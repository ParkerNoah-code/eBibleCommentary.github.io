    Ephesians 4:26, 27 "Be angry, and sin not; let not the sun go down upon your 
    anger; neither give place to the devil."</p>
<p align="justify">THE apostle is now on some particulars of the old man 
    that is to be put off, and of the new man which is to be put on. In the 
    former verse he dehorts them lying, and exhorts to the speaking of truth. In 
    the text, he lays before us our duty with respect to anger. We may take up 
    the words in three parts: 1. We have the passion kept within its due bounds. 
    Commended say some: allowed or permitted rather, say others. "Be angry." 2. 
    The inordinate passion simply condemned in its beginnings, as well as in its 
    progress, "sin not;" namely, in your passion. It is condemned particularly 
    in its progress and continuance. "Let not the sun go down upon your wrath." 
    3. The reason why the inordinate passion is condemned: it is a giving place 
    to the devil.</p>
<p align="justify">The first thing laid before us in the text is, anger kept 
    within its due bounds: "Be angry, and sin not." Some will have these words 
    token out of Psalm 4:4, which we render, "stand in awe." The Hebrew word, 
    some translate simply, be moved. It signifies to be moved, either with anger 
    or fear. The Septuagint reads it, be angry, etc. Thus our English rage, 
    answers it both in sound and sense; and accordingly our translators render 
    the same word rage, Proverbs 29:9; Daniel 3:13. Yet, on the other hand, it 
    cannot be denied, but it signifies also to be moved with fear, Isaiah 32:11, 
    "be troubled," etc; Deuteronomy 28:63, "a trembling heart." But if you 
    consider the scope of both places, they seem to be very different. The 
    Psalmist proposes that, "stand in awe," or "be moved," as a check to his 
    enemies sinning in persecuting the godly man, whom God has set apart for 
    himself. The apostle proposes his "sin not," as a check on the passion of 
    anger in ourselves, that it go not out of order. Therefore, I suppose, that 
    if the apostle has any eye in this, to that of the Psalmist, it is not by 
    way of citation, but at most an allusion.</p>
<p align="justify">I. see little reason why these words should be taken 
    rather as a concession or permission, than a command. It is nowise like 
    that, Genesis 2:16. It is not left to our option, whether to be angry or 
    not, when there is a just cause. Coldness in God's matters, is hateful 
    stupidity. The passions in the soul, are as winds in the air. If the winds 
    blow not at all, or too calmly, they leave the ship at a great disadvantage; 
    though it is sad when they blow so violent as to dash her upon the rocks. 
    And what though anger in itself is neither good nor evil? The same may be 
    said of love and other passions which are not in themselves evil, as envy 
    is; yet doubtless it is a command, "Love as brethren." The apostle here, is 
    directing us in practice, not what to think of anger in the abstract; which 
    is never found in a subject, but vested with its due circumstances, and then 
    it is either holy, good and just; or else it is irregular and impious. Thus 
    the meaning must be, be holily angry, but not sinfully.</p>
<p align="justify">As for what is merely natural in anger, depending upon 
    the body only, we leave it to philosophers to explain it. As for what 
    concerns the soul and conscience in it, I take anger to be a commotion of 
    the spirit, with hatred of, and grief for an injury, and desire of revenge; 
    or to express it more softly, a desire of the vindication of the injured 
    party. Every one may consult his own breast, and find it so. I shall 
    consider this as in holy anger. And there is in it,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A commotion of the spirit, which arises from the 
    apprehension of a real injury; for if it be only imaginary it is sinful. 
    This is necessary to stir up a man's desire to see the wrong rectified. All 
    commotion of a man's spirit is not sinful. Whoever feels this holy anger in 
    him, will find it answers the name, an anger, vexation, or trouble of 
    spirit. As Lot, whose soul in his anger against the sins of the Sodomites, 
    "was vexed with their filthy conversation." So did Paul encounter the stoics 
    at Athens, not with stupid apathy, but "a spirit stirred in him," Acts 
    17:16. Cast into a holy paroxysm, as the word signifies. Yes, our Lord 
    himself, vented this in his angry looks: "He looked round about him with 
    anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts," Mark 3:5. Nay, 
    behold the holy height of it in the Holy One, when he said to them that sold 
    doves in the temple, "Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an 
    house of merchandise." It was good Eli's want of this zeal, which was the 
    ruin, first of his sons, and then of himself, 1 Samuel 3:13. He restrained 
    them not, (Hebrew). Did not thraw his brows, or gloom upon them. Old age, it 
    is like, had wrinkled them; but he had not as much zeal as to wrinkle them 
    in holy anger against sin, and so he restrained them not.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is hatred in it, not at the persons but at their 
    sins, whether they be our own sins or others. In this respect it is called 
    indignation, 2 Corinthians 7:11. This is most desirable, when it is kept 
    purely on this object. That is not the part where we are in hazard of 
    excess, seeing we are commanded to abhor that which is evil, as we would do 
    Hell itself.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is grief in it, Mark 3:5. This naturally follows 
    on hatred of the thing, which likewise arises from a just apprehension of 
    the evil of it in a gracious soul. And from both arises,</p>
<p align="justify">4. A desire of the vindication of the right and honor of 
    the party injured. This is that which the word Ïñãéæåèå, used in the text, 
    most properly points at, being derived from ïñãç, which they say is from 
    ïñåãïìáé, to desire. The vindication of the right and honor of the party 
    injured, is that which naturally occurs as the object of this desire in 
    anger. Now where that cannot be done but by punishment or revenge, there is 
    a holy anger, an appetite after revenge, which in its due circumstances is a 
    good thing, being an execration of justice, Romans 12:19. But seeing God has 
    not appointed all to be ministers of justice, holy anger will not carry the 
    man without his sphere, and therefore it is still but an appetite of revenge 
    by the hand that has right, and power to inflict it, and not of that carnal 
    revenge which may satisfy an exorbitant passion, but that which is in a way 
    of justice necessary to vindicate the right and honor of the injured. But 
    where the party angry has power to revenge all disobedience, this holy anger 
    sets him on the work; as it was with Moses, Exodus 32:19–29, and Phinehas 
    slaying Zimri and Cosbi, and Jesus driving the buyers and sellers out of the 
    temple. But seeing there are not a few cases in which holy anger is very 
    necessary, and yet the humiliation of the party, or confession of the fault 
    may salve the honor of the injured, and a soft answer may turn away wrath; 
    in holy anger that desire will not proceed farther, and therefore I called 
    it, in the general, only a desire of the vindication of the right and honor 
    of the injured, and not simply a desire of revenge.</p>
<p align="justify">This we may discribe holy anger to be a commotion of the 
    spirit, arising from the apprehension of a real sinful evil, with hatred of 
    it, grief for it, and a regular desire of the vindication of the right and 
    honor of the injured, for the destruction of sin. Thus much for holy anger. 
    I proceed to the</p>
<p align="justify">Second thing, which is sinful anger condemned. And,</p>
<p align="justify">I. We are to consider it in its rise, and the passion 
    transgressing due bounds, which makes it sinful, however short, while it 
    lasts.</p>
<p align="justify">Sin not, says the apostle. There is no door opened for 
    sin in any case, but the particular here aimed at, is that we sin not in our 
    anger; that a fire from Hell rise not in our breasts, instead of a fire from 
    Heaven. We must not suppose that these words import a power in man, by any 
    grace given in this life, to order his anger in any case, so as to be 
    sinless in the eye of the law. The most pure fire that ever burnt in the 
    heart of any man but the man Christ, wanted not its smoke. But though the 
    law of God is not the measure of our strength, yet it is the rule of our 
    duty, and whatever in any case goes beyond the bounds of it is sin. It aims 
    not at the extirpation of the passion of anger out of our hearts, but says 
    unto it hitherto shall you come, but no farther, and here shall your proud 
    waves be stayed. But if the passion break over the bars, and be as the 
    letting out of waters, be in whom it will, the text shows them their 
    transgression that they have exceeded; even meek Moses in his holy anger, 
    breaks the tables. Though the defects in holy anger may be here condemned, 
    yet sinful anger seems to be that which the apostle calls ðáñïñãéóìïò, and 
    we render wrath, whereby he shows what he meant by his saying, sin not. He 
    says not, let not the sun go down åðé ôçïñãç, on your anger, but åðé ôç 
    ðáñïñãéóìù, upon your wrath; your unjust and sinful anger, which exceeds the 
    due bounds of anger, as the preposition in the word imports. Now for 
    clearing of what this sinful anger is, we must consider the due boundary of 
    holy and just anger, and what is beyond these is sinful.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The grounds of holy anger are just and weighty, such 
    as God's dishonor by our own sins, and the sins of others 2 Corinthians 
    7:11, Exodus 22:9. It must then be sinful anger, when it is without a just 
    ground. "Whoever," says our Lord, "is angry with his brother without a 
    cause, shall be in danger of the judgment." Without a cause, åéêç, that is 
    rashly, without any cause at all, or vainly, upon a light or trival cause, 
    which is indeed no just cause of anger. But the judgment is weak and 
    yielding, and gives way to the passions: in both senses we are said to take 
    God's name in vain.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The degree of holy anger is proportioned to the fault. 
    Thus God himself is angry at all sins, yet there are some sins to which he 
    reserves the fierceness of wrath. When the anger then in respect of degrees, 
    exceeds the measure of the offence, and men are carried so far beside 
    themselves, as to turn about the cart wheel on the cummin that might be beat 
    out with the rod, then it is sinful anger; and therefore good Jacob, when 
    a-dying, curses the wrath of the brethren of iniquity, against the 
    Shechemites because it was cruel, destroying a whole city for one's fault. 
    Such was David's anger against Nabal, 1 Samuel 25, to execute, which, though 
    he had vowed himself by vow, yet when he comes to himself he breaks, and 
    blesses God for preventing him.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The end of holy anger which it is directed, is the 
    glory of God and the good of our neighbor, Proverbs 13:24; John 2:16, 17. 
    Sinful then it must be, when it is a fire lighting on others, to make them 
    sacrifices to cursed self, to satisfy the desires of a proud (Hebrew, a wide 
    heart, Proverbs 27:25.) which will never think it gets enough from others. 
    "Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who deals in proud wrath."</p>
<p align="justify">4. The effects of holy anger directly and indirectly, are 
    just and good, for the man has rule over his own spirit, and no holy 
    affection is inconsistent with another. It fits him for his duty to God and 
    men, as may be seen in the case of Moses praying for the people, Exodus 32. 
    The anger then must be sinful when its effects are hellish, as when it 
    breaks out in clamor and evil speaking, Eph 4:31. Even meek Moses fell into 
    a fit of this sinful anger, "Because they provoked his spirit, so that he 
    spoke unadvisedly with his lips." The anger is sinful also, when it leaves a 
    man no more master of himself, and unfits him for duty, 1 Timothy 2:8.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence it appears there is a twofold sinful anger: 1. 
    There is an anger, which is originally, and in itself sinful; that, where 
    there is no just ground at all to be angry, to which men's weakness of 
    judgment and strength of passion often expose them. Such was Jonah's anger, 
    at the withering of the gourd. This anger is like a river which has quite 
    left its proper channel, and so cannot but be very pernicious. 2. There is 
    an anger accidentally sinful, where there is indeed just ground to be angry, 
    but by reason of the corruption of men, is carried beyond the proper bounds. 
    As a river which indeed still covers the ordinary channel, but so swells as 
    to overflow all its banks. Such was David's anger against Nabal, 1 Samuel 
    25:21, 22. Each of these is a ðñïïñãéóìïò, a sinful anger, of which we must 
    beware. But what if it arise in us, as it may in the best? Why then the 
    flame must be quickly quenched, which is the second thing to be considered 
    anent sinful anger. The progress and continuance of it is condemned. Let not 
    the sun go down upon your wrath. There seems to be some emphasis in that 
    your wrath; it points at the wrath of man, that works not the righteousness 
    of God. It is that wrath of which Satan is father, and our own corrupt heart 
    the mother. A hellish offspring that should be stifled in the birth, or be 
    taken as soon as possible and dashed against the stones, and not be allowed 
    to live until the sun go down. It is strange fire not brought from the 
    altar, but from the common hearth of a proud corrupt heart, and must be 
    quenched speedily. Let not the sun go down upon your wrath; which is not to 
    be understood as if it might lawfully be kept up until the sun go down for 
    what is sinful in its rise, must still be more so in its continuance. But it 
    is a proverbial speech, the import of which we may take up in these two 
    things: 1. As the sun with his scorching heat hastens to go down, so should 
    we, whose passion sooner by far comes to its height than the sun, make haste 
    to lay it aside. 2. As the sun going down brings on the night, which calls 
    men to set themselves to the putting off their clothes, and going to rest; 
    so should we set ourselves to put off the old man, and by all means to put 
    off anger with our clothes, that we take it not into the bed with us, where 
    it is most dangerous. For, whereas as the light affords variety of objects 
    to us, and so is a friend to the diverting of wrath, the darkness of the 
    night keeps these out of our sight, and so leaves the very spirit to feed on 
    that chiefly which first raised it, and so it gets leave to range through 
    the several methods of revenge; and so it is said of the wicked "that he 
    devises mischief upon his bed." This I take to be the main thing aimed at in 
    the expression.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, We shall consider the reason. "Neither give place 
    to the devil." That is, and give not place to the devil. It is a general 
    precept, but is here particularly aimed at, the matter of sinful anger. Some 
    read it, to the calumniator; thereby understanding the occasion given to the 
    wicked to reproach piety, because of the sinful passions of professors, and 
    the effects thereof. This is a sad truth indeed, but we take it rather as 
    our translation reads it, to the devil; who must needs have a particular 
    love to sinful anger: it is so like Hell, wherein men are on fire with a 
    scorching heat, but in gross darkness. It refers, 1. To the rise of sinful 
    anger. To give place to it, is to admit the devil. He will strive to have 
    place, and so tempt us to it; but our yielding to the temptation is to give 
    him place. 2. It refers to the progress and continuance of it. The more it 
    is harbored, the devil is the farther admitted. He loves to fish in muddy 
    water. When he has got the fire kindled, he employs his bellows to blow it 
    up, and always to make the flame greater and greater, to the destruction of 
    ourselves and others.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. Men not only may, but ought to be angry where 
    there is just ground for it. We know no just ground for anger, but the 
    things which are sinful. As for the injuries done to us, or our fellow 
    creatures, they are not real injuries, if they be not sins against the Lord; 
    for no man can break in upon the second table, but he must break through the 
    first.</p>
<p align="justify">REASONS. 1. Because in that case, the love and respect 
    which we owe to God, who is dishonored, require it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The love which we owe to ourselves or others who are 
    injured, requires it. For in that case, it is as it were said, who is on the 
    Lord's side, and on the side of souls that are in hazard.</p>
<p align="justify">Use I. Let us then be filled with holy indignation 
    against ourselves, because of the sins of our nature, hearts, lips, and 
    lives.</p>
<p align="justify">2. At the dishonor done to God by others. Alas! we are 
    very quickly set in a flame, if but a word seem to reflect on us; but how 
    cold are we in matters that dishonor God. O! that we could spend these 
    arrows, firebrands, and darts, of which we are otherwise liberal enough on 
    our own and others sins.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. Men should beware that the fire of sinful 
    anger kindle not in their breasts.</p>
<p align="justify">REASONS. 1. Because it is evil in itself, and 
    dishonorable to God; being the vomit of a proud heart and an unmeekened 
    spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because it is not only evil, but a mother of evil; and 
    is not only an inlet to many mischiefs to ourselves and others, but drives 
    men to them to act with vigor. An angry man stirs up strife, and a furious 
    man abounds in transgression.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. Guard against sinful anger; against being angry 
    without just cause. Let judgment always lead the way to your passion. He who 
    is slow to wrath is of great understanding; but he who is hasty of spirit, 
    exalts folly. Exalts, hangs up a sign of folly at his own door, that every 
    one may know that a fool dwells within. Again, when you are angry on good 
    grounds, be on your guard lest your anger degenerate into a sinful passion. 
    We may be easily carried too far, and when the furnace of the heart is hot, 
    if we take not heed, it may soon come to that to scorch and burn up 
    ourselves and others too, instead of consuming their, or our own evils. Self 
    is most ready to creep in, and jostle out all respect to the honor of God, 
    and have sad effects. Even in anger upon a just cause, we are like man 
    standing on the edge of a steep rock, the ground is firm, but the head is 
    ready to grow giddy, and he to fall headlong.</p>
<p align="justify">Consider the evil of sinful anger. 1. It is a degree of 
    murder. "Whoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in 
    danger of the judgment." It is a sword that stabs two at once, the angry man 
    and the party against whom he is angry. 2. It is a fit of madness, in which 
    a man has no rule over his own spirit, until he come to himself, for he goes 
    out of himself in anger. 3. It makes a man most unlike Christ, who was meek 
    and lowly. 4. It has most bitter effects. It mars our access to God in 
    prayer; makes us most unfit for divine communications, as the troubled water 
    cannot receive the image of the sun. It exposes us to Satan, as a city that 
    is broken down and without walls, to the enemy; and makes men intolerable to 
    others, if they be not all the more masters of patience.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE III. If sinful anger do enter our breasts, we 
    must endeavor to extinguish it quickly, and beware of nourishing it.</p>
<p align="justify">It reproves those, who when once that devil is raised in 
    them, can hardly be got laid again; men of an implacable temper, whose anger 
    is like fire in iron or other solid matter, long before it be laid aside. If 
    once it get unto them, it must go to bed and rise with them too. Yes, many 
    who will not only let the sun go down on their wrath, but keep it up weeks, 
    months, and years. Once do them an injury, they will never forget nor 
    forgive. Be not then hasty in your spirit to be angry, for anger rests in 
    the bosom of fools.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us learn then, to quench this spark quickly, when it 
    falls on us. This may be enforced from</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE IV. That the admitting and lodging of sinful 
    anger in our hearts, is a giving place to the devil. For remedies,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Let us consider our own vileness and unworthiness, and 
    how often we are provoking the Lord, and so turn our anger against 
    ourselves. "For we ourselves also, were sometimes foolish, disobedient, 
    deceived; serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy; 
    hateful, and hating one another.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Let us consider these things with which we are so 
    ready to be hurried away, are the trials of our patience, and we are on our 
    trial for Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Let us propose to ourselves the example of the meek 
    and lowly Jesus. "He suffered, leaving us an example that we should follow 
    his steps."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Out of a sense of our utter inability to resist 
    the least temptation, look to Jesus for strength, and by faith draw strength 
    from him. When the temptation is like to catch us, let us lay hold of the 
    promise, and of Christ in the promise. Without this, nothing will avail, 
    acceptably to prevent or suppress it; and this is the reason, why sometimes 
    Christians bear great affronts and injuries better than small ones. For in 
    the latter, they trust to themselves; in the former to Christ. No wonder all 
    goes to wreck, when men instead of the golden shield of faith made by the 
    true Solomon, they like fools think to do with the brazen ones of their own 
    stock. Amen.</p>
