    Heaven</b></font><br/>

<p align="justify">Ettrick, Feb. 13, 1715<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">2 Corinthians 5:1 "For we know, that, if our earthly 
    house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house 
    not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."</p>
<p align="justify">THE breach which the Lord made among us so suddenly last 
    Sabbath, is a loud call to us all to be making ready, and to be always ready 
    for another world. We all know that we must die: none of us know how, or 
    when. Let us then be sparing of our judgment, and take the lesson to 
    ourselves. Luke 13:1–5.</p>
<p align="justify">To pursue this providential call, with the call of the 
    word, I have chosen this text. That persons may go to Heaven without clear 
    evidence for Heaven, I doubt not. But it has often been a very serious 
    consideration to me, to think, that although there are very few people with 
    whom we can meet on a death bed but have hopes of Heaven; yet there are so 
    very few that can give any rational scriptural grounds and evidences of 
    their hope. This determined me some time ago, to urge the seeking of 
    evidences, that whatever God in holy sovereignty may do, yet people may not 
    through mere sloth and laziness, make but a leap in the dark into eternity, 
    if they will be warned.</p>
<p align="justify">In the words of the text there are three things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Something supposed. Two things are here supposed.</p>
<p align="justify">1. That the body will die and return to the dust. If our 
    earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved. This, if, is not for 
    doubting, but supposes it beyond all doubt. Consider what the body is. It is 
    but a house. And observe who is the inhabitant of this house. It is the 
    soul. The body is our house. The soul is the man, and is as much preferable 
    to the body, as the inhabitant is to the cottage in which he dwells. Observe 
    also what kind of a house it is. It is an earthly house. A mud wall house 
    patched up of earth. A house merely for the short time we are to be on 
    earth. Nay, it is rather a tabernacle or a tent. It is the tent in which the 
    soul dwells or sojourns, as persons do in a tent. Paul was a tent maker, and 
    he takes a lesson of his frailty from what used to be among his hands. A 
    house may be weak, but a tent is still weaker.</p>
<p align="justify">Consider also what death is. It is a dissolving of the 
    tent, a loosing of the frame of it, and then it falls down. Our bodies are 
    not castles and towers that must be blown up, or battered down by main 
    force: not even ordinary houses that must be pulled down with strength of 
    hand. But tents, where there is nothing more to do but to loose the cords, 
    and pull up the pins, and immediately it lies along.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is supposed that the saints when they die, make an 
    exchange much for the better. When they are turned out of this earthly house 
    they are received into a "building of God, an house not made with hands, 
    eternal in the heavens." Some by this understand the glorified condition of 
    the body, when it shall be spiritual, immortal, and incorruptible. But that 
    cannot be, for that does not take place until the resurrection. This 
    immediately after death, Verse 8, "We are confident, says the apostle, and 
    willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord." 
    It is meant of the glorious state of the saints in another life, even of 
    that glory in which the souls of believers shall dwell, when they depart out 
    of this tabernacle.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We have in the text a confident application of this 
    blessed privilege of having a building of God. It is applied with the 
    greatest assurance by the apostle in his own name, and in the name of other 
    saints that walked in the view of Heaven. We know that we have. Not so much 
    by extraordinary revelation, as by certain signs, and evidences grounded 
    upon the testimony of the word without us, and of our own spirits and God's 
    Spirit within us. For whatever the apostle himself enjoyed of revelation was 
    not common to the saints as this is.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is the blessed influence this had on their 
    suffering patiently intimated in the particle. For we know. They bore 
    sufferings without fainting, chapter 4:16. Because they had the glory of 
    Heaven in their view. And they knew assuredly, that they would attain it 
    after death. Therefore they were not afraid of suffering.</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine I.—The body is only the house of the soul, and 
    but an earthly house too. As a man lodges in his house, so does the soul in 
    the body until death come, and it departs from it. I shall here show,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What kind of a house the body is to the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I shall take notice of some of the peculiarities of 
    this house.</p>
<p align="justify">I. We are to show what kind of a house the body is to the 
    soul.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is only a lodging house. The soul is not sent to 
    dwell in it, but to sojourn and lodge in it, while on the way to another 
    world. "We are strangers and sojourners, as all our fathers were." The body 
    is our lodging house. Heaven or Hell is our dwelling house, where we will 
    abide forever.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a weak house. The soul in the body is not lodged 
    as in a tower or castle. It is not a fort, but a weak house that is broken 
    soon up by disease and soon broken down by death. The strongest body is 
    such. For the walls are but of mud, a house of clay, Job 4:19. and cannot 
    stand long nor abide a severe shock.</p>
<p align="justify">Let none deceive themselves with respect to their 
    strength. There are no stones in the walls of this house; no brass nor iron 
    in it. It must needs then be a weak house. "Is my strength the strength of 
    stones? or is my flesh brass?" No, only mud refined and tempered by the 
    Creator's hand, but now disordered by sin. We may indeed be fine, but must 
    be weak.</p>
<p align="justify">The foundation of it is in the dust. Job 4:19. Were a 
    house of clay built upon a rock it might stand long. But founded on dust, it 
    must quickly sink with its weight. Man is maintained out of the earth. Some 
    have a greater heap of dust to stand upon than others, but still the earth 
    supports us, and will swallow us up.</p>
<p align="justify">The pillars of the house are ready to give way very 
    quickly. The strong men, the legs, bow themselves. Ecclesiastes 12:3. A 
    day's sickness or two will make them not able to bear up the weight of the 
    house. So the man must lie because he cannot stand. The keepers of the house 
    are but weak. A little thing will set them a trembling.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is a house that is daily in danger. Though a house 
    were very weak, yet if nothing were to touch it, it might stand a long time. 
    But our house is in danger daily and hourly. It is in danger from without. 
    There are storms to blow it down, and a very small blast will sometimes do 
    it. Though we walk not among swords, daggers, and bullets, yet a stumble in 
    the highway may do it; as small a thing as a pear, yes a stone in fruit, has 
    laid the house on the ground. It is in danger also from within. There are 
    disorders to undermine the house. There are the seeds of a thousand deaths 
    in our mortal bodies; which sometimes quickly, sometimes leisurely undermine 
    the house, and make it fall down about our ears before ever we are aware. 
    The seeds of diseases, when we know not, are digging like moles under the 
    mud walls, and soon destroy the house.</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover it is a dark house in which often the danger is 
    never seen until it be past remedy. How many dangers come to the house from 
    without which are never seen from the windows, nor perceived by the eyes 
    until they arrive. But we cannot see what is doing within the house, the 
    dissolution thereof may be going on apace.</p>
<p align="justify">II. But it may not be improper to take notice of some of 
    the peculiarities of this house.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a curious house of brittle materials. "My 
    substance was not hidden from you when I was made in secret, and curiously 
    wrought in the lowest parts of the earth." The body of man is a stupendous 
    piece of workmanship, of admirable curiosity. "I will praise you; for I am 
    fearfully and wonderfully made." The very outworks of the house are 
    admirable. Are there any so dull as not to observe the wisdom of God in that 
    beauty and majesty that are in the face of man, beyond that of other 
    creatures, in the faculty of speech, and in the admirable diversity of 
    features and voices. How God has put the eyes and the ears in the head as in 
    their watch tower; that they may the better serve for seeing and hearing. 
    How the eyes are made rolling, that in a moment they can turn up or down, to 
    one side or to another; covered with lids that we can shut or open as need 
    requires. The ears always open, the tongue shut in with double leaved gates. 
    Two arms to defend ourselves. These are the guardians of the house. Hands 
    distinguished into so many fingers, for the more exquisite kinds of work. 
    Nay, there is not a hair, nor nail in the body, but has its use. The hair on 
    the eye lids to defend the eyes; the nails on our fingers are necessary for 
    the more dexterous handling of anything. What then must be the curiosity 
    within. Galen admired the wisdom of the Creator in the thigh of a gnat. How 
    much more is this wisdom, to be admired in the structure of the human body, 
    in which there is nothing lacking, nothing superfluous.</p>
<p align="justify">But now the more curious, the more easily marred. The 
    greatest beauty is soonest tarnished. The finer the earthen vessel is, it is 
    the more easily broken. So we are exposed to the greatest danger by a small 
    touch.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a house that needs reparation daily. A good, 
    well built house will need nothing for many years. Your meanest houses once 
    right, need nothing for a year. But this earthly house needs reparation 
    daily. It is reckoned by some that as much matter goes out of our bodies by 
    insensible perspiration, as by the other natural evacuations. Thus a large 
    proportion of our nourishment, perhaps five eights, goes out by the pores. 
    Thus our bodies are in a continual flux, wasting like the oil of a lamp; so 
    that in this sense we are dying daily. Hence eating and drinking are 
    necessary, the house must be patched up with more mud daily. And some are so 
    taken up with repairing the body, that all the day they do nothing else.</p>
<p align="justify"><u>Uses from this Doctrine</u></p>
<p align="justify">1. Prize your souls above your bodies, as you do the 
    inhabitant above the house. O what madness is it in the hearts of men, who 
    care for the body neglecting the soul. Will you be still looking after the 
    house, and never minding the never dying inhabitant the soul? shall the soul 
    be ruined, starved, and perish, while all the care is about the body.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Make not your body a war house against Heaven. It is 
    far too weak for that purpose. True, but many do it. While health and 
    strength last, they securely fight against God, trample on his law, despise 
    his Son, little minding how God may block them up in their house by disease, 
    or pull down their house by death.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Be tender in the house. Though it is an earthly house 
    it has a heavenly inhabitant. Take care of the house for the sake of the 
    soul. Such is the perverseness of man's nature, that many use their bodies 
    worse than they do their beasts. Some will see well to their beasts that 
    cannot bestow meat convenient on their own bodies; and work their bodies at 
    a rate at which they would be sorry to work their beasts. The drunkard and 
    the glutton treat their horses better than they treat their own bodies. They 
    take care of their horses, but ruin their own bodies.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Never ruin the inhabitant for the house. Would you not 
    think him mad that would strip himself naked to cover his house. Better 
    surely that the house be uncovered than that the inhabitant be left naked. 
    Yes, but this madness has seized the generality of the world. They will 
    pamper their bodies while they will be cruel as the Ostrich to their souls. 
    They will be all anxiety about food and clothing, who will take no more care 
    about their souls than if they were but salt to keep their bodies from 
    putrefaction. They will load their consciences with mountains of guilt, if 
    by that means they can get a little more thick clay to the earthly house.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Beware of defiling the house, seeing it has such a 
    noble lodger. "If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy: 
    for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are." Sin defiles the body. 
    When the members of the body, which should be instruments of righteousness, 
    are made instruments of sin; a covetous or wanton eye, a disorderly tongue, 
    given to lying or swearing: hands and feet employed in mischief, make the 
    body a foul lodging for the soul. And these will be stains, which, without 
    repentance, will cleave to the body in the grave and at the resurrection.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Take heed to the door of the house. Set a watch, O 
    Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. Let the door be duly shut 
    and discreetly opened. Open your mouth with wisdom. When the door stands 
    always open the dweller is in danger; and in the multitude of words there 
    lacks not folly. They can hardly speak well that speak much. Words, few, 
    select, and seasoned with grace and sobriety are best both for soul and 
    body. But the mouths of many are the dung-gate standing always open, that 
    the devil may drive out at it the filth of the heart in lies, slanders, 
    oaths, and impure language. But surely they will be silent in the grave.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Take heed to the windows of the house. The soul got 
    its death wound at first by the window. "When the woman saw that the tree 
    was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be 
    desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat." And 
    Satan will still attack where he made the first breach. Therefore Job put 
    the guard of a covenant upon them. I made, says he, a covenant with mine 
    eyes. They are two little rolling members which a splinter of wood may close 
    up altogether; but they are gates of destruction broad enough.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Dispatch your business with the stranger that is in 
    the house, always going out and in, that you be not surprised with his 
    departure, before you have done your business with him. I mean your breath. 
    It is going continually out and in, to and from the door of your lips, and 
    you know not what will be the last breath. But when once gone, no more 
    business can be done for time or eternity. His breath goes forth, he returns 
    to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Provide in time for a better house. You must 
    depart from this. Inquire, then, to what place you are going, for here you 
    cannot stay long. And if you have not your lodging taken up in Heaven, you 
    will get a dungeon house for eternity, where the light is as darkness. Awake 
    then, O sluggard, up and be doing. Mind the days of eternity for they shall 
    be many.</p>
<p align="justify"><u>Motives</u>.</p>
<p align="justify">1. This house will tumble down about your ears, whatever 
    you do to hold it up. Fix one foot then, before the other be loosed, lest 
    you get such a fall as you will never rise again. This body is but a lodging 
    house, it cannot stand very long. Look for another.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There are but two places, Heaven and Hell, in one of 
    which you must dwell forever. In Heaven there are many mansions of glory, 
    and yet there is room for you. In Hell every person will get their own place 
    of torment and misery unspeakable. The saints departed, are gone home to 
    their mansions; the wicked departed, are gone to their place. We are upon 
    the road. What way will you turn your face? Take what way you please, you 
    will soon be at the end of it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. You have no security of your house, you know not how 
    soon you may be turned out of doors. Now for a house to the body, you will 
    not readily want it; as much room as will serve you, you will certainly get 
    in the grave, the house appointed for all living. That will be the body's 
    long home. But where think you will be your eternal home? When the soul is 
    turned out at death, to what place will it next go? I hope to Heaven. Then 
    what evidence have you from this Bible for that hope? I do not know. How 
    comes that? Are you busy seeking evidences, but cannot come to light? May 
    the Lord clear up your darkness! But I fear many know nothing about this 
    work. You are careless whether you land in Heaven or Hell. You know not but 
    you may be in Hell the next moment. The brittle thread of life is not to be 
    depended upon; therefore "whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all 
    your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in 
    the grave, where you go."</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine II. Man's body is a Tabernacle, or Tent for his 
    soul. Paul was a tent-maker, and he takes a lesson of his frailty from what 
    was among his hands, teaching us to do the same. It is so called,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because it is easily taken down. Whatever force may be 
    necessary to pull down a house, it is easy to pull down a tent. There needs 
    no more but to loose the cords, and pull out the pins, and the tent lies 
    along. So easily is man's body taken down by death. Having its foundation in 
    the dust, it is crushed before the moth. A very little thing indeed may rob 
    man of his mortal life.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A Tent is a moveable house that stands not always in 
    one place, but is carried from place to place. So while we are in the body, 
    we are not come to the place of our rest, or settled habitation. Heaven ever 
    moves, yet is it the place of our rest, earth ever stands still, yet it is 
    not a place of rest. While we are in the body, our case is changeable, but 
    when once out of it, is unalterable forever, whether in happiness or misery.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Tents, though mean without, may be precious within. 
    However mean outwardly the tabernacle of the body be, it has a precious soul 
    within, of more worth than ten thousand worlds. It is a rich tent in that 
    respect, because of the precious soul, redeemed by the precious blood of 
    Christ, capable of enjoying God forever.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Our state in the world in this body is like that of 
    those who dwell in tents. Our body is as the shepherd's tent. Our souls are 
    those we have to feed while we are in the body. And the shepherd's tent must 
    not stand long in one place, but must soon be removed. So must our bodies 
    into the grave. The body is a soldier's tent. We are set down in the world, 
    to fight the good fight of faith, and we must lay our account with hardships 
    and of being conquerors, otherwise we will be surprised in our tents, and 
    ruined. It is a pilgrim's tent. We are in our way to another world; and the 
    lodging the soul has in the body, is but a lodging as in a tent by the way.</p>
<p align="justify"><u>Uses of this Doctrine</u></p>
<p align="justify">1. We need not wonder then at sudden death. It has often 
    been seen that a tent has fallen down when not a hand touched it. It is a 
    weak thing, but man's body is as weak before the king of terrors, that can 
    dispatch it in a moment.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Let us lay our accounts with hardships while we are in 
    the body. They that dwell in tents do not expect the ease and conveniences 
    which a house affords. And why should we wonder at the troubles with which 
    we meet while in the body. The ease is coming, if we come to the building of 
    God. But for a tent to be beaten black with wind and weather, nothing more 
    common.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Let us confess we are pilgrims and strangers on earth, 
    and live like those who are quickly to remove. Let us not expect to fix our 
    dwelling here but prepare for our removal. We come into the world to go out 
    again; and within a little our tent shall be removed and our place know us 
    no more.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Let us be preparing for a more excellent and 
    abiding mansion. There is a city that is continuing, let us seek after it. A 
    house of God's building, in which there are many mansions, let us be careful 
    to secure our title to it. There is a kingdom that cannot be moved, let us 
    run, as we may obtain that noble prize.</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine III. The earthly house of the tabernacle of our 
    body will be dissolved by death. That is what we look for, and we are 
    provided for it if we have a building with God.</p>
<p align="justify">I. Here I shall show in what respects death is a 
    dissolution.</p>
<p align="justify">II. That this body shall be dissolved. I am then</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show in what respects death is a dissolution.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Death dissolves the union between soul and body. When 
    it comes, the silver cord that unites the soul and body together is loosed. 
    Ecclesiastes 12:6. No wonder it dissolve relations between persons, when it 
    dissolves that union. The man is made up of two parts, a soul and a body, 
    united by an invisible bond; death looses the knot, and then the parts fall 
    asunder. The earthly part goes to the earth, and the spiritual part to God 
    that gave it, to be sent to its eternal home.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Death dissolves the body itself. It consists of many 
    parts curiously set together by the Creator, but then the beautiful frame is 
    dashed in pieces and is resolved into its primitive dust. The tabernacle 
    then is taken down, the earthly house is demolished, and lies in rubbish 
    until the resurrection.</p>
<p align="justify">Death dissolves the vital flame that kept the body in 
    life. It quenches that flame and puts out that candle. Sometimes it 
    dissolves it suddenly as a burning candle when it is blown out, sometimes it 
    works it out by degrees, like a candle burnt to the socket, which is 
    dissolved at length and vanishes away.</p>
<p align="justify">Death dissolves the communion between the parts of the 
    body. The flame being extinguished, the communication between the parts 
    which ceased not for many years, is then broken up. No more blood flows from 
    the heart, no more flows to it from the other parts, so the last pulse 
    beats. No more spirits from the brain. Then all falls down together. Then 
    the body grows cold, and stiff, and pale. The eyes see no more, and the ears 
    hear no more.</p>
<p align="justify">Death dissolves the joints and bands with which the body 
    was united. While it feeds, on the carcass in the grave, it looses the head 
    from the body and the skull lies by itself. Then the strongest arms fall 
    from the shoulder blade; and then the joints of the thighs are loosed, and 
    every bone lies by itself. Finally, the most minute particles of the body 
    are separated. How soon are the flashes of flesh so dissolved and separated, 
    that they are no more visible to the eye of him that looks into the grave, 
    they cannot be discerned from common dust. And though the bones last longer, 
    yet their solidity is not proof against the power of death, but they also 
    moulder into dust at length. Let us now,</p>
<p align="justify">II. Show that this body shall be dissolved.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is an unalterable statute of death under which 
    men are concluded. "It is appointed unto men once to die." There is no 
    perhaps in it but we must needs die. Though some will not fear death, every 
    man must see it. "What man is he who lives and shall not see death? Shall he 
    deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?" Death is a champion, with whom 
    all must grapple. An inexorable messenger, who cannot be diverted from 
    executing his orders, by the power of the mighty.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Daily observation tells us we must die. "For he sees 
    that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and 
    leave their wealth to others." There is room enough for us, notwithstanding 
    all the multitudes that were on earth before us. It is long since death 
    began to transport men into another world. It is daily carrying away vast 
    numbers, and none hear the grave say it is enough. The world is like a great 
    fair, some entering, others going away. Men, like travelers, enter at one 
    port and go out by another.</p>
<p align="justify">3. All men consist of perishing materials. "Dust you are, 
    and unto dust you shall return." The strongest are but brittle earthen 
    vessels. The soul is but meanly housed while in this body. A small spark 
    falling on the train of these perishing principles will blow up the house. 
    There is something more astonishing in our life than in our death. Diseases 
    are death's harbingers.</p>
<p align="justify">4. We have sinful souls, therefore dying bodies. The 
    wicked must die by virtue of the threatening. "For in the day that you eat 
    thereof you shall surely die." The godly also must die, that as death 
    entered by sin, so sin may go out by death. The leprosy is in the wall of 
    the house, therefore it must be pulled down.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, we are hastening to a dissolution. "Man comes 
    forth like a flower, and is cut down: he flees also as a shadow and 
    continues not. Our days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle. They are passed 
    as the swift ships, as the eagle that hastens to the prey."</p>
<p align="justify">All the improvement I shall make of this, is to exhort 
    you to prepare for your dissolution.</p>
<p align="justify">Motives—1. Your eternal state will be according to the 
    state in which you die. Heaven and Hell depend upon it. As to you, death 
    will open the door of the one or the other. As the tree falls so it must 
    lie.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Consider what it will be to go into another world, a 
    world of spirits, with which we have very little acquaintance. How terrible 
    is fellowship with spirits now to poor mortals. Acquaint yourself then, with 
    the Lord of that other world.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is but a short time which we have to prepare for 
    death. Now or never. The work is great—and the time allowed for it is short.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Much of our short time is already past. None can say 
    they have as much to come. Our life here is but a short preface to a long 
    eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The time we have is flying away. Time past has taken 
    an eternal farewell. There is no rekindling of the candle that is burnt to 
    ashes. The stream of time is the most rapid current.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, If once death carry us away there is no coming 
    back to mend matters. "If a man die, shall he live again?" If death were a 
    thing upon which we could be allowed to try our hand, it would not be so 
    dangerous. But it is only once to die, right or wrong. "We have a building 
    of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."</p>
<p align="justify">By this building and house, we are to understand the 
    glorified state of the saints after this life, that is, their heavenly house 
    of God's own making not by the hands of men, but by the fingers of God.</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine. When the tabernacle of the saint's body is 
    dissolved by death, they have a house of glory in Heaven ready for them. Man 
    when he is dead, is not done; though the body dies, the soul does not. Death 
    is but a departure or change, to some it is a miserable, to others a happy 
    change. So it is to the saints. Their souls depart from the earthly house, 
    to a house of glory. I design not to handle at large this great subject, but 
    only to glean a few things to show what sort of a house the glory of Heaven 
    is.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a dwelling house, not an house in which to 
    lodge, but to dwell and abide. "Lord, who shall abide in your tabernacle? 
    who shall dwell in your holy hill?" The body is but a tabernacle, in which 
    the believing soul lodges for a little time, like a shepherd, a soldier, or 
    a pilgrim in his tent. But at death the soul comes home to the house in 
    which it shall abide forever, and go no more out. The believer's dwelling 
    house is in Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a royal house, a palace. "They shall enter into 
    the king's palace." Christ calls his saints to a kingdom, and their house is 
    suitable to their dignity. It is the house of the kingdom, in which the 
    great King keeps his court, in which he has placed his throne, and displays 
    his glory in a peculiar manner, beyond what mortals can conceive. No 
    beggar's cottage is so far inferior to the best palace, as it is to the 
    house to which the gracious soul goes at death, though it departs from the 
    poorest cottage.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is a holy house, a temple. "He who overcomes, will 
    I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out." The 
    Jews reckon four or five things that were wanting in the second temple. In 
    this nothing shall be wanting. In it they shall have the cloud of glory in 
    the divine presence—Christ, the ark in which the flery law is forever 
    hid—the mercy seat, from which nothing breathes but eternal peace—the 
    Cherubim in the society of angels!—the golden candlestick with its seven 
    lamps; "for the glory of God does lighten it, and the Lamb is the light 
    thereof." The altar of incense, in the everlasting intercession of 
    Christ,—and the table of show bread, in the perpetual feast of the enjoyment 
    of God.</p>
<p align="justify">If you ask where this house stands? I answer for the 
    country, it is in a better country, even a heavenly one. Their house is in a 
    better country than the best of this world. It is in the heavenly Canaan, 
    Immanuel's land, in which nothing is wanting to complete the happiness of 
    the inhabitants. This is the happy country, blessed with a perpetual spring, 
    which yields all things for necessity, convenience, and delight. There men 
    eat angel's food, "even the hidden manna." They are fed to the full with the 
    product of the land falling into their mouths. That land enjoys an 
    everlasting day, "for there shall be no night there." An eternal sunshine 
    beautifies it. No cold, no scorching heat.—No clouds, yet no land of 
    drought. It is the country from which Christ came, to which he has returned, 
    and in which he will forever dwell.—As for the city, this house stands "in 
    that great city, the holy Jerusalem." In that city the inhabitants tread on 
    gold, the very thing on which the men of this world set their hearts; "for 
    the street of the city is of pure gold as it were transparent glass." A city 
    this, which shall stand and flourish when all the cities below are in ashes. 
    A city that never changes its inhabitants. Life and immortality reign in it. 
    Blessed with perfect peace, nothing from any quarter can ever annoy it. In 
    it there can be no want of provision, no discord.</p>
<p align="justify">If you ask concerning the pleasantness of the situation 
    of this house? I answer it is a palace, and paradise is the palace garden. 
    "Today shall you be with me in paradise," said our Lord to the dying thief. 
    Heaven is a paradise for pleasure and delight. Eden was the most pleasant 
    spot of the uncorrupted earth, and paradise was the most pleasant spot of 
    Eden. But what is earth in comparison of Heaven. The glorified saints are 
    advanced to the heavenly paradise where they will be satisfied with those 
    purest and sweetest pleasures which Immanuel's land affords, and swim in an 
    ocean of delights forever. There they shall enjoy everything in abundance, 
    "On either side of the river stands the tree of life, which bears twelve 
    manner of fruits, and yields her fruit every month." No flaming sword there 
    to keep them from it.</p>
<p align="justify">If you ask concerning the inhabitants of this house? I 
    answer, there dwell "the general assembly of the church of the first born." 
    The whole congregation of spotless saints, there dwell also the holy angels. 
    There is Christ the Lamb. There shall they be ever with the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is a Father's house. What a kindly word! It is 
    Christ's Father's house, and therefore no strange house to the gracious 
    soul. "In my Father's house," says he, "are many mansions, I go to prepare a 
    place for you." The Father loves the Son, and the Son has loved the gracious 
    soul to die for it. Why should the saints then be afraid of their welcome at 
    that house which is their Father's. It is our Father's house. For his Father 
    is our Father. "I ascend, said he, unto my Father, and your Father, and to 
    my God, and your God." Is not the believing soul espoused to the Son of God? 
    Is not the gracious person begotten of God and adopted of God. So he is 
    their Father and that makes Heaven home to them.</p>
<p align="justify">5. It is a spacious house. This clay body is a narrow 
    house, where the soul is caged up for a time. But in that house there will 
    be room enough for the soul to expatiate, for it has many mansions. For as 
    broad as the earth is, many a saint has not a foot of ground in it which he 
    can call his own; yes often there is not room for them at all to remain upon 
    it; but they will all have the most ample accommodation in Immanuel's land.</p>
<p align="justify">6. It is a most convenient house. In it no convenience 
    will be wanting. There are many mansions in it, and every saint shall find 
    his own mansion prepared and furnished with every convenience for him. They 
    will find everything that can be desired.</p>
<p align="justify">O believer, are you in poverty and straits? There is an 
    incorruptible treasure in that house. Is your honor in the dust? A crown for 
    your head and a scepter for your hand await you there. Are you shut up in 
    solitude? There you shall enjoy eternal converse with God, the angels, and 
    the saints. Is your life full of bitterness? You will find rivers of 
    pleasures there. Are you weak and sickly? There grows the tree of life, 
    whose leaves are for the healing of the nations. Are you groaning under the 
    tyranny of sin? There you shall walk in the glorious liberty of the sons of 
    God. Are defiled garments making you hang down your heads? You shall there 
    shine in spotless robes of holiness. Is fighting hard work? In that house 
    you shall forever triumph. Are you weary and almost fainting under the 
    labors of the Christian life? There you shall have perpetual rest. Is your 
    communion with God here frequently interrupted? There will be no 
    interruptions there. Are you in darkness? There is no night there. Are you 
    in fear of death? There you shall enjoy eternal life.</p>
<p align="justify">7. It is a safe house. The gates "are not shut at all by 
    day," for there is no danger there. Adam in the earthly paradise was not out 
    of danger. The serpent got accession to it. But no unclean thing can enter 
    there. None in the house are placed on the watch. The sentinels are all 
    recalled from their ports, and walk at large without fear of being annoyed, 
    or of falling upon any forbidden fruit.</p>
<p align="justify">8. It is a glorious house. The visible heavens, in which 
    the sun, that globe of light, is placed, and that are bespangled with stars, 
    are but the porch of the seat of the blessed. How glorious then must that 
    house be, whose avenues and entries are so splendid and rich. We know very 
    little of this house. But it must needs be a very glorious house. For it is 
    the house in which the king's son is to dwell with the bride, the Lamb's 
    wife, forever. Solomon built a glorious house for Pharaoh's daughter. This 
    is of the true Solomon's building for his elect, whom he loved before the 
    world was.</p>
<p align="justify">Besides it must be a glorious house, for it was purchased 
    at a vast expense, even the blood of the Son of God, an expense which 
    eternity will be too short to reckon. He was wise who paid the price, just 
    who received it, and also a Father who would not put his Son to needless 
    cost. What an unspeakably glorious purchase must the house then be?</p>
<p align="justify">The indispensable necessity for washing and purifying, to 
    fit persons for dwelling in the house, shows it to be glorious. There will 
    be spots and impurity in the fairest palace on earth; but "there shall in no 
    wise enter into it anything that defiles, neither whatever works abomination 
    or makes a lie." Those who are to be inhabitants, must first be washed in 
    the laver of regeneration; every day they must wash their feet from their 
    daily infirmities; and at death they must be washed every whit clean; and 
    all in the clean water of Christ's blood and Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is an everlasting house. It is eternal in the 
    heavens. This lodging house of the body goes quickly to the dust; the lower 
    house of this earth will go up in purple flames; but that house in the 
    heavens will endure forever.</p>
<p align="justify"><u><br/>
    For Improvement</u></p>
<p align="justify">1. Behold and admire the happiness of the saints. Though 
    they knew not where to lay their heads on earth, yet if this tabernacle were 
    dissolved they have a glorious house ready for them. Others may know of a 
    house under ground, a grave, a vault for the body. But the saints have a 
    house above the earth, yes above the clouds, a happy and glorious receptacle 
    for the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Is it not surprising that the saints should be alarmed 
    at death, the way to their own house? What the worse was Mordecai that it 
    was Haman that brought him the king's horse, and led his bridle through the 
    street of the city. A child of God is not ill situated in the very valley of 
    the shadow of death, for his Lord is with him. When persons are near their 
    own house, though they have a few rugged steps and the night be dark and 
    stormy, yet they are not easily discouraged, because they know they will 
    soon be home. Alas for our carnality and want of faith.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Seek a house now, into which you may be received 
    when your earthly house is dissolved. There is such a house, and you may 
    have it. O set to work now for this house. It is a house of which you may 
    obtain a lease, not for the term of life, for there is no dying there, but 
    an everlasting lease, for this house changes no tenants. It is a house which 
    you will get rent free, except the singing of glory, glory and praise to God 
    the builder and owner, and to the Lamb, the purchaser of the house.</p>
