    the Excellency of Christ!</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">
<a href="https://gracegems.org/28/thomas_boston_sermons.htm">Thomas Boston</a>, 1676–1732<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">Philippians 3:7-9 "But whatever was to my profit I now 
    consider loss for the sake of Christ.  What is more, I consider everything a 
    loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, 
    for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may 
    gain Christ  and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that 
    comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ--the 
    righteousness that comes from God and is by faith."</p>
<p align="justify">I COME now particularly to the words. Here is the 
    excellency of the knowledge of Christ, held forth as before all things. What 
    is meant by the knowledge of Christ? By the knowledge of Christ here, I 
    understand a saving interest in, and enjoyment of Christ. So it is taken, 
    "This is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus 
    Christ whom you have sent." So our Lord tells the foolish virgins, "I say 
    unto you I know you not." They plead an interest in him, hereby he disowns 
    them as none of his. And so "seeing of God," Matthew 5:8, and "seeing of the 
    kingdom of God," John 3:3, is put for an interest in, and enjoying of God. 
    And so the text must be understood; for certainly it is not the notional, 
    speculative knowledge of Christ, which Paul's adversaries here neglected 
    not; but the saving, practical, experimental knowledge of him, as is evident 
    from the context, verse 9. This is that for which he throws away all things 
    else, taking and desiring to have him instead of all. And this is called the 
    knowledge of Christ,</p>
<p align="justify">Because Christ is a spiritual object; an object for the 
    soul, and not for the senses; "whom, having not seen, we love." The soul 
    must rise from sensible things and occupy itself in the contemplation of his 
    perfections, uniting with him, so that the soul finds that sweetness in him 
    that satiates it, so that the happiness of Heaven consists in the seeing of 
    God and of Christ, "whom we shall see as he is;" that is, the enjoying of 
    them.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 1. That only is the true knowledge of Christ 
    which terminates in an interest in, and enjoyment of him. All other 
    knowledge that comes short of this is unworthy of the name. As the least 
    brook that is, however shallow, differs from the deepest standing pool, 
    while it runs into the sea, and rests not until it be there; so the least 
    measure of saving knowledge differs from all the light a hypocrite has, in 
    that it terminates in an embracing of, and uniting with Christ, while the 
    other stands idle and inefficacious in that matter. To confirm this, 
    consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That all the knowledge of Christ which men have, that 
    brings them not to him, is but splendid ignorance, according to the word. 
    Hence they are branded everywhere as fools; men whose hearts cannot be 
    right, because their heads are not right; foolish builders, foolish virgins; 
    they are blind also. Some persons can talk so as they are admired of the 
    ignorant, but when knowing persons come to try their knowledge, they find 
    they do not understand what they speak, nor whereof they affirm. So is it 
    with those that have not the saving knowledge of Christ; their knowledge is 
    but gilded ignorance.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That knowledge of Christ, which issues not in an 
    interest in in him, is not so much knowledge, as mere opinion; which is 
    dubious and uncertain. "The natural man receives not the things of the 
    Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, 
    because they are spiritually discerned." Natural men, to speak properly, 
    have not the knowledge of Christ, though they can preach him; but only an 
    opinion, a good opinion of him, as men have of many points that are in 
    controversy, in which they are far from an absolute certainty. They think 
    well of Christ, but yet they will not commit themselves to him, because they 
    are not sure. "When you meet with a stranger at an inn when traveling, you 
    find, perhaps, the man a very discreet person, and you form a good opinion 
    of him, that he is a very honest man, and therefore you will converse with 
    him a while; but yet you will not commit your money to him, because though 
    you have a very good opinion of him, he is a stranger to you, you do not 
    know him. Just so it is with those who have only a speculative knowledge of 
    Christ. They do not know him so well as to put their trust in him. There are 
    two points of saving knowledge, by which I may exemplify this.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The superlative worth and excellency of Christ. That 
    he is more precious than all things else, as in the text; and that all the 
    things that may be desired are not to be compared to him. Now, no doubt, 
    each in this congregation would answer, if asked, that they know this. But 
    mistake it not, there is a difference between knowledge and opinion. As for 
    most of us, it is but opinion, not knowledge, otherwise we would take him 
    for, and instead of all, Matthew 13:45, 46. If one should offer a pearl to 
    an ordinary merchant for all that he has, his attention would be excited, 
    his heart and eye would be in the pearl indeed, but he dare not venture on 
    the bargain; for though he has some notion that perhaps that one pearl is 
    better than all the goods he has, yet he is not sure. But should a jeweler 
    come and tell him, assuring him that it is worth double of all his ware, he 
    would take it, and give up all his ware with heart and good will. Thus says 
    Jesus, "if you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give me 
    to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living 
    water."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ's sufficiency. That Christ is able to bear all 
    the sinner's weight for time and eternity. That he is just such an high 
    priest as became us. We all think we know this; and certainly the saints 
    that have believed, and rolled all their weight upon him, have known it. 
    They can say, each for himself, "I know whom I have believed, and am 
    persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against 
    that day." But really, to the most part, it goes no farther than a bare 
    opinion, which never brings them to venture all freely upon him. They are 
    like a man fallen into a deep pit, a rope is let down, he looks to it again 
    and again, thinks it is strong enough; yet when he comes to try it, he 
    starts back, cannot venture for he is not sure, and therefore falls a 
    climbing up, until he fall and ruin himself. Now the true knowledge of 
    Christ differs exceedingly from this opinion of him. Says Paul to the 
    Thessalonians, "Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God. For our 
    Gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy 
    Spirit, and in much assurance."</p>
<p align="justify">3. The true knowledge of Christ engages the heart, and 
    captivates the soul. "And they that know your name, will put their trust in 
    you; for you, Lord, have not forsaken them that seek you." When the gospel 
    comes in power and demonstration of the Spirit, the heart of a sinner is 
    overpowered, that as it cannot hinder itself to assent to clear truth, so it 
    cannot but embrace him as the chief good. "Because of the savor of your good 
    ointments, your name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins 
    love you." As the loadstone draws iron to it, so there is a divine virtue in 
    spiritual illumination, to draw the sinner to Christ. As some waters have a 
    healing virtue coming through minerals, so Christ, riding in triumph in his 
    glory through the soul, certainly gains the heart consent of those that 
    behold him. So that that light, like the fire of the furnace, burns off the 
    children's bonds with which they were held before.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The saving knowledge of Christ differs not in kind, 
    but in degrees, from heaven's happiness. It is the commencement of eternal 
    life in the soul, John 17:3, "But we all with open face beholding as in a 
    glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to 
    glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord." Here the knowledge of him is 
    through a glass darkly, there face to face. As in Heaven, then, there is a 
    complete happiness and enjoyment of God, from that knowledge of him there; 
    so there is a real interest and enjoyment of him here, in some, in which the 
    knowledge of him here does issue. What did it avail the rich man, to see 
    Abraham, and Lazarus in his bosom, afar off; this contributed to his 
    torment. So what avails any knowledge of Christ, without an interest in him? 
    As James says of faith without works, "Can faith save you?" So may we say of 
    mere speculative knowledge, Can it save you?</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The true knowledge of Christ is not an idle 
    speculation, but a practical experimental knowledge, verse 9. It is to know 
    him, that we may be partakers of him. Saving knowledge is transforming, 2 
    Corinthians 3:18. Men do not dig into the affections of the earth to see 
    gold, but to enjoy it; nor do they know the treasure in Christ, whose 
    business it is not to make it their own.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of Information.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Many of those who want not knowledge of the truths of 
    religion in some sort, may begin again to learn the A, B, C, of Christian 
    knowledge. How many learned ignorants are there in the world, that know 
    something of all things, but the one thing needful. This is a certain rule. 
    A man has no more of Christ in his head, than he has of him in his heart. 
    And if that be so truly, for as far as most of us are on, we may be brought 
    back to the first question of grace's catechism, "What is his name, and what 
    is his Son's name, if you can tell?"</p>
<p align="justify">2. True knowledge carries a man out of himself to Christ, 
    and so fills a man with humility and self-denial. "I have heard of you by 
    the hearing of the ear," says Job, "but now mine eye sees you, wherefore I 
    abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." That knowledge which puffs up 
    is none of the right sort, for were it of the right kind, it would, as a 
    river, run into the sea of the excellency of Christ, and raise him, and 
    empty and humble men's selves in their own eyes. No more knowledge of Christ 
    have we, than we have of humility and self-denial. They to whom Christ is 
    all, will themselves be nothing in their own eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Surely Christ is a veiled beauty to those who are not 
    interested in him. They that know him cannot but love and embrace him, they 
    cannot refuse him. If Christ has not yet got your heart, surely your eyes 
    are held, that you can not perceive him, Song 5:9–16, compare chapter 6:1. 
    You could not prefer anything to him, if you did but behold his glory, 
    therefore you know no more of him than he has of your heart.</p>
<p align="justify">4. In whatever measure anything besides Christ carries 
    away the heart, the knowledge of Christ is so far lost. The heart of man is 
    an empty thing that must needs be seeking satisfaction in the enjoyment of 
    something. If your heart be inordinately going out after the enjoyment of 
    the creatures, it is an evidence that it has so far lost the knowledge of 
    his excellence; so far as that is gone, so far have you lost the true 
    knowledge of him. And, therefore, for recovery, turn the eyes of your mind 
    towards him to behold his glory, which is the readiest way to darken created 
    excellence.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The best way to obtain true knowledge of Christ, 
    is to be much in seeking and conversing with him, that is the way to enjoy 
    him. "My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth 
    shall praise you with joyful lips, when I remember you upon my bed, and 
    meditate on you in the night watches." "If any man will do his will, he 
    shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of 
    myself." Practical religion is the best way to attain to more of the 
    knowledge of Christ. As those with whom we would be acquainted, we must be 
    much in their company, and converse with them frequently; so this is the way 
    in which Christians get the secrets of the covenant manifested to them.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Let me exhort you to labor to know Christ, and to 
    improve your knowledge of him to an interest in, and enjoyment of him; and 
    never satisfy yourselves with a knowledge of him that comes short of that. 
    Never reckon you know more than you enjoy and feel in your souls of Christ, 
    or than you really, in believing, make use of, and improve for your souls. 
    Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Such knowledge is very useless to you, whatever it may 
    be to others, for whom God can serve himself of it, to lead them in the way 
    of truth. What would it avail a man to know the remedy, while he neglects to 
    apply it; would not such an one die of his disease. Sinners, what will it 
    avail you, that you know Christ is a Savior, if you do not employ him? What 
    the better is a man, that he dies within sight of the physician? What would 
    it avail if a man had ever so much knowledge of the law, if yet he suffer 
    men to wheedle him out of his estate, while he neglects to plead his right? 
    And what though you know what to do to be saved, if you do it not? What the 
    better are you to know Christ to be an up-making portion, if you take him 
    not for your portion?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Nay, such knowledge is noxious. It does for the 
    present aggravate your sin. Sins against light, are of all sins the most 
    heavy. For the future, it will aggravate your condemnation. Alas! what is 
    that knowledge, that serves only as a lantern to light men into everlasting 
    darkness?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Our disease lies more in our hearts than in our heads. 
    There was some knowledge left after the fall, Romans 2:15; but there was no 
    goodness, no heart holiness. If physic be taken, yet if it do not operate to 
    carry off the ill humours of the body, a person is nothing the better, but 
    rather the worse; so is it when knowledge comes into the head, but sinks not 
    into the heart. Men's minds should usher in the truth received, into the 
    heart; but instead of that, they are often as jailors, to lock it up in 
    prison that it cannot stir, "They hold the truth in unrighteousness."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, God will not own his knowing of any, but those in 
    whom he has a special interest, Matthew 25:12. And if you would reckon as 
    God will do, you would reckon thus also.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 3. Of comfort to those that have seen as much of 
    Christ, as that they cannot rest without an interest in him; and have some 
    enjoyment of him, but may be discouraged under a sense of weakness of 
    knowledge. But be comforted, it is true knowledge. And as a little gold is 
    far more precious than much brass, so the lowest degree of true knowledge is 
    far better than great stores of mere speculative knowledge.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. All things are but loss in comparison of an 
    interest in Christ, and the enjoyment of him. This is a point that runs 
    counter to the judgment of all the unregenerate world, who count highly of 
    other things, but make light of Christ and an interest in him. This is 
    confirmed by the daily practice of all out of Christ. Here I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show in what respects all things are but loss in 
    comparison of an interest in Christ, and the enjoyment of him.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I shall confirm this point by proofs and 
    illustrations. I am then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show in what respects all things are but loss, in 
    comparison of an interest in Christ, and the enjoyment of him.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is not one thing in all the creation, but it is 
    loss, in comparison of the enjoyment of Christ as ours. Turn over all the 
    creatures, and all created perfections in the world, single out the best of 
    them, and the most desirable, take the choicest, it will be but refuse in 
    comparison of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2. All of them together, are but loss in this respect. 
    Suppose you were possessed of the whole inventory of good things; profitable 
    pleasant things, lawful and unlawful, that what is wanting in one, may be 
    made up to you in another; lay the possession of them in one balance, and 
    the enjoyment of Christ in another, they would all be weighed down. If the 
    whole constellation of created perfections should arise upon you, Christ, as 
    the Sun of Righteousness, would darken them all. Had you Solomon's riches 
    and wisdom, Samson's strength, Absalom's beauty; should all the created 
    comforts ever man had, or ever will have, fall down together into your 
    bosom, all would be nothing in comparison of an interest in Christ, and the 
    enjoyment of him. All is but loss. All are of no value in comparison of an 
    interest in Christ. The best of them are not worthy to be named with him in 
    one day. Health and strength are good, and outward accommodations and 
    privileges are good, but as the glorious stars hide their heads when the sun 
    appears, so must all these things before Christ. They are all to be thrown 
    away, when we cannot have Christ with them. If it comes to that, that we 
    must part with Christ or part with them, then we have reason to say, 
    farewell profits, pleasures, honors, liberty, life itself, and all things, 
    and welcome Christ. They are to be lost in that case, but in no case must we 
    agree to lose him. The man is at no loss that loses them, but gains Christ. 
    He loses but loss, which no man will grudge. He is sufficiently made up in 
    the want of them all, by the enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, He has a poor bargain of it, that has all, but 
    wants Christ. His gain may be soon told, his loss cannot be reckoned up. We 
    now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To confirm this point by proofs and illustrations. O 
    to believe it! The belief of it would turn the current of our desires and 
    endeavors another way.</p>
<p align="justify">1. An interest in Christ makes God ours, for he is God; 
    "the fullness of the Godhead dwells in him." So runs the covenant, in which 
    God makes over himself, in Christ, to sinners: "I will," says he, "be to 
    them a God, and they shall be to me a people." He is their portion and their 
    heritage. They are children and heirs, "heirs of God, and joint heirs with 
    Christ." Now what is all the world in comparison of God himself? "While 
    others can say, this land, this house is mine, the Christian can say, God is 
    mine, for Christ is mine: "Lo this God is our God." An interest in Christ, 
    then, is absolutely the greatest treasure. Men nor angels cannot make an 
    inventory of the Christian's portion, which is summed up in this, God is 
    theirs. The greatest abundance of earthly things maybe reckoned, and you 
    will soon hear that there is no more. "But eye has not seen, nor ear heard, 
    neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has 
    prepared for them that love him." The infinite perfections of God are their 
    treasure, and this treasure will tell out to all eternity. It is also 
    absolutely the most valuable treasure, for what proportion can there be 
    between the perfections of God, and those of the creature. Worldly men may 
    have some streams of good things let out to them, but the Christian has the 
    fountain of all. Now, where the water is good, it is best in the spring. 
    Sure then the enjoyment of God must be best. God's goodness, love, and 
    all-sufficiency is theirs.</p>
<p align="justify">2. An interest in Christ is the one thing necessary. "One 
    thing" says our Lord, "is needful." All things must go for necessities. A 
    man parts with his money and goods for his health, and will part with all 
    for his life. He reckons all nothing in comparison of that, because he can 
    live without other things, but none of these things can avail him, if he 
    lose his life, Matthew 6:25. Even so an interest in Christ stands by itself, 
    and is not to be reckoned among, but above all things else.</p>
<p align="justify">Other things are conveniences to be thankfully received, 
    but not necessities that cannot be wanted. Man's great desire is to be 
    happy. This is the end which all propose to themselves. Now, I say, other 
    things besides Christ are not absolutely necessary for this end. It is not 
    necessary that you may be rich, you may be happy without riches. Lazarus was 
    happy, though poor; the apostles, though despised, and counted as the 
    off-scouring of all; Job, without either health or wealth; the saints in 
    Heaven are stripped of the comforts of this life, yet perfectly happy; 
    therefore happiness may be without them.</p>
<p align="justify">But an interest in Christ is absolutely necessary. No 
    happiness without it. Though you were compassed about with all the profits 
    and pleasures of the world, yet in this case the sword of vengeance hangs 
    above your head. You are but as a condemned malefactor set down at a well 
    covered table, but knows not how soon he may be raised and led to execution. 
    Though the earth smiles on you, yet Heaven frowns; though men bless, God 
    curses you, and may say to you, "you fool, this night shall your soul be 
    required of you; then whose shall those things be which you have provided?"</p>
<p align="justify">Again, nothing can make up the want of an interest in 
    Christ; but an interest in him can make up the want of all things else. All 
    the gold of the Indies will not buy a pardon, nor the greatest earthly 
    honors keep from everlasting contempt. Have what you will, if you have not 
    Christ, you are under a loss that cannot be made up another way; but that 
    makes up all other wants, Philip. 4:18. Whatever you want, if Christ be 
    yours, you have what is better.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, Everything that one really needs is comprehended 
    in it, so that the way to get all our needs compendiously answered, is to 
    get an interest in Christ. Our wants are far more than our needs. We reckon 
    our needs more than they are; but once in Christ; then one may well expect 
    to get all he really needs made out to him. "He who spared not his own son, 
    but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give 
    us all things." "For the Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing will 
    he withhold from them that walk uprightly." Whatever his people need, God, 
    as a Father, will provide for them," Matthew 6:32.</p>
<p align="justify">3. An interest in Christ is satisfying to the soul, while 
    nothing else can give satisfaction. You may as soon grasp your arms full of 
    dreams, and embrace your own shadow, as suck satisfaction out of the dry 
    breasts of the creatures. But in Christ there is what will satisfy the soul, 
    answer its desires in breadth and length. There are two things necessary to 
    give satisfaction. First, Suitableness. Now Christ is a suitable enjoyment 
    for the soul. He is suitable to the nature of the soul, which is spiritual, 
    and the enjoyment of him is the enjoyment of spiritual blessings. "God 
    blesses us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ." The 
    soul is immortal, and so an interest in Christ is durable; "for durable 
    riches and righteousness are with him." He is suitable to the necessities of 
    the soul, for pardon, peace, and every blessing; whereas all things of the 
    world are nothing so.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, fullness is necessary to satisfaction. Now there 
    is a fullness of these suitable blessings in him. "It has pleased the 
    Father, that in him should all fullness dwell." What can be wanting in an 
    infinite good. Here then "we eat that which is good, and our souls delight 
    themselves in fatness."</p>
<p align="justify">4. An interest in Christ is the most enriching interest. 
    "Were an estimate to be made of what the meanest Christian is worth, and 
    what the richest monarch, the Christian's would be found infinitely beyond 
    his. The Christian has a right to more, for he has a right to all through 
    Christ. "All things," says Paul to believers, "are yours." The Christian has 
    married the heir of all things, and so may set his name on all that is his. 
    What though he has but little in hand, yet look his papers, read his 
    charter, his bonds under the hand of God himself, containing the promises of 
    this life and that which is to come, and the greatest riches of the 
    graceless world, is rank poverty in comparison of that.</p>
<p align="justify">Nasy, the Christian has more in actual possession than 
    the greatest on earth. The most precious and valuable riches are ordinarily 
    least in bulk. A little gold, or a small pearl, is more valuable than a bag 
    full of brass coin. Reckon thus, and the man that is interested in Christ 
    has more in hand than the richest in the world. His grace is more precious 
    than gold, his power over his own spirit better than dominion over kingdoms. 
    What is so great on earth as a kingdom? What kingdom so great as that of 
    Heaven? The Christian has it: "For behold the kingdom of God is within you." 
    And this leads us to observe, that the Christian, by his interest in Christ, 
    has all within himself, that he needs not go out for it. You will say such a 
    man has a well furnished house and table, some things he got from such a 
    place, and some things from another. O! but, say you, there is another man 
    has all things within himself, the last is preferable. So in this. What an 
    ungodly man does most value, generally it is without himself. His riches are 
    in his coffers, his plenty in his barns, his dominion is given him by 
    others, and can be taken away; his honor also depends on others. But the 
    Christian has all within himself, because Christ is in him. Yes, "Christ is 
    in him, the hope of glory." "A good man," it is said, "shall be satisfied 
    from himself." Christians "know in themselves, that they have in Heaven a 
    better and an enduring substance." He has a kingdom within, that contains 
    what is suitable for every case.</p>
<p align="justify">Here, also, I would remark, that the little that one has, 
    that has an interest in Christ, is more valuable than the greatest abundance 
    of a Christless man. "A little," says the Psalmist, "that a righteous man 
    has, is better than the riches of many wicked." Better than the riches, even 
    than the riches of many. But how can that be? I answer, the little they 
    have, they have it with the love of God; and whatever others have, they have 
    it with his wrath and anger. "The curse of the Lord is in the house of the 
    wicked, but he blesses the habitation of the just." What the Christian has, 
    comes from God's love, and is a token of his love; and you know tokens are 
    valued more for the sake of the giver, than the gift itself.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, the Christian has the sanctified use of what he 
    possesses. All that they have comes to them through the channel of the 
    covenant, and tends to their good. "For we know that all things work 
    together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called 
    according to his purpose," whereas others, by virtue of a secret curse that 
    is in what they have, are thereby injured. There is death in the pot. "The 
    prosperity of fools shall destroy them." Many have been nourished and 
    supported with coarse fare, when kings and emperors have had poison mixed 
    with their most delicious meats. So it is here.</p>
<p align="justify">Besides, the little that the Christian has, he has it 
    freely, nothing to pay. It is paid for already by the blood of Christ. But 
    others will have a dear reckoning that will pay for all at the latter end. 
    They may write on all their enjoyments this motto, The price of blood. "For 
    what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own 
    soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" The world is as a 
    commodious inn, perhaps the children there do not fare so well as the 
    stranger. But then the stranger gets his bill before he go away, when he 
    must pay dear for all he has got.</p>
<p align="justify">The Christian, also, has a far better right to his 
    little, than the other has to his abundance. A covenant right, it is the 
    purchase of Christ. It was precious water that was brought to David, out of 
    the well of Bethlehem, more precious than wine, because it was the price of 
    blood.</p>
<p align="justify">Others have but a right by common providence. Their good 
    things are bones cast to dogs. It is but as a supper which a malefactor 
    enjoys before he is led forth to execution.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The little which the Christian has, is an earnest 
    of more mercy. You may call it Joseph, for God will add another to it. Now, 
    a little given as an earnest, is better by far than a great sum, after which 
    no more is to be expected. Even the Christian's wants are better than the 
    abundance of others, even as the want of strong liquor is better than to 
    have it to put us in a fever.</p>
<p align="justify">5. An interest in Christ is the only abiding, lasting 
    interest. It will abide when we must lose all other things. We see that a 
    little thing coming in yearly, is preferred to great sums in hand, which may 
    soon be all spent. An interest in Christ cannot be taken from us as other 
    things may, Matthew 6:19. The philosopher called riches the vomit of 
    fortune; if so, we find the vomit is often resumed. Job in his time saw 
    himself rich and poor to a proverb, Proverbs 23:5. But once in Christ, 
    always in him. The landed man may have his crop destroyed, but his land 
    abides. Other things are lent us, but this is an irrevocable gift.</p>
<p align="justify">We cannot be taken from it, Matthew 6:20. The man that 
    dies interested in Christ is his own heir, and carries his interest into 
    another world with him. The worldly comforts men have, are like servants in 
    an inn, that wait upon persons while they continue there, but go not away 
    with them, but abide to serve others that come after them.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, I shall prove it by an induction of particulars 
    upon which men set their hearts more than upon Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Knowledge of other things besides Christ, is no way 
    comparable to the knowledge of Christ. The pleasure which men find in it, is 
    infinitely below that which they find in the knowledge of Christ. It can do 
    no good at death, and they will have no more use for it through eternity, 
    while the other will continue as the saint's eternal happiness. "This is 
    life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ 
    whom you have sent." They are like men going through a city, gazing at 
    everything about them, while they never look to their own way, and neglect 
    their own business. Each of them may say with Grotius, Ah! I have destroyed 
    life, laboriously doing nothing.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Riches are vain, and, laid in the balance with an 
    interest in Christ, are lighter than vanity. They are uncertain as the wind, 
    and can never fill the heart, Proverbs 23:5. Nay, they enlarge the desires, 
    where grace does not narrow them; for worldliness is a sort of spiritual 
    drunkenness, that the more one gets, the more he would have.</p>
<p align="justify">They cannot profit in the day of wrath. It is with 
    Christians and others, as with Abraham's children. Abraham gave all that "he 
    had unto Isaac. But unto the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, he 
    gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son." Christians are with the 
    first, they are heirs; others get but movables, and they are made over to 
    them with the burden of danger, for says Jesus "how hardly shall they that 
    have riches enter into the kingdom of God." There is danger in an evil time 
    from men by them. The tall oaks are torn up by the roots, while the low 
    shrubs escape; and they are at all times, but especially in evil times, a 
    snare to the soul. They are a handle by which Satan holds men; so that while 
    they cleave to them, Satan draws them to himself. They have also a burden of 
    duties. God requires more of rich persons than of others. "To whom much is 
    given, from them much shall be required." They have accounts to give. They 
    are but stewards, and the more they have among their hands, their accounts 
    will be the greater, Luke 16. But an interest in Christ shall never be lost.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Honor and reputation. What vain things are they, 
    depending upon the uncertain thoughts of others; and where men have them at 
    many hands, they may be wanting at that hand where they might do them most 
    good. How easily is reputation stained, and it is at the mercy of every 
    calumnious detractor. It is a windy bubble of water that has no solidity in 
    it, and quickly is gone. But he who has an interest in Christ, though he 
    should lie among the pots while he lives here, shall shine in that honor 
    which is eternal, hereafter.</p>
<p align="justify">4. An easy and pleasant life in the world is a vain 
    thing, much desired and pursued, to the neglect of an interest in Christ. 
    But let us do our utmost to make our bed soft here, there shall ever be 
    found some thorn of uneasiness in it. No sound ease but in Christ. When 
    world's ease is got, it bears hard on the soul, which as readily corrupts; 
    while troubles in the world set men to their duty. And how suddenly is men's 
    ease and pleasure interrupted; and the more they had of it, they can the 
    worse bear the want of it.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Friends able to do one a kindness are much valued. 
    They that have them, value themselves upon them; they that want them, think 
    they would be well if they had them. But alas! how oft do they prove like 
    brooks dried up, Job 6:15; and how quickly may we be in such a case, that if 
    even our best friends were never so willing, they are utterly unable to help 
    us. Christ is a friend that can, and will help in all cases.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Comfortable relations; a husband, wife, or children, 
    dutiful and comfortable. Great mercies indeed, but loss in comparison of an 
    interest in Christ. How difficult is it for us to have them such and not 
    make gods of them? How difficult to rejoice, and not overjoy in them? And 
    many times where people have thought to find their greatest comfort, there 
    they have found their greatest cross. And however comfortable, yet they must 
    part; and when they go, the more comfortable they were, the deeper is the 
    wound they leave behind them.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Liberty is what every person prizes; there is always 
    no man who would not rather choose to be stripped of all, and to wander to 
    find her for himself, than to be penned up in a palace. But what serves that 
    liberty, while a man is still in the devil's chain, and has the eternal 
    prison abiding him; that though he can go where he will, yet be can go no 
    where but where Satan is with him, and in him. How much more worthy is an 
    interest in Christ. Though the body be imprisoned, confined, or banished, 
    yet the soul has access" at all times to the throne of God.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Life is dearer than all these, yet is but loss in 
    comparison of an interest in Christ. What a vain thing is the life of man on 
    earth, liable to a thousand accidents, and which even a blast of infected 
    air can take away. The lamp goes out at length, the oil being wasted; and 
    while it remains, may be clogged with such miseries as may make life itself 
    a burden, and men to court their dissolution, that they may rest in a grave. 
    To none of these is an interest in Christ liable, it is that which secures 
    an eternal life.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, In a word, self is what most men seek, neglecting 
    Christ. But what a vain thing are we ourselves. It will not be amiss to give 
    here some self-debasing considerations. Consider, then, we are nothing. 
    Whatever figure we make, we are nothing; that is to say, we are worth 
    nothing. However great, we are but fair nothings. I Am, is God's name. Take 
    away the parts of a compound, and then it is nothing. Let God take back his 
    own from us, and we are nothing. You will see some men make a great 
    appearance, and you think they are rich men; but others that know their 
    affairs will tell you that they are worth nothing, for it is all other 
    people's property that they have among their hands; and that if every one 
    had their own, they would be brought to nothing. "Without me," says Jesus, 
    "you can do nothing." We are but mere tools in the Lord's hands: without him 
    we can do nothing in grace or nature. As our being is from him, so is our 
    working. Again, we deserve nothing. We are unprofitable servants. Our 
    demerit is great, our merit nothing. We deserve Hell indeed, but deserve not 
    the least mercy. Yes, we are worse than nothing, as being sinful creatures, 
    even as a cup full of poison is worse than an empty cup.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of information.</p>
<p align="justify">1. How foolish are men, then, who are very busy and 
    diligent to get other things, but who neglect to get an interest in Christ. 
    Like Martha, they are careful and troubled about many things, while they 
    neglect the one thing needful, the better part. With what carefulness do men 
    manage their business for their bodies, who are careless of their souls. 
    Surely this interest is the great project we should be driving in the world, 
    and not be seeking after that which is lost, to the neglecting of the great 
    gain.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They have made but a poor purchase, have what they 
    will, that have not an interest in Christ. Can they be happy, though they 
    were monarchs of the world? They cannot, for their all is but a heap of loss 
    and dung, they have nothing substantial and durable. Have what you will, 
    what will all these things avail you, if you have not Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The righteous is more excellent than his neighbor. The 
    poorest saint on earth is richer than the greatest man on earth that is a 
    Christless man. He has that which is of more worth than all the world. O! 
    but fretting and discontentment ill becomes a Christian for want of any 
    worldly thing. Does not Jesus say, Am I not better to you than ten sons. 
    Surely it is because they see not their stock.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Men are no losers, lose what they will for Christ. We 
    have no reason to grudge to suffer the loss of all for him.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of exhortation. I exhort you then to seek and 
    secure an interest in Christ for yourselves. Make this your great business. 
    I have often called you to this, and it has been the great scope of all my 
    preaching among you to lead you to Christ. And now when the Lord is 
    threatening to draw our table, and separate ministers from their flocks, I 
    desire once more to call and invite you to an interest in Christ. And if I 
    could prevail, though I should never more have access to serve you in the 
    gospel, I would think I had got my errand.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. Christ is willing to receive you. There is a 
    match proposed between the King of Glory and the daughter of Zion, Christ 
    and sinners. And I declare there is nothing to hinder it on Heaven's part. 
    "For the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. 
    And let him that is athirst come. And whoever will, let him take of the 
    water of life freely." Young sinners, that are setting out in the world, he 
    is content to be yours. "I love them that love me," says he, "and they that 
    seek me early shall find me." Old sinners, he is content to be yours, though 
    you have refused many calls. He excludes none of you, do not, I beseech you, 
    exclude yourselves. "Ho! every one that thirsts, come you to the waters; and 
    he who has no money, come you, buy and eat; yes come, buy wine and milk 
    without money and without price." And to evidence his willingness to be 
    yours, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">Why did he come the long journey from Heaven to earth, 
    but to relieve the captive daughter of Zion. Are you the lost, Luke 19:10. 
    Why did he leave the Father's bosom, but to bring these back to it, whom sin 
    had shaken out. Why suffered he, but that they might be saved? Why was he 
    bruised, but that he might become bread to the hungry soul? Why shed he his 
    blood, but to remove the lawful impediments of this match?</p>
<p align="justify">In vain did he shed his blood, if sinners among men be 
    not partakers of it. Whom had he in his eye for reconciliation? Not angels, 
    not devils, Hebrews 2:6. It was men, "Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice 
    is to the sons of men." Not to the righteous, there were none such; and if 
    there had been, they had not needed him. Answer to your name then, O 
    sinners! for such Christ came to call; he really offers himself to you in 
    his word preached by his ambassadors. How then can you doubt his 
    willingness. Our offer is really, though ministerial, Christ's own offer, 
    for we have his commission to bear us out in it. Our commission and office 
    we had not from the magistrate, therefore it is not in their power to 
    deprive us of it, as they may deprive men of offices civil and military, 
    which come from them. But our commission is from Christ. We teach not but 
    what Christ has commanded us, and therefore he will be with us in it; which 
    these have no ground to pretend to, that teach for doctrines the 
    commandments of men, whom this Church is in hazard of having thrust in upon 
    her; 2 Corinthians 5:20. We are proxies for the Lord of Glory, come to you 
    with his own word, by his orders. Would you have himself leave his glory a 
    second time, to offer himself to you? Or would you have him come in his 
    glory. You know not what you ask. It would befit you better to do, as 1 
    Samuel 25:40–41.</p>
<p align="justify">Our offer of him in his own name, is so really his, that 
    you will be eternally ruined, if you refuse it, Mark 16:15, 16; John 17:20.</p>
<p align="justify">Consider, also, how long he has waited upon you, and 
    after many refusals has still, and is courting your consent, Revelation 
    3:20. Why did he not go away at your first or second refusal? No, but you 
    have still line upon line. Finally, he knows very well what is in you and 
    about you; yet has he declared, that nothing shall hinder the match, if you 
    be willing. Though you be poor and miserable, he is willing to take you, to 
    enrich you, to clothe you, and nourish you forever; and is he not then 
    willing to be yours.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. Consider what you are without him. Wretched and 
    miserable is the state of every Christless soul. If you saw your case by the 
    light of the Spirit, you would be much affected. Let us glance at a few 
    parts of your picture, as it is presented in the glass of the word. Sinner, 
    you are God's enemy. "The carnal mind is enmity against God." You came into 
    the world in a state of enmity against God. The reconciliation is not yet 
    made up, for there is no peace with God, but through Christ. Have you no 
    interest in Christ, then what have you to do with peace, who have nothing to 
    do with the great peacemaker. There is wrath in God's heart, in his word, 
    and in his hand against you.</p>
<p align="justify">Again you are debtor to justice. Sin is your debt, which 
    you are not, and never will be able to pay. You are in the hand of an 
    inexorable creditor. You have no cautioner to be surety for your debt. You 
    will not get your debt denied. Conscience will be instead of a thousand 
    witnesses against you. You will be pursued for principal and interest, and 
    the debt will be pursued at your own expense. You are also the law's 
    criminal. God has a law, and by that law you must die. "For the wages of sin 
    is death." The law condemns you, takes away your life as a traitor to God, 
    an enemy to Heaven. You live but as a malefactor, by the benefit of a 
    reprieve, and you know not how soon it may expire.</p>
<p align="justify">You are, moreover, Satan's slave, captive, and prisoner. 
    You are under "the power of Satan, and taken captive by him at his will." In 
    this case Christ finds all those to whom he comes. Behold your drudgery 
    work, the sign of your slavery, your chains, your captivity, your prison 
    garments that are on you.</p>
<p align="justify">You, O sinner! in your Christless state, are to every 
    good work reprobate. You can do nothing good or acceptable in the sight of 
    God. Your prayers are but howling, your sacrifice an abomination, your 
    throat an open sepulcher.</p>
<p align="justify">Besides, in your Christless state, sinner, you are a 
    stranger to the covenant of grace, and all the benefits of it, Ephesians 
    2:12. You have not married the heir, and, therefore, what have you to do 
    with the benefits of the contract. You can have no pardon nor peace in your 
    present state.</p>
<p align="justify">You are a burden to the earth, Romans 8:22. Every 
    creature is your enemy. The very meat which you eat, waits a command to 
    dispatch you. You are an abomination to Heaven, that will have nothing to do 
    with you. "For there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defiles, 
    neither whatever works abomination, or makes a lie." You are a prey to the 
    pit's devouring mouth that waits for you.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 3. An interest in Christ is the best interest 
    which you can have in the world. Consider that it is an interest for soul 
    and body both. A man's purchase in the world, may furnish him something in 
    the world for his body, food and clothing, and the like; but nothing for the 
    soul. This will furnish you peace, pardon, and all the benefits of the 
    everlasting covenant. Yes, and for the body, it makes it a member of Christ, 
    a temple for the Spirit, and ensures a glorious resurrection. It is an 
    interest both for Heaven and earth. It makes them to inherit the earth, 
    Matthew 5:5, by their right to it in Christ, and their contentment with what 
    they have of it, as if they had it all, and this interest entitles them to 
    glory. It is then both for time and eternity. "It is profitable unto all 
    things, having the promise of the life that now is, and that which is to 
    come." It is the best security for a through-bearing here, and will be an 
    interest of which you will reap the fruits forever.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 4. Consider the case of the day in which we live, 
    calls loudly for us to secure our own interest in Christ. And we can make no 
    good use of the reelings of the times, if they do not lead us to this. Have 
    we not need of something which men cannot take from us? And what is that, 
    but an interest in Christ, with the benefits depending thereon? We are 
    threatened with persecution and with the sword, in which the Church and land 
    were once involved, what in such a case have men they can call their own? 
    Have we not need of something that may be comfortable to us, under the loss 
    of all things? Indeed, the man that has an interest in Christ may say, I 
    have a refuge, a portion.</p>
<p align="justify">If you be called to suffering, what a sad thing is it to 
    suffer for one in whom you have no interest. You will be ready to turn your 
    back upon him; and yet, shunning suffering for a good cause, you may be 
    brought to suffer dishonorably, whether you will or not, so as sinning will 
    not keep you from suffering.</p>
<p align="justify">When snares are abroad, and a course of defection, how 
    can you think to escape that have no interest in Christ? And when the Lord 
    is threatening to remove the gospel from you, it calls you at length to 
    answer his call.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 5, and last. Let the consideration of eternity 
    stir you up. What will you do without an interest in Christ, when death 
    arrests you? The soul and body must part. Who will keep you from the second 
    death? When time is gone, you must pass to eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">What will you do when the resurrection comes? What hill 
    or mountain will cover the sinner from the face of the Lamb?</p>
<p align="justify">When, O sinner! you must stand before the tribunal, and 
    that very Savior whom you now slightest will be your Judge, who will then 
    plead your cause?</p>
<p align="justify">DIRECTIONS. View your sinfulness. Get a deep sight of 
    your misery without Christ, your utter inability to help yourselves, and the 
    helplessness of all creatures. Give away yourselves solemnly to Christ, and 
    all that is yours, taking him for, and instead of all. Amen.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
<br/>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>PART II.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">Philippians 3:7-9, "But whatever was to my profit I now 
    consider loss for the sake of Christ. What is more, I consider everything a 
    loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, 
    for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may 
    gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that 
    comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ--the 
    righteousness that comes from God and is by faith."</p>
<p align="justify">HERE the apostle asserts his interest in Christ, calling 
    him his Lord; not only as Christ had an interest in him and lordship over 
    him, but in so far as he had an interest in Christ. "My beloved is mine, and 
    I am his."</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. Saints may, and ought to plead an interest in 
    Christ as their Lord. The Lord's people sometimes fall into the hands of 
    strange lords, who are hard lords to them. But in the worst of times a child 
    of God may tell a fivefold tale of Christ, which their graceless enemies 
    cannot. Every saint may say of Christ,</p>
<p align="justify">1. He is my Lord God. For as low as his work and cause 
    are, the believer's Lord is God, and his God, John 20:28. "The fullness of 
    the Godhead dwells in him." "He is God manifested in the flesh." Now an 
    interest in God as our God, is an interest above expression. His infinite 
    wisdom is theirs to direct, his power to protect them. "Happy is that people 
    that is in such a case; yes happy is that people whose God is the Lord." Why 
    then should they be afraid of men, however severe masters they be?</p>
<p align="justify">2. My Lord, proprietor, master and owner. We and all ours 
    are the Lord's, therefore he may dispose of us as he will, and we are to 
    submit. In the day of the soul's closing with Christ, we gave up ourselves 
    and all our possessions to the Lord, and so must we say, "we are your 
    servant's, O Lord! truly we are your servants." But of others, Satan is 
    their lord and proprietor.</p>
<p align="justify">3. My Redeemer. "He gave himself for us, to redeem us 
    from all iniquity." When our lives were forfeited to the justice of God, he 
    came and bought them with his precious blood. And shall anything be too dear 
    to us to lose for him.</p>
<p align="justify">4. My Lord and husband. He sought the believer in 
    spiritual marriage, who has consented to him, and so he is their husband. A 
    noble relation! "For your maker is your husband, the Lord of Hosts is his 
    name." And therefore it is below a child of God to prostitute himself, his 
    soul and conscience, to the lusts of men, or pollute them to please the 
    greatest on earth.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, My Lord and King. He has subdued them to himself. 
    They have accepted him as their King and Lawgiver. His throne is in their 
    hearts, and his laws are there; and therefore they can do nothing contrary 
    to their allegiance to him, command it who will, under the most severe 
    penalties. And in the strict observation of his laws, they may expect such 
    protection and provision from him who is the King of kings, as he sees good 
    for them.</p>
<p align="justify">The saints may plead this relation to him and interest in 
    him, for they really have it. Though their real state be capable of degrees, 
    and one is more holy than another, yet this honor have all the saints, and 
    that equally. He is as much the Lord, God, Husband, and King of the meanest 
    soever, as of the strongest. And they ought to plead it.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is very pleasing to God, Jeremiah 3:4. God loves to 
    have his children know their relation to him, and therefore are the 
    Scriptures written and the Spirit given, that we may know the things freely 
    given us of God. We need not blame any but ourselves, if we walk in 
    darkness. It is the weakness of our eyes that keeps us from seeing our 
    privileges, and it robs God of the sacrifice of praise.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is very comfortable and strengthening to the saints 
    themselves, 2 Peter 1:10. This would not only heighten our comforts in the 
    worst of times, but heighten our graces, our love, repentance, obedience, 
    our trust in him, and dependence upon him.</p>
<p align="justify">USE I. O! the happy state of the saints, beyond all the 
    world. Christ is theirs. Mine is a sweet word, especially when it is joined 
    to the most glorious object. Nebuchadnezzar could say, my kingdom, my 
    majesty; but my Lord and my God, is a note of an infinitely higher strain. 
    This is a property that is above all other, that may comfort in the want of 
    all, and will supply all other wants, and is a property which none can take 
    from us.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Let the saints improve their faith to this degree of 
    assurance, that they may confidently, though humbly, call Christ their Lord. 
    But of this before. It is the weakness of the saints, that they dare not 
    say, My Lord. It is no presumption in a gracious soul to say so, who has 
    taken Christ for his Lord. You may say it.</p>
<p align="justify">1. If Christ be Lord of your heart, having the chief room 
    in your affections, Psalm 73:25, have you seen a glory in him, that has 
    darkened all created excellency, so that he reigns in your affections, and 
    your heart is his captive, so that he is dearer to you than what is dearest 
    in the world?—call him then your Lord, for he is Lord of your heart.</p>
<p align="justify">2. If he be Lord of your life, so that you endeavor 
    continually to live to him and not to yourself, not to your lusts, 
    Philippians 1:21. The great design you have in the world is to please him, 
    and to walk before him to all well pleasing, in heart, lip and life; and 
    what is displeasing to him, is displeasing and a burden to you also. Call 
    him then your Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">3. If he be Lord of your all, so that you are content to 
    part with all that is dear to you rather than with him, his favor, his 
    truths, his work, and cause, Luke 14:26. If you have laid down your all at 
    his feet, to be disposed of what way he will, call him then Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Let the people of God follow their duty to Christ 
    as their Lord, in spite of all opposition from the world. If the commands of 
    men go cross to the commands of Christ, though they were the highest powers 
    on earth, let us remember we are to obey our Lord God rather than men; and 
    let us never do a thing to please our lords on earth, that will displease 
    our Lord from Heaven. This day, alas! is a day in which the commands of our 
    rulers on the ministry of this Church cannot be obeyed in the judgment of 
    many worthy ministers, without disobeying our great Lord and Master; though 
    others are not of that mind. This threatens to rend this Church asunder, to 
    separate ministers from their flocks, and to shut up many church doors, and 
    yours among the rest. Prepare for snares, and cleave to the Lord whatever 
    come. If God baffle not the designs of our enemies, they will not rest here, 
    but having begun at the sanctuary, there will be a proceeding to the city; 
    and though ministers may smart first, professors will not want their share. 
    But cleave you to the Lord, to the purity of doctrine, worship, discipline 
    and government instituted by himself; and though the laws of men should 
    overturn all these, choose you rather to sit by the house of God, though 
    lying in rubbish, than to embrace that in religion which has no stamp but 
    that of human authority, for he is our Lord, and his orders we must obey on 
    all hazards.</p>

<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">PHILIPPIANS 3:8, "For whom I have suffered the loss of 
    all things."</p>
<p align="justify">THIS is a day in which suffering or sinning is set before 
    many in this church; and though our case is extraordinary, yet our good Lord 
    sends us this in our ordinary, which gives an evidence of a due esteem of 
    Christ, which the saints have.</p>
<p align="justify">1. We have in the words, the apostle's lot, which tried 
    his esteem of Christ, by his suffering for him. He had spoken much to the 
    commendation of Christ, but many will give Christ a good word, who will not 
    take a frown, an ill word, or a buffet for his sake; but Paul suffered for 
    him.</p>
<p align="justify">We have next what he suffered; the loss of all things. 
    When he says all, he excepts nothing which might come in competition with 
    Christ, external good things, yes, and internal also, as in competition with 
    him. We have also the cause of his sufferings; they were for Christ, for the 
    sake of that precious one.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. God tries, and the saints give proof of their 
    due esteem of Christ, by their suffering the loss of all things for him, as 
    they are called to it. There are two things aimed at in the text, namely, 
    external good things. Saints suffer the loss of these two ways for Christ: 
    1. In affection, when they lose the predominant affection to them, Luke 
    14:26; when the heart is so far weaned from them, as they are content to 
    part with them, rather than Christ. This is a suffering, in so far as it is 
    not easy, but opposite to nature to be content to let them go for Christ. 2. 
    In action, when they actually lose them for Christ and his cause, and let 
    them go rather than a good conscience. Sometimes storms arise in the church, 
    so as men must either part with Christ, his way, and his truths, or else let 
    all they have go for his sake.</p>
<p align="justify">Next internal good things. The saints suffer the loss of 
    these in point of confidence, when all their confidence is carried off them, 
    and laid on Christ alone. Both of these are aimed at in the text. I will now 
    speak a word to the first, namely, external things. And,</p>
<p align="justify">I. I will touch at those things which the saints always 
    suffer the loss of in affection, and often in action, for Christ. They must 
    lay their account,</p>
<p align="justify">1. With the loss of their credit, esteem, and reputation. 
    "We are fools," says the apostle, "for Christ's sake." None can be wise to 
    the Lord, who are not content to be the world's fools. None will go to 
    Heaven but their reputation will run a risk sometime or other. The worldly 
    wise will look upon them as a company of weak men, and the wicked will be 
    ready to count them madmen. Nay, they may lay their account with their 
    credit getting a jog, even among professors also.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The loss of their worldly goods, Hebrews 10:34. When 
    Joseph is flying from the temptation, the devil takes hold of the mantle of 
    worldly substance, and they must either leave Christ, or they shall not know 
    how to live in the world.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The loss of ease and quiet. Sometimes they sit every 
    one under his vine, each at his own table and fireside, but when 
    persecutions arise they may be hunted as partridges, and not have where to 
    lay their heads.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The loss of outward comforts and conveniences. The 
    saints have often got caves for their houses, been exposed to the want of 
    all things, to hunger, thrist, nakedness, with no certain dwelling-place.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The loss of their relations. Husbands dragged from 
    their wives, and wives from their husbands. In such cases they lose liberty, 
    and suffer confinement, imprisonment or banishment. Racks, tortures, and 
    scourges, are inflicted upon them, and these often terminate in the loss of 
    their lives, and even after death their bones are not allowed to rest in 
    their graves. Now let us inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">II. What it is to suffer these things for Christ. It is 
    to suffer them for Christ's sake. The saints get pardon, peace, and every 
    blessing from God, for Christ's sake; and they must take stripes and blows 
    from the hands of men. But more of this, when God gives another opportunity.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>

<p align="justify"><font color="#FF0000"><b>PART IV.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">November, 2, 1712.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">PHILIPPIANS 3:8, "For whom I have suffered the loss of 
    all things."</p>
<p align="justify">THE last Lord's day, I told you several things, with the 
    loss of which the saints might lay their accounts for Christ. There is one 
    thing, which, from experience, we are taught they may lay their account to 
    lose, namely, the countenance and protection of the civil magistrate in 
    their duty. This is in itself a great loss. And seeing God has promised to a 
    church, when he is well pleased with her, "that kings shall be her nursing 
    fathers, and their queens her nursing mothers;" the withdrawing of it must 
    be a sign of the Lord's displeasure. Yes, and if we trace the sins of rulers 
    that bear hard on the people to their first spring, we will find that it is 
    some quarrel that God has with the people, 2 Samuel 24:1. This should humble 
    us, and stir us up to pray for them, and be dutiful to them, to whom the 
    Lord has said, "you are gods," in everything that is not inconsistent with 
    your duty to God himself. But this is a trial to us, whether we will regard 
    God or man most; and the saints will ever prefer the countenance of the 
    Lord, to the countenance of the highest powers on earth; and depend upon his 
    protection alone, when they are deprived of all other.</p>
<p align="justify">I told you, likewise, what it is to suffer the loss of 
    anything for Christ. I said, 1. It is to suffer for Christ's sake. 2. For 
    the truths, the ways, and the cause of Christ. I will now add,</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is to suffer upon Christ's call to suffering. We 
    are not to cast ourselves into suffering, even for a good cause, at random. 
    We are not lords of ourselves, and therefore must not throw away our peace, 
    goods, liberty, or life, but when God calls for them, and when that is the 
    case, then all should be at his service. Now God calls us to it, when it is 
    brought to that, to suffer or sin. "We must choose rather to suffer 
    affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin, which 
    are but for a season." If people cannot get over the waters of suffering but 
    in the devil's boat, which is always a sieve to sink a good conscience, 
    though it may save men's persons and goods, they must even be content to 
    swim. If the cross lie just in the way of duty, and there be no way of 
    getting by it, but by going out of the way, we must even take it up and be 
    going.</p>
<p align="justify">4. To suffer for the love of Christ. "Many waters cannot 
    quench love, neither can the floods drown it." This is more than merely to 
    suffer for his sake. Many a man, in time of the church's trouble, gets a 
    blow for Christ's sake, that deserves it not at the enemy's hand; for, at 
    the bottom, they are even men of their own party, the seed of the serpent, 
    though found among Christ's doves; mere hypocrites, they sutfer not for 
    Christ, seeing it is not for love to him, of which they are void. A Roman 
    spirit may outbrave death itself; a rugged, opposing spirit may put men to 
    suffer the hardest things, rather than yield. Yes, self is such a salamander 
    as can live in fire, for a good cause. Though we give our bodies to be 
    burned, and have not charity, it profits us nothing. But the hearts of 
    honest sufferers are hardened against opposition of men, by soft love to the 
    Lord himself; to his work, cause, and truths, for his own sake. "You, Lord, 
    have given a banner to them that fear you, that it may be displayed because 
    of the truth."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is to suffer as a member of the body of 
    Christ. "If any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let 
    him glorify God on this behalf." There was a measure of sufferings laid out 
    for Christ personal, and he alone did bear them: "He endured the cross." But 
    there is a measure of sufferings for Christ mystical, which is divided among 
    the members of Christ, as their head sees meet, and every one must take 
    their share; and thus "fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of 
    Christ in their flesh; for his body's sake, which is the church." Some must 
    give in of their goods, some their liberty, some their blood, to fill up 
    this measure. And thus they suffer, that suffer for Christ. I come now to 
    the</p>
<p align="justify">III. Thing, Why the Lord trysts his people with suffering 
    the loss of all things for him.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because there are no things which they can long guide 
    well, and he will not permit them to destroy themselves with them. The 
    father gives his child a knife in the sheath, to divert himself with it; but 
    within a little, the child draws out the knife, and plays with it. "Go," 
    says the father, "take it from him, for he will hurt himself with it." So 
    God gives his people ease, peace, and wealth; and so long as these are 
    swallowed up with them in the love of God, they can do them no harm; but 
    alas! they often childishly throw aside the love of the Lord, and solace 
    themselves with the bare worldly enjoyments, and love to these things gets 
    uppermost in their hearts; then comes the word from the Lord, Take them from 
    them. Such a man has made a pillow of security of such a thing, he is 
    sleeping upon it, and minds not his work: go, draw the pillow from under his 
    head, that he sleep not to death upon it. It is no wonder to see wasters 
    want. We have bad long peace in the enjoyment of ordinances. God removes 
    that peace, that he may make us thankful of the crumbs which sometimes fall 
    from our tables. Then the word of the Lord becomes precious, when there is 
    no open vision.</p>
<p align="justify">2. To exercise and quicken their graces, to make them 
    thrive the better inwardly. "By this, therefore, shall the iniquity of Jacob 
    be purged; and this is all the fruit, to take away their sin." The 
    Christian, like the palm-tree, the more he is afflicted, the more he grows. 
    The fire burns hottest in a cold frost, and the wind of persecution makes 
    grace to flame, and blows away the ashes. The waters of affliction cast on 
    the faces of fainting Christians has often made them recover. And sure this 
    generation needs such an awakening. Sufferings tend to the conviction of 
    men, Jeremiah 2:23, 35. Solomon tells us, "that oppression makes a wise man 
    mad;" and a greater than he lets us see it will make a mad man wise, as in 
    the case of the prodigal, Luke 15:17. No doubt, sufferings will make all of 
    us see faults in our way, which we had no will to acknowledge in our 
    prosperity. Sufferings also make sin bitter. "Your own wickedness shall 
    correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you; know therefore, and 
    see, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that you have forsaken the Lord 
    your God." Sin is like Ezekiel's roll, sweet in the mouth, but bitter in the 
    belly. When the Lord writes the sin in the punishment, the smart of the 
    wound will make sin bitter. It will then be as gall and wormwood on the 
    breasts, to wean the child. They are also a hedge in the sinner's way, Hosea 
    2:6. Many are riding post away from the Lord, until the cross meet them, as 
    the angel did Balaam, and makes them stand. And truly, if the Lord did not 
    so with us, where would we be in a little time. It is God's goodness to the 
    Church of Scotland, that he does not allow her to have a long time in 
    sinning, but takes her quickly, when she is going away from him. Afflictions 
    also stir up the saints to take hold of a departing God, Hosea 2:7. 
    Sufferings are the devil's wedges, driven to separate the saints from 
    Christ. But God makes them cords to draw them to him, and make them cleave 
    to him with purpose of heart, as the child cleaves to the nurse the more 
    that one offers to pluck it from her.</p>
<p align="justify">3. To learn them to live by faith. "I will also leave in 
    the midst of you an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the 
    name of the Lord." There is never so much glory given to God in believing, 
    as in a suffering time; the promises of the covenant never smell so sweet as 
    then. Nay, there are many promises in the Bible, of which the saints never 
    taste the sweetness until then. While their worldly enjoyments stand entire 
    about them, they live much by sense. While they live at ease in their own 
    houses, the shelter that is in that promise, "Lord, you have been our 
    dwelling-place in all ages," is not so sweet as when they have nothing else 
    to depend upon. The daily bread in the promise is not so sweet when we have 
    plenty, as when we are in needy circumstances.</p>
<p align="justify">4. To be a real testimony before the world of the 
    superlative excellency of Christ, and the reality of religion. While the 
    world sees men whom they cannot deny to be otherwise wise and sober, and 
    having a due concern about their worldly enjoyments, yet suffer the loss of 
    all, rather than part with Christ and his way, it must needs leave a 
    conviction on their consciences of these things. While they see this, it is 
    a testimony before them to this, that Christ's favor, and way, are better 
    than all the world; preferable to relations, goods, yes, and life itself. 
    For his favor with them weighs down the world's frowns; and the testimony of 
    their conscience, that bird within their breast, makes the sweetest of all 
    melody. This conduct of the saints under sufferings is also a testimony to 
    the life to come against an atheistic generation. What do they fear, that 
    they choose suffering rather than sinning; not the wrath of him "that can 
    only kill the body," for sinning were the way to preserve it; but the wrath 
    of him "that can destroy both soul and body in Hell." What do they hope for, 
    great things in the world? No, they lose what they have, they therefore look 
    for a reward and recompense in another world. It is also a testimony to the 
    power which there is in religion, to wean the heart from the world. "Job is 
    but a dissembler," says the devil, "but put forth your hand now, and touch 
    all that he has, and he will curse you to your face." But Job makes the 
    devil a liar. There is a power in religion, which makes them suffer the loss 
    of all. It in like manner establishes this grand truth, that there is a 
    power in religion to make men live without these things, which the carnal 
    world cannot want; that there is a communication between God and the soul, 
    that can supply the want of all things. God will let his people see he can 
    make them live very well without these things, and he will let the world see 
    it too, John 14:19.</p>
<p align="justify">5. It is to make them long for Heaven, and so to prepare 
    them for a place among them that stand at his right hand. If they were not 
    so harshly entertained in the world, they would not so much long to be home. 
    But the rugged way which they find in the wilderness makes them long to see 
    the land of Canaan. While the sea of this world is calm to the people of 
    God, they are in hazard of saying, "It is good for us to be here." Therefore 
    the Lord raises a storm, the ship is tossed to and fro, then they long to be 
    on shore in Immanuel's land.</p>
<p align="justify">6. That what they get, they may the better see from what 
    a blessed hand it comes. God loves to have his people know that they are in 
    his common for what they have in a world. When men have all at hand, they do 
    not so well understand their holding; therefore he calls in his own benefits 
    sometimes, to keep them from hand to mouth; and make them many errands to 
    the throne of grace, that what they had before in a more ordinary way, may 
    come to them as an answer of prayer.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of information. It lets us see,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That no man is a saint indeed, but he to whom Christ 
    is dearer than what is dearest to him in the world, Luke 14:26. Every child 
    of God is a martyr either in action or affection. Grace, when it comes into 
    the heart, so loosens all worldly things at the root, that if ever it come 
    to that, that the man must either lose Christ, or lose all, he will suffer 
    rather the loss of all things.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That Christ has not his due esteem in the heart, where 
    the man can by no means suffer the loss of all for him. The shifting of the 
    cross, by sinning against the Lord, however it may prevail sometimes on the 
    saints, if it be a man's habitual practice, will prove him to be none of 
    his, for it says that the love of the world is predominant in such a person.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of exhortation. Let me exhort you then to be ready 
    to evidence your esteem of Christ, by suffering the loss of all things for 
    him, when he calls you to it. Be not offended at the cross of Christ, but 
    embrace it. And be not choosens of the cross. Some will be willing to part 
    with such a thing for Christ, but there is another they cannot part with. 
    But you must make no reserve. Alas! that this exhortation is so very 
    seasonable. The half hour's silence in the Heaven of this Church seems to be 
    at an end. The plough that made such deep furrows on the back of this Church 
    formerly, stands now yoked again; the cords of it, which the Lord cut, are 
    knit again, and how soon the word may be given to drive on, we know not. But 
    if it were once set a-going, it is very like it may make deeper furrows on 
    the back of the Church of Scotland than ever it yet made since her youth, 
    though we hope it shall be loosed sooner. Idolatrous papists and 
    superstitions bigots make furious drivel. "Let us contend for the faith once 
    delivered unto the saints," and cleave to that purity of doctrine, worship, 
    discipline, and government, to which this Church has by the mercy of God 
    attained; to which she stands engaged by the covenants; and which has been 
    handed down to us, sealed with the blood of many martyrs. "Let us stand fast 
    in the liberty with which Christ has made us free." Let our esteem of 
    Christ, his truths, ways and work, be displayed in our suffering the loss of 
    all things, rather than give up with them.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. We will betray Christ's cause, if we shift his 
    cross. And woe be to that man who does this. It is impossible in the way of 
    God's dispensation laid down in the Scripture, that the church should 
    continue in the world without sufferings. "For we must through much 
    tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. Yes, and all that will live godly 
    in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution." Do we think that ever the seed 
    of the woman and the seed of the serpent will be at peace? that ever the 
    ship of the church will get to the haven, without the devil's raising a 
    storm to sink her? Where had Christianity been this day, if the primitive 
    Christians had complied with their pagan persecutors, and refused to suffer? 
    Where had the Protestant religion been, if bloody cruelties could have 
    frightened our ancestors into popery? And where had our Church been this 
    day, if the fining, imprisoning, banishing, executing of the opposers of 
    abjured prelacy, had frightened all into a tame compliance with the course 
    of defection then carried on. So that whoever shall choose to sin rather 
    than suffer, will for his part give Christ and his work freedom to depart 
    out of our coasts.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Consider the danger of apostasy from the good ways of 
    the Lord, because of the cross. "If any man draw back," says God, "my soul 
    shall have no pleasure in him." This makes men unsavory salt, withered 
    branches, and ordinarily ends in the candle of their life going out with a 
    stink: either going off in fearful stupidity, or horror. "Hold fast, then, 
    the form of sound words as you have been taught" for many years, and however 
    you may be afterwards trysted, let it appear that you have not heard nor 
    professed in vain. And though grievous wolves enter among you, let it be 
    seen that you are Christ's sheep that discern his voice, and that will not 
    refuse even his fire mark, rather than to be marked for another.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Consider that whatever Christ shall mark out for his, 
    among the things you have, whenever he has said, give up with it for me, it 
    will not be worth the keeping longer. For what? It will be like the manna, 
    which the people kept until the morning, against the express command of God, 
    which stank and bred worms. The plague of God will be in it, and it will 
    never after do you good. "It is a snare to the man who devours that which is 
    holy, and after vows to make inquiry." If Christ shall say, Man, give up 
    with your ease, goods, liberty, life, for me; you had better be harassed, 
    tossed and stripped of your substance, than be at ease in your own house, 
    amidst all your enjoyments. Nothing in the world can be more to us than what 
    God makes it be. We can get no good of what we have, but what goodness God 
    puts in it. But in this the substance is out of it. An evil conscience will 
    put a sting in it, and either silently or violently suck the sap out of it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. What is lost for Christ will be the surest and best 
    laid out thing in your possession. It is good lending to the Lord. You will 
    have his bond for it. "And every one that has forsaken houses, or brethren, 
    or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my 
    name's sake, shall receive an hundred-fold, and shall inherit eternal life." 
    See here the interest secured, and that is a very extraordinary interest, an 
    hundred for one. That is peace of conscience, joy in the Holy Spirit, sweet 
    contentment, with anything that is left, and a blessing in it. A little for 
    present support, served up in the dish of a promise and a particular 
    providence, which you will see as if you saw the face of God; which is an 
    hundred-fold better than anything lost for him. See also the principal 
    secured, but exchanged into eternal life, in Heaven.</p>

<p align="justify">November 9, 1712.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">PHILIPPIANS 3:8, "For whom I have suffered the loss of 
    all things."</p>
<p align="justify">NOW, let me urge, by a few motives, that you be not 
    choosers of the cross, but let all without reserve be at his service.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. Absolute resignation of ourselves to the will 
    of the Lord is necessary to evidence our sincerity. There is no reality 
    where there is any reserve, for where Christ has the chief room in the 
    heart, everything will give place to him, Acts 20:24. The will must be the 
    first sufferer, if ever a man suffer to purpose. It must be melted down into 
    a universal compliance with the will of God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ's standard will never be kept up in the world 
    by a company of men who have anything with which they cannot part for 
    Christ. Persecution is like a fire, that will burn on and consume, yes and 
    until it meet with something that will not burn. The wicked's malice will 
    not end, until they can go no farther.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is in some sort all one what we suffer for Christ; 
    for in our own strength we cannot acceptably suffer the loss of anything for 
    him; but in his strength we are able to sustain the greatest loss, and yet 
    say, "we have all, and abound." Peter denied Christ, at the voice of a maid; 
    but when strengthened by his Master's grace, his boldness was so 
    astonishingly great, "that even the rulers took knowledge of him that ho had 
    been with Jesus." The Lord gives people strength suited to their burden. It 
    is as easy for a strong man to lift a stone weight, as for a child to lift a 
    pound.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The small things we lose for Christ, are lost indeed 
    as to divine acceptance, when not willing to part with all for him. He will 
    not be served by halves, nor according to our will, Malachi 1:13; 2 John 8.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Christ stood at no loss, as too hard for us. He 
    took the whole cup, and wrung out the dregs of it. What had become of us, 
    had Christ dealt with the Father, as we do with him? No, but he was content 
    to be the Father's servant in all, Psalm 40.</p>
<p align="justify">DIRECTIONS 1. Labor to get your hearts loosed from the 
    world. "Love not the world, neither the things of the world. If any man love 
    the world, the love of the Father is not in him." Now if you would be thus 
    loosed from the world, then let your hearts be going out more after Heaven. 
    I must put these together, for there is no parting of them. The heart will 
    never give up its hold of the world until it be to fix on Heaven. So you 
    must do with your hearts as they do with children, when they offer to take 
    one thing from them, they must do it by putting another thing in their hand. 
    Now if the heart were loosed, worldly things would fall off easily, as ripe 
    fruit from a tree; and the affections set on Heaven, fit for suffering, 
    Philippians 3:18, 19, 20.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Strive to get the coal of holy zeal blown up in your 
    spirits. A bird shall as soon fly without wings, as one suffer aright 
    without zeal for God. Zeal is an heat of the affections to Christ, his 
    cause, his truths, and way. It is properly an affection that is between 
    married persons, by which they resent the affronts put upon their 
    yoke-fellow, especially with respect to their chastity. "For I am jealous 
    over you," says Paul, "with godly jealousy," 2 Corinthians 11:2, 3. (Greek,) 
    zealous over you with zeal. And if ever there was a time for this zeal, it 
    is now, when so many are crying, let Zion be defiled, when they are setting 
    themselves to deal with our mother as with an harlot.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Study experimental religion. There is no disputing 
    against sense and feeling. Hence the unlearned, but experienced Christian 
    has stood it out, when the disputers of this world have fallen. Study to 
    keep up the power of godliness, communion with God in duties, and to feel 
    the power of truth upon your hearts. Personal holiness in men's private walk 
    is an excellent help to their keeping right in public trials.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Renew your repentance, and let there be no standing 
    quarrel between God and you. Unmortified, unrepented sin, leaves a sting in 
    the conscience, deprives us of confidence with God, and so unfits us for 
    bearing the cross.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Live by faith. "The just shall live by faith." 
    Let faith be employed to cast your burden on the Lord; the burden of your 
    duty, protection, provision, and through-bearing on Christ, and to keep in 
    your eye the promised reward, Hebrews 11:26.</p>
<p align="justify">I should now come to speak of these things of which the 
    saints suffer the loss, in point of confidence, for Christ. But I have 
    before, on the third verse, spoken of these things, internal and external, 
    with which they give up in point of confidence. I will only hint at two 
    things:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The saints suffering the loss of their sufferings for 
    Christ, in point of confidence in them. Sirs, you heard what you may be 
    obliged to lose for Christ; but I will tell you one thing more which you 
    must give up for him, when you have suffered the loss of all these; and that 
    is, all confidence in these your sufferings, or else you will lose them all 
    indeed; as when you have done, so when you have suffered, "you must say you 
    are unprofitable servants." They will perish in their sufferings, who make 
    their sufferings their confidence before the Lord. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. This has been the way of all honest sufferers, 
    Galatians 6:14; compare 2 Corinthians 11:23. See also Revelation 7:14, 15. 
    When they have lost all for him, they have renounced confidence in all, and 
    fled naked to the horns of the altar, and dared not plead for his favor for 
    their sufferings, but for the Lord's sufferings.</p>
<p align="justify">2. To plead upon sufferings for Christ is a dreadful mark 
    of a graceless sufferer, Matthew 20:12–16. It is a sign men seek themselves 
    and not the Lord in their sufferings, therefore they get their penny, the 
    credit and reputation among the saints that they were seeking, and that is 
    all.</p>
<p align="justify">3. What is the Lord obliged to us, when we have suffered 
    the loss of all? Have we done more than our duty; yes, than our interest led 
    us to? If a beggar should come in, and crave his alms as debt, because, 
    forsooth, he stood at your door, and would not go away, though a heavy rain 
    was falling on him all the time, what would you think of his plea? So it is 
    with us, if we plead the merit of our sufferings.</p>
<p align="justify">4. None of our sufferings will abide the trial of the 
    law, so that in our best performances that way there is sin to condemn us. 
    So that if God would enter into judgment with us for our sufferings, we 
    would be ruined by them. The greatest patience wants not a mixture of 
    impatience, and the strongest faith some remaining unbelief.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is our honor to suffer for Christ, and 
    considering our unworthiness and sinfulness, we may wonder if ever God honor 
    the like of us to bear his cross. And therefore such persons are deeper in 
    debt to free grace than other persons; because that they had anything to 
    lose for Christ, which many have not, and that when they had it, they had a 
    heart to part with it for him.</p>
<p align="justify">2. I would take notice of the difficulty of parting with 
    these things, in point of confidence. Such a difficulty it was to the 
    apostle, that it was a perfect suffering on his part. He had a difficulty in 
    renouncing them, but yet he did it.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is difficult, for it is above nature to do it. It 
    is harder for a man to renounce confidence in his suffering, than it is to 
    suffer; or in his duties when done, than it is to do them. The latter are 
    not beyond the power of nature, the former are, Philippians 3:3; Matthew 
    5:3. The influence of the law may bear a man out to the latter, but gospel 
    grace is necessary to the former.</p>
<p align="justify">It is contrary to nature to do it. Not only nature cannot 
    do it, but cannot but resist the doing of it. Nature bends always to the way 
    of the covenant of works, which was to depend upon the good done by the man 
    himself, and is opposite to the way of believing, which carries a man out of 
    himself to Christ. This is a suffering to a proud heart, to have its 
    beautiful feathers thus pulled down and trampled in the dust. To be obliged 
    to another for life, while it thought it had a sufficiency of its own. To be 
    at pains to do and suffer for the Lord, and after all to be obliged to 
    renounce all it has done and suffered, and betake itself to the doing and 
    suffering of another: to work for the winning of Heaven, and then to 
    overlook all as if they had done nothing. It is no evidence of acquaintance 
    with the heart, where men find nothing of this difficulty. This weed grows 
    in all men's hearts naturally, however few do sweat at the plucking it up. 
    Amen.</p>

<p align="justify">PHILIPPIANS 3:8, "And do count them but dung, that I may 
    win Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">MANY are mistaken in their first accounts, and therefore 
    throw away what they would gladly take up again, when they have made a 
    second reckoning. Such are the foolish builders, Luke 14:29. But the 
    apostle, who first counted all loss, and then parted with them for Christ, 
    upon a review counts them but dung or dog's meat, such things as are only 
    fit to be cast to the dogs: and so repents not his parting with them, but 
    takes his heart away from them all, that he may gain Christ. This was his 
    grand object in the world, to which all things behooved to yield. And 
    gaining Christ with the loss of all, counts himself a great gainer.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. It is the Christian's grand object in the 
    world, and should be the grand design of every one, to win, or gain Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">O, my brethren! what is your grand object or design in 
    the world? what is the great business which you have in view? No doubt it is 
    to win something. But what is that something which you chiefly set 
    yourselves to win? Is it to win preferment? to win an estate? a stock to 
    yourselves, and your families to live upon, after you? To win a livelihood? 
    Are these your grand objects in the world? I fear most of us rise no higher. 
    These are too mean, too groveling. I show you a more excellent way. If you 
    make not this your choice, you will be fools indeed.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I will show you what it is to win Christ, and how we 
    are to win him.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Give the reasons of the point. Let us then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what it is to win Christ, and how we are to win 
    him.</p>
<p align="justify">To win or gain Christ, is to get him to be ours. To get 
    an interest in him, and enjoy him. This we have always to seek until we come 
    to Heaven, where we will have the full enjoyment of him. This is that which 
    is the grand object of some, and should be of us all. Now this winning of 
    Christ imports, that naturally we are without Christ, Ephesians 2:12. He is 
    not ours naturally. This spiritual relation to Christ must be by the 
    sinner's consent, who must take him for Lord and Husband, and then he is 
    theirs. But all naturally are destitute of an interest in this blessed 
    treasure. It imports, also, that Christ is gain. They are great gainers that 
    get him. He is an inestimable treasure, "the treasure hidden in the field." 
    "The one pearl of great price." They are enriched forever that have him to 
    be theirs. Lose who will, they are gainers. The blind world see no beauty 
    for which he is to be desired. But it is no wonder to see the most gainful 
    bargain slighted by fools, who have a price put into their hand to get it, 
    but have no heart for it. It imports that this gain may be got. We may have 
    Christ for the winning. The treasure is hidden in the field, they may have 
    it that will dig for it. Christ is revealed and offered in the gospel. The 
    door of access to him is open. The proclamation is made, "whoever will, let 
    him take the water of life freely." It is our own fault if we want him. But 
    they that will have him must win him before they can get him. People must 
    not think to sit at ease, and wait until Heaven drop down into their months; 
    or that an interest in Christ, and the enjoyment of him, will be obtained by 
    drowsy wishes, with folded hands. No, we must lay this bargain to heart, and 
    leave no stone unturned to make it effectual; nay, in order to win him,</p>
<p align="justify">1. We must work and win as laborers do. "Work out your 
    own salvation with fear and trembling." It will cost working, and sore 
    working. What severer work, than that of those who dig in mines. "If you 
    Seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures, then shall 
    you understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God." Up 
    then, you lazy souls, if you would have a Christ; you must put your hand to 
    work; yes, your heart must be set to work. "You shall seek me and find, says 
    the Lord; when you shall search for me with all your heart." God gives 
    Christ freely; but I assure you it is to laborers, not to loiterers, that 
    gift is made. You will toil sore to win something for the body, but what are 
    you doing to win Christ?</p>
<p align="justify">2. We must fight and win as soldiers. "The kingdom of 
    Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force." If you have a 
    mind for Christ, to come even to his seat, you must fight your way to it. 
    "To him that overcomes," says he, "will I give to sit with me on my throne; 
    even as I also overcame, and as set down with my Father in his throne." 
    Whenever a soul is on the way to Christ, the alarm is sounded in Hell, and 
    if the soul will have him, it must have him in opposition to flesh and 
    blood, principalities and powers. You must fight your way through the white 
    band of the world's smiles, profits, and pleasures; and refuse to be held by 
    these silken cords, which the devil uses to keep souls from Christ; and also 
    through the black band of temptations, doubts, fears, discouragements, that 
    he will muster up against you; and, by all appearance, the red band too, so 
    that it may cost you to resist unto blood, Hebrews 12:4. Sometimes Satan 
    gets plunderings, prisons, tortures, yes, and death, set up between Christ 
    and them that would be at him; but you must fight and win, saying, in all 
    these things, "we shall be more than conquerors, through him that loved us."</p>
<p align="justify">3. We must wrestle and win, as those do who strive for 
    the mastery, Ephesians 6:12–14. There will be a combat, in which you must be 
    engaged against your own lusts, "for the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and 
    the Spirit against the flesh." If you tamely yield, truly you will never win 
    Christ. You must in his strength cast them down, get them nailed to his 
    cross, and make your way over them, to the enjoyment of himself. You must 
    cut off right hands, and pluck out right eyes, that you may win Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">4. We must run and win as racers do. "So run that you may 
    obtain." "Lay aside every weight, and the sin that does most easily beset 
    you, and run with patience the race set before you." There is a race 
    proposed by the Lord, namely, the profession of the truth, and practice of 
    holiness. The Lord Christ and his apostles opened the race, and ever since 
    that time there have been many who engaged to run that race. But as soon as 
    it was opened, the devil planted thorns on the race ground, kindled fires, 
    set up gibbets, laid misery, shame, grief, poverty, and temptations of all 
    sorts in the way. Many fell, many turned back, a great many run faintly, but 
    all go forward that win Christ. In the world, men suppose but two fixed 
    points, the highest and the lowest; the bodies between the two are in 
    continual motion. In the rational world, the glorified are in the highest 
    point, the damned in the lowest. Both fixed, neither of them can go farther. 
    We that are between the two, are in motion either to Heaven or Hell. If we 
    would win Christ, then, let us set our face heavenward, and run and win.</p>
<p align="justify">5. We must trade and win as merchants do. "The kingdom of 
    Heaven is like unto a merchantman seeking goodly pearls; who, when he had 
    found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought 
    it." And, as spiritual merchants, we must be at pains; we must exchange and 
    win, as they do. They that have a mind for Christ, have much business in the 
    royal exchange of Heaven. And you will say they win indeed, if you consider 
    what they exchange with the Lord. "A new heart also," says he, "will I give 
    you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony 
    heart out of your flesh, and will give you a heart of flesh." Christ takes 
    off their rags, and gives them his robes of righteousness. He frees them 
    from the curse, and sends them away with the blessing. You must also sell 
    and win, as merchants do. I had occasion, on another subject, to tell you 
    how you must sell all you have at the market of free grace, Mark 10:22, and 
    condescended on the particulars which you are to sell. Be sure this is a 
    gaining trade.</p>
<p align="justify">You must also buy and win, as merchants do. I find three 
    things, which the spiritual merchant, who would win Christ, is this day 
    called to buy. Precious truth. "Buy the truth, and sell it not." It can 
    never be too dear bought; whatever people may pay for it, they are gainers. 
    This is like to be a time for selling of the truth, and persons of Judas' 
    trade will never be wanting, saying, "what will you give me, and I will 
    deliver him unto you." But let men get for it what they will, they will find 
    at length that they have made a fool's bargain, and they will be losers at 
    the end of the day. "For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole 
    world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his 
    soul?" A second thing you ought to buy, is precious time. "Redeeming the 
    time," says Paul. We have had a long time of selling it, and squandering it 
    away, though we have not enriched ourselves with the price. We have allowed 
    our precious opportunities of communion with God to go for trifles. But buy 
    again now, for the days are evil. That is, as the merchant who has foolishly 
    neglected his business most of the day, plys it most eagerly when he sees 
    the market is near a close, if by any means he may make up his former loss. 
    So do you. The third thing you must buy, is the precious riches of Christ. 
    "I counsel you," says he, "to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may 
    be rich; and white clothing, that you may be clothed." His merit; that is, 
    gold able to purchase Heaven. His righteousness; clothing for your souls. 
    His Spirit; salve for your blind eyes. It is a blessed market this. You 
    cannot but be gainers. Here we are to "buy without money and without price." 
    For I hope you will not count upon renouncing your own merits, righteousness 
    and wisdom, as a price for these things. You must also export and import, as 
    merchants do. Our trade to Heaven consists much in our export to Immanuel's 
    land. And what have we to export, but the home product of guilt, weakness, 
    poverty and wants. But let us carry them all away to the Lord, we will gain 
    by it, leaving them there. We must import the products of the King's 
    country, consisting of pardons for our guilt, strength for our weakness, and 
    fullness for our wants, and then we will gain indeed. We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To give reasons of the point. It is the Christian's 
    great object to win Christ, and should be the great object of all.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because if we win Christ, we gain all. This is the 
    shortest way to make up a stock, a treasure that will enrich us forever, in 
    time and eternity. He thought so who said, "one thing have I desired of the 
    Lord; that will I seek after." So also did the wise merchant, Matthew 13:45, 
    46. He were a foolish man who would spend his time in making a great number 
    of petty bargains, by which he gained but little, and would neglect a 
    bargain that would make up for all his days, when in his offer. You are the 
    man, whose great object is not to win Christ. If you win Christ, you are 
    made up for time. "Godliness is profitable unto all things, having the 
    promise of the life that now is." What would you have for time? Would you 
    have food and clothing? win Christ, and you shall have them. With the 
    kingdom of God your great object, "all these things shall be added unto 
    you." It will be a very bad time indeed, in which Christ's spouse may not 
    promise herself food and clothing. It is not an uncertain, but sure thing: 
    "Bread shall be given her, her water shall be sure." She wants then only a 
    dwelling-place: well, "she shall dwell on high; yes, the Lord himself is her 
    dwelling-place, in all generations." But some people would have land too. 
    Then there is no such sure way to make a purchase as this, win Christ. He is 
    Lord of all the land in the world, and the whole earth is your in the right 
    of your husband, Matthew 5:5. But what will people do for money? Win Christ, 
    and you shall not want it. "The Almighty shall be your defense, and you 
    shall have plenty of silver." (Hebrew,) gold; and the silver of your 
    strength.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. Yes, says the unbeliever, these are brave 
    words, but depend upon them, and see what they will bring in to your 
    treasure, ANSWER. They are God's words, and his good words are better than 
    all the world's good deeds. God gives some persons, for whom he has no 
    special care, their portion in their hand, and sends them away; and others, 
    his dearest children, he gives them the good words of a promise, and keeps 
    them at home with himself. Say now, who has the best of it, Matthew 25:34, 
    "You blessed of my Father;" (Greek,) you to whom my Father has spoken well. 
    God's good words have always good deeds in their bosom. He will not approve 
    of those who say to the needy, "be you clothed, be you fed, but give not the 
    things that are needful for the body." And will he be found such an one 
    himself? No, no. Many of the saints have depended upon his words, and they 
    have been fed and clothed, and left their experience on record, Psalm 
    34:6–10. They have declared, that like the disciples, "they had lacked 
    nothing." The mistake of the unbeliever is, he thinks God's bond cannot be 
    paid, unless it be paid in cash, the very thing itself. No, God can make it 
    out another way, and his people can say, "as having nothing, and yet 
    possessing all things." Had Moses any reason to complain, when he wanted 
    meat forty days, when God so supported him, that he needed it not. Adam 
    lived very well at first, when the Heaven was the roof of his house, the 
    earth his floor, the grass his seat, and the shade of trees his bed-chamber. 
    He did not complain of the want of a house, when God was his God, and he was 
    so provided. Stamped leather has sometimes gone for money, and they that had 
    enough of it were even as rich as they that have the silver and gold now; 
    and if it was as good, I hope you may allow the Almighty himself to be 
    better than gold.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, you are made up for eternity. "Godliness is 
    profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life that now is, and 
    of that which is to come." Come death when it will, your lodging is taken up 
    on the other side of Jordan. You have won the Lord of the land to be your, 
    how can you be but welcome there? John 14:2. The law cannot lay anything to 
    your charge, for he has satisfied it, and you may say, "I am crucified with 
    Christ, nevertheless I live." Justice cannot apprehend you, for the debt is 
    paid and Christ has got up your discharge. When the gain of other people, 
    who are winning the world, is at an end, your gain is but in some sort 
    beginning to come in, but it is a gain that will tell out through the ages 
    of eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because if we win not Christ, we win nothing, we lose 
    all. We lose our souls, and where is our gain then? Matthew 16:26. Without 
    Christ, without hope, for he is the only way to the Father, John 14:6. The 
    wise people of the world need not boast of their winning; they are penny 
    wise and pound foolish, win what they will, seeing they win not Christ. 
    "Whatever they are winning, there is a thousand times more going to 
    destruction in the meantime. Would he be a wise man that would go abroad in 
    the harvest, and while he is winning by some little bargain, his whole crop 
    in the meantime is shaken with the wind, and rotten with the rain. That is 
    your case, O man! you are abroad winning the world, but all is going wrong 
    at home within your own soul. And when you come home to yourself, at death, 
    or otherwise, it will be sad. Whatever you are winning, is but like children 
    winning of their fellows, that will never make them rich, never buy meat nor 
    clothes to them. It is money "for that which is not bread, and labor for 
    that which satisfies not." A thousand worlds will not purchase a pardon; a 
    Heaven to you, without which you will be miserable. It is a poor trade, 
    where a man is not winning Christ. It will never bring him the one thing 
    necessary, and what winning can be there?</p>
<p align="justify">Whatever you are winning, if you would count what you 
    give out, as well as what you get in, you would find all your winning is 
    worse than nothing. Count your days, your precious time, precious 
    opportunities of grace and salvation, your precious souls laid out in 
    winning the things of the world, but not Christ; each of which is far more 
    precious than what you can win that way, and you will see you win nothing by 
    the bargain, but are great losers.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. It reproves several sorts of persons; and first, 
    those who are taken up about nothing but to win the world, utterly 
    neglecting to win Christ, and to get an interest in him. There is little 
    difference between such and the brutes. They work, and eat, and sleep; these 
    are the all of the beasts, and the all of some who are worse than the 
    beasts. They never seriously set themselves to get matters right for their 
    souls. It were their advantage that they could die as the beasts, as they 
    live like them.</p>
<p align="justify">You whose business it is to win Christ, but it is not 
    your main business. It is but a bye-hand work with you. It is the world that 
    is nearer your hearts than an interest in Christ, and the enjoyment of him. 
    You walk with God at all adventures. Assure yourselves that no man will 
    stumble upon Christ by accident, or snapper into Heaven, or fall into it by 
    guess. If you make it not your chief business, you may gain a name, but you 
    will never win Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Those who sell the truth and a good conscience, that they 
    may get the world kept. People that will sail with every wind, and keep 
    always on the side that is upmost in the world, are not in the way to win 
    Christ; "For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth." Take 
    heed to yourselves, our time is like to be an ensnaring time. You will be 
    fair to lose the world and its countenance, or to lose Christ. But be you 
    ready to let all go which you cannot hold in his own way, with his favor.</p>
<p align="justify">Those who will not stand to sell soul and conscience, to 
    win something of the world, if they can but get their hands on it. They are 
    careful for nothing but their credit, which is in hazard too, if so be they 
    can gain some little thing in the world. It seems we have such persons among 
    us, by the frequent complaints people are making of their losses that way, 
    not only by picking, but stealing. May the good Lord discover them for a 
    terror to others! O! how are people's consciences thus seared, and their 
    hearts hardened to defy that curse, that roll of curses that God has said he 
    will send into the house of the thief, Zechariah 5:4; that bill of eternal 
    exclusion from Heaven, passed against the unrighteous, 1 Corinthians 6:9, 
    10. Read their doom, Deuteronomy 29:19, 20.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. I exhort you to make it your main business in the 
    world to win Christ. Consider this is the way in which every person may win, 
    the poor as well as the rich. It is not much the most part of us can 
    rationally propose to win to ourselves in the world. It is difficult to win 
    much, unless people have a good stock, and be very diligent also. But come 
    here and win, even you that has no money.</p>
<p align="justify">You have been at pains to win something of the world. 
    Some of you have won, some of you have lost; many of you have real 
    difficulty to win your daily bread. You have tried the one, will you not do 
    so much as try the other also. Sirs, if you will not, your toil, sweat, and 
    weariness, in winning the world, will be a witness against you before the 
    Lord, that you could be at pains for other things, but at no pains for 
    Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">This is the shortest way of winning. No man will choose 
    the winning by many small bargains, when he can win all that and more by one 
    great bargain. This is the case, win Christ and you win all. In short, it is 
    a safe and sure way of winning. The best traders that ever carried on 
    merchandise have lost of some bargains; but never one was a loser here. You 
    will be sure to win if you set yourself to win Christ, and your winning will 
    be beyond your expectation.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is a durable winning that can never be lost. 
    People will be winners one year, and lose all that and more, another year; 
    win of one bargain, and lose it again of another: but win Christ once, and 
    you will never again lose your winning.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. 3. Of trial. You may see whether you be Christians 
    or not. Try what is your grand object. Is it to win Christ, or not? You may 
    know it by what follows.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. II. They whose grand object in the world is to 
    gain Christ, will count all but dung that comes in competition with this 
    bargain. For explication of this, they will count,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Nothing too much for him, but be content to have 
    Christ on any terms. They will say, "Lord, what will you have me to do." 
    Dung is a worthless thing, that nobody makes account of. They will think no 
    pains too much for him; and they that think otherwise, never saw the worth 
    of the pearl, Proverbs 2:4, 5. They will hang on about his door, and think 
    they speed well, if they be heard at length. They will count no cost too 
    much. Sometimes men have a cheap religion; but it is not to be supposed that 
    they will always get the Lord served with that which cost them nothing. It 
    is very like that God will have a costly sacrifice of the hand of these 
    nations; to which both his own people, and the enemies of religion and of 
    his work, shall be obliged to contribute both of their goods and of their 
    blood. These lands are defiled with blood. So many murderers escaping 
    unpunished; and the blood of the saints shed in these nations remains 
    unpurged, though it is like there may be more put to it, and the land may 
    get blood to drink. It nearly concerns us that God has said, "I will bring a 
    sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant." We have mixed 
    with the nations and learned of them their ways, and justly may the Lord 
    send the instruments of his vengeance from the places from which we have 
    brought the atheism and profanity of the day. But cost what it will, the 
    saints will think nothing too much, so as they win Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Cost what it will, they will not think that they are 
    even hands, but that they are gainers, if they can win Christ. Whatever be 
    laid in the balance with Christ, it is but so much dung and dross for so 
    much gold. They must lay out for Christ, lusts dear as right eyes; yes, it 
    may be also goods, liberty, and life. The carnal world cannot see how they 
    can hold their own with such trading, and therefore will trade no such way. 
    But he whose grand object is to win Christ, considers it the most gainful 
    bargain; even a hundred-fold got in, for one given out, Matthew 19:29.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Have what they will, they will count they have 
    nothing, while they have not Christ. What avail barns, and coffers full of 
    dung, to a man? What do food and clothing, riches and honor, avail to a man 
    who sees the need and the worth of Christ? Will he not be ready to say, what 
    will you give me, if I go Christless? These things can do no more to my poor 
    soul, than dung to my body. Could the soul dwell and feed with the swine, 
    they would have enough, while they have dog's meat. This says, few make it 
    their grand object to win Christ, seeing so many can live and reign as kings 
    without him; and give them the world and their lusts, and they have the 
    desire of their hearts.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Win what they will, they will count they win nothing, 
    if they win not Christ. It is but dung they can win that way. The world 
    thinks godly people fools, while they care not for winning, as they do. But 
    see the world's fool's, while they lose so egregiously, yet count themselves 
    gainers. Achan was no gainer, when he brought into his tent a wedge of gold, 
    and a weight of wrath far heavier than the wedge. That meat is but dog's 
    meat, that has a bone in it to stick in the throat of the eater. The open 
    fields are better than a house in which brimstone is scattered on the 
    habitation. Wealth, with the want of God's favor, is but dung in comparison 
    of want, with God's good will. I am afraid there are but few who count this 
    way.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Be about them what will, if Christ be not in them, 
    they will count themselves loathsome with it all, like persons that have 
    nothing but dung about them, Job 9:31; therefore they count wicked men vile 
    men, Psalm 15:4. Rags, with righteousness, are more desirable to them than 
    robes and mirthful apparel, where there is a naked soul. What is a throne 
    for the body but dung, while Christ has not the throne of the heart; or 
    riches, while men are not rich toward God.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Be in their way what will, to hinder them from Christ, 
    they will shovel it out of their way as dung, rather than be kept back from 
    Christ, Song 8:6. 7. Him they cannot want, him they must have. "Cast you up, 
    cast you up, prepare the way; take up the stumbling-block out of the way of 
    my people." They must be at Zion; and if they should cut their way through 
    rocks and over mountains, they must be there; if a Red Sea were before them, 
    it shall not stop them. O! how easily are the most of us kept back from 
    Christ! Little thing will stand between him and us, which we will be as 
    loathe to cast out of our way, as if it were gold.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, If they cannot shovel it out of their way, they 
    will tread and trample on it as dung, that they may win Christ. "Thus Levi 
    said unto his father, and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he 
    acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children; for they have observed 
    your word, and kept your covenant." The street of the New Jerusalem is laid 
    with gold, for the citizens thereof will tread on gold, and on what is most 
    valuable in the world, that they may get forward to God. If waters be in 
    their way, they will pass through them; and if fires, they will walk over 
    them, and therefore all the travelers to Zion "have their feet shod with the 
    preparation of the gospel of peace."</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of information. This lets us see that there are 
    few in the world whose grand object is to win Christ; so far are they from 
    counting that dung which comes in competition with Christ. Nay, instead of 
    that, people are worshiping dung gods, so the original calls idols. The gods 
    of many are no other than gods coming out of the earth. It is the earth, and 
    what is in it, that has most of their hearts. The belly is the God of many, 
    the world of others, for covetousness is idolatry; yes, who is the God of 
    this world, but the devil, Beelzebub; that is, the God of dung, (Syriac.)</p>
<p align="justify">They are also wallowing in the mire of profanity, 2 Peter 
    2:22. Mire, the word properly signifies the dung that is carried out of 
    stables in which swine wallow. And what are these profane courses, but that 
    which comes out of the vile stable of an unrenewed heart, Mark 7:21. And 
    alas! many washed swine are found there, who sometimes appeared another 
    thing than they are now.</p>
<p align="justify">They are loading themselves with the thick clay of the 
    world, Habakkuk 2:6. Taking a complete burden of the world, pressing them so 
    that they cannot get up their heads toward Heaven. Surely these count not 
    the world dung, or less of it would serve them. The cares of it stretch 
    their minds like tenter hooks, and are Satan's cords binding them down to 
    the earth, that they cannot lift up their souls to the Lord. Thus the houses 
    of many are but dunghills, where all is for the world, nothing for God and 
    themselves, but dung to fatten the earth, not to help to replenish Heaven. 
    Dust is their meat, for they are the serpent's seed, Isaiah 65:25. That is 
    to say, they fetch their satisfaction from their lusts, they cannot rejoice 
    in God, nor in the ways of holiness. These things are tasteless to them, and 
    nothing relishes with them, but the husks of sin, which the swine of the 
    world eat.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, The worship of many is but dung and loathsome. 
    God says to the in, "I will spread dung on your faces, even the dung of your 
    solemn feasts." There is nothing of spirit in their worship. It is but a 
    loathsome carcass of bodily exercise, which is good for nothing but to be 
    cast out. They may value it themselves, for sometimes dung was valued 
    highly, when "a fourth part of a cab of it was sold for five pieces of 
    silver," but God abhors it. There was a gate in Jerusalem called the 
    dung-gate, Nehemiah 2:13. Such may be in the church, but they will be 
    carried out at the dung-port by death, or otherwise; and see their end, 
    "they shall perish forever, like their own dung; they who have seen them 
    shall say, where are they?"</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Evidence yourselves true Christians, by counting 
    thus. There are three parts of counting, which the carnal world cannot 
    learn, but Christians learn them at the school of Christ:</p>
<p align="justify">1. Counting days. "So teach us," says Moses, "to number 
    our days, that we may apply our hearts to wisdom." The carnal, when they 
    begin to count their time, they number by years, and many years, Luke 12:19; 
    and hence they always fool away the present time. But the Christian will 
    count by days, and these few days short and uncertain, Genesis 47:9; and "so 
    apply their hearts unto wisdom."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Counting afflictions and trials to be gainful. The 
    carnal world can make nothing of these that is desirable, but the total of 
    them is still grief, sorrow, and loss; they cannot see how to make more of 
    them. But the godly are taught to count them light, momentary, and gainful; 
    yes, "as working for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." 
    They count them all joy, and that they are happy that endure them, James 
    1:2, and 5:11.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Counting things of this world, in competition with 
    Christ, to their true value. The world is ever completely wrong in this 
    counting. Here they count their mites to talents; and instead of fifty, set 
    down an hundred. They count them ever above their worth, better than Christ 
    and his favor. But Christians have learned to count them at another rate, 
    all loss and dung for Christ; and I would have you count so. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. How God accounts of them. The verdict of the Spirit 
    concerning all is, "vanity of vanity, all is vanity." "Riches are that which 
    is not." Agrippa's great pomp is, in the language of the Holy Spirit, much 
    fancy, (Greek,) Acts 25:23. God is no acceptor of persons. None of these 
    things commend us to God, more than if we were naked and bare; the judgment 
    of God is according to truth. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. How you will account of them when you are going into 
    another world, and when you are there. When death stares you in the face, 
    and gives you a warning away from all you possess, what will you think of 
    them then? When you are in another world, and standing before the 
    judgment-seat of Christ, whether will grace or gold, robes or righteousness, 
    Christ or the world, be of greatest value in your eyes?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Consider you will never honor Christ, and if so, he 
    will never honor you. You will never honor him in your hearts, while you 
    prefer everything to him; nor in your lives, by doing much, or suffering for 
    his cause. A man that counts not thus, is not fit for such a time as this, 
    in which God seems to be about to put it to the trial, what men think of the 
    world, in comparison of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Labor then to get a view of the glory, riches, and 
    excellency of Christ, and then you will count all things but dung for him. 
    If men knew the worth of Christ, they would think nothing too much for him.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE III. They are truly winners, lose what they 
    will, that gain Christ. To confirm this point, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">What he is in himself. He is God, and so if he be yours, 
    God is yours, for he is God; the Son of God begotten by the Father, by an 
    eternal unspeakable generation, so that he has life in himself. He is man, 
    God-man, fairer than the children of men. The human nature is united to the 
    divine in the person of the Son, and so lies at the fountain head, as the 
    bowl in Zechariah's candlestick.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Consider what he is to us:</p>
<p align="justify">1. Winning Christ, we gain a ransom for our souls. "He 
    gave himself for us, to redeem us from all iniquity." If one were a slave to 
    the Turks, what matter what he lost, if he gained a ransom for himself. We 
    are debtors to justice, criminals in law, prisoners of Satan, bound over to 
    the wrath of God by nature. Now the soul's redemption is precious. If we 
    could gain the whole world, that could not ransom us, Hosea 13:14; Job 
    33:24.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Winning Christ, we gain a purchase. He not only 
    ransoms us from the wrath of God, but purchases Heaven to us. He gives us 
    gold tried in the fire, to enrich us. If Christ be your, he communicates his 
    merit to you for your justification, and title to eternal life; so that it 
    is a righteous thing for you to get Heaven, 2 Thessalonians 1:6, 7.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Winning Christ, we gain a treasure; the treasure 
    hidden in the field. Consider that whatever you can lose for Christ, if you 
    win him, you win a treasure, when you lose but some small mite for it. 
    Christ is a treasure for preciousness, everything in Christ is precious. 
    When Solomon counted all that was in the world, he sets down the total in 
    two great ciphers, vanity and vexation. And is this the prize for our sweat 
    and cares? Why so eager on vanity, so foud of vexation. But all in Christ is 
    precious. Is not grace, pardon, peace, precious? They were purchased with 
    his precious blood, 1 Peter 1:19; they are wrapped up in precious promises, 
    2 Peter 1:4. O precious promises! where happiness is enrapt up in words and 
    syllables. Eternity couched in a sentence! an eternal weight of glory in a 
    word! Christ is also a treasure, for variety and abundance of precious 
    things. The treasure of worldly things is soon counted. We have the 
    inventory of it, consisting but of these three things, "the lust of the eye, 
    the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life." But it "has pleased the 
    Father, that in Christ should all fullness dwell." "Eye has not seen, nor 
    ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man to conceive, the 
    things which God has laid up for them that love him." I will only tell you 
    of the following things in it. The whole constellation of graces, each more 
    precious than gold, of more worth than a world. The whole privileges of the 
    saints: an eternal weight of glory. Finally, the whole Trinity. Christ is 
    also a treasure in respect of secrecy. hidden to the unrenewed world, and 
    even to believers in a great measure. "It does not yet appear what we shall 
    be; but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we 
    shall see him as he is." But even in glory, they will never see to the end 
    of it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Winning Christ, we gain that which will turn 
    everything to our advantage. "All things shall work together for our good." 
    This is the stone that turns all to gold. If we be in Christ, death shall be 
    profitable to us as an inlet to eternal bliss; the grave, a place of rest, 
    as God's field, where the seed sown shall spring up with increase; the wind 
    of afflictions shall drive us more speedily to our harbor; our crosses shall 
    be for crucifying our lusts; our losses shall be our gain to bring an 
    hundred-fold. Thus, in a word, all things shall work for our good.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Winning Christ, we gain an heirship. We "become heirs 
    of God, and joint heirs with Christ." More by far, than if we were heirs of 
    the greatest monarch on earth. By this you will be heirs of the promises, 
    young heirs of glory. Attended by angels, and duly provided for while in 
    your minority, and at length admitted to your inheritance. Yes, all is 
    yours.</p>
<p align="justify">6. There is nothing, then, which we have to lose for 
    Christ, that is worthy to be laid in the balance with him. The loss is 
    infinitely made up in him. What are our worldly goods, in comparison of the 
    goodness laid up for those that are in Christ. May not the relation to 
    Christ and his Father make up all the loss of other relations? The glorious 
    liberty of the sons of God, make up the loss of our liberty in the world; 
    and an eternal life, our natural life.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is below the honor of God to let sinners be 
    losers at his hand. He will not be behind with his creatures. They shall 
    have good measure, pressed down and running over. "But now they desire a 
    better country, that is, an heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be 
    called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of information. The worldly man is penny wise and 
    pound foolish. "He strains at a guat and swallows a camel." He will be loath 
    to lose a sixpence, but he can let a talent of glory slip through his 
    fingers. He watches a little gilded earth, lays it up securely, holds it 
    fast in his hand, nay, in his heart; but he can let a crown, a kingdom, a 
    Heaven, a Christ go. Though it is difficult to beguile him in other things, 
    he will be cheated out of these for a trifle, like a child. Esau was a 
    cunning man, yet he was as easily cheated of the blessing as if he had been 
    a fool or idiot.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In a time of giving out for Christ, they are not the 
    greatest gainers that lose nothing for him. When the trial is over, and 
    every one counts their winning, the greatest losers will be found the 
    greatest gainers. The greatest outgiving has the greatest income, as in the 
    parable of the talents. Alas! what is the winning of others, but that they 
    have saved the shoe, but lost the foot; saved the cabinet, but lost the 
    jewel; saved the body, but lost the soul; the world is gained, Christ is 
    lost.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of exhortation. "Buy the truth, and sell it not." 
    Win Christ at any rate, lose him at no rate. Remember you cannot make too 
    dear a purchase in this point. There are three cases in which I would have 
    you to walk by this principle,</p>
<p align="justify">1. When sin comes to you, like Potiphar's wife to Joseph, 
    and offers you deadly poison in a golden dish. Now Christ and a lust are in 
    competition. Now here is a goodly price offered you for the Lord's favor and 
    countenance; but sell it not, for all you can make by it will not clear the 
    cost, but it will be bitterness in the end. Now you must have him at the 
    rate of plucking out a right eye, yet buy the truth, assure yourself it is 
    cheap enough of all.</p>
<p align="justify">2. When sloth comes to you, as Peter to Christ, covering 
    a sharp sword with words softer than oil, saying, "Master, spare yourself," 
    what needs all this trouble about religion? What needs such bitter 
    repenting, wrestling in prayer, watching over heart and life? What needs 
    this exposing yourself for a sermon? Now sloth and Christ are come in 
    competition. Here is a goodly price for Christ, a sound sleep on the 
    sinner's soft bed, a way strewed with roses, pleasant carnal company, and a 
    warm fireside; but sell it not so cheap: all that is not worth one smile of 
    his face: nay, of one check from him. Take him, though at the rate of the 
    most exquisite diligence, the most painful exercise, most difficult and 
    grating to the flesh, and cheap enough.</p>
<p align="justify">3. When the enemies of Christ and his work come to you, 
    as the chief priests to Judas, offering you thirty pieces if you will betray 
    him; and when you are put to loss in his cause, say, like Judas to the 
    honest woman that bestowed a box of ointment on Christ, "What needs all this 
    waste?" Now Christ and the world are in competition. Here is a goodly price 
    for Christ. You may keep what you have, and also get more; you shall get the 
    world's smiles, if you will venture on his frowns. Let them guide God's 
    house as they will, and you shall dwell in ceiled houses. Take the mark of 
    the beast in your foreheads, or in your hands, and you shall obtain leave to 
    buy and sell. But sell him not. The world's offer is not worth the hearing; 
    it is but dung for gold, counters for pearls. But in such a case you cannot 
    have him, but at the expense of the world's countenance, loss of means, and 
    perhaps liberty and life itself, but he cannot be too dear bought.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE. You will get all in Christ that you are seeking 
    to win in the world, and more. If you would have a name, you shall get one, 
    better than that of sons and daughters. Would you have honor? you shall have 
    it. "Him that honors me," says God, "I will honor." Would you have gold? you 
    shall have it. The very streets of Heaven are paved with gold. Amen.</p>

<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">PHILIPPIANS 3:9, "And be found in him."</p>
<p align="justify">HERE is another thing which the apostle has in his eye, 
    namely, to be found in Christ. This supposes that they who win Christ are in 
    him, united to him, and that they who are united to him will be found in 
    him, when God searches for them. Having before handled the doctrine of union 
    with Christ, I shall only speak to this.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. It should be men's great care, to provide that 
    when God comes to search, they may be found in Christ. Here I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show how, or when God comes to search, and the saints 
    are found in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">II. How and where they shall be found, that are found in 
    Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Give the reasons of the point, and then subjoin some 
    improvement. I am then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show how or when God comes to search, and the 
    saints are found in Christ. This world is a confused heap, and many times 
    the counterfeits are found among the jewels, undiscerned; but God has 
    searching times, in which he will search out men. "I will," says he, "search 
    Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled in their lees, 
    that say in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will he do 
    evil."</p>
<p align="justify">1. One searching time is, a time of plain searching, 
    preaching of the word. The word is God's candle, which he kindles to let men 
    see through their state and condition. "The Word of God is quick and 
    powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing 
    asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner 
    of the thoughts and intents of the heart." God carries this candle through 
    the man's spirit, and searches him thoroughly. Thus Paul tells us, that by 
    such searching preaching "even an unbeliever, or unlearned man, is convinced 
    of all, he is judged of all; and thus are the secrets of his heart made 
    manifest; and so, falling on his face, he will worship God, and report that 
    God is in you of a truth." Now the false wares of the hypocrite appear 
    naught, the mask is drawn off between God and their own consciences, Malachi 
    3:1–3. But then the believer is found in Christ, for the word is never an 
    enemy to the grace of the Spirit, "for he who does truth, comes to the 
    light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God."</p>
<p align="justify">2. A time of temptation is a searching time. This is a 
    sieve which Satan is allowed to manage for the discovery of the true grain. 
    "Satan," said our Lord, to Peter, "has desired to have you, that he might 
    sift you as wheat. Sometimes Satan is, as it were, let loose, and 
    temptations abound, iniquity is established by law, and then good and bad 
    are put to the trial. Then the light corn and chaff appear, being driven 
    away before the wind; the world begins to wonder after the beast, stars 
    fall. Then goes the earthly, carnal-minded professor to the earth; the 
    heady, unsettled, light professor, unstable as water, falls away; the proud, 
    conceited professor appears as he is, like a tall barren tree. But then 
    saints are found in Christ, sealed and safe; "for it is impossible to 
    deceive the elect," Revelation 7:1–3.</p>
<p align="justify">3. A season of the church's trouble, and of persecution 
    for the gospel, is a searching time. A true friend is known in adversity. 
    The stony ground receives the word and holds green, until the sun of 
    persecution arise, and then it withers. When Christ rides in triumph, many 
    cry, Hosanna, who will afterwards cry, Crucify him. Many run after Christ in 
    a day of peace, that will run as fast away from him in a day of trouble. 
    This is God's sieve, with which he searches. They are brought to the waters 
    of suffering, and then bowers down go away back. But the saints are now 
    found in Christ, so that when "Israel is sifted as corn, not the least grain 
    falls to the ground."</p>
<p align="justify">4. The time of death and judgment: this is the main 
    thing, though not the only thing aimed at in the text. Possibly some may 
    escape all the former searches, but none can escape this. Now the King 
    indeed comes in to see the guests, and if there be but one hypocrite, he 
    will instantly discover him. At present the corn and chaff are mixed, but 
    then he will thoroughly purge his floor. Now foolish and wise virgins cannot 
    easily be distinguished, but then it clearly appears who are wise and who 
    are foolish. Now goats and sheep intermingle, but then they shall be forever 
    separated. Then the saints shall be found in Christ, and placed on his right 
    hand. We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show how and where they shall be found, that are 
    found in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They shall be found in him, as branches in the true 
    vine, John 15:1–6. Being thus in him, they are in no hazard of the axe of 
    God's wrath. Barren trees may, and shall be cut down for the fire; but 
    Christ mystical is a tree which the axe may not, yes, cannot approach. "I 
    the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment lest any hurt it; I will 
    keep it night and day." The pruning-knife, indeed, may come to it, to cut 
    off the twigs of corruption; but this, instead of injuring, will render it 
    more fruitful. They are in no hazard of the wind, blow from what quarter it 
    will. The wind of temptation and trouble may indeed shake, but cannot break 
    nor remove the branches that are in Christ. They may be made by a violent 
    blast to sweep the ground, but they will never be broken off.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They shall be found in a sanctuary, in a place of 
    refuge. "The Lord shall be for a sanctuary to them." They have fled to him 
    for refuge, and so shall find shelter in the worst of times. "Come, my 
    people," says he, "enter you into your chambers, and shut your doors about 
    you: hide yourself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be 
    overpast." When God came by a deluge to search the old world, he found them 
    all eating and drinking; Noah only he found in the ark, and there he was 
    safe. They who are in Christ, have laid hold on the horns of the altar: law 
    and justice cannot drag them from it. They are within the city of refuge, 
    where one drop of wrath cannot fall.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They shall be found under a covert, and in a 
    hiding-place. The man Jesus shall be to them as an hiding-place from the 
    wind, and a covert from the tempest. This is a covert of blood, the 
    Mediator's blood, under which the guilty creature may sit safely, and abide 
    the search of a holy God; for he sits there, clothed with an everlasting 
    righteousness, a white clothing, in which omniscience can see no spot. When 
    God searches for the guilty creature, but finds him here, "then he is 
    gracious to him, and says, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have 
    found a ransom." There is blood sprinkled on the door-post where this man 
    is, and therefore the destroying angel must pass by.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They shall be found in the covenant, in Christ's 
    chariot, which is a safe place, Song 3:9, 10; and so they shall be treated 
    as God's own friends, even when he comes to render vengeance to his enemies, 
    Isaiah 27:4, 5. We are now,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To give the reasons of the point.</p>
<p align="justify">1. God will search and find out every one of us, be where 
    we will. "The King will come in to see the guests." We may sit at ease a 
    while, but we must lay our account with a narrow search at last, which will 
    try what metal we are of. There is no hiding from God. "Can any hide himself 
    in secret places that I shall not see him? says the Lord: Do not I fill 
    Heaven and earth? says the Lord." Men may deceive themselves, and make a 
    figure in their own eyes, when they are naught in the sight of the Lord. 
    "But God is not, cannot be mocked." The world may be deceived, so that one 
    limb of the devil may hate another, because he is so like a saint. The 
    saints may be deceived, who may take them for full brethren, while they are 
    not father's children. What if even hypocrites deceive the devil himself, in 
    their religious fits, Jeremiah 17:9, 10; but God will find us out, "for he 
    searches the reins and hearts, and will give unto every one according to his 
    works."</p>
<p align="justify">2. If God find us, in this search, out of Christ, we are 
    undone. We have nothing to shelter us, he will draw us out of our 
    hiding-places and lurking holes; take off our mask, and spue us out of his 
    mouth. We will be put away like dross, driven as the chaff before the wind, 
    set among the goats, and separated forever to destruction. "Neither is there 
    salvation in any other: for there is none other name given under Heaven 
    among men, whereby we must be saved."</p>
<p align="justify">3. If we are found in Christ, we will be safe in time and 
    eternity, blow the storm as it may. Temptations shall not totally carry us 
    away, but we shall be born up against the stream. Troubles, though they get 
    over our heads, yet we will find him "the lifter up of our heads," and we 
    shall get safe on shore. When death comes, it shall be without its sting, 
    seeing we are found in Christ; and at the day of judgment we shall be right 
    hand men, because in him.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. Let it be your great care to be found in Christ. Our 
    time is like to be a searching time of temptation and trouble; and though it 
    should not, yet death and judgment are abiding us. What should we do to be 
    carried through? Why, if you be found in Christ, as Noah in the ark, Lot in 
    Zoar; you are in your chambers, "no evil shall befall you, nor plague come 
    near your dwelling." Let not the searching time find you at a disadvantage; 
    all those will be found so, who are in such a time,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Found in an unregenerate state, "dead in trespasses 
    and sins, and without Christ." This is a dangerous and soul-ruining case to 
    meet God in. God will find these men as Elijah found Ahab, "have you found 
    me, O! mine enemy." Two cannot walk together except they be agreed; yet they 
    may meet together, but surely there will be sad work when they meet. 
    Dreadful will the meeting be, between God and his enemies. When these meet, 
    a consuming fire and dry stubble meet; a judge and a criminal. The Judge 
    will say, "those my enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, 
    bring hither, and slay them before me."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Be not found with the sluggard, in your bed. Be not 
    secure, as God found the old world. It is like that God will set fire into 
    the nests of this generation, it were good to leave them in time, and shake 
    off security; "to have our loins girt, and lamps burning." It was a sad case 
    with Jonah, when he was drawn out of a sound sleep, and cast into a raging 
    sea. It is awful to feel calamities, are we fear they are coming.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Be not found, as death finds the wicked, in the 
    embraces of your lusts. "The wicked is driven away in his wickedness." The 
    Philistines found Samson just risen out of Delilah's lap, without his hair. 
    The soft embraces of our idols do but make way for severe strokes from the 
    hand of God. It is difficult to conceive how a man may just make but a skip 
    of it from the enjoyment of his lusts into Abraham's bosom. Nay, rather, God 
    will take these filthy garments, cover them with brimstone, and set them on 
    fire about men's ears.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Be not found, like Saul, hidden among the stuff. "Lay 
    aside every weight, and the sin that does most easily beset you." The world 
    is like a long garment, which entangles a man, and unfits him to run and 
    flee from the wrath to come. The rich man, who was thinking of nothing but 
    full barns, and goods laid up for many years, was in a sad case when God 
    found him out. Sit loose, then, to the world, if ever you would meet 
    comfortably with God in the way of his judgments, here or hereafter.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Be not found in the devil's camp, among ill 
    company. "A companion of fools shall be destroyed." Lot's sons-in-law might 
    have escaped, if they would but have left their ill company in Sodom, 
    Genesis 19:14, 15. Better go to the house of mourning, than to the house of 
    feasting; the house of trembling, than of riot. "Blessed is the man that 
    walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, 
    nor sits in the seat of the scornful." But if you would abide the search 
    here or hereafter, then be found in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Be found to be in him, united to him, by his Spirit 
    and by faith. No storm can blow down those who are built upon this rock; 
    neither will Christ lose a member of his body, in time or eternity. He is 
    the true ark and refuge, "none perish that trust in him."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Be found walking in him. "As you have therefore 
    received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him." Walking with him, before 
    him, after his example, "walking even as he also walked." This is to walk in 
    the way of holiness, "without which no man shall see the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, Be found living in him, and upon him, Galatians 
    2:20. Those that live in and by themselves will wither, when the trees 
    planted in God's house will be flourishing.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVES, to urge you to make it your main business to be 
    found in Christ, when God shall search for you in time and eternity—</p>
<p align="justify">1. If you be found in Christ, he will be found in you, so 
    shall you have a double security in a time of trial; for it is a mutual 
    indwelling, John 17:21–23. He will be found in believers, as in his own 
    house and lodging. Christ has two lodgings: one in Heaven. "He inhabits 
    eternity, and dwells in the high and holy place." He has another on earth, 
    the believer's heart. "For he dwells with him also that is of a contrite and 
    humble spirit." Christ has bought both, and he made a journey to take 
    possession of the house in Heaven for us, Hebrews 6:20; and it is our own 
    house, because it is his. "It is our house, which is from Heaven." And he 
    comes to the sinner's heart, to take possession of it for himself, and when 
    they open to him by faith, he comes in and dwells, Revelation 3:20. This 
    will be a grand security. A man will always take care of his own house, 
    especially in a storm, that the winds do not unroof it, or the rains ruin 
    it.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ will be found in you, as in his banqueting-house. 
    The Pharisees wondered that he was a guest to sinners; and the world will 
    not believe it, because they cannot see it. God's own children often say, 
    how can these things be? Will he come into such a poor house to be 
    entertained, where there is little or nothing with which to entertain him? 
    They do not consider that Christ brings the provision with him. He is such a 
    guest as Elijah was to the poor widow in a time of dearth, and feasts them 
    in a time of the greatest trouble. "In the world," says he, "you shall have 
    tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world; in me you 
    shall have peace."</p>
<p align="justify">He will be found in you, in his fortified house, as a 
    conqueror. The first thing David did, after he received the kingdom, was to 
    take the stronghold of Zion, which was so well fortified against him, that 
    they thought the blind and the lame could hold it out, 2 Samuel 5:6, 7. So 
    Christ, being anointed king, sets himself to recover the hearts of the 
    elect, held out against him as a stronghold, by a blind understanding, and a 
    lame and crooked will. "But he pulls down the strongholds, and casts down 
    imaginations;" and having brought all to obedience, he comes in to hold it 
    for himself. Now here is another security. Will he quit his conquest? No. "I 
    give unto them" says he, "eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither 
    shall any pluck them out of my hand."</p>
<p align="justify">4. His temple house, as the God of the temple. Believers 
    are his temple; as the King of Glory, he has come in, to dwell in their 
    souls forever. The soul that was a chapel for the devil, becomes the temple 
    of Christ. There are sacrifices. They offer themselves to the Lord; their 
    graces as incense, and he is the altar that sanctifies the gift. Another 
    security; they shall be under special protection. "His eyes and his heart 
    shall be on them perpetually." He will see to it, that the temple shall not 
    be polluted; and though it should be laid in rubbish in a grave, it shall be 
    gloriously rebuilt.</p>
<p align="justify">5. His garden. "I am come," says he, "into my garden, my 
    sister, my spouse." They are a garden of spices, in which the precious 
    plants of grace grow. This is another security. "He will water it every 
    moment," hedge it about and preserve them, as a man does his garden, while 
    his other fields are exposed, Jeremiah 17:5, 6.</p>
<p align="justify">6. As a child in the mother's womb. "My little children," 
    says Paul, "of whom I travail, as in birth again, until Christ be formed in 
    you." "Christ is in them the hope of glory." This is another security. The 
    mother cannot be executed in law, while she is with child, for that would be 
    the death of two, whereas her life only is exposed.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, As the soul is in the body, Christ is their very 
    life; he lives in them, Colossians 3:4; Galatians 2:20; Acts 2:25–27.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. If you be not found in Christ, you will be 
    found in a bad case in time and eternity; in a trying time in this life, and 
    in another world. You will be found as under the curse: laid open to the 
    wrath of God, as the chaff to be driven away with the wind.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FF0000"><b>PART VIII.</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">PHILIPPIANS 3:9, "Not having mine own righteousness, 
    which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ; the 
    righteousness which is of God, by faith."</p>
<p align="justify">IN these words, the apostle describes the righteousness 
    in which he desires to be found and to appear before God, and this is the 
    righteousness of Christ. It is not our own, for to our own he opposes it. It 
    is not our faith, for it is through and by faith. But it is the 
    righteousness of Christ, through the faith that has him for its object. The 
    righteousness received by faith.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. Christ's righteousness, received by faith, is 
    the sinner's only security to be depended upon before God. It is the 
    sinner's only shield, shelter and defense, from the wrath of God. Here I 
    shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what is meant by Christ's righteousness.</p>
<p align="justify">II. How it is received by faith.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Confirm the doctrine. I am,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show what is meant by Christ's righteousness, which 
    is the sinner's only shield. Righteousness is the result of obedience to the 
    law. He who satisfies the law is righteous, and this shelters from wrath. 
    The great thing that stands between God and a sinner is a broken law; and 
    while God is, it will be an effectual bar to keep sinners out of Heaven, to 
    which the sinner can never come but with the good leave of the holy law, it 
    being once satisfied. For this cause, seeing sinners could not satisfy the 
    law for themselves, Christ undertook to do it for them. Accordingly, he 
    fulfilled it, and by his fulfilling it, comes this righteousness which is 
    the believer's security. Now Christ fulfilled the law in our room,</p>
<p align="justify">1. By his active obedience to its commands; perfect 
    obedience to all the commands. This no mere man since the fall could do, yet 
    it is that without which no man can be saved. It is a debt which must be 
    paid for every one, either by themselves, or by their surety. The law says 
    to all the children of men, "If you will enter into life, keep the 
    commandments;" that is, keep them perfectly. Alas! then, must all perish? 
    No. Christ answered for his own. What they could not do, he did. Now the 
    law's demands of the sinner were very high.</p>
<p align="justify">DEMAND 1. Your nature must be absolutely pure and 
    spotless: for if the fountain be poisoned, how can the streams be wholesome. 
    "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one." Alas! the sinner 
    can never answer this. He has a corrupted nature, and he cannot purify it. 
    "Who can say I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin." He was born 
    in sin; he cannot get into his mother's belly, and be born over again 
    without sin. Well, Christ satisfies this demand for his people, the law 
    shall have all its asking; therefore the Son of God takes to himself a true 
    body and a soul, both sinless. The ancient of days becomes an infant of 
    days; he is conceived without spot, by the power of the Holy Spirit, and in 
    due time born without sin. For as he was in his life, so was he in his 
    birth, "holy, harmless, undefiled, and separated from sinners." His nature 
    was not in the least tainted, but absolutely free of the least seed of sin. 
    Here is now such a birth, such a nature as the law sought, so that demand is 
    answered, that bar in the sinner's way is taken out; but the law has other 
    demands.</p>
<p align="justify">DEMAND 2. You must give obedience to every command. Your 
    obedience must be as broad as the law. One hair's breadth lacking, you shall 
    never see Heaven. "Cursed is every one that continues not in all things 
    which are written in the book of the law, to do them." Alas! what shall the 
    sinner do with this; there are many of these commands which he does not 
    know, how shall he obey them. Many quite against his nature, as "love your 
    enemies." Many that, were his life a thousand times lying on them, and he 
    would set himself to the utmost watchfulness, he will often break; such as 
    vain thoughts, and impure desires.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ has answered this demand. "He fulfilled all 
    righteousness." "He did no sin, neither was deceit found in his month." He 
    made the law, he could not then but know every part of it; and he fulfilled 
    it in every iota. He gave external and internal obedience; obedience in 
    heart and life. Its hardest commands he opposed not; loved his enemies and 
    denied himself; not a vain word ever dropped from his mouth, nor a vain 
    thought ever entered his heart.</p>
<p align="justify">DEMAND 3. Every part of your obedience must be raised up 
    to the highest degree and pitch the law requires. "You shall love the Lord 
    your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your 
    mind." It is not enough that you be sincere, and desire to do better, and be 
    sorry you can not. Alas! the sinner can never answer this, he shall as soon 
    reach the clouds. Let him do his best, corruption holds him down, so as he 
    can never reach the top. If he be praying ever so fervently, there is always 
    some coldness in the heart. In his purest intentions, self-will insinuates 
    itself.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ answered this demand. His love to his Father was 
    more than seraphic. It was most ardent love. His love to men was 
    incomparable, and went to the utmost bound of love. "For greater love has no 
    man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends; but he laid 
    down his life for his enemies." Every one of his actions was absolutely 
    spotless and perfectly refined, without the least mixture of imperfection.</p>
<p align="justify">DEMAND 4. All this must be continued to the end, without 
    the least failure in one iota, Galatians 3:10. If you should all your days 
    live sinless, and at the hour of death a vain thought run through your mind, 
    all is gone. Alas! how impossible is this! The sinner cannot keep perfectly 
    right one year, day, hour, minute, if a thousand hells were in it.</p>
<p align="justify">But Christ satisfied this demand. "He became obedient 
    unto death, even the death of the cross." The first Adam made a fair outset, 
    but he soon halted. The second continued to the end. The law could never 
    catch him in the least sin from his cradle to his grave, by day or night, 
    alone or in company. His heart and life shone in holiness in its meridian 
    brightness, without the least cloud or spot, while his day lasted. So all 
    these bars are removed by his active obedience. He fulfilled the law also,</p>
<p align="justify">2. By his passive obedience. When all these demands are 
    answered, the law has another word with the sinner, before he can enter 
    within the gates of the city, and that is, taking sure hold of him, it says, 
    "Pay what you owe." You are in debt to the justice of God, for the sins 
    already committed. You must satisfy the threatenings of the law, and bear 
    the curse and vengeance yourself, or find a surety. O! then, "will the Lord 
    be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? 
    Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the 
    sin of my soul?" No. These are all too mean to satisfy here. But, O! you 
    crowned heads, and mighty monarchs of the world, may not you be cautioners 
    for the debt? No, they cannot, if they would sell their crowns, kingdoms, 
    and dig up all the gold in the world, and lay it down, it would not pay 
    their own debt; but they themselves must have a cautioner, or they are 
    ruined. O you mighty angels! may not you rather undertake for this debt, 
    than that your fellow-creatures should perish? They cannot. They are not 
    able. They would be bankrupt with the payment of the thousandth part, and 
    ruined forever; and it would never be paid for them. O high demands indeed! 
    that no creature in Heaven or earth can answer. Then said the Mediator, "Lo, 
    I come," Psalm 40:7. What are your demands?</p>
<p align="justify">DEMAND 1. Sinner, you must suffer, you must die the 
    death, for the word is gone out of the Lord's month, "in the day you eat 
    thereof you shall surely die." Alas! how shall this be answered? For if the 
    sinner's life go for it, what has he more? And if death once get him down, 
    it will hold him down forever. O! may not bearing crosses do it? No, the law 
    must be satisfied with bearing curses, not crosses. O! may not tears for 
    sin, bitter mourning, do it? No, it is shedding of blood, not pouring out of 
    water, that the law must have. Without this, no remission of sin. But Christ 
    satisfies this demand. It shall have all its asking. He puts himself to the 
    sword of justice. Armed death falls upon him, sheds his precious blood, 
    wounds him to the heart, separates soul and body, carries him away prisoner 
    to the grave, and he is laid in the dust of death. Death gave him the first 
    fall, but because he was God, he rises again; and death having got his due, 
    he brings away the keys of Hell and death with him, that never one of his 
    may be prisoner there.</p>
<p align="justify">DEMAND 2. Your sufferings must be universal in the whole 
    man, for so has your sinning been. That body of your, the instrument of sin, 
    must suffer. That head, that has contrived so much mischief, must be 
    wounded; that heart, that has been the spring of all, must be pierced; these 
    feet, which have carried you so often to sin, and these hands, that have 
    wrought so much iniquity, must also be pierced. And that soul of your must 
    also suffer principally, us being the chief actor of all you have done 
    against God. Ah! how shall we bear it? Who can endure this, which is a 
    thousand deaths in one? Christ satisfies this demand also. He suffers in his 
    body. His head was crowned and pierced with thorns. "His heart was melted 
    like wax in the midst of his affections." "His feet and hands were pierced." 
    "His tongue did cleave to his jaws." "His bones were all out of joint." His 
    body had nothing to cover it but shame, and his strength was dried up like a 
    potsherd. The wrath of God fell on his soul. It was troubled, sore amazed, 
    and agonized. The arrows dipped in the curse were shot against it, until the 
    law had no more to require.</p>
<p align="justify">DEMAND 3. Your sufferings must be most exquisite; you 
    shall have no pity, no sparing, but judgment without mercy, Deuteronomy 
    29:20. Ah! who can satisfy this? "Who can dwell with devouring fire?" "It is 
    a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God." Christ satisfies 
    this too. "God spares him not, but delivers him up to the death for us all." 
    Though his body was of a most refined temperature, and so his senses most 
    exquisite, his death was of the most tormenting kind. His eyes were denied 
    the light of the sun, his ears heard their cruel mockings, and he got 
    vinegar to drink. He was in travailing pangs, and soul travail. No help had 
    he in it. Men nor angels did not help him, and he died in it.</p>
<p align="justify">DEMAND 4. Your sufferings must be infinite, for it is 
    infinite justice that you have offended. Ah! who can bear this? This is 
    killing; saddest of all, a thousand times. Universal, exquisite; yet 
    infinite, ever to endure, never to end. "Who can abide with everlasting 
    burnings?" This is the Hell of hells, and beyond the reach of a creature, a 
    finite being. But Christ answers this too. He is God, therefore an infinite 
    one; so his sufferings, though not infinite in duration, yet infinite in 
    value, fully answering the demands of the law.</p>
<p align="justify">Last DEMAND. Your sufferings must be voluntary, for God 
    hates robbery for burnt-offering. If you murmur in the least, under all your 
    sufferings, it is new sin; a blemish in the sacrifice, which prevents its 
    acceptance. Ah! who can do this? The weight of wrath makes the devils and 
    the damned roar against God. A man can scarcely bear a fit of the gout or 
    gravel, or even a sharp pain of any kind, but with some impatience. But 
    Christ satisfies this too. "When he was oppressed and afflicted, he opened 
    not his mouth." In all his sufferings, he never had the least wrong thought 
    of God rising in his heart, Psalm 22:1–3. Never the least murmuring or 
    fretting. He willingly underwent what he was to suffer. He did not flee when 
    his hour came. He prayed for his enemies, his murderers, in the very 
    extremity of his sufferings, in a meek and loving manner, saying, "Father, 
    forgive them, for they know not what they do." Let us,</p>
<p align="justify">II. Show how this righteousness is received by faith. It 
    is received and becomes ours by faith, as faith unites us to Christ. Upon 
    this union, follows a communion with Christ in his righteousness; so Christ 
    being ours by faith, his righteousness is ours. The soul, by faith, marries 
    with Christ, and the righteousness is its dowry. The soul flies to Christ as 
    the city of refuge, and that righteousness is their cover. We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To confirm the doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">1. That only can shelter us from the wrath of God which 
    satisfies his law. Now this righteousness is the only thing which can 
    satisfy his law, and it has done it fully. The law is magnified more by his 
    obedience and sufferings than if all the elect had gone to Hell for it. The 
    law being obeyed, and executed upon Christ, is more magnified than it could 
    have been by them, and that because of the dignity of the person. Even as a 
    king shows a greater respect to the law, by executing it on his own son, 
    than upon a thousand common malefactors. They would have been ever 
    satisfying, but never could have fully satisfied. By Christ it gets both 
    active and passive obedience, by them only passive.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is the righteousness of God. It is so called, 
    because it is the righteousness of him who is God, Jeremiah 23:6; therefore 
    it is called, gold tried in the fire. Our gold is become dross, it will not 
    abide the touchstone of the law, because imperfect, but Christ's 
    righteousness will. Ours will not abide the fire of the judgment of the God 
    of truth. Our obedience is not full measure, and, being weighed in the 
    balance of the sanctuary, it will be found light.</p>
<p align="justify">It is the only righteousness accepted of God. "In whom," 
    says he, "I am well pleased." It may be safely depended upon, for it is of 
    infinite value. "Christ purchased the church with his own blood." It was the 
    divine nature of Christ that made all his obedience so efficacious for the 
    benefit of his people. What sins will not the blood of the Son of God purge 
    away? "It cleanses from all sin."</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is the righteousness contrived by the only wise God 
    to save sinners, when nothing else could do it, Psalm 40:6, 7. When there 
    was no help among angels or men for them, he laid help on the Mediator, as 
    one mighty to save. This was a contrivance becoming an infinite God. The 
    mercy of God shines forth in it, finding an object in the deepest misery. To 
    have given a deliverance from wrath, after millions of years, would have 
    been great mercy; but here is mercy, bringing the sinner from the lowest 
    abyss of misery unto the highest pitch of happiness. Here, also, the justice 
    of God shone gloriously. In the deluge, and the burning of Sodom, it 
    appeared, but more here. It got all its demands. What are all creatures, to 
    the Son of God suffering? The love of God was displayed. "God so loved the 
    world, that he gave his only begotten Son." The Son willingly gave himself. 
    Here is love, wonderful indeed in all its dimensions. Behold also the wisdom 
    of God. The confused mass at the beginning was not comparable to the 
    confusion at the fall. But truth met with mercy. Out of the sin that 
    obscured the glory of God, is brought the greatest honor. The matter is so 
    ordered, that man stands more firmly than under the first covenant. When the 
    angels stood astonished, Hell rejoiced at the fall. Man lay groveling in the 
    dust of misery, wisdom found out a way for restoring them to happiness.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Never entertain low thoughts of sin. It is the 
    worst of evils, which could not be remedied, but by the sufferings of 
    Christ. It brings a heavy burden on a sinner that bears his own burdens. 
    Behold it in the glass of Christ's sufferings, and you will think none of it 
    little. Sin runs counter to the nature of God, and dishonors all his 
    attributes. God is the chief good, sin the worst evil. The sinner dares 
    God's justice, presumes on his mercy, mocks his patience, challenges his 
    power, despises his love, and invades his sovereignty. So Christ behooved to 
    suffer the most extreme punishment, to honor his justice and glorify all his 
    perfections.</p>
<p align="justify">Sin contradicts his will. The foolish contradicts the 
    laws of infinite wisdom, casts off God's laws and make its own lusts laws, 
    and, therefore, to blot out this dishonor, the Son is made a sacrifice.</p>
<p align="justify">When God had perfected the frame of the world, and it 
    remained only that he should have his tribute of glory paid to him out of 
    it, sin gave a rude shock to the whole work, shook the whole frame; 
    therefore was there such dreadful work to repair it, the Mediator suffering, 
    rocks rending, the sun not shining, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Never entertain low thoughts of pardon. Every 
    pardon is the price of blood, more precious than a thousand worlds. 
    Pardoning sin is one of the greatest letters of God's name, one of the 
    greatest of his works, greater than to make a world. When God said, let such 
    a thing be, it was. But when sin is to be pardoned, justice stands up for 
    satisfaction; the truth of God for the honor of a broken law. Wisdom is set 
    to work to find out a way, the Son pays down the price of his blood, Numbers 
    14:17–19.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 3. Come to Christ for shelter under his 
    righteousness, that you may be justified, pardoned, and accepted. Consider 
    there is no other way but this to the divine favor, no shelter from the 
    sting of unpardoned guilt but here. All other will be but fig-leaf covers.</p>
<p align="justify">Is not pardon of sin, and acceptance with God, worth the 
    seeking? It makes a man happy, Psalm 32:1. A man may be rich and yet 
    reprobate, great in this world and yet damned in the next. His portion fat, 
    yet his soul lean. But a justified man is a happy man. Worldly things come 
    from God's hand, but this great blessing from his heart. It will be sweet 
    sauce to the bitterest dish; it will cause you to glory even in tribulation. 
    The righteousness of Christ justifies a man, and this makes every bitter 
    water sweet. "For there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. 
    It is God that justifies, who is he who condemns?"</p>
<p align="justify">And if you would give evidence of your interest in 
    imputed righteousness, you must do it by inherent righteousness. Show your 
    faith by your works. Faith without works is dead, being alone. Amen.</p>
