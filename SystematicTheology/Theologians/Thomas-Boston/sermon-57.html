<p align="justify">Proverbs 6:10, 11. "Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, 
    a little folding of the hands to sleep. So shall your poverty come as one 
    that travails, and your want as an armed man!"</p>
<p align="justify">I HAVE been pressing sinners to repentance from the 
    former text, and I hope by this time all of you may be convinced of the 
    necessity of it But, alas! delays in this matter kills their ten thousands. 
    Men put off the work from time to time, until time be gone, and they are 
    surprised into ruin, as we may learn from this text. Where,</p>
<p align="justify">1. We have the sluggard's picture drawn in reference to 
    his eternal concerns; which is the main thing here aimed at. He is one that 
    puts off his great work from time to time, "Yet a little sleep, a little 
    slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep."</p>
<p align="justify">In the 6th verse the slothful sinner is set to school to 
    learn a lesson of the emmet; which though she has not the advantages that he 
    has, yet has so much natural sagacity, as to provide for winter, in the time 
    of summer and harvest, when meat is to be got. In the 9th verse there is a 
    rousing call to the sinner to follow that example. But behold how he 
    entertains it; as a person that is loath to arise, he begs "a little more 
    sleep, a little more slumber, a little more folding of the hands to sleep." 
    Here is,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Something supposed; and that is threefold.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The sleeper convinced that he has slept, and 
    neglected his work. There are many who see themselves wrong, yet have no 
    heart to endeavor to get right. They are convinced that their great work is 
    far behind, yet have no heart to stir to set it forward.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The sleeper convinced that he must awake, and set to 
    his work. Slothful sinners may see that the case they are in, is not a case 
    they would venture to die in: they see that it is necessary to turn over a 
    new leaf, to mind their salvation at another rate than they have done, or 
    are doing.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The sleeper resolved to awake, and mind his 
    business. He would gladly sleep, but he does not design to sleep long, to 
    sleep always. No; he designs but a little sleep, if you will believe him, 
    and afterwards to awake; though, poor soul, he does not consider that he is 
    sleeping within the sea-mark, and may be swallowed up before he awake out of 
    his little sleep.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Something expressed; and that is threefold too,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A delay craved: "Yet a little sleep," etc. He is not 
    thinking never to waken, never to repent, but only he cannot think on doing 
    it as yet. However long a sleep he has taken in sin, yet he must have more. 
    For as men, the more they sleep, the more they would sleep; so the more they 
    continue in sin, the more they would continue. And the more they put off 
    repentance, they are the more unfit for it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The quantity of this delay: it is but a little in 
    the sluggard's conceit. Though the Spirit of the Lord be grieved and wearied 
    with waiting on his awakening, yet he thinks that all is but little. If the 
    sluggard considered that his whole time is but little in comparison of 
    eternity, the least time he spends in his sleep would appear very great. 
    But, alas! he considers it not.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The mighty concern he is in for this delay. Though 
    his ruin be enrapt up in it, he is fond of it, his heart is set upon it; and 
    he pleads for it, as a starving man for bread. Ease is sweet to him; and so 
    he speaks, "A little sleep, a little slumber." There are three things here 
    which he craves, each less than the other; which shows how loathe he is to 
    bestir himself.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) "A little sleep;" not a dead sleep, but a moderate 
    one.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) If that cannot be granted, let him have but "a 
    little slumber;" a napping, as it were, a middle between sleeping and 
    waking.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) If he cannot get that, yet he would have "a folding 
    of the hands to sleep;" (Hebrews) to lie a-bed. Let him but lie still 
    loitering, and embracing his sweet self, and not presently be obliged to 
    rise to put hand to work. Love to folded hands goes deep with him.</p>
<p align="justify">Observe, how the hearts of sinners are glued to their 
    sins, and carnal security. When conscience begins to draw them out of their 
    bed of sloth, they will not yield, they will dispute every foot of ground 
    with it. And they will take very little before they want all. O were we as 
    nice in the point of our salvation, as in the state of blindness, in the 
    point of our ruin, how happy might we be?</p>
<p align="justify">2. We have the fatal issue of this course. Delays are 
    dangerous, but most of all in matters of eternal concern. The issue of these 
    delays is, the man is ruined, he never awakes until it is out of time. His 
    little sleep, etc. spends all his little time, and throws him out quite 
    unprovided into a long eternity. Here consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, What ruin comes upon him: Poverty and want. It is 
    held forth under these notions, to answer to the provision the ants make for 
    themselves. They provide for themselves in summer and harvest: so that when 
    the winter comes, when they cannot stir out of their holes, they live on the 
    provision they have laid in. There is a winter abiding us, a time wherein no 
    man can work, when there will be no access to God's grace and favor. Death 
    brings in this. This time is our summer and harvest, wherein matters may be 
    secured for eternity: but, alas! the sluggard sleeps in working time; and so 
    when it is over, he must starve and perish forever.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, How this ruin comes upon him. It comes on,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Swiftly and speedily. So the word rendered one that 
    travails, imports: one that walks vigorously, as a man in a haste upon the 
    road. Though the sinner lies at ease on his bed of sloth, yet his ruin 
    hastens on apace, 2 Peter 2:3. The sun stands not still, though the 
    sluggard's work goes slowly on. Every breath he fetches in his spiritual 
    sleep, draws his destruction a step nearer.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Silently and surprisingly; "Your poverty shall come 
    as one that travails." If we send one on an errand, we will be looking for 
    him again at the time appointed; but we know nothing of the traveler, until 
    he come at us. So ruin comes on the delaying sinner before he is aware; 
    destruction is at his bedside before he is awakened, Proverbs 29:1.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Irresistibly: "Your want shall come as an armed 
    man;" (Hebrews) a man of a buckler, who may hurt you; but not you him, for 
    his buckler defends him. Were this traveler unarmed, the danger were not so 
    great; or were the party attacked watching, and armed too, he might possibly 
    come off safe. But alas! the poor man is naked, and sleeping too; how then 
    can be make his part good against his enemy? He cannot; he must fall a 
    sacrifice to his own sloth. Which brings me to consider,</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, What all this it owing to: "So shall your poverty 
    come as one that travails," etc. It is all owing to the cursed love of ease, 
    to sloth, to the delays and pot-offs, with which precious time is squandered 
    away, and the precious soul is irrecoverably lost, They delay and delay on, 
    until the golden opportunity is lost, and they are swept away into the pit, 
    with all their good resolutions for the time to come, which they never see.</p>
<p align="justify">The point I intend to speak to from these words, is,</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE, The delaying and putting off of repentance or 
    salvation-work, is a soul-ruining course among gospel hearers.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing this doctrine, I shall show,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Why it is that gospel hearers delay and put off 
    repentance.</p>
<p align="justify">II. That this delaying is a soul-ruining course.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Lastly, Make application.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall show why it is that gospel hearers delay and 
    put off repentance. There is a generation that are not resolved never to 
    repent, never to ply salvation-work; but only they are not for it yet. They 
    hope to mend and reform afterwards, but for the present they have no heart 
    to it: so by cheating themselves out of their present time, they put a cheat 
    on themselves for ever. They are called by the word, and by their own 
    consciences, to make ready for another world, to work out their salvation; 
    but their hearts say, "Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little 
    folding of the hands to sleep;" and their practice is conformable thereto. 
    Why is it so?</p>
<p align="justify">1. Satan has a great hand in this. If he cannot hold out 
    the light altogether from disturbing them, he will do what he can to lull 
    them asleep again, before they be fully wakened: Luke 11:21. "When a strong 
    man armed keeps his palace, his goods are in peace." Thus he did with Felix, 
    Acts 24:25, who, "as Paul reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and 
    judgment to come, trembled, and answered, Go your way for this time; when I 
    have a convenient season, I will call for you." When the soul begins to 
    think on making its escape, all the art of Hell will be employed to hold it 
    fast; and it is easier to get one to put off salvation-work until 
    afterwards, than downright to refuse it altogether. And thus Satan is always 
    on one of the two extremes, urging either that it is too soon, or else that 
    it is too long a doing.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The cares and business of the world contribute much to 
    this. Hence our Lord explained "the seed which fell among thorns, to be 
    those, who when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and 
    riches, and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection," Luke 
    8:14. How often are people in such an unsanctified throng of business, that 
    they cannot find a convenient season for putting their salvation-work to a 
    point? They have so many other cares upon their hands, that they jostle out 
    the care of their souls. They find themselves enrapt up in a cloud of cares; 
    but think with themselves, that were they but once through that, they shall 
    ply their main work. Well, but they are no sooner out of that, than they are 
    in to another; and so on, until the work being put off from time to time, is 
    quite neglected. The truth is, persons in such a case will hardly find a 
    time for that work, until they be resolute that they shall take it as they 
    can find it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The predominant love of carnal ease: Proverbs 26:15, 
    "The slothful hides his hand in his bosom, it grieves him to bring it again 
    to his mouth." We are all naturally like Issachar, who saw "that rest was 
    good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and 
    became a servant unto tribute," Genesis 49:15. Could people get sleeping to 
    Heaven on the sluggard's bed, would drowsy wishes carry them thither, many 
    would be the passengers in that way. But that will not do. Men must labor, 
    strive, and wrestle; and that is hard in the eyes of carnal men; and 
    therefore, if it cannot he altogether refused, it is put off as long as may 
    be. And hence never will a soul ply salvation-work in earnest, until it be 
    effectually roused out of its lazy disposition.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The predominant love of sin. Why do persons stave off 
    repentance, but because they are like those who entertaining their friends 
    whom they have no will to part with, do therefore put off their departure 
    from day to day? The parting with sin is like the cutting off of a member of 
    the body, Matthew 5:30; which one will never yield to, unless he be very 
    resolute. No man will delay a minute to throw a burning coal out of his 
    bosom; but they will love to keep a sweet morsel under the tongue, who yet 
    know that they must spit it out at length. And hence it is, that no purpose 
    of reformation, which is only for afterwards, can be sincere; because it 
    argues a love to, and loathness to part with sin.</p>
<p align="justify">5. A natural aversion and backwardness to holiness: Rom 
    8:7. "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the 
    law of God, neither indeed can be." The heart will never be reconciled to 
    the yoke of Christ, until grace make it so, Psalm 110:3. But like as the 
    bullock unaccustomed to the yoke is loath to stoop to it, and therefore 
    still draws aback; so will the heart of man do, until overcoming grace reach 
    it, Jeremiah 31:18. Hence, when light is let into the mind, but the aversion 
    still remains in the will, what can be expected, but that the business of 
    repentance, which they dare not absolutely refuse, will be delayed?</p>
<p align="justify">6. The hope of finding the work easier afterwards. The 
    sluggard thinks with himself, that a little more sleep, a little more 
    slumber, a little more folding of the hands to sleep, would make it easier 
    to him to get out of his bed; though, on the contrary, the more he sleeps 
    unseasonably, the more he would sleep; and the longer persons delay the work 
    of repentance, it is the harder to go through with it. For sin is a disease, 
    which, the longer it lasts, gathers the more strength, and is harder to 
    cure. And he who is not fit today to repent, will be less fit tomorrow.</p>
<p align="justify">7. A large reckoning on the head of time that is to come: 
    Hence the rich man reckoned, "I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much 
    goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry." But 
    let us hear the judgment of God concerning this speech: "But God said unto 
    him, you fool, this night your soul shall be required of you: then whose 
    shall those things be which you have provided?" Luke 12:19. 20: God has 
    given no man a tack of years, no nor hours; yet every body is ready to tell 
    what they will do tomorrow, next month, or next year. The young people think 
    they have a great deal of time before their hand for repentance; the old 
    people think they have enough before them for that too: and in people's 
    conceit there is always enough, until their time be gone quite, and they be 
    wakened out of their dream. Hopes of long life have ruined many a soul. O to 
    be wise! James 4:13. 14. "Go to now, you that say, today or tomorrow we will 
    go unto such a city, and continue there a year, and buy, and sell, and get 
    gain: Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow: For what is your 
    life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time, and then vanishes 
    away." But what folly is it to venture eternity on such uncertainty!</p>
<p align="justify">8. A fond conceit of the easiness of salvation-work. 
    There is a generation that please themselves with the thought, that it is 
    but to believe and repent, and that is soon done. What persons can do with a 
    touch of their hand, they think they need to be in no haste with. But O how 
    contrary is this to the whole strain of Scripture, and the saint's 
    experience? Matthew 7:14, "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which 
    leads unto life, and few there be that find it." Luke 13:24. "Strive to 
    enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter 
    in, and shall not be able." Ephesians 1:19, 20, "The apostle speaks of the 
    exceeding greatness of God's power toward them who believe, according to the 
    working of his mighty power; which he wrought in Christ, when be raised him 
    from the dead. 1 Peter 4:18. "If the righteous scarcely be saved, where 
    shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?" Did men believe this, that there 
    is such a difficulty in getting to Heaven, they would not dare delay for a 
    minute entering on the way.</p>
<p align="justify">9. A conceit of sufficient ability in ourselves to turn 
    ourselves from sin unto God. That the doctrine advancing the power of 
    natural reason and ability in spiritual things, does take so much with the 
    world, is no wonder, since man naturally is such a stranger to his own 
    spiritual impotency. Hence it is observed, that the first question with the 
    awakened is, "What shall I do to be saved?" It is worth observing how the 
    carnal heart turns itself into different shapes, to retain its sinful lusts. 
    Sometimes the man says, that he is not able to do any good; but when his sin 
    cannot find shelter under this covert but he is pursued hot with conviction, 
    he puts off his reformation and repentance to another time; thereby in 
    effect declaring that he can do it, if he had but a season for it. He who is 
    to use his oars may row at what hour he pleases; but he who must sail by the 
    help of the wind must set off while it blows, because he cannot command it.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I shall show that this delaying is a soul-ruining 
    course.</p>
<p align="justify">This is evident if you consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is directly opposite to the gospel call; which is 
    for today, not for tomorrow: Hebrews 3:7, 8, "Today if you will hear his 
    voice, harden not your hearts." All the calls of the gospel require present 
    compliance, and do not allow sinners to put off until another day. It is 
    true, salvation-work must be deliberate work; but you are not allowed a time 
    to deliberate whether you will come to Christ and be holy or not. It is like 
    the call to quench fire in a house, that must presently be done, yet done 
    deliberately, so as the work be not marred in the making. How then can it be 
    but a soul-ruining course?</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is threatened with ruin. The text is very express, 
    "So shall your poverty come as one that travails, and your want as an armed 
    man." And one with a thousand times more safety might venture on a 
    sword-point, than the edge of such a divine threatening. See Proverbs 23:21; 
    Ecclesiastes 10:18. And this threatening has been accomplished in many, whom 
    their slothful delays have caused to perish; as in the case of Ephraim, 
    Hosea 13:13. and of Felix, Acts 24:25. Many have been not far from the 
    kingdom of God, who yet never came to it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Whenever grace touches the heart, men see that it is 
    so. Hence says the Psalmist, Psalm 119:60, "I made haste, and delayed not to 
    keep your commandments." When men are in earnest to get into Christ by 
    faith, and to get back to God by repentance, they dare linger no more in the 
    state of wrath, they flee out of it, as one fleeing for his life, Matthew 
    3:7. Their eyes are opened to see their danger, and therefore they are 
    presently determined.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It has a native tendency to soul-ruin, which 
    inevitably overtakes them, if they do not at length break off all delays, 
    and come away. This is evident, if you consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The state of sin is a state of wrath, where ruin 
    must needs compass a man about on every hand: John 3:36, "He who believes 
    not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him." To 
    have stayed in Sodom that day it was to be burnt, was dangerous; but to 
    abide a moment in the state of wrath, is far more dangerous. Who would 
    venture into a house that is about to fall? who would not presently leave 
    it? And will men venture "yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little 
    folding of the hands to sleep," in a state of enmity with God? Surely such 
    persons know not God's greatness, nor the worth of their own souls.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The longer you continue in sin, your spiritual 
    death advanced the more upon you. Every sin sets you a step farther from 
    God, is a new bar in the way of your peace with him, strengthens your 
    natural enmity against him, and alienates you more from the life of God. And 
    where can this natively end, but in your souls' ruin? Ah! are we not far 
    enough on in that way already? why delay more, that we may go yet farther 
    off from God?</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, While you remain in this state, there is but a step 
    between you and death, which you may be carried over by a delay of ever so 
    short a time. All that is your security in this case, so far as you can see, 
    is the brittle thread of your life, which may be broken with a touch, and 
    then you are ruined without remedy. So that every delay, shorter or longer, 
    of repentance, is a venturing of eternity on that uncertain life of yours, 
    which in a moment may be taken from you.</p>
<p align="justify">USE I. For Information. This lets us see,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That delayers of repentance are self-destroyers, 
    self-murderers. Well may it be said to such, as Ezekiel 18:31, "Why will you 
    die?" Should a man willfully neglect a remedy for his disease, which puts 
    him in hazard of his life, he could not be guiltless of his own death; more 
    than one who being called to rise and quench the fire in his house, and yet 
    would lie still until it were consumed to ashes, would be blameless of its 
    ruin. Self-love, that is, love of sinful self, is the source of the greatest 
    cruelty; whereby lusts are spared to the destruction of the life of the 
    soul.</p>
<p align="justify">2. By delays the interest of Hell is advanced; where many 
    are this day who had resolved to repent, but death did not wait their time, 
    and so they were disappointed. No wonder new grounds of delay be still laid 
    to persons' hands, for it is Satan's great drift to get men entangled in the 
    wilderness, that they may not make forward to Canaan's land. And every new 
    entanglement sets the soul a step nearer to destruction: and who questions 
    but Satan has are enough to coin new pretenses for delays?</p>
<p align="justify">3. No wonder Satan is most busy to ply the engine of 
    delays, when a sinner is somewhat awakened by conviction; as he did with 
    Felix, Acts 24:25. "A soft answer turns away wrath;" and delays will blunt 
    the edge of convictions, as much as a peremptory refusal. Under convictions, 
    at a sermon, or on a sick-bed, the sinner is awakened out of his sleep; but 
    then nothing can serve Satan's purpose better, than yet a little sleep: 
    which if they get, they sleep off the edge of convictions.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They are sinners' best friends, that give them least 
    rest in a sinful course. And whatever men think of them now, they will think 
    so afterwards, Proverbs 5:11, 12, 13. Every body loves ease, and therefore 
    faithful preaching and dealing with souls, is a torment to those who love to 
    be undisturbed in their rest in sin, Revelation 11:10. But what suits best 
    with our sinful inclinations, is worst for our souls, and will in the end be 
    found so. Flattery has ruined many, when plain dealing and fair warning has 
    brought many out of the snare.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of Lamentation. We may lament here the case of 
    many, nay of most that hear the gospel. They put off their work from time to 
    time, and so their spiritual case is going to wreck day by day. This is the 
    case in natural things: Ecclesiastes 10:18. "By much slothfulness the 
    building decays, and through idleness of the hands the house drop through." 
    They are in a dying condition, the physician comes to their bed-side, and 
    offers them a remedy; they do not absolutely refuse it, only they put off 
    the taking of it. In the meantime their distemper increases, and death is 
    advancing apace. The market of free grace is opened, and they are called to 
    come and buy: they see they need to buy, yet they are not like to stir until 
    the market be over. O madness and folly to be lamented with tears of blood! 
    Poor slothful creature, that is yet for a little sleep, a little slumber, a 
    little folding of the hands to sleep, there are four things you know not.</p>
<p align="justify">1. You know not the worth of a precious soul, which you 
    are throwing away for what will not profit. Will the sweet sleep is sin quit 
    the cost of the soul's ruin? No, no: "For what is a man profited, if he 
    shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul or what shall a man give 
    in exchange for his soul?" Matthew 16:26. Christ left the bosom of the 
    Father, and shed his precious blood to redeem the soul. He was wise that 
    paid the price; and if less would have done, he would not have been at 
    needless expense of blood: he was a Father that received it; and would not 
    have put his Son to that if it had not been necessary. Satan goes about 
    without intermission to ruin it. But what low thoughts do you entertain of 
    it, that will not break your rest to save it from ruin?</p>
<p align="justify">2. You know not the excellency of precious Christ; sleep 
    locks up your eyes that you can not see the ravishing sight, John 1:10. The 
    eyes of saints and angels are fixed on him, as the glory of the upper house: 
    the eyes opened here by grace, are arrested by his overcoming glory. Hence 
    are these rapturous expressions in Scripture, Psalm 73:25. "Whom have I in 
    Heaven but you? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides you." 
    Canticles 1:3. "Because of the savor of your good ointments, your name is as 
    ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love you." Zion's crowned 
    King is making his progress through the city where you dwell; the cry to 
    come out and behold him, reaches your ears, Canticles 3.; but while he goes 
    by, you must have "yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of 
    the hands to sleep," and so you lose the sight. The royal Bridegroom 
    stretches forth his hand unto you, to espouse you, saying, Behold me, behold 
    me: you open your drowsy eyes, and begin to stretch forth the hand; but 
    sleep overcomes you, your eyes close, and your hand falls down again, and 
    the match is marred. The chariot of the covenant that is driving on to his 
    Father's house halts at your door, and you are called out: the ship is to 
    sail to Immanuel's land, you are called to come aboard: but "yet a little 
    sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep," and all is 
    lost.</p>
<p align="justify">3. You know not the worth of precious time. The Apostle 
    will have time redeemed, Ephesians 5:16; but you squander it away as a thing 
    of no value; and working time is turned by you into sleeping time. Precious 
    moments slip away, and you regard not; though once gone, they can never be 
    recalled. What would those who are past hope, give for an hour of that time, 
    whereof you let days, months, and years slip, without any improvement for 
    eternity? O unhappy soul, who "know not in this your day, the things that 
    belong unto your peace!"</p>
<p align="justify">4. You know not the weight of the wrath of God. It is 
    true none can have a full comprehension of it, Psalm 90:11. "Who knows the 
    power of your anger?" But all the elect of God get such a notion of it, as 
    rouses them up to fly from it, 2 Corinthians 5:11. "Knowing the terror of 
    the Lord," says the Apostle, "we persuade men." And if you had tolerable 
    apprehensions of it, it would break off your sleep and slumber, and cause 
    you put forth your hands to work. Did you consider what a fearful thing it 
    is to fall into the hands of the living God, and how when you fall down 
    again into your bed of sloth, you are truly in hazard of it, it would give 
    you such a gliff as would keep the waking.</p>
<p align="justify">There are three things you do not observe.</p>
<p align="justify">1. You do not observe what speed your ruin is making, 
    while you lie at ease; how your judgment lingers not, "and your damnation 
    slumbers not," 2 Peter 2:3. The avenger of blood is pursuing you, though you 
    are not fleeing from the wrath to come. You are like a man sleeping in a 
    leaky ship, which is drawing water every moment, and within a little it will 
    be full, and sink to the bottom of the sea, if he do not awake and help it. 
    Every hour your debt is growing, the cup of wrath is filling, and fills so 
    much the faster, as you are secure.</p>
<p align="justify">2. You do not observe how near your destruction may be. 
    You are like the old world, who "were eating and drinking, marrying and 
    giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew 
    not until the flood came, and took them all away," Matthew 24:38, 39. Your 
    spiritual lethargy and dead sleep hinders you from hearing the sound of the 
    feet of the approaching stroke. You lie open to the most terrible surprise, 
    to sleep the sleep of death, which you may never awake out of until in Hell, 
    Luke 12:19, 20. and 16:23. And O how sad is it for men to be past hope, 
    before they begin to fear; to have the house falling, before they get over 
    their bed!</p>
<p align="justify">3. You do not observe how utterly unable you are to ward 
    off the blow when it comes: Isaiah 33:14, "The sinners in Zion are afraid, 
    fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites: who among us shall dwell with the 
    devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?" Ezekiel 
    22:14, "Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong in the days that 
    I shall deal with you? I the Lord have spoken it, and will do it." Can worm 
    man stand before the almighty God, whose patience may be worn out before you 
    awake? And if mercy and patience quit the field, justice will succeed into 
    their room; and then there shall be no more sleeping, nor ease forever.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 3. Of Reproof to delayers of salvation-work. Why do 
    you go on in this soul-ruining course? Have you no respect to the calls of 
    the gospel, none to your souls, none to eternity? Why do not you with all 
    your might whatever your hand finds to do? I would apply myself here,</p>
<p align="justify">1. To delaying saints.</p>
<p align="justify">2. To delaying sinners.</p>
<p align="justify">1. To delaying saints; for such there may be, and of such 
    there are many at this day, Canticles 5:2, 3; and our text is a general 
    truth and warning. Spiritual sloth is so interwoven with our corrupt 
    natures, that it will never be quite rooted out, until the corrupt nature be 
    perfectly expelled. And as it remains in great measure in the saints, so it 
    is fruitful of delays. There are these five delays incident even to the 
    saints.</p>
<p align="justify">1. A delay of righting their case when matters are wrong, 
    by renewing their repentance, and the actings of faith. Sometimes their case 
    is quite out of order: their graces are not in exercise; they are strangers 
    to the Spirit's influences, and to access to and communion with God in 
    duties. They have a secret dissatisfaction with this, and are resolved to 
    get to their feet again; but sloth masters them, and the work is put off 
    from time to time; as was the case with the spouse, Canticles 5:2, 3, "I 
    sleep, but my heart wakes," says she, "it is the voice of my beloved that 
    knocks, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for 
    my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. I have 
    put off my coat, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I 
    defile them?"</p>
<p align="justify">2. The delaying to give up with some bosom-idol that mars 
    their communion with God, Canticles 3:1; Psalm 66:18. They are convinced, 
    that the harboring of it does much harm to their souls' case, and many 
    resolutions they have to put the knife to the throat of it, but still they 
    draw back their hand. And from one time to another the crucifying of it is 
    put off; so that still it lives, like a waster in the candle, causing the 
    soul's case go to wreck.</p>
<p align="justify">8. The delaying to clear their state before the Lord. 
    They see need to have marches rid, and to be brought to a point whether they 
    be in Christ or not, whether in a state of grace or not. They have 
    resolutions to put it to a solemn trial, to examine themselves, and search 
    what evidences they have for a title to Heaven: but still the heart draws 
    back, and the trial is put off.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The delaying of some particular duty, or piece of 
    generation-work, which they are convinced God calls them to. They have often 
    thoughts of setting about it in earnest; but still some one thing or other 
    intervenes, and it is put off. They begin perhaps sometimes; but it is 
    broken off again, and they must yet have "a little sleep, a little slumber, 
    a little folding of the hands to sleep."</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, The delaying of actual preparation for 
    eternity; like the virgins, Matthew 25:5, who, "while the bridegroom 
    tarried, all slumbered and slept." They see that it is no easy thing to die; 
    they resolve to labor to put themselves through grace into a case for it; 
    but day after day it is delayed. The lamps are not trimmed for meeting the 
    Bridegroom. Though they be in a good state, they have not a dying frame.</p>
<p align="justify">To all such I would say, as Jon. 1:6, "What meanest you, 
    O sleeper? arise, call upon your God, if so be that God will think upon you, 
    that you perish not." Let me expostulate with you upon this head, O delaying 
    saints.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Do you find yourselves anything the nearer your 
    purpose by all your delays? Nay the longer you delay, do not you find 
    yourselves the farther from it? Does not your aversion and backwardness to 
    duty grow upon you the more? and is not your confidence in the Lord still 
    the more lessened? Yes; the more you give yourselves to spiritual sleep, the 
    more you will desire to sleep.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Do not you find this the way to rank poverty and want? 
    Your consciences will witness the truth of that, that where the diligent 
    shall abound with blessings, the idle soul shall suffer hunger. Is it with 
    you as in months past? Have you that sense and gust of religion, that access 
    to God in duties, which you have had when you were doing with your might 
    what your hand found to do?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Has not your poverty come upon you as one that 
    travails? Have you not been sometimes like Samson awaked out of Delilah's 
    lap, and found your strength gone from you when you had most to do with it? 
    Perhaps you have spent many days in estrangement from God, with much ease; 
    but at length some strong temptation, or piercing trial has overtaken you; 
    and then you have sucked the bitter sap of your slothful delays.</p>
<p align="justify">4. A little more sleep, a little more slumber, a little 
    more folding of the hands to sleep, and the occasion may be lost, the 
    opportunity for doing neglected duties may be lost. Either they may be taken 
    from you, or you from them. No man has a tack of his life, nor of occasions 
    of doing good; and therefore "as we have opportunity, let us do good unto 
    all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith," Galatians 
    6:10. And though the soul that is in Christ shall be saved surely, yet this 
    will make the salvation to be so as by fire.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, The long delayed work is hard work when it 
    comes to the setting too, Canticles 5:5–8. When the awakening comes, there 
    may be little time, much opposition, and less strength than otherwise you 
    would have had, and yet more to do with it than otherwise. The longer your 
    hand is from your case the more raveled will it be. And it will readily 
    occasion much fear, darkness, and perplexity in a dying hour.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I would apply myself to delaying sinners, to those 
    that are yet out of Christ, and have all to do for eternity still. They are 
    living in a state of wrath, and yet they linger, and put off their removal 
    from Sodom. They delay repentance, and go on in their sin. I would say to 
    you, as Proverbs 6:9, "How long will you sleep, O sluggard? when will you 
    arise out of your sleep?" I must expostulate with you on this head.</p>
<p align="justify">First, You young people, why do you delay repentance? why 
    are you like the wild donkeys' colts, intractable and unteachable? No doubt, 
    you think it is too soon for you; that it may be time enough several years 
    after this. You think repentance and seriousness suits best with the 
    wrinkled brows, the pale face, and hollow eyes, etc; that it is pity to 
    spoil the bloom of youth with such work. When do you mean to repent then? It 
    is like, it is when you are settled in the world, or when you grow old; at 
    least the days of youth must be over first. But, poor fool,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Is the debt of sin so small upon your head, that you 
    must run yourself deeper in the debt of God's justice? Do not you know that 
    you were born a child of wrath? Ephesians 2:3; that you brought that into 
    the world with you, that will damn you, if you repent not, and come to 
    Christ? And will not that sink you deep enough in destruction, though you 
    add no more to it, unless you repent?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Is not the same holy law binding on you, since you 
    could discern between good and evil, that is binding on the oldest alive? 
    Have the young a liberty to sin, and to cast off the fear of God and 
    religion, more than the old? See Galatians 3:10, "For as many as are of the 
    works of the law, are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every 
    one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the 
    law to do them." Here there is no exception. The follies of youth men may 
    pass; but assure yourselves, God will not pass them: Ecclesiastes 11:9, 
    "Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the 
    days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of 
    your eyes: but know you, that for all these things God will bring you into 
    judgment." And I doubt not, but if you saw your sinful thoughts, words, and 
    actions, whether vain or vile, laid before you, as you must reckon for them 
    at length, however few your years have been, you will see them to be more 
    than the hairs on your heads. And I must tell you, that being yet unrenewed, 
    and strangers to the life of grace, all your actions have been sin: Proverbs 
    21:4, "An high look, and a proud heart, and the ploughing of the wicked, is 
    sin." And is it not then time to repent?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Who has assured you, that ever you shall see the age 
    you speak of? Go to the churchyard, and you will see graves of all sizes, of 
    your length and under. There are far more young corpses, than there are of 
    those that carry gray hairs, ten to one. Most men and women are cut off 
    before they come to old age. What has befallen others as young and 
    flourishing as you, may befall you too. And therefore, since you know not 
    but you may die young, repent while you are young, lest in the end you find 
    yourselves miserably disappointed.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Who has best right to your youth and strength? God or 
    the devil? God is courting you for his own gift: Ecclesiastes 12:1, 
    "Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth." Satan will labor to 
    keep his possession. God is the first and last; and he required the first 
    and best, the first-fruits, the first-born, the morning-sacrifice; and he 
    requires the first of your days, and he takes pleasure therein: Jeremiah 
    2:2, "I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your 
    espousals, when you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not 
    sown." And will you devote the first and best to sin and Satan, reserving 
    the last and worst to your Creator?</p>
<p align="justify">5. Great is the advantage of those that get a gripe of 
    religion while they are young, beyond others, in many respects.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Readily their passage in the pangs of the new birth 
    will be easier than that of others. In none is that scripture fulfilled 
    more, Mark 4:27. of the seed's springing and growing up, none knows how, 
    than where grace joins with good education in young persons. The nail lately 
    driven, draws easily in comparison of that which has been long rusted in. 
    Where grace catches persons before they begin to dip into the gross 
    pollutions of the world, it frees them of much remorse that these must 
    occasion to those that have been led away with them.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Young people's affections are easiest moved; and as 
    they move easiest, so they move most vigorously, whatever way they be set. 
    Hence they lie most fair for tasting the sweet of religion: Hosea 2:14, "I 
    will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably 
    unto her." God sometimes dandling young converts upon the knees, and giving 
    them sensible tastes of the pleasure of religion, is agreeable to the 
    particular promise made for their encouragement, Proverbs 8:17, "I love them 
    that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) They are in the fairest way to have most access to 
    serve God in their generation. Suppose a man to be converted when he is old, 
    his salvation will be secure; but, alas! his time for serving God's honor in 
    the world is almost gone before he puts hand to work.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, God commands you to repent presently, and 
    therefore it is on the peril of your soul, that you venture to delay a 
    moment longer: Hebrews 3:7, 8, "Today if you will hear his voice, harden not 
    your hearts." Remember that word, Ecclesiastes 11:9, 10, "Rejoice, O young 
    man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, 
    and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes: but know 
    you, that for all these things God will bring you into judgment. Therefore 
    remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh: for 
    childhood and youth are vanity." A sinful youth will at length make a sad 
    soul. You know not how soon God may be provoked against you to cut you off, 
    if you delay. Monuments of the Lord's anger have been set up in childhood 
    and youth, as well as in old age. Witness the children at Bethel, 2 Kings 
    2:23, 24.</p>
<p align="justify">Let not Satan deceive you, as if there were no pleasure 
    in religion. No, Wisdom's "ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths 
    are peace," Proverbs 3:17. There is a sweet in religion a thousand times 
    preferable to all the pleasures and vanities youth gades after.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, You middle-aged people, why do you delay 
    repentance? why do not you think with yourselves seriously, where you are 
    like to take up your eternal lodging, and prepare for eternity by 
    repentance? No doubt you think you have time enough too; but no time at 
    present, for you have another thing ado, the care of a family upon your 
    heads, Luke 14:20. When is your term-day of repentance? It is like it is 
    when you shall have more time than now, or when you grow old. But, O sirs,</p>
<p align="justify">1. What know you that ever you shall see old age? Yes 
    what do you know, but, as Luke 12:20, "this night your soul shall be 
    required of you"? Alas! shall men thus from time to time venture their 
    eternal state upon a mere uncertainty? Your life is but a day, a short day, 
    a winter day, and you have a long journey to go; your forenoon is past 
    already, and will you sleep on until the evening that will soon be upon you? 
    The declining sun calls you to awake.</p>
<p align="justify">2. What reason is there, that your business in the world 
    should shuffle out your business for eternity? Remember they had as good 
    excuses as you, who upon the sending of them were rejected, and it was 
    declared their day of grace was past, Luke 14:18, 19, 20, 24. Oh have you 
    not a soul to provide for, your eternal state to look after? Can you wonder, 
    if, as you prefer the world to Christ now, he give you your portion in this 
    life; and if ever the time come that you set yourself to repent, he deny you 
    his grace, and hidden you go to the gods you have served?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Consider the advantages you have now for seriousness, 
    when the foam of youth has settled, and the infirmities of old age have not 
    yet drawn on. O consider, and show yourselves men. You have spent your youth 
    in vanity, and will you spend this age too that way? What is it you design 
    for God, the dregs of your years, that age that is the sink of infirmities? 
    and you will part with sin, when you can follow it no longer. O sirs, what 
    confidence can you have, that God will accept that off your hand? Malachi 
    1:8. "And if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you 
    offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto your governor, 
    will he be pleased with you, or accept your person? says the Lord of hosts."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Suppose you should live until you grow old, O how few 
    are there that get grace to repent when they are old? I shall not say, there 
    are none such; but truly though they be, they are very rare. Be not you 
    encouraged to delay, because some were called at the eleventh hour, Matthew 
    20:6; for if you mark the text, these were others than those that were 
    standing there at the third, sixth, and ninth hour. We set no bounds to 
    sovereignty; but as for those that live under the gospel, and spend their 
    best days in sin and estrangedness from religion, common observation tells 
    us, that it is God's ordinary way to plague them with hardness of heart, 
    when they grow old: Job 20:11. "His bones are full of the sin of his youth, 
    which shall lie down with him in the dust." About three hundred years after 
    Christ, there was one that had lived a pagan until he was an old man; when 
    he told Simplicianus that he was a Christian, he would not believe him: but 
    when the Church saw that he was really so, their was great shouting and 
    gladness, saying, Caius Marius Victorious is become a Christian! They 
    wondered to see a man when he was old born again.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Will you see the deceit of delays. When you 
    were young, did you not put it off to this time? and now when that is come, 
    you are as unready as before. Delay no more then lest you sleep the sleep of 
    death.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, Old people, why do you delay repentance: why is 
    not your heart bowing to God's call, when you are begun to bow to meet the 
    grave? You that have always thought you had time enough all your days, you 
    will think there is time enough yet. But when is your term-day for 
    repentance? a death-bed, it is like. And when you come there, you will hope 
    it will be but a sick-bed, and so drive off your work until the utmost 
    point. But, O sirs,</p>
<p align="justify">1. May not the time past of your life suffice to have 
    wrought the will of the flesh? Most you have "yet a little sleep, a little 
    slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep?" Well, when you have taken 
    it over the belly of God's call to you all your days, what confidence can 
    you have to look for grace or mercy then? Sin, Satan, and the world shall 
    have all your time, and you will look to God, and seek his favor, when you 
    can do no more. O, are you not afraid, that that be accomplished on you? 
    Proverbs 1:24. etc. "Because I have called, and you refused, I have 
    stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but you have set at nothing all 
    my counsel, and would have none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your 
    calamity, I will mock when your fear comes; when your fear comes as 
    desolation, and your destruction comes as a whirlwind; when distress and 
    anguish comes upon you," etc. I trow, if your conscience were awakened just 
    now, you should have enough ado to fasten your feet on a promise of mercy.</p>
<p align="justify">2. How do you know, that you will get a death-bed or 
    sick-bed? What do you know, but that in a moment you may drop into eternity, 
    as many have done? Mind him who used to say, three words would do his turn 
    at death. Death does not always send messengers to warn us of its approach. 
    Nay, see what our Lord says expressly, Matthew 24:48–51. "If that evil 
    servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delays his coming. And shall begin 
    to smite his fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken: the 
    Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looks not for him, and in 
    an hour that he is not ware of; and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him 
    his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of 
    teeth."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lastly, And is dying such an easy business, that you 
    must be laying up other work, yes your main work, for a dying time? I should 
    think, that dying itself, with the pains, throes, and sickness that 
    ordinarily attend it, were enough of themselves. Surely, if we were rightly 
    exercised in health, we would endeavor, that when we come to die, we should 
    have nothing ado but to die. But I pray you remember, you may come to die 
    roving, without the exercise of your reason. But though you should have it 
    to the last, I pray you consider, is the work of repentance such an easy 
    work as to leave it until the time you can do nothing else? Will you put off 
    turning to God, until you are not able to turn yourselves on a bed, but as 
    you are lifted? taking Heaven by storm, until your strength be gone? crying 
    to God, until you are not able to speak two sentences at once? making ready 
    for death, until it be come to your bed-side?</p>
<p align="justify">USE. I exhort you all to delay repentance and 
    salvation-work no longer.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. Consider you do but mock God, and cheat 
    yourselves by your delaying. For it is inconsistent with a sincere purpose 
    to repent and turn from sin, 1 Peter 4:1, 2, 3. For he who sincerely minds 
    to turn from sin, will presently turn from it.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. Repentance is not in your power; it is God's 
    gift, which he gives when he will, Acts 5:31. "God has exalted Christ with 
    his right hand, to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel." 
    The time of God's grace is limited: a time wherein he will be found, and 
    when not: Isaiah 55:6. "Seek you the Lord while he may be found, call you 
    upon him while he is near." Death certainly puts a period to it. But it 
    seems to be clear, that men may outlive their day of grace: Luke 14:24. "I 
    say unto you, that none of those men which were bidden, shall taste of my 
    supper." Time was when Esau might have had the blessing, but then he 
    despised it; but the time came when he could not have it: Hebrews 12:17. 
    "You know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing, he 
    was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it 
    carefully with tears." Strike in then with the occasion; for if wind and 
    tide fail, there can be no setting to sea.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 3. Though we knew certainly, that our day of grace 
    were far from the end; yet it is a most unworthy thing so to deal with God. 
    Shall men abuse mercy and grace because the Lord waits to be gracious? Will 
    men abuse the divine patience, because it suffers long? What a folly is it 
    to stand off as long as we can from him to whom we must needs submit 
    ourselves at length?</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 4. The time is short, the work great, and so is 
    the opposition. Salvation-work is a great work; it is no easy thing to be a 
    Christian; you must lay your account with all the opposition the devil, the 
    world, and the flesh can make you; you have but an age that is an 
    handbreadth, as nothing to do it in.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 5. Your life is most uncertain. We are 
    tenants-at-will, we have no tack for tomorrow, James 4:13, 14. forfeited. We 
    are agreed about the necessity of repentance; the only question is, When 
    shall it be done? God says, Today; and to morrow is not yours, but God's. 
    How then can you destinate for this use the time that is not yours? Return 
    to God one day before your death, say the Jewish doctors. Wisely said; 
    return then today, for it may be you shall die tomorrow.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 6. The longer you delay, the work will be the 
    harder. For sin becomes stronger, as the waters, the farther from the head, 
    the greater they grow. And the arrow that going from the bow strays from the 
    mark, how far wide will it be before it come to the utmost point? It is 
    observed, that Christ groaned at the raising of Lazarus four days dead; but 
    not so at the raising of the young man of Nain, or Jarius' daughter. 
    Jeremiah 13:23. "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his 
    spots? then may you also do good, that are accustomed to do evil." Their 
    number increases; the devil who comes alone at first, at length his name is 
    Legion. The heart grows harder, the mind blinder, the will more perverse, 
    the affections more carnal.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 7. A moment's delay may be an eternal loss, 
    because you know not any moment that may not be your last.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE. God commands you to repent presently, Hebrews 
    4:7. Therefore upon your peril it is, if you delay any more.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. The thief on the cross repented at the last 
    gasp. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. His repentance was one of the miracles at 
    Christ's death; and he glorified God more at his death than you could if you 
    had been a penitent all your days. But though there was one that none might 
    despair, yet there was but one that none might presume. The other thief even 
    died as he lived.</p>
