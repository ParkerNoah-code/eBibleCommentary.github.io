    Isaiah 61:1, "To proclaim liberty to the captives."</p>
<p align="justify">HITHERTO we have had Christ's commission as it respects 
    those who have some good in them, the meek and the broken-hearted. Here is 
    his commission with respect to those who have no good in them, but are utter 
    strangers to him, living in their natural state. He is anointed to proclaim 
    liberty to the captives. In which words consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Man's natural state. It is a state of captivity: they 
    are captives to Satan: 2 Timothy 2:26, "And that they may recover themselves 
    out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captives by him at his will." 
    He is the tyrant whose captives they are, who has carried them away out of 
    the light of God's favor, and holds them fast in his territories, being the 
    God of this world. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ's work with respect to them. It is to proclaim 
    liberty to them, Luke 4:18, "To preach deliverance to the captives." These 
    are indeed the same. Luke's word for liberty or deliverance, is properly 
    dismissing or letting away, that is, giving liberty. The words for preaching 
    and proclaiming signify properly to cry, and are used either of preaching or 
    proclaiming. And what is preaching but proclaiming in the name of the king 
    of Heaven? and so this relates to Christ's kingly office.—From this part of 
    the subject we take the following DOCTRINES—</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. That sinners in their natural unregenerate 
    state are Satan's captives.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. That Jesus Christ, with the express consent 
    of his Father, has issued out his royal proclamation of liberty to Satan's 
    captives.</p>
<p align="justify">We begin with</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. That sinners in their natural unregenerate 
    state are Satan's captives.</p>
<p align="justify">For illustrating this doctrine, we shall consider,</p>
<p align="justify">I. How sinners in their natural state have become Satan's 
    captives.</p>
<p align="justify">II. What is their condition as Satan's captives.</p>
<p align="justify">III. The properties of this captivity, and then,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Add the improvement of the subject.</p>
<p align="justify">We are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show how sinners in their natural state have become 
    Satan's captives. They have become his captives,</p>
<p align="justify">1. As taken in war; 2 Peter 2:19, "Of whom a man is 
    overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage." Satan having proclaimed war 
    against Heaven, maliciously set on our first parents in paradise, and on all 
    mankind in them. He set on them as the confederates of Heaven, and carried 
    his point, gained the victory. And in this respect he is still pursuing the 
    victory, and driving the. unrenewed world before him as prisoners of war, 
    called his lawful captives, Isaiah 41:24. They have become his captives, 
    because</p>
<p align="justify">2. They are born his captives, as being born of those 
    whom he overcame and carried captive. So they are expressly called the 
    children of Hell, Matthew 23:15. There were many of the captives in Babylon 
    who had never seen Canaan, having been born in that country. These were 
    captives no less than their parents, and that by their birth. So is it with 
    Adam's posterity naturally; they were born under the power of Satan, Acts 
    26:18. When a slave, under the law, married in his master's house, though at 
    the end of seven years he got his own freedom, yet the children were his 
    master's, as being born in his house, and could not be free without a 
    particular liberty for them, Exodus 21:4. Thus even the children of godly 
    parents are by nature Satan's captives; children of Abraham, children of the 
    devil. To the Jews our Savior said, "You are of your father the devil, and 
    the lusts of your father you will do," John 8:44. We were,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To inquire what is their condition as Satan's 
    captives. Upon this we observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That every natural man is transported from his 
    primitive soil into Satan's territories, his kingdom of darkness. Hence 
    believers are said "to be turned from the power of Satan unto God." Acts 
    26:18. And again, Colossians 1:13, "God has delivered us from the power of 
    darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son." Sinners 
    are not now where God at first set them down; they are transported into 
    another kingdom; like the prodigal, they have left their father's house, and 
    gone into a far country, where they have spent their substance, Luke 15:13. 
    They are far from God, his covenant, and his Son. You are in Satan's 
    kingdom, O unconverted soul! a black and dismal kingdom, where sin, 
    darkness, and death reign, where there is no gleam of saving light or life; 
    and if you were awakened out of your dream, you will see matters so 
    situated; a kingdom with which God will have war forever; and you are an 
    unhappy subject of that kingdom.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They are plundered and robbed of all that is valuable, 
    as captives used to be; Revelation 3:17, "They are wretched, and miserable, 
    and poor, and blind, and naked." The light of the mind, the righteousness of 
    the will, the holiness of the affections, all are lost, all has become a 
    spoil and a prey to the hellish conqueror. Now you are a poor captive, who 
    have nothing truly good left you, nothing which the bands of Hell have not 
    made you render up.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They are stripped, as has also been an ancient custom 
    of dealing with captives. Thus, as the prophet Isaiah, ch. 20:3, 4, walked 
    three years naked, for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and Ethiopia; so did the 
    king of Assyria carry away these nations captive, naked and bare-foot. What 
    a melancholy sight is it, to see brave men, who were glittering in shining 
    apparel and arms at the commencement of an engagement, when fallen into the 
    hands of their enemies, stripped and driven away naked before the 
    conquerors. But yet more melancholy to see precious souls stripped by Satan 
    of their original righteousness, and driven away before him, without any 
    covering but rags, filthy rags, Revelation 3:17. This, O sinner, is the 
    shameful and dangerous case which you are in as Satan's captive.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They are no more masters of themselves, but under the 
    power of the conqueror; 2 Timothy 2:26, "They are taken captive by him at 
    his will." Their liberty is gone, and they are slaves to the worst of 
    masters. Wonder not that many a poor sinner is at Satan's beck, over the 
    belly of reason and conscience, to serve the devil, to their own visible 
    ruin. Alas! they are captives, not at their liberty, but must go as he 
    commands them; Romans 1:23. "There is a lair in their members, which brings 
    them into captivity to the law of sin and death."</p>
<p align="justify">5. If they get anything that is valuable, they cannot get 
    it kept, it is torn from them by the conqueror. As the Babylonians wasted 
    and insulted the Israelites, when they carried them away captives, so does 
    Satan waste and insult his captives, Psalm 137:3. Sometimes the natural man 
    gets a conviction of sin or duty darted in on him, and this produces 
    relentings for sin, and resolutions to amendment of life; but they do not 
    continue. Alas I how can they, while they are Satan's captives, who will not 
    suffer them to think of entertaining them, more than Pharaoh would endure 
    the Israelites to think of leaving his service. Nay, he rests not until they 
    have thrown them away.</p>
<p align="justify">6. They are so secured as that they cannot get away, they 
    are kept by the strong man under the power of darkness, Colossians 1:13. 
    There is a gulf fixed between them and all spiritual good, so that they 
    cannot pass. Satan has his guards on them, whom they cannot escape to come 
    back to the Lord. He has them fettered with divers lusts, which they cannot 
    shake off. And, in a word, nothing less than a power stronger than all the 
    powers of Hell can make way for the deliverance of a captive.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, If they but offer to make escape, they are more 
    narrowly watched, stronger guards set on them, and more work put in their 
    hands; as Pharaoh did with the Israelites, so the devil does with his 
    captives, Romans 7:9, 10, 11. Hence many never go so far wrong, as on the 
    back of communions, convictions, or times of more than ordinary seriousness, 
    the powers of Hell being joined together to stop the fugitive. We now 
    proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To speak of the properties of this captivity. Here 
    we observe that it is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A spiritual captivity, a captivity of the soul. The 
    soul is the most precious part of the man; and therefore the captivity of it 
    must be the most deplorable. All the captivity of men, if they were captives 
    to the Turks or the most barbarous nations extends but to the body. He whose 
    body is in the power of another, his soul and thoughts are as free as those 
    of any. But Satan lays his bands upon the inner man, and, go the body as it 
    will, he holds fast the man, in so far as he holds fast the soul. And,</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is universal. It extends to all the powers and 
    faculties of the soul, the inner man. The natural man's mind is Satan's 
    captive; 1 Corinthians 2:14, "The natural man receives not the things of the 
    Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can be know them, 
    because they are spiritually discerned." The Lord formed the mind of man in 
    him, and endowed it with knowledge, to be the guide of the whole man in the 
    way of happiness; to be the eye of the soul, to distinguish between sin and 
    duty; and the pilot to direct his course through the several rocks and 
    quicksands that lay between him and the shore of the upper Canaan. But in 
    the engagement between Satan and mankind, being wounded by the deceit of the 
    tempter, Genesis 3:5, it fell into the hands of the enemy, who robbed it of 
    its light, and shut up sinners in darkness. Hence they are said to be in 
    darkness, Ephesians 5:8. They cannot see the way to escape, and withal, 
    there is struck up a false light in the mind, which, like wild-fire, leads 
    the soul into pits and snares, causing it to put sweet for bitter, and 
    bitter for sweet, good for evil, and evil for good. They thus "glory in 
    their shame, and mind earthly things," Philippians 3:19. Again, the will is 
    his captive. They have a stony heart, Ezekiel 36:16. The Lord having endowed 
    this faculty with righteousness, and straightness with his own will, for, 
    Ecclesiastes 7:29, "God made man upright," gave the will dominion over the 
    man, that nothing, good or evil, could be done by him without it. But behold 
    it fell likewise into the enemy's hands, who has given it such a set to the 
    wrong side, that no created power can again straighten it; hence, 2 
    Thessalonians 3:5, "The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God." He 
    only can do it. Satan holds it so fast, that it cannot move without the 
    circle of evil he has drawn about it, nor can it will anything truly good in 
    a right manner: Philippians 2:13, "It is God that works in us, both to will 
    and to do of his good pleasure." Satan has loaded it with such heavy chains, 
    that it cannot come to Christ at his call, no more than a mountain of brass 
    can come to a man at his call. "No man," says Jesus, "can come unto me, 
    except the Father who sent me draw him." Farther, the affections also are 
    Satan's captives; Genesis 6:5, "And God saw that the wickedness of man was 
    great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart 
    was only evil continually." The affections being made perfectly holy, were 
    subjected to the guidance of the mind, and the command of the will, and were 
    set in the soul to execute its holy contrivances and will. But they also 
    were taken in this war with Hell; loosed from this bond of subjection to the 
    understanding and will in these things, but nailed to Satan's door-posts to 
    serve him and his work in the soul forever; so that they have no heart for 
    the price put into their hand to get wisdom, and can have no heart to it. 
    But the natural man's joys and delights are arrested within the compass of 
    carnal things, together with his desires, sorrows, and all his other 
    affections.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is a hard and sore captivity. The Egyptians and 
    Babylonians never treated their captives at the rate Satan does his. They 
    are held busy, and even busy working their own ruin, kicking against the 
    pricks, digging for the grave as for hidden treasures. It is their constant 
    work to feed their lusts, to starve their souls; and the design of their 
    master is, that the one may ruin the other. It is their daily employment, to 
    weave snares for their own feet, twist cords to bind themselves over to 
    destruction, and dig pits into which they may fall, and never rise again. In 
    so far as sin is their work, they wrong their own souls, Proverbs 8:36, and 
    show themselves in love with death. This captivity is,</p>
<p align="justify">4. A perpetual captivity. A few years captivity among 
    men, how grievous is it! And men will do what they can to be ransomed. But 
    this conqueror will never quit his captives, unless they be taken from him 
    by Almighty power. Death at farthest looses other captives; "For in the 
    grave," says Job 3:18, 19, "the prisoners rest together, they hear not the 
    voice of the oppressor; and the servant is free from his master." But those 
    who die Satan's captives are so far from being free, that they are ensured 
    to him forever and ever.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is a voluntary captivity, and thus the more 
    hopeless; 2 Timothy 2:26, "They are taken captive by Satan at his will." 
    They need not to be driven. They do not only go, but they run at his call: 
    Romans 3:15, "Their feet are swift to shed blood." Though they were taken in 
    war, and born captives, yet now he is their master, by their own consent and 
    choice, while they choose to serve the devil, and cannot be brought to give 
    themselves to the Lord. It is a bewitching captivity. The sinner once 
    captive to Satan, never cares for his liberty, unless grace changes his 
    heart. He glories in the badges of his slavery; loves his work heartily, and 
    is well pleased with his condition. The gracious proclamation of liberty by 
    Christ sounds in his ears; but he says, I love my master, I will not go out 
    free.—We are now,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To make some practical improvement,</p>
<p align="justify">First, In a use of conviction. Know then, and be 
    convinced, O unconverted sinner, that you are the devil's captive. Are there 
    not many who have never troubled their heads about their state, who never 
    have had anything like a work of grace or conversion upon their spirits? 
    many in whom their hopeful beginnings have been all marred? I would say to 
    every such one, you have been hearing of the case of the devil's captives, 
    and you are the man, you are the woman, as fast in his power as ever 
    prisoners of war were in the hands of their conquerors. you will not believe 
    it, and this is your sin, and also your misery, Revelation 3:17. you will be 
    ready to sign yourselves, and defy the devil; though you have never been, by 
    regenerating grace, delivered from the power of darkness, and translated 
    into the kingdom of God's dear Son, Colossians 1:13. But this is Satan's way 
    with his captives, to put out their eyes; 2 Corinthians 4:4. "He blinds the 
    minds of them who believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of 
    Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them;" that they cannot 
    know where they are, or who it is that has got hold of them. Do you think 
    that it is only witches and wizards who are the devils captives? No, no, 
    Satan may have a full possession of your soul, though his name with you be 
    not Legion, Even praying people, and great pretenders to religion, to 
    righteousness, and sobriety, and those who have turned to a strict course of 
    life, much more to making a profession of religion, may still be children of 
    Hell, as our Savior called the Scribes and Pharisees, Matthew 23:15. And all 
    unregenerate ones are children of wrath, and the devil's captives. He is 
    "the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience;" and they are 
    "the children of wrath," Ephesians 2:2, 3. Will you apply what was spoken 
    before for your conviction?—Try yourselves.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Are you not, O unconverted sinner! carried off from 
    God's gracious presence, into the kingdom of Satan, the kingdom of darkness? 
    What know you of the light of God's countenance shining on your soul? 
    Certainly you were once darkness, Ephesians 5:8. Has there any spiritual 
    saving light broke up in your soul yet? Has the long night of your natural 
    state had a morning yet? Or are you not in the state in which you was born? 
    If you be not in darkness, what means your works of darkness, and your not 
    discerning the transcendent excellence of Christ?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Are you not robbed and stripped of your spiritual 
    ornaments? Where is the light of the mind, the righteousness of the will, 
    the holiness of the affections, which man had before he fell into the 
    enemy's hands, and which are restored in some measure to the ransomed of the 
    Lord?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Are you free to righteousness? are you not under the 
    power of the conqueror? How is it then that you have no power to resist a 
    temptation, that Satan can so easily carry you the way you know to be wrong, 
    over the belly of reason and conscience! Nay are not your lusts upon you 
    like fetters, that you cannot move away from carnal things God-ward?</p>
<p align="justify">4. Are you not quickly spoiled of any beginnings of good 
    which you sometimes meet with? You hear the word, but do not the birds pick 
    it away from you? Have not all your convictions and resolutions gone off by 
    degrees like a morning cloud? How quickly has all the noise within your 
    breast been hushed, and you at much again in love with your lusts as ever!</p>
<p align="justify">Admit the conviction, then, for they who never saw 
    themselves Satan's captives, are never yet made Christ's free men, John 
    8:32, 33, 44, 45. What think you, is the work of grace carried on in the 
    soul as a morning dream? Are the devil's captives brought away, and never 
    know that they were his captives? What way can a soul embrace the proclaimed 
    liberty to the captives, who never saw itself in this condition?—Consider, 
    that this will be the first step to your liberty. The gospel is sent "to 
    open your eyes, and to turn you from darkness to light, and from the power 
    of Satan unto God, that you may receive forgiveness of sins, and an 
    inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in Christ," 
    Acts 26:18. Christ's Spirit begins his work with conviction of sin and 
    misery. He makes the captives to see where they are, whose they are, and 
    what is their case. This rouses them out of their lethargy, makes them prize 
    this liberty; it makes them glad to come away with their deliverer; "O 
    Israel you have destroyed yourself, but in me is your help."—This subject 
    may be improved,</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, In an use of exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">O captive exiles! hasten to be loosed, that you may not 
    die in the pit, and that your bread may not fail, Isaiah 51:14. Stir up 
    yourselves to regain your liberty, and remain no longer at ease in your 
    captive condition. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That a short time's continuance in this state will put 
    you beyond a possibility of liberty: Ecclesiastes 9:10, "Whatever your hand 
    finds to do, do it with all your might; for there is no work, nor device, 
    nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, where you go." Your life is 
    uncertain, and if death carry you off in this condition, you will be carried 
    to the lower prison, and then farewell liberty forever and ever; Luke 13:24, 
    25, "Strive to enter in at the strait gate, for many, I say unto you, will 
    seek to enter in, and shall not be able. When once the master of the house 
    is risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand without, and to 
    knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us, and he shall answer and 
    say unto you, I know you not, whence you are." The servant under the law, 
    though he refused his liberty at the end of six years, yet received it in 
    the year of jubilee. But whoever in this life refuse to come away from 
    Satan's service, shall never see a time after for it. And when you are 
    closed up in the net, it must be without remedy; it will be no comfort to 
    think that you did not imagine it would have come to this. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That now it the time of liberty; 2 Corinthians 6:2, 
    "Behold now is the accepted time! behold, now is the day of salvation!" 
    Christ has paid a ransom for Satan's captives and the liberty is proclaimed 
    in the gospel. Strike in with the season of grace, and come away with the 
    deliverer upon the gracious proclamation. Hear what Christ is saying to you, 
    Song 2:10," Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</b></p>
<p align="justify">HAVING, in the preceding discourse, spoke to the first of 
    the doctrines which we took from this part of the subject, we go on to</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. That Jesus Christ, with the express consent 
    of his Father, has issued out his royal proclamation of liberty to Satan's 
    captives. "He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives."</p>
<p align="justify">In illustrating this doctrine, we shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what this proclamation is.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Explain what liberty is proclaimed in the gospel to 
    Satan's captives.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Mention some of the circumstances attending this 
    proclamation. And then,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Subjoin the improvement of the subject.</p>
<p align="justify">We are,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show what this proclamation is. This royal 
    proclamation issued out by Jesus Christ, is the gospel, the glad tidings of 
    salvation. The gospel is the proclamation of the King of Heaven to poor 
    sinners, in which he proclaims liberty to all the captives of Satan, to whom 
    it comes. The law lays the heavy yoke of the curse upon sinners, the gospel 
    brings the offer of liberty. Here we observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That it is a jubilee-proclamation. You have the law of 
    jubilee, which was every fiftieth year, when seven times seven were over; 
    Leviticus 25:10, "And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim 
    liberty throughout all the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall 
    be a jubilee unto you; and you shall return every man into his possession, 
    and you shall return every man unto his family." It was proclaimed by sound 
    of trumpet, on the day of atonement, verse 9, then all the poor slaves got 
    their liberty, whether their masters were willing to part with them or not; 
    and all those who had been obliged to mortgage or sell their lands returned 
    to the possession of them again. And so it was a proclamation which made 
    many a heart glad. Now, the gospel is such a proclamation, and the time of 
    it is the year of jubilee. Jesus came, Isaiah 61:2, "To proclaim the 
    acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort 
    all that mourn;" compare 2 Corinthians 6:2, "Behold, now is the accepted 
    time! behold, now is the day of salvation!" O! good news, sinners, there was 
    a day of atonement on the cross, and now the trumpet of the gospel sounds, 
    and there is a proclamation, bearing that Satan's captives may now have 
    their liberty, though their master be not willing to part with them; that 
    the mortgaged inheritance of Heaven and God's favor, though forfeited, may 
    be possessed; poor criminals and bankrupts may return to them again.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a conqueror's proclamation to captives. The king 
    of Babylon took the Jews captive, and held them seventy years in captivity; 
    but God raised up Cyrus; Isaiah 45:1–4, and he overturned the Babylonian 
    empire; the destruction of that kingdom was the deliverance of the Jews, for 
    he proclaimed liberty to them to return to their own land. This also was a 
    type of the gospel-proclamation. Satan warred against mankind, he carried 
    them all captive into his own kingdom; and there was none to deliver out of 
    his hand. But King Jesus had engaged him, routed all his forces, overturned 
    his kingdom, and taken the kingdom to himself; Colossians 2:15, "And having 
    spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing 
    over them in it." 1 John 3:8, "For this purpose the Son of God was 
    manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil." And now being 
    settled on his throne, his royal proclamation is issued out, that Satan's 
    captives may again return into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p align="justify">We shall now,</p>
<p align="justify">II. Explain what liberty is proclaimed in the gospel to 
    Satan's captives.</p>
<p align="justify">This is the great subject of the proclamation; and that 
    you may see the riches of this proclamation, know that Christ by the gospel 
    proclaims to every poor sinner to whom it comes,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Liberty from the power and slavery of Satan; Acts 
    26:18, "He turns them from the power of Satan unto God." Every one who is 
    willing to quit their old master the devil, may come away without his leave. 
    Ton are welcome to Jesus the conqueror, and the conquered tyrant shall not 
    have power to keep you. Now, "the Spirit and the bride say Come; and let him 
    that hears say, Come; and let him that is athirst come; and whoever will, 
    let him take of the water of life freely;" Revelation 22:17. He is a strong 
    one, but there is a stronger one than he, who will break his yoke from off 
    your necks, make his iron fetters to give way, like ropes which are burnt 
    with fire. And though, as long as you are here, he will be molesting you, 
    yet he shall never, never gain his former power over you, and you shall at 
    length be completely freed from the least molestation by him; "The God of 
    peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly;" Romans 16:20. He 
    proclaims,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Liberty from the law as a covenant of works; Romans 
    6:14, "You are not under the law, but under grace." Satan's captives are 
    under the law as a covenant of works, and it lays a heavy yoke upon them, 
    namely, perfect obedience, under the pain of the curse: Galatians 3:10, "For 
    as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse, for it is 
    written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things written in the 
    book of the law to do them." This curse they carried away with them when 
    they went into captivity, and it abides on them always, until they be loosed 
    from it. Now, Christ proclaims liberty from this curse, offers to bring 
    sinners from under the dominion of the law, to be under grace, where there 
    is no more curse; Galatians 3:13, "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of 
    the law." Here they are provided with a righteousness imputed to them, and 
    not set to seek it by their own works! where, in case of sinning, the utmost 
    penalty is fatherly chastisement; Psalm 89:30–33. Thus he offers to take off 
    the law's yoke, to set you without the reach of its curse, and to lay on his 
    own yoke, which is easy; Matthew 11:29. Jesus proclaims,</p>
<p align="justify">3. Liberty from the dominion and bondage of sin; Romans 
    6:14, "Sin shall not have dominion over you." Satan's captives are all the 
    drudges of sin. It does not only dwell in them, as it does in the best, but 
    it reigns over them, fills their hearts and hands continually with its work, 
    so that they can do nothing else but sin; Psalm 14:3, "There is none that 
    does good, no not one." It lays its commands on them, which are a law which 
    they cannot dispute, but must obey; it has its several lusts in the heart, 
    which are chains to them as its captives, the handles by which it holds 
    them, and drags them after it. Now, Christ proclaims liberty from this, and 
    his Spirit effects it; Romans 8:2, "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ 
    Jesus, makes them free from the law of sin and death." He will break sin's 
    dominion, loose the chains of unmortified lusts, and set the prisoners free; 
    John 8:32, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." 
    And though sin may dwell for a season, as an unclean, unwelcome guest, he 
    will at length extirpate it wholly. He proclaims,</p>
<p align="justify">4. Liberty from the ruining influence of this present 
    evil world; Galatians 1:4, "Who gave himself for our sins, that he might 
    deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and 
    our Father." This world has a ruining influence on Satan's captives. The 
    things of this world work their destruction, the smiles of it are killing; 
    Proverbs 1:32, "The prosperity of fools shall destroy them;" their blessings 
    are turned to curses; the frowns of it are ensnaring and destructive. The 
    God of this world mixes every cup with poison. The men of this world are 
    ruining one another; and therefore it is said, "Save yourselves from this 
    untoward generation;" Acts 2:40. There is a plague in Satan's family, and 
    each member serves to infect another, to convey sin and death to his fellow. 
    But Jesus proclaims liberty from this pest-house; you may be drawn out of 
    it, Jesus will pluck you as a brand out of the fire; why stay in it, while 
    he proclaims liberty to you from it? Jesus proclaims,</p>
<p align="justify">5. Liberty from the fear, the terror of death and Hell; 
    Hebrews 2:15, "He delivers them who, through fear of death, were all their 
    lifetime subject to bondage." Satan's captives may for a time be secure, 
    fearing nothing; but as soon as their conscience awakens, they will be 
    filled with horror, as perceiving the approach of death and Hell towards 
    them; they can have no comfortable view of another life. Christ proclaims 
    liberty from this; if you will come to him, conscience shall be pacified 
    with the sprinkling of his blood, you shall be set beyond the possibility of 
    perishing; he will be to you an almighty Savior. He proclaims,</p>
<p align="justify">6. Liberty from the sting of death and the evil of 
    afflictions. Though Christ, in his gracious proclamation, does not promise 
    that such as obey his will in it shall never be afflicted; yet he promises 
    that afflictions shall be so far from doing them hurt, that they shall do 
    them good; Romans 8:28, "And we know that all things work together for good 
    to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose;" 
    that though they die, death shall be to them unstinged; John 8:51, "Truly, 
    truly, I say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death." 
    So that they may meet it with that triumphant song; 1 Corinthians 15:55, "O 
    death! where is your sting? O grave! where is your victory?" It shall not be 
    to them what it is to Satan's captives: the serpent's sting, with which it 
    kills the serpent's seed, shall be taken away before it comes near them. 
    Jesus proclaims,</p>
<p align="justify">7. Liberty from the power of the grave; 1 Corinthians 
    15:55, quoted above. Verse 57, "Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory, 
    through Jesus Christ our Lord." Satan's captives are laid up in their graves 
    as in prisons; and when they come out of them at the resurrection, death and 
    the power of the grave will he still hanging about them; so that they shall 
    but change one grave for a worse, namely, for the lake of fire. But Christ's 
    ransomed ones, who come away on his proclamation of liberty, though they go 
    to the grave, yet the power of it over them shall be broken, death shall 
    have no more power over them forever. He proclaims,</p>
<p align="justify">8. Liberty from condemnation; Romans 8:1, "There is 
    therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus." All Satan's 
    captives are condemned malefactors; John 3:18, "He that believes not is 
    condemned already." And the sentence shall be solemnly pronounced against 
    them at the great day; and so they shall be led away "into everlasting 
    burnings, prepared for the devil and his angels;" Matthew 25. This is 
    terrible; but Christ proclaims liberty from it. So soon as you embrace the 
    offered liberty, the guilt of eternal wrath shall be done away, you shall be 
    beyond the reach of condemnation; your standing on the right hand is 
    secured, and the sentence of solemn absolution shall follow. He proclaims,</p>
<p align="justify">9. Liberty of free access to God, with holy boldness; 
    Romans 5:1, 2, "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our 
    Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by faith into this grace 
    wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God." Now, the captive 
    exiles are banished from the presence of God; they can have no access to 
    him, nor communion with him. But our Lord, by his death, has opened the 
    two-leaved gates of his Father's house, and gives free liberty, by open 
    proclamation, to Satan's captives, leaving their master to come in. They 
    have access by one Spirit to the Father.—Jesus proclaims,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Liberty, that is, freedom of spirit in the 
    service of God; 2 Corinthians 3:17, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there 
    is liberty." The Spirit of Christ is called a free spirit, because he makes 
    free. Satan's captives may yield some obedience to God, but it is 
    burdensome, because they act therein as slaves, from a slavish fear of Hell 
    and wrath. But Christ's freemen act from a nobler principle, love; Romans 
    8:15, "For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but 
    you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby you cry, Abba, Father:" 1 
    John 4:18, "There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; 
    because fear has torment; he who fears is not made perfect in love." We now 
    proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To mention some of the circumstances attending this 
    proclamation. Here we observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That the law on which it is founded was the eternal 
    agreement of the glorious Trinity for man's redemption. The eternal law of 
    love and good-will to poor sinners, by which it was provided, that upon the 
    Son of God's laying down his life a ransom for an elect world, they should 
    be delivered from the captivity of sin and Satan, and be made God's freemen; 
    which the eternal Son engaged to do. Accordingly, in the fullness of time he 
    did it, and thereby purchased their liberty. We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That the proclamation was drawn up, and is recorded in 
    the Bible, by the Holy Spirit; Isaiah 55:1, "Ho! every one that thirsts, 
    come you to the waters, and he who has no money, come you, buy and eat; yes, 
    come, buy wine and milk, without money and without price." And what is the 
    whole Bible but a declaration of this liberty, with promises to those who 
    accept of, and threatenings to those who refuse it. The truth and reality of 
    this declaration is sealed by the blood of Christ; "This," said he, "is the 
    New Testament in my blood." So that there is not the least ground to doubt 
    its truth. We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That this proclamation is issued out by our Lord Jesus 
    Christ, with the consent of his Father and the Spirit. The Father has sent 
    him to proclaim liberty to the captives. The Spirit says, Come. A whole 
    Trinity invites Satan's captives to liberty. They have no will that the 
    captive exile should die in the pit; Ezekiel 18:23, "Have I any pleasure at 
    all that the wicked should die? says the Lord God; and not that he should 
    return from his ways, and live?" We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">4. That this proclamation is directed to men, to the sons 
    of men; Proverbs 8:4, "Unto you, O men, do I call, and my voice is to the 
    sons of men." Not to fallen angels, they are excluded from the benefit of 
    the purchased liberty. But the captives in the land of the living, these 
    prisoners of hope, to them is the proclamation directed, without exception 
    of great, yes, even the greatest of sinners; Revelation 22:17, "Whoever 
    will, may take of the water of life freely." Isaiah 1:18, "Come now, and let 
    us reason together, says the Lord; though your sins be as scarlet, they 
    shall be white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as 
    wool." Such are invited, though, they have often refused their liberty, and 
    though they have gone back into their captivity. We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">5. That the first crier of this proclamation was the Son 
    of God in his own person. He made this proclamation first in paradise; 
    Genesis 3:15, "The seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent." 
    Afterwards he took on him man's nature, then came and proclaimed it; Hebrews 
    2:3," The Gospel at the first began to be spoken unto us by the Lord." And 
    he sealed it with his most precious blood, though there were but few who 
    came away upon the proclamation made by him; "Who has believed our report, 
    and to whom bath the arm of the Lord been revealed?" is the complaint of the 
    prophet Isaiah. We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">6. That, being ascended into Heaven, he has appointed 
    criers in his name the ministers of the Gospel, to publish this 
    proclamation, and to invite sinners to accept of this liberty; 2 Corinthians 
    5:20, "Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech 
    you by us; we pray you, in Christ's stead, be you reconciled unto God." This 
    is our work, to proclaim it unto you, to make you sensible that liberty is 
    purchased, and offered unto you. We are the voice of the great crier; Christ 
    cries to you by us. We observe,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, That the place where the proclamation is ordered 
    to be made is in this world; Mark 16:15, "Go you," said Jesus to his 
    disciples, "into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature." As 
    for those who are gone into the other world, the proclamation can reach them 
    no more; the prisoners there are without hope. But while you are in this 
    world, the proclamation is to you, and particularly when in those public 
    assembles where the Lord's people are gathered together to hear it; Proverbs 
    1:20, 21, "Wisdom cries without, she utters her voice in the streets; she 
    cries in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates, in the 
    city she utters her words." It only remains,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. That we make some improvement of the subject. This 
    shall be confined to an use of exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">We would exhort you, O captives of Satan! to comply with 
    the design of this proclamation of liberty; we beseech you, receive not this 
    grace of God in vain. To be more particular, we exhort you,</p>
<p align="justify">1. To be convinced of your state of captivity; deceive 
    not yourselves with thoughts of liberty, while you are really serving divers 
    lusts. Until you see your captive state, what hope can there be of good to 
    be obtained by the proclamation of liberty? We exhort you,</p>
<p align="justify">2. To be willing to come away and forsake your old master 
    and his service. Ah! may not the time past suffice to have done the will of 
    the flesh? 1 Peter 4:3. You have been long under this captivity; had the 
    youngest of you been as long a slave to any man as you have been to Satan, 
    you would have been weary of your situation long before now. O! strive that 
    your spirits may be raised towards your being free, and walk no more 
    contentedly in your chains of divers lusts. You will say, you are not able 
    to come away; but if you were willing, you would not be allowed to remain in 
    your captive state. We exhort you,</p>
<p align="justify">3. To be affected at the heart with the news of the 
    proclamation of liberty. Do not hear it unconcernedly, but hear as those who 
    are nearly concerned in the matter. Take a view of the wretched state you 
    are in, and wonder that there is yet hope. How glad were the Israelites in 
    Egypt and Babylon of the notice they had of their liberty! Your captivity is 
    a thousand times worse, and your heart should leap within you at the voice 
    of the deliverer. We exhort you,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, To accept of the proclaimed liberty, and come 
    away with the deliverer. Give up with your old master, lay by his work, bid 
    farewell to his kingdom, as never to remain more in it. Shake off your 
    fetters resolutely, and embrace cordially the offered liberty of the sons of 
    God. To prevail with you in doing this, we present you with the following 
    motives—</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. Consider that the captivity you are in is a 
    most miserable bondage and slavery; Egyptian, Babylonish, and Turkish 
    slavery and captivity, all in one, are not sufficient to represent it. And 
    this will appear, if you consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That the master is the devil. While you are in your 
    natural state, you are the devil's captive and bond servant, 2 Timothy 2:26, 
    and that by a threefold title—as taken in war, 2 Peter 2:19—as bought by him 
    at a low rate, "you sold yourselves for nothing," Isaiah 52:3, and—as born 
    in his house, Matthew 23:15. Therefore you are called to forget that house, 
    Psalm 45:10, and to come out of his family, and touch not the unclean thing, 
    2 Corinthians 6:17. How wretched must that bondage be where the devil is 
    master! Sure he is a cruel and merciless master, who will take pleasure in 
    your miseries. Do we esteem the case of those wretches so horrible, who, by 
    express compact, are become his? and will we yet contentedly continue in 
    bondage to the same master? Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That the work is sin, called the works of darkness, 
    Romans 13:12. None of his captives are suffered to be idle, he puts a task 
    in their hands, which they must fulfill. One of two things they are always 
    doing while out of Christ; either weaving the spider's web, working that 
    which will not profit at the latter end, more than such a web will be a 
    garment; or, hatching the cockatrice egg, doing mischief and wickedness that 
    will recoil upon you, to your own destruction. This dung-hill work Satan 
    employs his captives in, is most unfitting the heaven-born soul. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That the provision and entertainment is bad and 
    unsatisfying, Isaiah 55:2, "Wherefore do you spend money for that which is 
    not bread, and your labor for that which satisfies not?" The best of this 
    sort, which the natural man has, is to eat dust with the serpent, to suck 
    the breast of filthy lusts, which, though it may feast one's corruptions, 
    poisons the soul; or to eat husks with the swine, Luke 15:16, to feed on the 
    empty things of the world, which can afford no nourishment. Thus, while you 
    ask from him bread, he gives you a stone; while you ask a fish, he gives you 
    a scorpion. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) That the wages of sin is death: Romans 6:23, "For 
    the wages of sin is death." Present death, spiritual, in the separation of 
    their souls from God, for from every natural man God is departed, whether he 
    knows it or not. Death temporal, to come, armed with its sting, and provided 
    with the envenomed arrows of the curse. And death eternal in Hell, where 
    they shall be ever dying, but never shall die. O! shall not the 
    consideration of these things move you to accept of liberty, and come away 
    from such a master, such work, such provisions, and such wages?</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. The liberty proclaimed is most excellent and 
    glorious liberty, Romans 8:21; the glorious liberty of the sons of God; 
    which may create the most surpassing joy in the world. The glory and 
    excellency of it will appear, if we consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The purchaser of it is Christ the King of glory. He 
    it is by whom we have the gospel-jubilee proclaimed in the text. He is the 
    victorious Monarch, who has overcome Satan, and gives liberty to his 
    captives. He is our near kinsman, who has redeemed us by payment of a price, 
    a costly price, even his own precious blood. It was the honor of the Jews 
    that they had their liberty by Cyrus; but how much more honorable is it, to 
    have liberty by Christ! And when such an one has purchased for us liberty, 
    will not you accept it? Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The ransom paid for it; 1 Peter 1:18, 19, "Forasmuch 
    as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver 
    and gold, from your vain conversation, received by tradition from your 
    fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without 
    blemish, and without spot." Never was such a ransom paid for the greatest 
    captive king among men, as for us wretched sinners; even the blood of God. 
    He compassionated the case of the poor captives, laid by the robes of his 
    glory, put his neck under the yoke of the law, endured the wrath of God, the 
    sting of death, and the rage of Hell, and all to purchase this liberty for 
    us. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The party to whom it was paid, to God, even his own 
    Father; Ephesians 5:2, "He gave himself an offering and a sacrifice to God, 
    for a sweet-smelling savor." Satan is but the jailor and executioner, into 
    whose hands men fell, being condemned by the Judge, to whom alone the ransom 
    was due. Hence, in respect of Satan, his captives are said to be redeemed 
    without money, Isaiah 52:3. They are to be set at liberty by main force, 
    being violently wrested out of his hand, Isaiah 49:25.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) The glorious privileges attending this liberty. It 
    is not a naked freedom, which yet would be valuable, but pregnant with many 
    precious privileges. I have told you already, that it is a liberty from the 
    power of Satan, from the law as a covenant, etc. But besides these, many 
    positive blessings and privileges attend it; such as, the freed captives are 
    made free men of the New Jerusalem, they are made citizens of Heaven on 
    earth, and are burgesses there; Ephesians 2:19, "They are no more strangers 
    and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of 
    God." They are incorporated with the society of saints and angels, of whom 
    Christ is the head. They who had their lot before in the kingdom of 
    darkness, have now their lot in these pleasant places.—The freed captives 
    are made children of the family of Heaven; 2 Corinthians 6:18, "And I will 
    be a father unto you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord 
    Almighty." So it is the liberty of the sons of God, for God makes all the 
    freed slaves sons of his house; and whatever children may expect from a 
    father, able and willing to do for them, this they may expect from God. The 
    freed captives are all made first-born: Hebrews 12:23, "The general assembly 
    and church of the first-born, which are written in Heaven." This excellence 
    of dignity and power is put upon them, they are thus highly advanced. As it 
    was with Joseph, he not only got his liberty but was made lord over Egypt, 
    where he had been a slave; so the freed captive is made king: Revelation 
    1:6, "And has made us kings and priests unto God and his Father." This is 
    accomplished in them all, Isaiah 14:2, "They shall rule over their 
    oppressors." They get mastery over their lusts, and shall at last triumph 
    over Satan, Romans 16:20. They shall sit and judge him, 1 Corinthians 6:3. 
    They are made priests also, to offer up sacrifices of praise to God, Romans 
    12:1. O what a change of their work! They are all heirs of God, and receive 
    the double portion. There is not anything which such an one gets, but it is 
    twice as much and good as that which a captive of Satan has. The blessing is 
    the best half; this the captives of Satan want. Lastly, When their minority 
    is over, they shall have a perfect liberty, with the affluence of all 
    things, to an entire completing of their happiness, Romans 8:21. O the 
    glorious day abiding Christ's freemen! Now they have got the word, Roll away 
    the stone, Lazarus come forth; but then this will be added, Loose him and 
    let him go. The great day will begin their eternal jubilee; when death the 
    last enemy shall be destroyed, then shall soul and body return to the full 
    possession of the mortgaged inheritance, and the perfect freedom from their 
    captivity. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) The unchangeableness of this liberty. When once a 
    captive is freed by Christ, all the power and policy of Hell cannot bring 
    him back again into bondage: John 10:28, "And I will give unto them eternal 
    life: and they shall never perish; neither shall any one pluck them out of 
    my hand." See how Paul boasts of this, Romans 8:38, 39. It is true, were 
    there none to preserve this liberty but the believer himself, it might be 
    lost; but it is infallibly guarded against the gates of Hell, by the 
    unalterable decree of God, 2 Timothy 2:19; by his unchangeable love and 
    covenant; by the continual indwelling of the Spirit, and the prevalent 
    intercession of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Consider the eternity of this liberty. Death does 
    not put a close to this liberty, but rather gives a new beginning to it; it 
    shall continue forever, they shall lire forever and ever in the enjoyment of 
    it.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus life and death are set before you, will you accept 
    this liberty or not? May I not say, how shall you escape, if you neglect so 
    great salvation?" Hebrews 2:3. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That it is most unreasonable to refuse it, to remain 
    in captivity after the proclamation of liberty is issued. Would men but make 
    their reason judge between Christ and them, there would be no fear of the 
    cause, Joshua 24:15. Who would refuse their liberty, if they might be made 
    free? liberty from such a master and such work etc; liberty purchased from 
    such a glorious person, by the glorious King, at such a ransom, etc. Consult 
    your reason, your interest, and will you prefer the pleasures of sin for a 
    season, to the eternal rivers of pleasures at God's right hand? Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That every refusal makes your captivity the more firm 
    and hopeless. Satan bores the ear of sinners anew to his door-post on every 
    refusal. Hence none so hard to win, as those who have refused many gospel 
    calls. Tyre and Sidon would be much easier wrought upon than Chorazin and 
    Bethsaida, Matthew 11:21; Ezekiel 3:7; wild Americans, than Scotsmen. For 
    when the gospel does not soften the heart, it is hardened under it. 
    Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That by refusing this liberty, you become the 
    murderers of your own souls. Proverbs 8:36, "He who sins against me, wrongs 
    his own soul; all they that hate me, love death." Hear, sinners, how our 
    Lord expostulates with you on this point, Ezekiel 18:31, 32, "Cast away from 
    you all your transgressions, whereby you have transgressed, and make you a 
    new heart, and a new spirit; for why will you die, O house of Israel? For I 
    have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, says the Lord God; Wherefore 
    turn yourselves, and live you." You have the poisonous cup of your sins at 
    your head, will you drink it? you say, you cannot help it, you must drink it 
    off; our Lord says, Throw it away, it will be your death if you do not. Come 
    to me, and I will free you from this miserable bondage to Satan and your 
    lusts, so that they shall not have that power over you which they have had. 
    "Well, if you will not comply, you are murderers of your own soul with a 
    witness, as really as if you did willfully drink up a cup of poison, or 
    stabbed yourselves with a sword. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">4. That if you refuse, you make the deliverer your enemy, 
    and shall not escape, Hebrews 2:3, The deliverer will turn your destroyer, 
    for neglecting his salvation. The Lamb of God will be as a lion to you, for 
    slighting his offers of grace. They who know not God, and who obey not the 
    gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, shall be punished with everlasting 
    destruction from the presence of the Lord, and the glory of his power, 2 
    Thessalonians 1:8, 9. As the sourest vinegar is made of the best wine, so 
    the fiercest wrath arises from slighting the greatest grace, Proverbs 
    1:24–31. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">5. That you know not how soon you may be beyond the reach 
    of the proclamation of liberty, Luke 13:24, 25. The voice of it is not heard 
    on the other side of death, to which we are fast making way. Do you not see, 
    as in Psalm 90:9, that "we spend our days as a tale that is told?" A 
    new-year's day, and other days adjoining to it, are very ill chosen for 
    reveling, jollity, and carnal mirth; they suit it nearly as ill as does the 
    pretended day of Christ's birth, commonly called Yule-day. Alas! they will 
    give themselves the loose run in these things, because they are now a year 
    nearer the grave and eternity than they were; because they are entered on a 
    new year, the end of which it may be they shall never see. If people will 
    make a difference between such days and others, it would be most suitable in 
    these days to take a solemn and serious view of eternity, and to be making 
    preparations for that day, which will put an end to their years. However, 
    let this time put you in mind of death's approach, and refuse not the offer 
    of grace, which you will have no more, when once death has carried you off 
    the stage. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, That your judgment will be more grievous than 
    that of those who never heard the gospel, if you do not come away upon the 
    proclamation; Matthew 11:22, "But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable 
    for Tyre and Sidon, at the day of judgment, than for you." Remember double 
    stripes are for him who knew his master's will, and did it not; and the 
    hottest place in Hell will be for gospel-despisers. Men may have their lusts 
    and sinful courses cheaper in the dark corner of the earth, than in a land 
    of light.</p>
<p align="justify">We conclude with the following advices. Labor to get a 
    just esteem of your souls, and a due sense of what concerns another life. 
    The soul is the man, as being the best part of the man, the loss of which 
    nothing can ever counterbalance. Matthew 16:26, "For what is a man profited, 
    if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man 
    give in exchange for his soul?" The other life is the life chiefly to be 
    cared for, since that only is the life which will have no end; and a man is 
    happy or unhappy, as his plan for that life is well or ill laid. Be sensible 
    of the real drudgery of sin. It is as real a servitude as ever was in the 
    world, while men serve divers lusts. This is clear from the very light of 
    nature: the consideration of the noble nature of the soul, with the 
    experience of the tyranny of unruly passions, made some heathen moralists to 
    lay it down as a principle, That a wise man is a free man. Wherefore, 
    believe that a holy life is the only true liberty; Psalm 119:44, 45, "So 
    shall I keep your law continually, forever and ever. And I will walk at 
    liberty; for I seek your precepts." He, then, who has the mastery over his 
    own corrupt will and inclinations, who walks in the way of God's 
    commandments, is a person the most free and easy. Lastly, Come to Christ for 
    his redeeming blood and free spirit. Renounce the devil, the world, and the 
    flesh. Receive and improve Jesus, as made of God unto you, wisdom, 
    righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Amen.</p>
