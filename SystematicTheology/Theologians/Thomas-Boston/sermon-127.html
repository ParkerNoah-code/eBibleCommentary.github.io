          1 Chronicles 15:13, "For because you did it not at the first, the Lord
          our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the

          THE ark of God having been brought from Kirjath-jearim, and left at
          the house of Obed-edom, upon the account of the death of Uzza, whom
          God smote, God blessed that man and his house, where the ark was. The
          news of this coming to David's ears, he resolves again to attempt the
          bringing of the ark into his own city, 2 Samuel 6:12. In this
          transaction, observe. 1. That the fear of mismanaging a duty may
          sometimes prevail so far with the people of God, as to make them lay
          by the duty for a time. David had seen how dear a rash touch of the
          ark had cost Uzzah; so, says he, 2 Samuel 6:9, "How shall the ark of
          the Lord come unto me?" The fear of God, by reason of corruption,
          easily degenerates into a slavish fear, which cuts the sinews of holy
          endeavors, and leaves people neither heart nor hand for the work. 2.
          Lay by duty who will, God will always have some that will take it up.
          If David have no will for the ark to be with him, Obed-edom will
          entertain it. Many, in our own day, turn their backs on Christ, and
          his service; shut their hearts against himself, and their houses
          against his worship; but God will always have some that will put their
          shoulders to his work. 3. They are great fools that lay aside duty.
          They stand in the way of their own mercy, and deprive themselves of
          that blessing that attends the service of the Lord. 4. The people of
          God, when they take up duty again, will see themselves the greater
          fools that ever they laid it by. Well, David, being resolved on the
          work, proceeds with great caution and circumspection, as we see in the
          verses preceding that of our reading: the reason of all which we have
          in the text.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In which words there is, 1. An old story brought fresh to mind: "The
          Lord our God made a breach upon us." The stroke reached Uzzah, and cut
          him off, while all the rest were safe; yet the holy man looks on that
          as a stroke to the whole congregation. 2. There is the cause of the
          stroke: The stroke was dreadful and astonishing, but the holy man lays
          not the blame on God, but on themselves, and so justifies God. The sin
          of the Levites was the cause of the stroke: "For because you did not
          at the first," namely, sanctify yourselves when you first began to
          remove the ark from Kirjath-jearim. They did not sanctify and prepare
          themselves, by solemn prayer and services, in consideration of God's
          will, as to the way of carrying the ark; as if he had said, We have
          smarted already by your carelessness, beware of it therefore at this
          time. The sin of all the congregation, wherein he takes in himself
          among the rest, also produced the stroke; and that because it was his
          and the people's duty to have been acquainted with the word of the
          Lord; and the oversight of the Levites did not excuse them. We sought
          him, indeed, bringing the ark, the symbol of God's presence, from the
          place where it was, to be in the midst of us; but our way of doing
          marred all. It was God's ordinance that the ark should be carried on
          the Levites' shoulders, Numbers 4:15, and 7:9; but the Philistines had
          put it on a cart. God did not punish them for this transgression, and
          this emboldened Israel to follow their example: but they learned by
          sad experience, that God would not bear that in the one, which he did
          in the other.—From this subject, I take this
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE, God is highly displeased with persons who perform duties,
          but are not careful to perform them in a right manner.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In discoursing which, I shall show,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. How it comes to pass that men perform duties, but are not careful
          to perform them in a right manner.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. How the Lord testifies his displeasure against such persons.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. Why is the Lord so highly displeased?</p>
        <p align="justify">IV. Make some practical improvement.</p>
        <p align="justify">I am to show,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. How it comes to pass that men perform duties, but are not careful
          to perform them in a right manner.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because to perform duty is the easiest part of religion, but to do
          it in a right manner is very difficult; and few people have a heart to
          manage the difficulties of religion. Ease is sweet; and in other
          things we see it very ordinary for men to take what is most easy
          instead of what is most profitable. It is an easy thing to think, to
          hear, to eat bread, and drink wine; but to plough up our corruptions,
          to engage in good earnest in the service of God, and to get the heart
          in a case for fellowship with Christ, is not easy, and sloth prevails.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because the bare performance of duties is within the reach of all,
          the performing of them in a right manner is beyond the reach of the
          most part. Natural abilities will serve for the one, gracious
          abilities are necessary for the other. John 15:5, "I (said Jesus) am
          the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in me, and I in him, the
          same brings forth much fruit; for without me you can do nothing." "By
          faith (says Paul, Hebrews 11:4), Abel offered unto God a more
          excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he
          was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and by it he, being dead,
          yet speaks." Grace, you see, is necessary, and grace is very rare. A
          natural man is conjured within the circle of self, beyond it he cannot
          move; this is his principle, and this is his end. Nature cannot carry
          a man above itself, more than the mouth of a river can be higher than
          the spring-head. This, then, mars all, so that the service can no more
          be acceptable to God, than a man sowing his master's ground with his
          own seed, to reap it for himself.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. By the bare performance of duties, men attain the base and low ends
          which they propose to themselves in the service of God; namely,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Peace of mind, such as it is. The consciences of some are but
          half awakened; thus a little thing quiets them, even the external
          performance of duties; but should these neglect duties altogether,
          they could have no peace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) It gains a man credit in the world, and that is a strong cord to
          draw men to the outside of duties, namely to be seen of men, and to
          have glory of men, as our Savior expresses it, Matthew 6:1, 2. It is
          to them no small matter to have a name to live; to be called good is
          affected by such as are at no pains to be good.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What shall we say of these that will set about duties, and attend
          sacraments, even while they are sure that they will be mocked and
          reproached for it by the wicked?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. It is good in so far as they are carried over these things;
          for, alas! there are some so pitifully weak, that they will be blown
          over with the wind of the mouth of the wicked. A broad laugh, or silly
          taunt, out of the mouth of the profane, is an unanswerable argument
          against religion and seriousness, to some who are in the cause of
          Christ like silly doves without heart. Such as are thus chargeable are
          very inconsiderate; Christ gives a solemn warning to them, Mark 8:38,
          "Whoever, therefore, shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this
          adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of man be
          ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father, with the holy
          angels." We doubt not but a hypocrite may come this length. We do not
          wonder if even a miser, a covetous wretch, part with his money to buy
          land; neither need we wonder if a hypocrite should sacrifice credit
          among the profane, to gain credit among the godly. He does but as a
          man on a ladder, tread on the lower step to win to the higher.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Because men may get duties done, and keep their lusts too. For
          instance, they may go to a communion-table one day, and the next to
          the table of devils. But to perform duties in a right manner, is
          inconsistent with peace with our lusts: Psalm 66:18, "If I regard
          iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me." Hence, over the
          belly of an express commandment, people will venture to the Lord's
          table without self-examination, or at least without searching to the
          quick. They cannot, however, communicate aright without a due
          attention to it. No, indeed. Says the apostle, 1 Corinthians 11:28,
          "But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and
          drink of that cup." Many, notwithstanding, can communicate without it,
          and keep their lusts too; here is the hellish advantage. There are
          secret lusts, which the man is unwilling to disturb, therefore he will
          not light the candle and search, lest he be obliged to cast out the
          old leaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Because most men have low and mean thoughts of God, Malachi 1:6–8,
          "A son honors his father, and a servant his master, if, then, I be a
          father, where is mine honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear?
          says the Lord of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name: and
          you say, Wherein have we despised your name? You offer polluted bread
          upon my altar; and you say, Wherein have we polluted you? In that you
          say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. And if you offer the blind
          for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and sick, is
          it not evil? offer it now unto your governor, will he be pleased with
          you, or accept your person? says the Lord of hosts." It is not every
          one that knows the Lord. Many men worship they know not what, and
          therefore they offer him for worship they care not what. If men had
          awful apprehensions of that God whom they worship, as a God greatly to
          be "feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence
          of all them that are about him," Psalm 89:7, doubtless they would see,
          that there is none in Heaven or earth like him, and they would worship
          him in another manner.—Therefore the apostle, to engage men to take
          care how they perform duties, says, "Let us have grace, whereby we may
          serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear: for our God is a
          consuming fire," Hebrews 12:28, 29.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I am now to show,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. How the Lord testifies his displeasure against such persons. He
          does so,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. By withdrawing from them in religious services: "Son of man," says
          God by Ezekiel, chapter 11:3, "these men have set up their idols in
          their hearts, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before
          their face; should I be inquired of at all by them?" And by Hosea he
          says, chapter 5:4, "The spirit of whoredom is in the midst of them,
          and they have not known the Lord." It is granted, ordinances are the
          galleries wherein the King is held; they are the trysting-places where
          Christ meets with his people; but if they be not gone about in a right
          manner, they will be but an empty sepulcher: "Why seek you the living
          among the dead?" The living God is not to be found in a dead worship;
          when men withdraw their hearts from the service of God, then he
          withdraws himself from them; and it is but sorry entertainment a man
          can have at this feast, when the Master goes away.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. By rejecting their services, Malachi 1:13, "You said also, Behold
          what a weariness is it! and you have snuffed at it, says the Lord of
          hosts; and you brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the
          sick; thus you brought an offering: should I accept this at your
          hands? says the Lord." God will not accept of such duties, whatever
          pains men may take about them, Isaiah 1:11, "To what purpose is the
          multitude of your sacrifices unto me? says the Lord." It is better to
          go halting on in the right way, than to be going straight in the way
          of error: "The labor of the foolish wearies every one of them, because
          he knows not how to go to the city," Ecclesiastes 10:15. It may well
          be applied to the duties of some, what is said, Habakkuk 2:13, "The
          people shall labor in the fire, and the people shall weary themselves
          for very vanity." To labor in the fire signifies great pains, and
          great disappointments; they work in the midst of scorching flames, and
          what they do produce consumes between their fingers, they get no good
          of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. By spiritual strokes upon their souls. There is a curse denounced
          against them, Jeremiah 48:10, "Cursed be he who does the work of the
          Lord deceitfully;" and Malachi 1:14, "But cursed be the deceiver which
          has in his flock a male, and vows and sacrifices unto the Lord a
          corrupt thing. This will pierce the soul; and they are of two sorts:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) They are deadening strokes; these are silent blows, arrows that
          fly without noise from the hand of an angry God into the soul; "Make
          the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut
          their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears,
          and understand with their hearts, and convert, and be healed," Isaiah
          6:10. Sometimes men are like Saul among the prophets, but afterwards
          they are knocked on the head, it may be on a communion Sabbath, and
          from that time God answers them not. Many are sprightly professors for
          a while, but at length God is so provoked, that their hearts are
          deadened, their affections withered, their consciences stupefied,
          their souls blasted, and they are then prepared to be pruned off, and
          cast over the hedge.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Quickening strokes, whereby the man's name is changed; he is
          Mager-Missabid. The conscience is made like Mount Sinai, where nothing
          but thunder, lightning, and the sound of the trumpet, are to be heard.
          God takes the filthy rags of their lifeless duties, wraps them in
          brimstone, and then sets them on fire about the sinner's ears; so
          that, like the house built upon the sand, to which the man betook
          himself for shelter, the whole falls into ruins. As to this, you will
          observe what the prophet declares, Hosea 5:11–14, "Ephraim is
          oppressed, and broken in judgment; because he willingly walked after
          the commandment. Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to
          the house of Judah as rottenness. When Ephraim saw his sickness, and
          Judah saw his wound; then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to
          king Jereb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound. For
          I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of
          Judah; I, even I, will tear, and go away: I will take away, and none
          shall rescue him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. By strokes upon their bodies. Sometimes the Lord has mingled his
          people's blood with their sacrifices. Thus he did with Nadab and
          Abihu, Leviticus 10:1, 2. A wrong look into the ark cost the men of
          Bethshemesh dear: "The Lord smote of the people fifty thousand and
          threescore and ten men," 1 Samuel 6:19. Uzziah, taking hold of the
          ark, was struck dead, 2 Samuel 6:7. And the apostle tells, 1
          Corinthians 11:30, that for profaning the Lord's supper, "many (among
          the Corinthians) were weak and sickly, and many sleep," that is, were
          dead. One dies before his time, even in his strength; another falls
          sick, it may be after a communion. At communions there is a great
          throng; perhaps one has got a cold, another has caught cold, but
          unworthy communicating has more often done the deed.—I shall inquire,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. Why is the Lord so highly displeased?</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because God commands his service to be done in a right manner. The
          matter and right manner of performing duties are, in the command of
          God, linked together. He will have his service well done, as well as
          really done. We must serve God with a perfect heart and a willing
          wind, for the Lord searches all hearts, and understands all the
          imaginations of the thoughts; if we seek him, he will be found of us;
          but if we forsake him, he will cast us off forever, 1 Chronicles 28:9.
          Masters on earth challenge to themselves a power to oblige their
          servants, not only to do their work, but to do it so and so; and
          though they do the thing itself, yet if not in the manner required, it
          cannot be accepted. So they brought the ark, but they brought it on a
          cart, which was opposite to the command, for it should have been on
          the shoulders of the Levites; and therefore their service was rejected
          with vengeance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because the doing of a duty in a wrong manner alters the nature of
          it, and makes it sin. Hence the plowing of the wicked is sin. Hence
          prayer is accounted a howling on their bed, Hosea 7:14. And unworthy
          communicating is not to eat the Lord's supper, 1 Corinthians 11:20. If
          a house be built of never so strong timber and good stones, yet if it
          be not well-founded and right built, the inhabitant may curse the day
          he came under the roof of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because duties not performed according to the right order, are but
          the half of the service we owe to God, and the worst half too. The
          Jews had it written about the doors of their synagogues, "Prayer
          without intention is as a body without a soul." A skeleton of bones
          without the flesh would have been a very abominable sacrifice to have
          laid upon God's altar; no less abominable are our services, when the
          heart is not engaged, and when the soul is not lifted up to God: "God
          is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and
          in truth," John 4:24.

          Lastly, Because duties thus performed are very dishonorable to God.
          See again, Malachi 1:6–8. Now, God is a holy God, and will be
          sanctified in them that come near him, and before all the people he
          will be glorified, Leviticus 10:3. He is a jealous God in the matter
          of his worship, Joshua 24:18.

          IV. I am now to make a practical improvement. And this,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. In a use of information. We may hence see what a mercy it is that
          we have a pure worship among us at this day; a worship neither defiled
          by idolatry, nor corrupted by superstition, but after the divine
          order, according to the pattern shown on the mount. It is dangerous to
          join in a way of worship not warranted by the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Let this fill us with a holy reverence of God when we approach his
          presence in this venerable ordinance, Psalm 89:7. Let us know and
          remember, that the God with whom we have to do is a heart-searching,
          holy, and jealous God, who will not hold them guiltless that profane
          his ordinances. Was he so displeased with Belshezzar, for abusing the
          vessels of the temple? how much more with us, if we profane the
          symbols of the body and blood of his Son! The danger is great, both
          for soul and body. But there are two sorts that are ready to abase
          this.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The stiff-necked careless sinner will cloak his contempt of
          communicating, and his sloth with this: "If it be so, then we will do
          best not to meddle with it." But, O Sirs! is there not an odds between
          rushing on the sacrament, and forsaking it? Assure yourselves this
          contempt of the sacrament is damning. God can reach a blow to you,
          though you stand far off from his table; and so much the more, that
          you slight the love-token of a dying Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The poor broken-hearted sinner will be ready to drink up
          discouragement from this, fearing that he may be the person on whom
          the Lord will make the breach. But, poor soul! I would say to you,
          Where will you be safe, if you keeps yourself without the ranges? the
          sword of the Lord may overtake you there, for the neglect of your
          duty. Therefore come, though trembling, venture yourself at his feet;
          acknowledge, that if he should make you a monument of his justice, he
          is most just, you deserve it. A trembling hand may receive a pardon.
          Be diligent to prepare yourself; and when you have done all, lay no
          stress on anything, but flee to Christ, and get him between an
          offended God and your soul. Dry stubble may be safe before a consuming
          fire, if there be a crystal wall between it and the fire.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I conclude with exhorting all that intend to sit down at the Lord's
          table tomorrow, to take heed how you communicate. I would urge you to
          do it in the right order. You have heard the danger of an opposite
          conduct; this may be sufficient under this. Another motive is, that
          duty done in a right manner, and that only, has the blessing connected
          with it: mark Matthew 24:26, "Blessed is that servant whom his Lord,
          when he comes, shall find so doing." A man may pray a thousand times,
          and never be heard; go from one communion to another, and never be
          sealed; one sincere groan from the heart will do more than all these.
          If you mismanage this sacrament, your souls may get such a stain that
          they will never cast again; and if you manage it rightly, you may get
          such a taste of the goodness of the Lord as you never got before. With
          this view, see that you be right as to your state; that you be the
          friends of the Bridegroom, or you have no right to sit down at the
          marriage-feast. It is not the due order, for persons dead in sin to
          sit down at the table of our Lord; it is an ordinance only for those
          who are quickened, and made spiritually alive; it is the children's
          bread, and therefore they only, who are the children of God by faith
          in Christ Jesus, have a right to it. Endeavor to be in a right frame;
          to have grace in exercise; a holy hunger, faith, repentance, and love.
          It is not enough that you have oil in your lamps, you must also have
          your lamps trimmed, and the oil burning. Your graces must be in
          exercise. If this be your state, and this be your frame, then surely
          it will be good for you to draw near to God at his own table: "They
          that thus wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall
          mount up on wings like eagles, run and not be weary, walk and not
          faint."
