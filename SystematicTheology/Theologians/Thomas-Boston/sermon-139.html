          1 John 4:14, "We have seen and testify, that the Father sent the Son
          to be the Savior of the world."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          JOHN, the beloved disciple, in his epistles, is still breathing love;
          love is the string he delights peculiarly to harp upon: so he is
          either magnifying God's love to us, or pressing our love to God and to
          one another. And his darling subject, love, is no narrow one, but most
          comprehensive: it comprehends both the gospel and the law, both faith
          and works. The love of God to man, is the great doctrine of the
          gospel, the object of faith; men's love to God and to one another, is
          the great doctrine of the law of the ten commandments, and the object
          of holy practice. And there is a near relation between the two: God's
          love is the fountain, our love the stream; the former the original
          holy fire, the latter the flame kindled by it. Accordingly, in the
          text, there is a display of the love of God, for moving us to love one
          another; the which display of divine love is the substance of the
          gospel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here then we have the gospel, which all the apostles were in one voice
          to preach unto the world: "We have seen and do testify, that the
          Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world." And therein we may
          consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The gospel or glad tidings itself, namely, that the Father sent the
          Son to be the Savior of the world. Here is glad news to the world,
          Christ's mission. The promise of this mission was made to fallen Adam
          in paradise: believers under the Old Testament lived and died in the
          faith of it. But the apostles testified it as a thing performed; the
          Father sent, or has sent the Son. The party sent is the Son of God,
          our Lord Jesus Christ; no other was fit for this mission. The party
          sending, from whom he had his commission, was the Father, the first
          person of the glorious Trinity. None of a lower dignity could send one
          of his dignity. The character in which he was sent, is, "the Son
          Savior of the world." So the words are without any supplement; of
          which there is no need here. So Christ is said to have come a teacher
          from God, John 3:2, that is, in the character of a divine teacher. As
          one is sent ambassador to such a court, that is, constituted by his
          prince ambassador to that court, and accordingly sent away in that
          character; so Christ was constituted, nominated, and appointed by his
          Father, "Savior of the world," and so sent away into the world in that
          character. The world is the world of mankind indefinitely, ruined by
          Adam's sin, John 3:16, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only
          begotten Son, that whoever believes in him, should not perish, but
          have everlasting life." Therein God's love toward man appeared, Titus
          3:4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The certainty of this gospel or glad tidings. All the apostles
          witnessed with one mouth this great truth: and they witnessed the same
          as eye-witnesses, having seen the Savior, and conversed with him, and
          read his commission for that effect, and behold heaven's seal again
          and again set to it in his miracles. And this matter of their
          witnessing from their eye-sight, was so much stood upon, that the
          apostle Paul, who was not called to be an apostle until after Christ's
          ascension, was allowed first to see with his eyes, before he should
          bear witness, Acts 26:16, "I have appeared unto you for this purpose,
          to make you a minister and a witness both of those things which you
          have seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto you."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. It is the great truth and testimony of the gospel, that the
          Father has sent his Son Jesus Christ in the character of Savior of the
          world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In prosecuting this doctrine, I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Take notice of some things imported in this testimony.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Open this character, "Savior of the world," in which Christ was
          sent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. Apply.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall take notice of some things imported in this testimony.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The world needed a Savior; otherwise one had not been provided for
          them by him who does nothing in vain. It was a sick world, east into a
          desperate illness by eating of the forbidden fruit; and needed a
          physician to cure the distemper, Matthew 9:12, "Jesus said unto them,
          They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick." It
          was a cursed world, staked down under wrath by the sentence of the
          broken law; and needed a Savior to remove the curse, and bring in the
          blessing, Acts 3:26, "God having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to
          bless you," etc. It was a lost world, lost to God, lost to themselves,
          lost to all good, lost and perishing under the wrath of God; and it
          needed one to seek and save them, Luke 19:10, "For the Son of man is
          come to seek and to save that which was lost."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. None of inferior dignity to the Son of God could be the Savior of
          the world. No man, nor angel, was able to sustain the character of
          Savior of a lost world: the work which lay to that office was above
          the reach of the whole creation, Revelation 5:3, "And no man in
          Heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the
          book, neither to look thereon." Here was a trial of the divine love to
          man; his case was hopeless and helpless from all the creatures: and it
          issued in that, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only
          begotten Son," John 3:16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Christ was sent Savior of the world from heaven's proper motion.
          The plot to save man, was concerted entirely without him. The world
          did not meet, and send one to the court of Heaven, with a petition for
          a Savior, that a Savior was granted to their earnest entreaties and
          supplications: but the Father, of preventing free love, sent his Son
          Savior of the world. The world's need spoke loud, but they themselves
          were quite silent; and yet their needs spoke no louder than those of
          the fallen angels: and sovereign free grace heard the voice of man's
          need, while it stopped its ears to the voice of the needs of fallen
          angels, Titus 3:4, "But the kindness and love of God our Savior toward
          man appeared."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Christ is fully furnished for the saving of a lost world. His being
          sent in that character, speaks his ability to answer it, Hebrews 7:25,
          "Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost, that come
          unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them."
          There is no case to be found in the world, but what there is a remedy
          to be found in Christ for. Whoever in the world shall die, they shall
          not die because there was no help for their case in the Savior, but
          because they did not employ him, or put their case in his hand. The
          Savior of the world is certainly able to save the world; since he was
          sent of God in that character.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, The salvation of lost sinners of the world of mankind is
          very acceptable to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus, as well as to
          himself, otherwise he had not sent his Son Savior of the world, 1
          Timothy 2:3, 4. "For this is good and acceptable in the sigh of God
          our Savior; who will have all men to be saved." Hence it is called
          "the pleasure of the Lord," Isaiah 53:10. "The pleasure of the Lord
          shall prosper in his hand." So he is said to make the marriage for his
          Son, and to send forth to bid to that marriage, Matthew 22. Whence it
          is evident, that there is no impediment to the salvation of sinners by
          Jesus Christ, on Heaven's part; it is pleasing to the Father, to his
          Son, and to his Spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. I shall open this character, Savior of the world, in which Christ
          was sent; and for that end inquire into two things. 1. In what sense
          Christ is Savior of the world. 2. What is the business committed to
          him as such.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, In what sense Christ is Savior of the world. A Savior is a name
          of honor, and a name of business. It is an honorable thing to save and
          help the miserable; to be destined, appointed, and called to that
          employment: but the honorable post has business annexed to it; it will
          not do without activity, which success is expected to attend, as in
          the case of a teacher, physician, and the like. Now, one may be a
          Savior, even as a teacher or physician, of a society, two ways.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) In respect of office, as being called to and invested with the
          office of saving, teaching, or curing that society. And thus one is
          Savior, teacher, or physician of that society, before ever he save,
          teach, or cure any of them. In this respect one may be called an
          official Savior, teacher, or physician.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) In respect of the event and success, as actually and eventually
          saving, teaching, and healing. As the former arises from an
          appointment put upon such a one; this arises from the work he manages
          in virtue of that appointment. In this respect one may be called an
          actual and eventual Savior. Thus it is said, Nehemiah 9:27. "And,
          according to your manifold mercies, you gave them saviors, who saved
          them out of the hands of their enemies. This premised, we say,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Our Lord Jesus is the actual and eventual Savior of the elect only,
          in whose room and stead only he died upon the cross, according to the
          eternal compact passed between him and the Father, in the covenant of
          grace, otherwise called the covenant of redemption; for these are not
          two, but one and the same covenant. Thus the apostle calls him "the
          Savior of the body," Ephesians 5:23. that is, of the elect, who make
          up the body whereof he was appointed the head from eternity, and in
          whose name he contracted with the Father in the eternal covenant. And
          he is their Savior eventually, as actually saving them, Matthew 1:21.
          "And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name Jesus;
          for he shall save his people from their sins." None but these will
          ever truly employ him as a Savior, or put their case in his hand: and
          there are none of them but will certainly employ him sooner or later,
          Acts 13:48. "As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed." John
          6:37. "All that the Father gives me, shall come to me; and him that
          comes to me, I will in no wise cast out."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Our Lord Jesus Christ is the official Savior, not of the elect
          only, but of the world of mankind indefinitely; so our text calls him
          "Savior of the world." Agreeably to which, God in Christ is called
          "the Savior of all men," but with a speciality, "the Savior of them
          that believe," 1 Timothy 4:10. The matter lies here: like as a prince,
          out of regard to his subjects' welfare, gives a commission to a
          qualified person to be physician to such a society, a regiment, or the
          like; and the prince's commission constitutes him physician of that
          society; so that though many of them should never employ him, but call
          other physicians, yet still there is a relation between him and them;
          he is their physician by office; any of them all may come to him if
          they will, and be healed: So God, looking on the ruined world of
          mankind, has constituted and appointed Jesus Christ his Son Savior of
          the world: he has Heaven's patent for this office; and wherever the
          gospel comes, this his patent is intimated. Hereby a relation is
          constituted between him and the world of mankind; he is their Savior,
          and they the objects of his administration: so that any of them all
          may come to him, without money or price, and be saved by him as their
          own Savior appointed them by the Father.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That Christ is thus the Savior of the world, appears, if you consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Scripture testimony, which is plain. Our text expressly calls him
          so: and so do the believing Samaritans profess their faith in him,
          John 4:42. "We have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed
          the Christ, the Savior of the world." You have the appointment of
          Heaven very plain thereanent, John 3:16. "God so loved the world, that
          he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him, should
          not perish, but have everlasting life;" even as the brazen serpent
          lifted up on the pole in the wilderness was the ordinance of God for
          healing to the stung persons of the whole camp of Israel. Hence
          Christ's salvation is called the common salvation, Jude verse 3; a
          salvation which any of mankind sinners may lay hold on. So the
          Savior's birth is said to be "glad tidings for all people," Luke 2:10,
          11; which it could not have been, if he had not been a Savior for all
          people. Wherefore he himself testifies, that he came to save the
          world, John 3:17. "God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the
          world; but that the world through him might be saved." Chapter 12:47.
          "I came not to judge the world, but to save the world." This was his
          office; to save sinners indefinitely; not this or that sort of
          sinners, but sinners of mankind indefinitely, without exception, 1
          Timothy 1:15. "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
          acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners;"
          the lost, Luke 19:10. "The Son of man is come to seek and to save that
          which was lost;" 2 Corinthians 5:19. "God was in Christ, reconciling
          the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them." To
          the same purpose he declares himself "the light of the world," namely,
          by office, John 8:12. that whoever will employ him may have the light
          of life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, If it were not so, he could not warrantably be offered with his
          salvation to the world indefinitely, but to the elect only; more than
          he can be offered lawfully to fallen angels, who are not within his
          commission as a Savior. For the ministerial offer can never lawfully
          carry the matter beyond the bounds of Christ's commission from his
          Father. But Christ and his salvation may be warrantably offered to the
          whole world of mankind-sinners, with assurance that whoever of them
          will employ him to save them, he shall be saved: Mark 16:15, 16. "Go
          you into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." "He
          who believes, shall be saved; but he who believes not, shall be
          damned." Moreover, if it were not so, the unbelief of hearers of the
          gospel, not elected, their not coming to Christ for salvation, could
          not be their sin: for it can never be one's sin not to do a thing he
          has no warrant for; not to employ one to save him, whom God never
          appointed to be his Savior. So it is not the sin of fallen angels,
          that they believe not in Christ for salvation, because they are not
          within the Savior's commission; nor of those who never heard of
          Christ, because his commission was never intimated to them. But not
          believing in Christ the Savior, is the sin that ruins the hearers of
          the gospel who do at all perish, John 3:19. "And this is the
          condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved
          darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil." Finally,
          if it were not so, the elect themselves could never believe in Christ,
          until in the first place their election were revealed to them; which
          is contrary to the stated method of grace: for they can never believe
          on Christ for their salvation, until they see him to be a Savior for
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are two things further to be remarked on this head.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The ground upon which Christ might be constituted Savior of the
          world by office. And that was the sufficiency of the merit of his
          death and sufferings: for though Christ died only in the room and
          stead of his elect, on the cross sustaining their persons only,
          according to that John 10:15. "I lay down my life for the sheep;" yet
          the price paid for them being of infinite worth, was sufficient in
          itself to save the whole world. The bread provided for them, namely, a
          crucified Christ, was sufficient to give life to and feed, not them
          only, but the whole world of mankind: and therefore he might be
          appointed Savior of the world, John 6:33, 51. "The bread of God is he
          which comes down from Heaven, and gives life unto the world. I am the
          living bread, which came down from Heaven: if any man eat of this
          bread, be shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is my
          flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The reason why he actually was constituted Savior of the world.
          Among several reasons that might be given for this, I shall only
          observe here this one, namely, that it was put upon him as a piece of
          honor, the reward of his great service, in laying down his life for
          and instead of those who were the objects of his Father's electing
          love, Isaiah 49:6, 8. "And he said, It is a light thing that you
          should be my servant, to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore
          the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the
          Gentiles, that you may be my salvation unto the end of the earth. Thus
          says the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of
          salvation have I helped you: and I will preserve you, and give you for
          a covenant of the people." The Father for that cause invested him with
          "all power in Heaven and earth," Matthew 28:18. John 5:21, 22. "As the
          Father raises up the dead, and quickens them; even so the Son quickens
          whom he will. For the Father judges no man; but has committed all
          judgment unto the Son." And it was a reward suitable to his work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, What is the business committed to him as Savior of the
          world. Not to descend into particulars here, we may take it up in
          these two.

          1. It is to save sinners from their sin, Matthew 1:21. "You shall call
          his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins." Satan
          ruined the world by bringing sin upon them: thereby they were bound
          with the cords of guilt, the image of God in them was defaced, they
          were polluted and made loathsome, and shut up in the hands of a
          strange lord. God has appointed Christ Savior of the world, that
          sinners may come to him, and be delivered from their sins, 1 John 3:8.
          "He who commits sin, is of the devil: for the devil sins from the
          beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he
          might destroy the works of the devil." It was an inveterate disease,
          the cure of which was quite beyond the reach of any mere creature, as
          far as the raising of the dead is: so he was appointed Savior in the
          case, Psalm 89:19. "I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have
          exalted one chosen out of the people."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is to save sinners from misery, to free them from destruction,
          Hosea 13:9. "O Israel, you have destroyed yourself, but in me is your
          help." They are by sin made objects of wrath, laid under the curse of
          the broken law, liable to revenging wrath for time and for eternity:
          he is appointed to save them from all this, upon their coming to him,
          and employing him for that purpose, Isaiah 32:2. "And a man shall be
          as an hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as
          rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a
          weary land." Sin let in a deluge of miseries on the world, which flow
          about the sinner continually in greater or lesser measure: he is a
          Savior to dry it up to them, 1 Corinthians 1:30. "But of him are you
          in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness,
          and sanctification, and redemption."

          1. Behold here, admire, and believe the great love of God to a lost
          world, in providing a Savior, and such a Savior, for them, even his
          own Son. The Scripture speaks of this in a very high strain, John
          3:16. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,"
          etc. There was a man-love in God, Titus 3:4. "But the kindness and
          love of God our Savior toward man appeared;" a love of the kind,
          mankind. It has appeared in two eminent instances.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) In securing, by an irreversible decree, the salvation of some of
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) In providing a Savior for the whole of the kind, constituting his
          own Son Savior to the lost family of Adam indefinitely. Believe it
          with application to yourselves. If upon this a secret murmur begins to
          go through your heart, But it was not for me; crush it in the bud, for
          it is a bud of Hell. If you are not one of the devil-kind, but of
          sinful mankind, it was for you. The Father gave Christ a Savior for
          you, that if you would believe on him, you should not perish: he sent
          his Son from Heaven with full instructions and ample powers to save
          you, if you will believe. And is not this love? Believe it, and it
          will be the way to let you in to a sight of more love.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Behold here a broad and firm foundation of faith for all and every
          one of you; that you may come to Christ, whatever your case is, and
          claim his righteousness and his whole salvation for yourselves; that
          you may betake yourselves to him as the refuge appointed for you by
          the Father, from sin and wrath, with as much freedom as a stung
          Israelite might have looked to the brazen serpent; that you may wholly
          trust on him, that he will save you from sin and wrath. For he was
          sent of the Father Savior of the world; and if by the Father's
          appointment he is Savior of the world, he is by office your Savior,
          and my Savior, since we are members of that world of mankind: so that
          we may by faith claim his saving us from sin and wrath; as a scholar
          bred in a place may claim teaching of him who is appointed master of a
          free school in that place; as those of a congregation may claim
          preaching of their own minister; and as the wounded in battle may
          claim healing of their own physician, who has a commission to be
          physician to their regiment. "For we testify, that the Father sent the
          Son Savior of the world."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Sinners living in their sins, pining away, and about to perish
          eternally in them, are without excuse. For "we testify, that the
          Father has sent the Son Savior of the world:" John 15:22. "If I had
          not come, and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they
          have no cloak for their sin." Sinners are destroyed with their living
          and raging lusts, they are run down with them as with running sores,
          their souls are bleeding to death with them as with mortal wounds: in
          this case they hold on over the belly of their convictions; and they
          say, they cannot help it. One cannot help his swearing; another his
          sensuality; another his pride, passion, covetousness, gross ignorance,
          his old corrupt unrenewed heart. But the truth is, you will not have
          it helped, John 5:40. "You will not come to me, that you might have
          life." If you cannot help it, you have a Savior who can help it, and
          would certainly help it if you would employ him. Know it of a truth,
          if any of you shall perish, and if you go on in your sins you shall
          perish, you shall not perish for want of a Savior. At the tribunal of
          God, the devils may say, we could not be saved from our sins; for
          there was no Savior appointed for us: the pagans may say, we could not
          be saved; for though we were within the compass of the Savior's
          commission, yet we never heard of it, it was never intimated to us.
          But what will you have to say, that you are not saved from your sins;
          when your Savior shall sit judge upon you, and condemn you, to suffer
          the vengeance of eternal fire, for that you would have none of him,
          nor his salvation; you would not be saved from your sins, would not
          put your case in his hand; though he had his Father's commission to be
          Savior of the world, and your Savior, and it was read to you, you
          would not receive him as your Savior, but would rather die in your
          sins than employ him?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Believers themselves may be ashamed and confounded, for that
          iniquity prevails so against them. Alas! it is a sad sign the Savior
          is little employed among us. Little living by faith, makes little
          holiness of life. O look to that sin that so easily besets you, that
          has so often wrecked your soul's case: believe you have a Savior for
          it, and employ him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">USE II. For trial.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          Try whether the Savior of the world by office is your actual Savior;
          whether or not he has saved you. Think not that Christ puts off his
          saving of sinners until they come to Heaven: true, they are not
          completely saved until they be there; but if your salvation by Christ
          is not begun here, you shall never get there: Titus 3:5. 6. 7. "Not by
          works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy
          he saved us by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
          Spirit; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
          Savior: that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs
          according to the hope of eternal life." And you have no right before
          the Lord to his table, if he has not been a Savior to you actually and
          eventually, in having saved you from sin and wrath initially, though
          not completely: for if it is not so, it is an evidence you have not
          received him as your Savior; for no sooner is he employed by a sinner
          but he begins to save that sinner.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Mark 1. If Christ has really begun to save you, you will have the
          saved man's thoughts of sin, and of the wrath of God. If a drowning
          man were pulled alive out of a water, or a filthy stinking puddle; and
          standing at the side of it, looking to it after that gliff; what would
          be his thoughts of that water, that puddle, where he was once over
          head and ears, and almost gone? Such will be your thoughts of sin, and
          of the wrath of God. You will have awful and reverend thoughts of the
          wrath of God above all awful things: Hebrews 12:28. 29. "Wherefore we
          receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby
          we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear." For our
          God is a consuming fire." Matthew 10:28. "Fear not them which kill the
          body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is
          able to destroy both soul and body in Hell." Of all terrors it will be
          to you the most terrible. Those in the state of wrath, they are either
          so as they have lost their senses in it; they know not where they are,
          they are dreaming of some pleasant place; and so they go on peacefully
          in their sins, undisturbed with thoughts of wrath: or else they have
          some terrible apprehensions of it; but there is something more
          terrible; and therefore they will rather sin than suffer the hardships
          attending duty, yes attending mortification: or else their heart is
          fire-hot with the terror of the wrath of God, and in the meantime, at
          least, key-cold of love and child-like affection to the God whose
          wrath it is. But the saved soul looks on it as of all things the most
          awful, but in the meantime with a child-like reverence of and
          affection to that God whose wrath it is.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Mark 2. You will have a transcendent esteem of and love to your
          Savior, 1 Peter 2:7. "Unto you which believe he is precious." His
          conscience-purifying blood, his soul-sanctifying Spirit, will be more
          valuable to you than a thousand worlds. You will desire them above all
          things, pant and long after them, and yes more and more of them: and
          in comparison of them, all the world will be but trifles in your eyes,
          which you would be content to part with to gain them: Matthew 13:46.
          "The merchantman when he had found one pearl of great price, he went
          and sold all that he had, and bought it." Luke 14:26. "If any man come
          to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children,
          and brethren, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my
          disciple." Philippians 3:8, 9. "Yes doubtless, and I count all things
          but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord:
          for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but
          dung that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own
          righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the
          faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith."

          Mark 3. Lastly, You will be groaning under the remains of the disease
          of sin you are saved from; your conscience will witness you would
          gladly be wholly rid of it, Romans 7:24. "O wretched man that I am,
          who shall deliver me from the body of this death!" Your souls will be
          longing for the complete salvation; that the enemies you see today,
          you may see no more forever; that you may get a complete victory over
          all your corruptions: Romans 8:23. "We ourselves groan within
          ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our

          Receive the Lord Jesus, then, O sinners, in that character wherein his
          Father sent him, as the Savior of the world, and your Savior. You are
          lost in your sins, and lost under the wrath of God, and the curse of
          the law; come to him for his whole salvation. Employ him, put your
          case in his hand as your Savior by the Father's appointment; and
          slight him no more.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. Consider you need a Savior. Your disease of sin will ruin
          you, if you be not saved from it. The guilt of it will stake you down
          under wrath, and the wrath of God will sink you into Hell. And while
          sin keeps its dominion over you, be sure the guilt is not removed:
          Matthew 9:12. "They that be whole need not a physician, but they that
          are sick." Genesis 2:17. "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and
          evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat thereof,
          you shall surely die."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 2. There is no Savior besides Christ, Acts 4:12. "Neither is
          there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under
          Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved." All others are
          physicians of no value. All your own endeavors will not save you, nor
          anything any creature can do for you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 3. He is able to save you, Hebrews 7:25. "He is able to save
          them to the uttermost, that come unto God by him." Whatever be your
          case, there is infinite merit in his blood to take away the deepest
          guilt, 1 John 1:7. "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from
          all sin." There is an infinite efficacy of his Spirit to sanctify the
          most unholy, 1 Corinthians 6:11. "And such were some of you: but you
          are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name
          of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God." If you doubt it, you
          dishonor Christ, and his Father who sent him, Psalm 89:19. "Then you
          spoke in vision to your holy One, and said, I have laid help upon one
          that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 4. He is willing to save you, Revelation 22:17. "And the Spirit
          and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears, say, Come. And let
          him that is athirst, come. And whoever will, let him take the water of
          life freely." The only thing wanting is your willingness to be saved,
          Jeremiah 13:27. "Woe unto you, O Jerusalem, will you not be made
          clean? when shall it once be?" There is no fear of being rejected if
          you come, John 6:37. "Him that comes to me, I will in no wise cast
          out." He has taken on him the office of Savior of the world, and he
          cannot refuse the business of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 5. Lastly, You must either receive him as your Savior from sin
          and wrath, according to his commission from Heaven; or you will be,
          and be held refusers of him for your Savior, after his Father has
          nominated and commissioned him for that effect. Consider how you will
          answer that before the judgment-seat.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question. How shall I receive him, and employ him? Answer. By faith,
          by believing on him. Being convinced of your sin and cursed state, and
          desiring to be saved from both, believe Christ is your Savior by his
          Father's appointment; and so wholly trust on him as a crucified
          Savior, for his whole salvation, on the ground of God's faithfulness
          in his word.
