    Godliness, Necessary to Make a Godly Minister</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">A Sermon Preached at the Ordination of Mr. Robert 
    Lithgow, at Askirk, March, 7, 1711.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">1 Timothy 4:7, "And exercise yourself rather unto 
    godliness."</p>
<p align="justify">TWO things are necessary to make a good minister of Jesus 
    Christ; namely, sound doctrine, and a holy godly life. A good minister is 
    one nourished up in, or with the words of faith, verse 6. He does not only 
    hold forth the breasts of the word to others, but sucks them himself, and 
    grows by them. The apostle will have Timothy to study a holy accuracy in 
    both these; so to hold by the words of faith grounded on divine testimony, 
    as to refuse all profane and old wives' fables: that is all impertinent 
    discourses that have no foundation in the Word of God, and have no tendency 
    to the promoting either of faith or holiness. These he does in contempt call 
    old wives' fables, which, whether true or false, are yet unprofitable and 
    profane; or impure and muddy, unworthy of the heavens and stars, according 
    to the notion of the word; and therefore, as a Greek, not to be brought to 
    the temple. In the text he calls him to the diligent study of true 
    godliness, in which,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider the connection. And, or but exercise yourself 
    rather unto godliness. The refusing of the one, and embracing of the other, 
    must go together. There is an opposition between the two. Such impertinences 
    may nourish men's lusts, but cannot feed their souls in godliness. There is 
    no suitableness in them for that end, more than in ashes to feed our bodies. 
    They have no word of divine appointment for that end, which though they were 
    suitable, yet would be absolutely necessary for their efficacy; and 
    therefore men's souls will lose by them instead of gaining. But there is a 
    pleasant harmony between the words of faith and true godliness. The words of 
    faith are the doctrine according to godliness. There is a suitableness 
    between them. And the words of faith have a word of divine appointment, 
    making them the means of holiness. John 17:17; Romans 10:17. Holiness again 
    casts a divine splendor about the truths of God, to discover them in their 
    glory. "For if a man," said our Savior, "will do his will, he shall know of 
    the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." Hence the 
    Christian's practice is, walk in the truth; and his faith of the principles 
    of religion, is speaking the truth in love, Ephesians 4:15; which shows us, 
    that were truth more received in the world, there would be fewer of profane 
    lives: and were there more holy hearts exercised unto godliness, there would 
    not be so many unsound heads.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The exhortation itself, which is not to be taken 
    comparatively, as if of two good things here, exercising unto godliness were 
    the best, but simply and absolutely. The ministers of Christ, that would be 
    good ministers of Jesus Christ, are simply to refuse these profane and old 
    wives' fables, and in opposition to them, to exercise themselves to 
    godliness; to bend their studies towards the advancing of godliness in 
    themselves, and in the people. Godliness here, comprehends the whole of 
    religion. It is a conformity to God in the whole man. To this end we must 
    exercise ourselves. The word properly signifies such exercise as wrestlers 
    and runners use, to which the apostle frequently alludes; which was with all 
    their might and skill, that they might gain the victory, being trained up to 
    it by frequent practice. It is plain from the following verse, that the 
    apostle opposes the exercise unto godliness, unto bodily exercise, which 
    denotes external exercises in religion, by which the body is exercised, but 
    not the spirit, to its advancing in holiness; which, therefore, are not 
    religion indeed, or godliness. Such as abstaining from certain meats, 
    marriage, and such like things, verse 3. Man is not a mere machine, a lump 
    of earth, and therefore godliness cannot consist in bodly exercise. He has a 
    soul which is his better part. It is a spirit, as God is a spirit, and 
    religion exists there. The exercise unto godliness then, is heart exercise, 
    soul exercise; laboring and wrestling to get the soul wrought up into a 
    conformity to God, in holiness, which may sometimes be alone, (without 
    bodily exercise,) acceptable unto God. But bodily exercise can never be 
    acceptable without it, seeing it derives all its value from the soul 
    exercise, which spiritualizes it. The apostle does not simply condemn 
    bodily exercise. Men may fast, abstain from marriage, and do such things as 
    may best contribute to the prosperity of the soul. They may, and must 
    exercise their tongues, in praying, preaching, and the like; but in all 
    these things they must be spiritual, exercising their hearts unto godliness, 
    which lies inwardly.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE.—A heart exercised unto godliness, as it is 
    necessary unto all; so it is especially necessary to him, that would be a 
    good minister of Jesus Christ. In discoursing upon this, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what this heart exercise unto godliness is.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The necessity of the exercise of the heart to 
    godliness, to make a good minister of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I am to show what this heart exercise unto godliness 
    is.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It pre-supposes a man to be truly godly. That 
    professor or minister that is not godly can never exercise himself to 
    godliness. It is impossible to act without a principle of acting, and 
    exercise does naturally require a power of it. He can never exercise himself 
    to running, that wants feet to run with; or to wrestling, who wants arms; 
    nor the ungodly exercise themselves to godliness; on the contrary, "an heart 
    they have exercised with covetous practices." There is more haste than good 
    speed, when men run to be leaders of the Lord's people, before ever they 
    have been taught to follow Christ among them. Serious men will not dare 
    adventure on that great work, until they have examined themselves in the 
    point of personal holiness, and had some comfortable account of themselves 
    therein. Our very calling, supposes us to be holy, Deuteronomy 33:8. A slave 
    to Satan and lusts, cannot be very meet to be a man of God, nor does it suit 
    well to preach the words of life, with the grave cloths of an unregenerate 
    state upon us. Where it is so, it is sad. For the minister himself, that is 
    an awful hedge about the mountain; "Unto the wicked God says, what have you 
    to do to declare my statutes, or that you should take my covenant in your 
    mouth? seeing you have instruction, and cast my words behind you." It is a 
    dreadful work to be ferrying over others, with our own backs to Immanuel's 
    land. The conversion of every graceless man is a wonder, but the conversion 
    of a graceless minister is a double wonder; therefore, when the Word of God 
    increased, and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, 
    it is added, and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. 
    There is here particular notice taken of the conversion of priests. The more 
    frequently holy things go through men's hands, and do not make them better, 
    they harden them the more. It is sad also for the people. They that begin 
    not at home, in their own breasts, to ruin the devil's kingdom, will not 
    readily set themselves to do much execution against it abroad. And if the 
    Lord begin a good work in a soul it is hard for people in the pangs of the 
    new birth, to fall into the hands of those who have had no experience of 
    these things in their own souls.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Making religion our business. In this the apostle gave 
    himself a pattern to us. "Herein," says he, "do I exercise myself to have 
    always a conscience void of offence, toward God and toward men." Godliness 
    should be our great work, how to advance it in ourselves and others. Now we 
    will make religion our business, if we take it not only by fits and starts, 
    but make it our daily work, as men exercise themselves in their callings. 
    That is a sad character of whom Job says, "will he delight himself in the 
    Almighty? will he always call upon God?" But see our duty as angels of the 
    churches, Revelation 4:8. "They rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, 
    holy, Lord God Almighty, which was and is, and is to come." The priests and 
    Levites, in their attendance in the temple, "were to lift up their hands in 
    the sanctuary, and bless the Lord." Godliness is that holy fire, which we 
    are to watch, that it go not out at any time, in ourselves or others. For 
    ministers or people to make religion only their sabbath-day's work is but 
    Pharaoh's religion, to serve God when we have nothing else to do. If the 
    heart be allowed to rove, and lie carnal all the week, no wonder that it be 
    ill to gather for a sabbath; and that the affections be ill to kindle, that 
    lie drenched all the week in carnal worldly things. Again, we make religion 
    our business, if whatever our exercise be, we make godliness still the scope 
    of it. "For me to live," says Paul, "is Christ, and to die is gain." This 
    then, should be the scope, that all the several lines of our life and 
    actions, may meet there as in the center. We have many things to do as 
    Christians, and much as ministers; but happy they, that make this the scope 
    of all, in public and private. The most holy minister on earth, while he is 
    feeding others with the one hand, has need to be putting into his own mouth 
    with the other; and it would likely do others the more good, that we had the 
    relish of it on our souls. How sweet might our work of preaching, 
    catechizing, reading, and studying, be to us, when thus followed; not 
    studying and preaching just for preaching's sake, but for godliness's sake: 
    that is, in effect, for God's sake. And if in reading and meditation, we be 
    obliged to go even without the compass of the holy ground, yet to manage it 
    so, as to bring and consecrate the spoil to the service of the tabernacle.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It imports a vigorous following of it, as wrestlers 
    and runners ply their work vigorously. The apostle will have those that 
    serve the Lord "to be fervent in spirit;" seething hot, as the word imports; 
    Romans 12:11. The word of the Lord, in Jeremiah's breast, was as a burning 
    fire shut up in his bones. When it is thus as a fire in the heart, it will 
    not readily die in our mouths. Though burning lips with a dead heart, is but 
    bodily exercise that will not profit; and though it may gain credit with 
    men, God will account of it no more than as a potsherd covered over with 
    silver dross. It was John the Baptist's commendation "that he was a burning 
    and a shining light." Much need have we to be lively, for our own sake, and 
    the sake of others.</p>
<p align="justify">4. A resoluteness, over the belly of all opposition. 
    "You, therefore," says Paul to Timothy, "endure hardness as a good soldier 
    of Jesus Christ;" we must thus act, as those who strive for the mastery. 
    Levi will always finds himself the son of the hated, if he set himself to 
    answer his name, and set himself to join his own heart, and the heart of 
    others to the Lord. Satan will oppose the exercise of godliness in all, but 
    especially in ministers; because a lively minister is most likely to make a 
    lively people, and a dead minister can scarcely fail to make a dead people. 
    To be a little more particular, I will touch at four things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. We should exercise ourselves to the knowledge of these 
    things pertaining to godliness, that we may be full of eyes, and "by reason 
    of use, have our senses exercised to discern both good and evil." Therefore, 
    "we must meditate upon these things, and give our hearts wholly to them, 
    that our profiting may appear to all." Solomon lay down ignorant, and arose 
    wise as an angel of God. Bezalel and Aholiab got the art of making all 
    manner of work and utensils for the tabernacle, in an extraordinary way from 
    the Lord, but others behooved to learn it, and be taught by them. We must be 
    at pains to get knowledge, and therefore give attendance to reading. We will 
    find many books useful, but there are four, the study of which are necessary 
    to make a good minister of Jesus Christ. These are, 1. Jesus Christ himself, 
    who is that body of divinity which the Holy Spirit teaches all his scholars, 
    particularly those whom he fits for the work of the ministry. "For we preach 
    not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord. For God who commanded the light to 
    shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the 
    knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ." There is no 
    saving knowledge of God, but in him. All is in him, not only subjectively, 
    but objectively, "In him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and 
    knowledge. And in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." Ah! 
    how foolish are they that turn over many volumes, while this lies by 
    neglected. "The labor of the foolish wearies every one of them; because he 
    knows not how to go to the city." This the apostle resolved to make his 
    study. "For I determined," says he, "not to know any thing among you, save 
    Jesus Christ, and him crucified." Shame and blushing may cover our faces 
    when we think on this.</p>
<p align="justify">The second book is that of our own hearts, ourselves. The 
    beasts, Revelation 4:8, were full of eyes within. It is sad when the heart 
    is a sealed book. Three things, said Luther, make a good minister, 
    temptation, prayer, and meditation. Temptation makes the man know his own 
    heart, if he be attentive to observe it: for it makes characters both of 
    grace and corruption appear. It is likely to be the best sermon that is 
    taken out of this book, among the rest.</p>
<p align="justify">The third book is God's word, the Bible. "All scripture 
    is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, 
    for correction, for instruction in righteousness. That the man of God may be 
    perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works." If we would be good 
    Christians, or good ministers, we must study this, not simply as a book of 
    knowledge, that we may speak of the truths contained in it; but as a book of 
    saving knowledge, that we may feel the power of the truths of it on our 
    hearts, and may, as the original has it, Romans 6:17, be delivered into that 
    form of doctrine, as melted metal cast into a mold, comes out with the form 
    thereof upon it.</p>
<p align="justify">The works of God make the fourth book. Providence is a 
    river continually bringing down golden ore, in gathering of which much of 
    the exercise of godliness consists. "Whoever is wise, and will observe these 
    things, even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord." And it 
    should be the exercise of ministers in particular, who are to be full of 
    eyes before, to observe the motions of their great Master in his works as 
    well as otherwise. The watchman that is not asleep, is supposed to see the 
    sword coming.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We should be exercised in combating the lusts of our 
    hearts, beginning the war against the devil at home. Like Paul, "we should 
    keep our bodies under, and bring them into subjection; lest that by any 
    means, when we have preached to others, we ourselves should be castaways." 
    How sad will it be, if we be keepers of the vineyards of others, yet keep 
    not our own, but let it be as the garden of the sluggard! We never want 
    matter for this exercise; if we be secure, at any time, it is not because 
    our foes are expelled from the house, but because we see them not, or have 
    lost heart for the struggle.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We should be exercised to the performing of our 
    duties, and that in a spiritual manner. Many are the duties of Christianity 
    and of the ministry, and we should have that mark of sincerity, "that we 
    have respect unto all God's commandments." We need eat no idle bread. And we 
    must exercise ourselves to be spiritual in them all, acting from a right 
    principle, in a right manner, for a right end. "Blessed is that servant, 
    whom his Lord when he comes, shall find so doing." If these things be 
    wanting, what we do will be but loathsome bodily exercise. What avails it 
    though we speak with the tongue of angels, without a principle of love to 
    God, and the good of souls. Though we should waste our lungs and whole 
    bodies, it is of no avail, if meanwhile the base heart be swelling with 
    pride. If our work be a sacrifice to self, the fatter the more abominable to 
    God.</p>
<p align="justify">4. We should be exercised in the life of faith, without 
    which, in vain will we attempt the other parts of the exercise of godliness. 
    "We must live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved us and gave himself 
    for us." I take this to be the soul's constant traveling between the 
    fullness in Christ, and the emptiness, nothingness, misery and poverty in 
    itself. This we may take up in these two things. 1. A continual use-making 
    of the blood of Christ, to take away our guilt, and new defilement, which we 
    contract in everything. The laver stood beside the altar, in which they were 
    to wash their hands and their feet before they approached the altar, though 
    in the morning they had bathed themselves. "Even he who is washed, still 
    needs to wash his hands and his feet." 2. A continual use-making of the 
    Spirit of Christ, for sanctification. The coals with which the priests were 
    to burn incense in the temple, were to be taken from the altar of 
    burnt-offering. And without the Spirit of Christ, we and our duties will be 
    but a dead lump. There is a fullness of merit and spirit in him. Happy they 
    who are exercised by faith to bring it in as a flood into their guilty and 
    barren souls. We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show the necessity of the exercise of the heart 
    unto godliness, to make a good minister.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is necessary to make a man faithful in his work, 
    and to cause him take God for his party, with whom he has to do. "Knowing 
    the terror of the Lord, we persuade men." If the fear of the Lord be not on 
    our spirits, to counterbalance the fear of men, we cannot avoid being 
    ensnared in unfaithfulness. But a heart exercised to godliness, will lead us 
    on to act, as in the sight of God, whether in public or in private, that no 
    souls perish through our default. Hence a man will not offer what cost him 
    nothing; because, let the people be ever so few or injudicious, he is to 
    offer it to the Lord. He will not keep up anything of the mind of God that 
    may be profitable to souls, for God is his party.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is necessary to give a man a sense of the weight of 
    the work, and the worth of souls, without which he cannot be a good 
    minister. 2 Corinthians 5:9, 10. It is a weighty work. "For we are unto God 
    a sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish. To 
    the one we are the savor of death unto death; and to the other, the savor of 
    life unto life: and who is sufficient for these things?" But it will sit 
    light on men that are not exercised to godliness, for how can we have a 
    sense of the worth of the souls of others, if we keep not up the sense of 
    the worth of our own souls?</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is very necessary to fit a man to suffer for truth. 
    The Lord sometimes calls ministers to seal the truths which they have 
    preached, with their blood. Such days have been, and yet may be. And a good 
    minister must say, "None of these things move me, neither count I my life 
    dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry 
    which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace 
    of God." But alas! how will we be able for this, if we feel not the power of 
    truth on our own souls. The exercise of godliness has carried out some to 
    suffer for Christ, when they could speak little for him; while many learned 
    heads but ungodly hearts, have betrayed him.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is necessary to give a man insight into the mind of 
    God. "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will show 
    them his covenant." Heavenly truths appear certainly in another luster to 
    the exercised soul than to others. And the interruption of this exercise, 
    will make the great things of God's law appear even as a strange thing to 
    them, who before have tasted the sweetness of them. When the heart is 
    sealed, the Bible will be found sealed too. If they be not sensible of it in 
    the time, they will be sensible of it after the veil is taken away. An 
    exercised heart is one of the best commentaries on the Bible, when the soul, 
    upon the reading of it, can say, "As we have heard, so have we seen in the 
    city of our God."</p>
<p align="justify">5. To make a man one that has interest in the court of 
    Heaven. I intend not to put the exercise of godliness in the room of 
    Christ's intercession. But sure it is, that the prayers of those who are 
    favorites of Heaven, have much influence. It is of importance to think how 
    the prophet, to convince the priests that God was displeased with them, puts 
    them to try their interest in the court of Heaven, Malachi 1:9, "And I pray 
    you beseech God, that he will be gracious unto us: this has been by your 
    means: will he regard your persons? says the Lord of Hosts."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is most necessary to fit us for the 
    performance of the several duties of our calling, whether in preaching, 
    administering the sacraments, visiting families, or the sick. Our great 
    business is to bring souls to Christ, and to preach his unsearchable riches; 
    and the law itself must be preached still, in view to Christ, as the only 
    way to union with God, and communion with him, and as the alone fountain of 
    true holiness; and not to feed people with barren discourses of Christless 
    morality. This is a great work: the apostle calls for prayers for his help 
    in it, Colossians 4:3, 4. Much need of personal acquaintance with him, for 
    that end. For God to reveal his Son in us, that we may preach him among the 
    people. Alas! What hopes can we have, that the word should have weight with 
    others, if it have none with ourselves. That is a stinging word, "But if 
    they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, 
    then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of 
    their doings." If they did not turn, but would go to Hell, they should go 
    with a witness. To speak powerfully in the demonstration of the Spirit, this 
    is necessary. The heart makes the best oratory. If lusts live at peace in 
    our own bosoms, then preaching against them in others, we will hear a voice 
    from within to cool our zeal, saying, as David, "deal gently with the young 
    man for my sake." But if a man be exercised in combating his own lusts, it 
    will put an edge on his own zeal, when he comes to his own weak side. It is 
    exercise unto godliness that makes a man speak seasonably, and to the cases 
    of the people; and he who is most exercised about his own heart, bids 
    fairest for opening up the hearts of others; for as face answers to face in 
    water, so does the heart of one Christian to that of another. And for this 
    very cause, are matters of exercise laid in to ministers. "God," says Paul, 
    "comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them 
    which are in trouble, by the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted 
    of God. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and 
    salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which 
    we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and 
    salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us then, my brethren, study the exercise of 
    godliness. Let this be our great work, if we would either save our own 
    souls, or the souls of others. This will be our only comfort in a dying 
    hour, "that in simplicity and in godly sincerity, not by fleshly wisdom, but 
    by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, holding 
    forth the word of life;" and this will be our comfort, when we must leave 
    our pulpits to others, and go to the tribunal of our Master. The crown of 
    glory will be sure to such wrestlers. But doubly miserable will we be, if 
    while we preach to others, we ourselves be castaways.</p>
<p align="justify">To you, the people, I would say: 1. Embrace godliness, 
    and be exercised unto it. It belongs to you as well as to us. You have no 
    dispensation to be vile more than we. Ungodliness will ruin you eternally; 
    "for without holiness no man shall see the Lord." Study to be a lively 
    people. A dead people will do much to make a dead minister. Many a time the 
    minister comes out to the people, in bands laid on for their sake.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Take kindly whatever is said or done by us for the 
    advancing of godliness. It is your good the Lord's servants will seek. And 
    true wisdom would learn you to love him best, that crosses your corruptions 
    most, whether in doctrine or discipline.</p>
<p align="justify">We are dying ministers, preaching to dying people. Other 
    persons will shortly get our pulpits, and your seats. Let this be our joint 
    exercise while we live, and then we will not be afraid to die.</p>
<p align="justify">In vain will we press men to bring forth fruit to God, 
    while they are not married to Christ, and there is no marriage with Christ, 
    without dying to the law. Romans 7:4. Dare any look God in the face with 
    their best works, but through the veil of the flesh of Christ? Will we press 
    men to conformity to God, and not send them for it to Jesus, "who is the 
    brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image of his person," whom 
    he sent down from Heaven, that men beholding him by faith, "might be 
    transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the spirit 
    of the Lord." An eternal barrenness will be on our souls, if influences of 
    grace for duty, come not from Heaven; and the falling dew shall sooner make 
    its way through the flinty rock, than influences of grace come from God to 
    us, but through him whom the Father has constituted the head of influences. 
    "For it pleased the Father, that in him should all fullness dwell." There 
    can be no good fruit but what grows on this vine, John 15:1–6. Let men 
    otherwise exercise themselves to the greatest strictness and mortification, 
    it will be found at length, not exercise to godliness, but to ungodliness; 
    "seeing he who honors not the Son, honors not the Father who sent him." 
    Amen.</p>
