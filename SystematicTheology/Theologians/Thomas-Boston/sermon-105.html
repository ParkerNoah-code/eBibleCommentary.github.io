    Genesis 6:9, "Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations."</p>
<p align="justify">IN the two preceding verses we have the destruction of 
    the old world determined, verse 7, and the preservation of Noah by special 
    favor secured, verse 8. When that generation for their sins was to be swept 
    away by a deluge, Noah is God's favorite, safety and protection from the 
    common stroke is determined for him. Hereupon a question natively arises, O 
    what sort of a man was Noah, who was so highly favored? It is answered in 
    the words of the text, "Noah was a just man, and perfect in his 
    generations." Wherein we have,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Noah's character; he "was perfect;" not legally, but 
    evangelically. He was a man of integrity, downright for God; not following 
    the wisdom and way of the world, but studying in all things to approve 
    himself to God. This character of his is raised, from the consideration of 
    the time wherein he lived, "He was perfect in his generations;" in the 
    generation before the flood, and the generation after it. The former was a 
    generation of general corruption, verse 12, wherein the seat of wickedness 
    and apostasy ran so high, that it carried all before it; yet even in such a 
    time Noah kept his feet, and made his way against the stream, though he was 
    very singular. This is the man that finds favor with God in a day of wrath 
    against the generation, that is safe while others are swept away in the 
    anger of God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. How Noah came to reach such a character; "He was a 
    just man." It refers not to his life; for the perfection or integrity 
    ascribed to him comprehends all in that point; but to his state; he was a 
    justified man, justified before God by faith in the promise; Genesis 3:15. 
    For so runs the original, "Noah a just man was perfect," etc. Noah held by 
    the righteousness of faith for himself, and preached it to others, as we 
    learn from Hebrews 11:7, "By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not 
    seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by 
    the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which 
    is by faith." 2 Peter 2:5, "God spared not the old world, but saved Noah the 
    eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the 
    world of the ungodly." And not only so, but he taught and practiced the 
    righteousness of a holy life; while that generation, slighting the faith of 
    the promise, and going off from the doctrine of free grace therein held 
    forth, to acceptance by works, after the example of Cain, Genesis 4:5, ran 
    into all immorality, and casting off of good works, in their practice, until 
    they were swept off the earth for their loose lives; which is the native 
    consequent of legality. There were others, I doubt not, besides Noah, 
    justified persons in that generation, and holy too; at least Methuselah, who 
    died in the year of the deluge, and Shem, Noah's son; but this is added 
    concerning Noah, that he "was a just man," to show that he could not have 
    attained that excellency in his generation, but that he was justified by 
    faith; the promise being the only channel of the conveyance of grace.</p>
<p align="justify">Two doctrines are deducible from the words.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. In the most declining generation, wherein sin 
    and wickedness come to the greatest height, God has still some, though few, 
    that retain their integrity, and cleave to him and his ways.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing this doctrine, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Evince the truth of the point.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Show how it is that the declining of a generation 
    comes to be so very general, that so very few are left retaining their 
    integrity.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Why some, though few, are still left retaining their 
    integrity in such a generation.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Lastly, Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall evince the truth of this, That in the most 
    declining generation, wherein sin and wickedness come to the greatest 
    height, God has still some, though few, that retain their integrity, and 
    cleave to him and his ways." It has been found so in all ages of the church. 
    In the old world there was a Noah; in Sodom a Lot; among the children of 
    Israel in Egypt a Moses, who all retained their integrity, and cleaved to 
    the Lord and his ways. Of Moses it is said, Hebrews 11:24–26, that "when he 
    was come to years, he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 
    choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy 
    the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater 
    riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he had respect onto the recompense 
    of the reward." There was a Caleb and a Joshua in the generation in the 
    wilderness; in Elijah's days "seven thousand;" in Isaiah's days "a small 
    remnant;" Isaiah 1:9, and likewise "a remnant" in Jeremiah's days; Jeremiah 
    15:11. In the Jewish apostasy under Antiochus, there were some that were 
    tortured for the cause of God, and refused to "accept of deliverance" on 
    sinful terms; Hebrews 11:35. When Christ came into the world, there were 
    some "waiting for the consolation of Israel;" and when the Jewish nation was 
    ruined at the destruction of Jerusalem, there was "a remnant according to 
    the election of grace." In the grand apostasy under the New Testament, there 
    were still "two witnesses" left; Revelation 9.</p>
<p align="justify">II. How is it that the declining of a generation comes to 
    be so very general, that so very few are left retaining their integrity, 
    that they may be for signs and wonders in the day wherein they live?</p>
<p align="justify">1. The corruption of human nature is the spring-head of 
    it; Genesis 6:5, "And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the 
    earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil 
    continually." In the most favorable times for religion, in the most 
    advantageous circumstances men can be placed in, man's nature has still a 
    strong bias to the wrong side; therefore no wonder, that whatever set a 
    church or people get at sometimes towards religion, they do through time 
    decline and go all wrong, according to the natural bias.</p>
<p align="justify">2. No due care taken for the religious education of those 
    who are springing up, does notably advance it. When religion falls low among 
    parents, and those in the place of parents having the training up of youth 
    in their hands, it can hardly miss to sink among the children and youth; so 
    that if the one be bad, the other must needs be worse, but where sovereign 
    grace interposes, and hinders the native effect of the neglect and ill 
    example. And here is one of the manifest causes of the declining of religion 
    in our day, in families, in parishes, and in the ministry, alas! too. The 
    signal corrupting of the youth was one of the causes of the apostasy of the 
    generation in Noah's days; Genesis 6:2, "The sons of God saw the daughters 
    of men, that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they 
    choose."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Corruption of manners thus prevailing, every one 
    serves to corrupt another, until the leaven has well near gone through the 
    whole lump; Genesis 6:12, "And God looked upon the earth, and behold it was 
    corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth." In a time of 
    declining, sin and wickedness is like a ball of snow rolled among snow, that 
    still grows bigger, one piece of snow licking up another; or like the water, 
    the farther from the head the greater it grows, by the brooks that join it 
    in its course. And dreadful execution is thus made three ways,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) In all times there are some of no principle, that 
    have no tincture of religion; but in respect of religion are like a sheet of 
    white paper. These readily take on the first bad impressions, and lie a 
    ready prey to evil counsel, and pernicious example. By this means thousands 
    are ruined by their falling into ill hands, and in an evil time; who might 
    have got another cast, if the stream of wickedness had not run so high in 
    their day.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) There are others who have a very slender grip of 
    religion. They have good meanings and inclinations; but, alas! the evil day 
    comes upon them before they are rooted; and so the wind of an apostatizing 
    time blowing hard, their fruit and leaf is blown off, and at length they are 
    blown up by the root with it, and go quickly away with the stream.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Many that have the root of the matter in them, fall 
    asleep, and let down their watch, and they are carried off their feet too; 
    and so, though they get their souls for a prey, they lose the honor and 
    advantage of retaining their integrity in their generation. Thus it is said 
    of some of the Lord's people; Psalm 99:8, "You were a God that forgave them, 
    though you took vengeance of their inventions." So Moses and Aaron, for 
    their provocation at Meribah, died in the wilderness, with the generation 
    that had been a snare to them; and good Eli, for the little care he had of 
    the young priests, to train them up rightly for his Master's work, never saw 
    the captive ark return into Israel.</p>
<p align="justify">4. When a generation is thus posting on in the road of 
    apostasy from God unto ruin, the Lord usually takes home many of his own out 
    from among them; Isaiah 57:1, 2, "The righteous perishes, and no man lays it 
    to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the 
    righteous is taken away from the evil to come. He shall enter into peace; 
    they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness." The 
    good Lamech, Noah's father, died five years before the flood; and his good 
    grandfather Methuselah died in the very year it came on. Josiah was taken 
    away a little before the Babylonish captivity; Luther a little before the 
    wars in Germany began; holy Rutherford died the very day before the act was 
    passed, 1661; and a great man of God in this church was taken away from 
    among us in May 1720. Matters being thus, the declining goes on the faster, 
    the pillars being removed.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The declining humor by these means at length so 
    prevails, that it makes its way over all opposition, and gets the mastery, 
    so as it carries all before it, like a flood. And at this height of it three 
    things are remarkable,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Iniquity comes to be established by a law. Thus some 
    are said to "decree unrighteous decrees, and write grievousness which they 
    have prescribed; Isaiah 10:1. The sin of the generation which began 
    privately to set up its head, spreads, and is by degrees brought into 
    reputation, until at length it turns truth and holiness out of their seat, 
    and sits down in their place; and "good is called evil, and evil good;" 
    Isaiah 5:20. And then all are not only allured, but commanded to entertain 
    it; and in such circumstances the apostasy of the generation cannot miss to 
    make a mighty progress, like Ephraim; Hosea 5:11, "Ephraim is oppressed and 
    broken in judgment; because he willingly walked after the commandment."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Shame is cast on the way of God. Thus our Lord says, 
    that some are "ashamed of him and his words in an adulterous and sinful 
    generation;" Mark 8:38. And that shame drives many into the net. Then men 
    must risk either their conscience or credit and reputation; and must either 
    be false to God, or fools in the eyes of their generation. No doubt Noah, 
    when he was building his ark, and the rest were eating and drinking, 
    marrying and giving in marriage, would even be a laughing-stock to them. 
    This is a mighty engine for corrupting man. Many whom blows would not drive 
    from their religion, are ashamed out of it by an apostate generation pouring 
    contempt on it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The stream of the generation's favor runs on the side 
    of the declining. True seriousness and tenderness serves only to make men 
    overlooked, opposed, contemned, and despised; while such as can go with the 
    multitude, are in honor and estimation, Psalm 7 throughout. The prophet 
    Jeremiah takes notice, chapter 12:1, that "the way of the wicked prospers," 
    and that "they are all happy that deal very treacherously."</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, What puts the copestone on the course of a 
    generation's defection from God, and readily fills the cup to the brim, is 
    persecution of the way of God, and of any that will dare to retain their 
    integrity. This is the native end of a declining course, and is readily 
    found, also, to be the full sea-mark, which when they come to, God calls 
    them to an account for their apostasy. Lot was long vexed in Sodom: at 
    length they made an attack upon his house, and then their ruin came on. The 
    Jews had a long day of declining; at length they crucified Christ, and 
    instead of embracing the Gospel, they persecuted the apostles; and so wrath 
    came on them to the uttermost.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Why are some, though few, still left retaining their 
    integrity in such a generation?</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because of God's faithfulness in his promise; Matthew 
    16:18, "Upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of Hell shall 
    not prevail against it." The gates of Hell may attack the church, and carry 
    on their victory very far, but cannot prevail over her entirely. The floods 
    may overflow her even to the neck, but shall never go quite over her head, 
    and so utterly carry her away. Christ is ever in the midst of her; and 
    though his attendants that cleave to him may be very few, there will always 
    be some.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because God will not leave himself without a witness 
    in an apostatizing generation. While the anti-christian apostasy was going 
    on, God would have his witnesses against them maintained, Revelation 11:3. 
    Such a witness for God was Noah against the old world, and by his practice 
    as well as his preaching he condemned them, Hebrews 11:7. And this is the 
    character of all those who in a declining day cleave to the Lord and his 
    way; Isaiah 43:10, "You are my witnesses, says the Lord." Proverbs 28:4, 
    "They that forsake the law, praise the wicked; but such as keep the law 
    contend with them." Therefore he bears them up for their work.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because therein the power of his grace appears most 
    illustriously. That the Lord preserved a Noah in the old world deluged with 
    wickedness, before it was overflown with water; and a Lot in Sodom, where 
    all were so very vile, was a sort of miracle of grace, as the keeping of a 
    candle burning in an ocean, where the waters are round about to extinguish 
    it. There is an emphasis in that Revelation 3:4, "You have a few names, even 
    in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments." There are sometimes when 
    in some places people can hardly miss to seem good, if they be not really 
    so; but some times there are again, wherein it is extremely hard to get the 
    road kept in the practice of religion, the stream runs so against it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, The Lord preserves them for a seed to better 
    days. What should have come of the new world if Noah had not been perfect in 
    his generation? But he served to carry the principles and practice of 
    religion into the generation after the flood. And as long as God has a 
    church in the world, be the times never so bad, there will still be some to 
    cause the name of Christ to be remembered in all generations, according to 
    that promise; Isaiah 6:13, "But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall 
    return," etc.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Whatever encouragement such have, that turn their 
    back on the way of religion and seriousness, and take a sinful latitude to 
    themselves from the multitude going their way, there is a witness against 
    them still left, that will rise up in judgment against them, and condemn 
    them. This was the case in Noah's days; Hebrews 11:7, "By faith Noah being 
    warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to 
    the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became 
    heir of the righteousness which is by faith." Though iniquity is become 
    fashionable, and the stream of it overflows all its banks in our days, there 
    are still some who for ten thousand worlds would not take the sinful liberty 
    to themselves that others take. And their way and practice writes death on 
    theirs.</p>
<p align="justify">2. However bad the days are, let none pretend it cannot 
    be better with them, because their lot is cast in such an evil day. The 
    speat of wickedness never ran so high yet, as to carry all before it without 
    exception. But there are some, who, if religion will be easy for them, will 
    follow it; but they have no heart to strive against the stream. Such are not 
    for Heaven, especially in a declining day.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Be exhorted not to conform yourselves to the ways of 
    the declining generation wherein our lot is cast; but be among the few who 
    cleave to him and keep his way. It is hard, yet it is possible. Noah was 
    perfect in his generation; it will be our sin and ruin if we be not so in 
    ours. Awake, and bestir yourselves to see your state, that you be righteous 
    by faith; and see to your life and conversation, that you walk with God, as 
    Noah did. And for direction take this other doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. God takes special notice of them for good, 
    who in a declining generation retain their integrity, and keep right, 
    cleaving to him and his way in the face of a generation departing fast from 
    him.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing this doctrine I shall show,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What this rare attainment is, this perfection in such 
    a generation; or, How men keep right, like Noah, in such a generation.</p>
<p align="justify">II. What are the advantages of this course, in which the 
    Lord takes special notice for good, of those who follow it in a declining 
    day.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Lastly, Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. The first thing is to show what this rare attainment 
    is, this perfection in such a generation; or, How men keep right, like Noah, 
    in such a generation. It is then to be,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Sincere, and not a hypocrite. Sincerity is Gospel 
    perfection; and where it is wanting, nothing is accepted, as is clear from 
    the case of Amaziah, who did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, 
    but not with a perfect heart, 2 Chronicles 25:2; and where this sincerity 
    is, the man is accepted, notwithstanding of many imperfections, as is clear 
    from the case of Asa, who, though the high places were not taken away, yet 
    his heart was perfect before the Lord, chapter 15:17. Noah was a sincere 
    soul, else he had not got such a noble character. Hypocrisy will never carry 
    out before the Lord; a form of godliness will be no sufficient preservative 
    in such a generation, wherein the mask is taken off many faces, and the 
    thoughts of many hearts made manifest.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Downright for God, without going aside to the ways of 
    carnal wisdom. The apostle gives us an excellent notion of it from his own 
    practice; 2 Corinthians 1:12, "For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of 
    our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly 
    wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world." 
    The man considers what is the good and acceptable will of the Lord; and that 
    discovered, he follows it in simplicity, without consulting with flesh and 
    blood; reckoning it his greatest wisdom to cleave to the Lord's way, and 
    that his greatest wisdom lies in discerning the steps of the great Leader 
    before him. Other wisdom will be a false light.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Tender in one's private walk and conversation, as 
    under the eye of the all-seeing God. This David could say from his own 
    experience; Psalm 18:23, "I was upright before him, and I kept myself from 
    mine iniquity." Men will in vain pretend to be perfect in their generation, 
    by keeping a fair outside in public, while in the meantime they make no 
    conscience of the secret life of a Christian, which the world cannot be 
    witness to. Those that truly keep right in such a day, set themselves above 
    all to keep their own hearts, to mortify their own lusts, and to keep up 
    communion with God in duties; and do not satisfy themselves with a parcel of 
    outward performances.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Watchful against snares and temptations, that one be 
    not led away with them. The perfect man has his eyes in his head to discern 
    his hazard; and his soul cries within him, "Lead us not into temptation." 
    And he labors to stand at a distance from sin: And</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) From the sin with which he is most easily led aside, 
    Psalm 18:23; Hebrews 12:1.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) From the snares and sins of the time wherein he 
    lives. He sees the snares of that sort many, as they always are in a 
    declining time; and it is his business to keep his garments clean, 
    Revelation 3:4. Whatever his station is in the world, he will never think 
    himself out of hazard of being led aside into sinful courses, while all 
    flesh have corrupted their way.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Proof against ill example, which is the great engine 
    of Satan for carrying on apostasy in such a day and generation. So was Noah 
    in the old world, and Lot in Sodom. They who set God before them as they 
    ought, while he bids them stand, though all the world should be moving 
    forward, will not dare to follow. Ill example is the ruin of many in such a 
    day. Hence says our Lord, Matthew 24:12, "Because iniquity shall abound, the 
    love of many shall wax cold."</p>
<p align="justify">6. A mourner for the sins of others. Hence we read of 
    some that sighed and cried for all the abominations that were done in the 
    midst of Jerusalem, Ezekiel 9:4. And righteous Lot, while dwelling in Sodom, 
    in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day, with the 
    unlawful deeds of that people, 2 Peter 2:8. Such a one will not think 
    himself unconcerned in the sins of the generation wherein he lives. He sees 
    God is dishonored, his wrath is provoked, the souls of the sinners are 
    thereby put in the utmost hazard, and his own soul is in hazard of being 
    held consenting thereto. So love to God, to his neighbor, and to himself, 
    kindles in his soul a real grief and sorrow for the sins of the generation.</p>
<p align="justify">7. An opposer of the sinful courses of the day and 
    generation wherein he lives, as he has access. Hence is that exhortation: 
    Ephesians 5:11, "Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, 
    but rather reprove them." It is not enough to stand off from them ourselves; 
    but we ought to witness against sin in others to reprove, admonish, and 
    exhort sinners to take heed of the God-provoking courses. The Lord in such a 
    time says, "Who is on my side?" And we are to take part with God against a 
    sinful, backsliding, wicked generation.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Lastly, In a word, it is to be rowing against the 
    stream of iniquity, and endeavoring to draw the nearer God that others are 
    going far from him; to be best when others are worst; to be the more 
    earnest, serious, and active in real religion, the more low we see it 
    falling in our day.</p>
<p align="justify">This may afford us matter of lamentation, showing there 
    are few perfect in our generation.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Most part are under visible blemishes in their 
    outward conversation.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They that are otherwise, are asleep; they are not 
    active for God; if they be not carried away with the stream, they do not 
    oppose it.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The second thing is, to show what are the advantages 
    of this course, in which the Lord takes special notice for good, of those 
    who follow it in a declining day.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Sweet peace of conscience in keeping the Lord's way, 
    while others are disregarding it. Hence says the apostle, 2 Corinthians 
    1:12, "Our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in 
    simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of 
    God, we have had our conversation in the world. Though it is hard to row 
    against the stream of an apostatizing generation, and may expose one to much 
    trouble; yet there is a quietness within, a certain satisfaction that arises 
    from reflecting that one is in the way of duty, and through grace gets it 
    kept. And this will be of great value with those who by experience have 
    learned, that inward peace is preferable to peace with all the world, and is 
    to be bought at any rate, but sold at none. Hence says Job, chap, 27:6, "My 
    righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go; my heart shall not 
    reproach me so long as I live."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Communion with God, and access to him in duties. Hence 
    says our Lord, John 14:21, "He who has my commandments, and keeps them, he 
    it is that loves me: and he who loves me, shall be loved of my Father, and I 
    will love him, and will manifest myself to him." As the endeavor to keep 
    right in such a day, gives the upright soul many errands to God, and obliges 
    him to be looking much to the Lord, whence must come his help; so the Lord 
    even allows the soul access to him in such a case in a special manner, 
    Revelation 11:4; and though no works of theirs, but the blood of Jesus only 
    is the ground of their confidence before the Lord, yet uprightness for God 
    removes the impediments which hinder the soul's confidence. Hence says the 
    apostle, 1 John 3:21, "Beloved, if our heart condemn as not, then have we 
    confidence towards God." It any have communion with God in such a day, it 
    shall be they. Hence says the prophet, Micah 2:7, "O you that are named the 
    house of Jacob, is the Spirit of the Lord straitened? are these his doings? 
    do not my words do good to him that walks uprightly?"</p>
<p align="justify">3. A sweet allowance of furniture, strength, and support, 
    for the duty called for; Proverbs 10:29, "The way of the Lord is strength to 
    the upright," Sometimes the Lord calls his people to the field of battle; 
    and unbelief says, it will not do, for they are naked and unarmed; but the 
    call being clear, they that would keep right in an evil day, must venture 
    forward at their Lord's beck, though naked, leaving it upon him by faith to 
    provide them weapons when and where he will, 1 Samuel 2:4. And then they are 
    provided in the field of battle, if not before. Henco says our Lord, Matthew 
    10:19, "When they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you shall 
    speak, for it shall be givon you in that same hour what you shall speak." 
    And whoever uprightly venture thus to swim against the stream, they may 
    assure themselves the Lord will be the lifter up of their head.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Seasonable providential appearances for them. God has 
    a watchful eye for good over them who keep his way; and he will protect them 
    in it, while he has use for them that way; Psalm 121:2, 3, "My help comes 
    from the Lord, which made Heaven and earth, He will not suffer your foot to 
    be moved; he who keeps you will not slumber." They that would carry 
    uprightly in a declining time, must lay their account to run a risk; but it 
    ever remains a truth; Proverbs 10:9, "He who walks uprightly, walks surely." 
    And whoever do uprightly appear for God in an evil day, sooner or later God 
    will appear for them, with a favorable cast of his hand; Proverbs 16:7, 
    "When a man's ways please the Lord he makes even his enemies to be at peace 
    with him." Lot was a witness against Sodom's wickedness; and at length they 
    make a furious attack on him and his house, but God seasonably interposes 
    for his rescue, Genesis 19:9, 10, 11. Jeremiah in the road of duty was in 
    hazard of death, but the princes rescue him, especially Ahikam, Jeremiah 26. 
    Samuel witnesses against Israel's bent for a king; but there was no 
    diverting them; he could not stem it; but God joined his testimony from 
    Heaven against the people's course by thunder and rain, which left a 
    conviction in their breasts, so that they greatly feared the Lord and 
    Samuel," 1 Samuel 12:18.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Special favor in a suffering time, when the 
    Lord arises to plead his controversy with the sinful generation. Hence says 
    the prophet Habakkuk, chapter 3:16, "When I heard, my belly trembled; my 
    lips quivered at the voice; rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled 
    in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble." The best security 
    against a time of suffering is uprightness for God in a sinning, declining 
    time.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Sometimes they are so seen to in a common calamity, 
    that they are freed from trouble, as if they dwelt alone, or had a Goshen to 
    live in, while darkness is over all the land. Hence says the Lord; Ezekiel 
    9:4, "Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and 
    set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh, and that cry for all the 
    abominations that be done in the midst thereof;" an allusion to the 
    Israelites in Egypt. Noah had an ark whon the old world was destroyed; Lot 
    was saved when Sodom was burut up. God can hide whom he will, when the world 
    is in greatest confusion.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A mitigation of trouble when they meet with it in a 
    suffering time. Though they may drink of the cup of common calamity, it 
    shall be of the brim, not of the bottom; there shall be much sweet mixture 
    in it. Jeremiah 15:11, 'The Lord said, Truly it shall be well with your 
    remnant, truly I will cause the enemy to entreat you well in the time of 
    evil, and in the time of affliction." The rod shall be to them but the rod 
    of a man, a weak man, that lays on but a slender stroke.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) They shall be safe from the sting of trouble; they 
    will have ease within, though trouble without, Habakkuk 3:16; forfeited. 
    Their standing at a distance from the provocations that brought on the 
    stroke, will afford much sweet peace, while others find themselves taken in 
    the snares their own hands have made.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) They lie fairest to be preserved from the 
    temptations of a suffering time, and to be carried cleanly through. Hence is 
    that promise; Revelation 3:10, "Because you have kept the hour of my 
    patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation, which shall come 
    upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth." The Lord in his 
    just judgment, for the sins of a backsliding generation, often brings such a 
    trial, as does not only expose men to suffering, but to sinning, and 
    renouncing the religion that is left them. And it is too likely that they 
    may come to be the trial of this generation; but they that now retain their 
    integrity, are fairest to be preserved in such a day.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Lastly, Let the worst come to the worst in the 
    matter of trouble, it shall be well with them. Josiah had a promise of dying 
    in peace, 2 Kings 22:20, yet he died in battle; but the promise stood firm, 
    for die as they will, they die in peace who die within the covenant of 
    peace. The grave is one of God's hiding-places for his people.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. I exhort you to be perfect in this generation, to be 
    persons of integrity, downright for God, rowing against the stream of this 
    sinful generation. And in order to that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Purge your conversation from the gross pollutions of 
    the outward man. It is the character of "the man who shall ascend into the 
    hill of the Lord," that "he has clean hands, and a pure heart; has not lift 
    up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully," Psalm 26:3, 4. Be blameless 
    in your walk before the world, standing at a distance from the profanity of 
    the generation. It is true that this is not enough; but alas! wickedness is 
    at such a height in the generation, that there are few whose outward 
    conversation is not stained with cursing, swearing, banning, drunkenness, 
    deceitfulness in their dealings, lying, profanation of the Sabbath, etc. 
    Surely, whoever they be that are perfect in this generation, it is not the 
    like of these.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Be Christians indeed, in the inner man. Such an one is 
    described Romans 2:28, 29, "For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; 
    neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh. But he is a Jew 
    which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, 
    and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God." For real 
    religion is under a deep decay; and as profanity is devouring the souls of 
    some, woeful formality is preying on the souls of others. The virgins are 
    generally slumbering and sleeping, and the life of religion is much gone. O 
    strive to be among the "few names which have not defiled their garments" 
    Revelation 3:4, And here I would recommend three things to you.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Study to be experimental Christians; Psalm 34:8," O 
    taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man that trusts in him." 
    Experimental religion is much worn out in our day. Men satisfy themselves 
    with dry and sapless notions of religion in their heads, while they labor 
    not to find the power of truth on their souls; and hence it comes to pass 
    that truth itself is a going so fast. See the promise; John 8:32, "And you 
    shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Be exercised Christians, like Paul; Acts 24:16, 
    "Herein do I exercise myself (says he) to have always a conscience void of 
    offence toward God, and toward men;" exercised about your soul's case, 
    carefully observing whether you be going back, or coming forward; looking to 
    the ills of your hearts, your pride, passion, untenderness, etc., and 
    setting yourselves to mortify these; exercised to know what is sin and duty 
    in particular cases; to notice the Lord's comings or goings with respect to 
    your souls.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Lively and active Christians. The prophet complains, 
    that it was otherwise in his time; Isaiah 66:7, "There is none that calls 
    upon your name, that stirs up himself, to take hold of you; for you have 
    hidden your face from us, and have consumed us, because of our iniquities." 
    In public, and in private and secret duties, stir up yourselves to get near 
    God; to get the favor of religion on your spirits; and strive against 
    deadness, formality, and spiritual numbness, that has seized on most of the 
    generation.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Be of a public spirit. That is a spirit sunk sore in 
    this generation; in place of which is come a detestable neutrality, 
    indifference, selfishness, and worldliness; Philippians 2:21, "For all seek 
    their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's." Be you concerned for 
    the public honor of God, for the ark of God, for Zion in all her distresses. 
    Let your hearts say, as Psalm 137:5, 6, "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let 
    my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember you, let my tongue 
    cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief 
    joy." They that are not with Christ in such a case are against him.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Be of a Gospel spirit, having high thoughts of the 
    free grace of God, and deep impressions of the nothingness of man, and all 
    that he can do; "Galatians 6:14, "God forbid (says the apostle) that I 
    should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world 
    is crucified unto me, and I unto the world." Learn and hold fast Gospel 
    principles in your heads; keep up a Gospel frame in your hearts, and have a 
    Gospel practice in your walk. Learn the art of living by faith, believing 
    the promise, and on the credit of the promise going out in duty. Let love 
    constrain you to obedience, and be strict and tender in the whole of your 
    walk, and so adorn the profession of the Gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Be accurate observers of your duty to God, whom the 
    generation we live in has much cast behind their back. Be conscientious in 
    the duties of godliness, frequent and fervent. Keep your hearts for him; 
    worship him reverently, converse much with his word; give yourselves to 
    prayer; let him have the morning as well as evening sacrifice in secret and 
    in your families; name his dreadful and holy name as little as you can in 
    common conversation, and never mention it but with awe on your spirits; 
    sanctify his day, and let alone discoursing of your worldly business before 
    and between sermons, at home or at the church.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Be nice observers of justice and truth in your 
    dealings with men; for both these are rare to a marvel in this generation, 
    as they were of old. See Isaiah 59:13–15, Micah 7:1, etc. O sirs, do not go 
    with the stream of the generation. Know that God is a God of justice and 
    truth, and his soul loathes the unjust and deceitful man. A little gained or 
    kept back by injustice, may bring a blasting curse on all you have, and may 
    make it melt yet like snow before the sun. Make not the way of the multitude 
    the standard of justice in your dealings; but "to the law and the testimony; 
    if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in 
    them." Especially I recommend to you, and, as the messenger of God, do bind 
    it this day on your consciences, "All things whatever you would that men 
    should do to you, do you even so to them; for this is the law and the 
    prophets," Matthew 7:12. Lie not; but be you tender of speaking truth, as 
    you would be tender of your souls. That is the character of the Lord's 
    people; Isaiah 63:8, "Children that will not lie." Be slaves to your word; 
    if it be to your loss, do not break your promises. This is the character of 
    a citizen of Zion: Psalm 15:4, "He swears to his own hurt, and changes not." 
    And in a special manner do not break your promises, and alter your bargains 
    with the poorer sort to their loss; Proverbs 22:22, "Rob not the poor 
    because he is poor; neither oppress the afflicted in the gate."</p>
<p align="justify">7. Oppose and set yourselves against sin and wickedness 
    in others, as you have access; and so endeavor to stem the tide of the 
    apostasy of the generation; Ephesians 5:11, "Have no fellowship with the 
    unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them." Appear on the Lord's 
    side as witnesses for him, and his ways of truth and holiness; and 
    discountenance and bear testimony against the dishonor you see done to his 
    name. Strengthen the weak in hazard to be led away; admonish and warn those 
    before whom temptations are laid; and show yourselves adversaries to all 
    sinful courses. Hence are these exhortations, 1 Thessalonians 5:14, "We 
    exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, 
    support the weak, be patient toward all men." Jude, verses 22, 23, "Of some 
    have compassion, making a difference: and others save with fear, pulling 
    them out of the fire, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh." If you 
    be Christ's disciples, you are the salt of the earth, Matthew 5:13, to 
    resist putrefaction.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Do your endeavor to get a right set in the young 
    generation, who are in great hazard at this day. It should be the work of 
    all that fear God, to be concerned for posterity, after the example of 
    David; Psalm 45:17, "I will make your name to be remembered in all 
    generations; therefore shall the people praise you forever and ever:" and 
    therefore to give good example and precept in their families, as did 
    Abraham, Genesis 18:19, "For I know him, that he will command his children, 
    and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do 
    justice and judgment:" and to be useful to all others of the younger sort, 
    as they have opportunity, to recommend the way of the Lord to them, and set 
    them at odds with the sinful courses of the day. The hope of future times 
    lies in them; and what will become of the land, and of the work of God, his 
    cause and interest in it, if they be bred up in the ways of the present 
    apostasy of the generation?</p>
<p align="justify">When we look to the rising generation at this day, they 
    are visibly declining, generally corrupt in their manners, and worse than 
    their fathers; however, in a few years, church, and state, and country will 
    be in their hands. This is a weighty consideration for all who are concerned 
    for religion. I would therefore drop a few words to those of the younger 
    sort of both sexes.</p>
<p align="justify">1. While you are entering on the stage of the world at 
    this time, you must either act the part of witnesses for God against the 
    sinful courses of the day, or enter into the conspiracy of the generation 
    against God. You cannot be neutral, however you may think to be so; Matthew 
    12:30, "He who is not with me," says Christ, "is against me; and he who 
    gathers not with me, scatters abroad." Therefore consider well which to 
    choose, and resolve to sist yourselves forthwith on Christ's side. Say as 
    Joshua, chapter 24:15, "And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, 
    choose you this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers 
    served, that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the 
    Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve 
    the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Know that this land is married to the Lord in solemn 
    covenants to reform what is amiss, and to preserve the reformation in 
    doctrine, worship, discipline, and government, and to oppose whatever is 
    contrary to sound godliness. And since that time there have been periods of 
    defection and apostasy from God. But among our fathers were found witnesses 
    for God, who, at the expense of all that was dear to them in the world, and 
    even of their own lives, transmitted the testimony for truth and holiness 
    onto us. It lies upon your consciences to take it up, and maintain it; for 
    you must be answerable to God for it in your stations; and woe, woe will be 
    to that generation in whose hand it falls. This was expressly enjoined to, 
    and strongly inculcated upon the Jewish church, as you may see from Psalm 
    78:5–7; "For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in 
    Israel, when he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to 
    their children. That the generation to come might know them, even the 
    children which should be born: who should arise, and declare them to their 
    children. That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of 
    God; but keep his commandments."</p>
<p align="justify">3. The speat of irreligion, neglect and contempt of 
    seriousness, runs so high among the young generation of this day, that you 
    are in great hazard of being carried away with it; and can hardly miss to be 
    so, if you do not look well to yourselves. Therefore take these advices.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Begin the world as you would desire to end it; 
    Ecclesiastes 12:1, "Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth, 
    while the evil days come not, nor the years draw near, when you shall say, I 
    have no pleasure in them." Though you be young now, you must be old, and go 
    the way of all flesh then, if not before. It is pity to stand at a distance 
    from religion and seriousness while you are young, since you know the day 
    will come when you will need it, and you know not how soon.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Give an obedient ear to good advice for your souls. 
    Nature is corrupt, youth is headstrong, raw, and inexperienced; there is 
    much need for to be pliable to the counsels of those concerned for your 
    spiritual welfare, Proverbs 5:11, 12, "lest you mourn at the last, when your 
    flesh and your body are consumed; and say, How have I hated instruction, and 
    my heart despised reproof?" A few years may come to let you see the folly of 
    the way of wilfulness.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Take heed to your company; 1 Corinthians 15:33, "Be 
    not deceived: Evil communications corrupt good manners." Ill company has 
    been the ruin of many, and is so at this day. And many have fallen into such 
    company in their youth, as has given them an ill set, that has stuck to them 
    all their days; or led them into such courses, as have soon ruined them.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Observe carefully and improve what you see befalling 
    young people as well as others. You see there are of that sort carried off 
    to eternity in the middle of their days; and is it not reasonable you should 
    timely see to your own state, in case it be your lot too? You see what 
    wretched snares the folly of youth betrays many into; and be you therefore 
    on your guard. Take heed of sad examples set before you, lest you become 
    examples to others.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Study to learn the lesson of the vanity of the 
    world; Ecclesiastes 1:2. What is youth, strength, beauty, wealth, etc. but 
    fair fading flowers, that last not, but are quickly gone? Cease your 
    towering imaginations, your flourishing hopes of worldly contents, your big 
    promises to yourselves of what fine things you may reach; these will but 
    make your disappointments the more cutting.</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) Consecrate yourselves to the Lord; and let Christ 
    Jesus, the plant of renown, the chief among ten thousands, have your hearts 
    and affections while you are young; Proverbs 23:26, "My son," says the Lord, 
    "give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways." Lay hold on him in 
    the covenant of grace, and knit unto him by faith, and so lay your measures 
    for your welfare in time and eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">(7.) Carry yourselves tenderly and religiously, being 
    holy in the whole of your conversation; Hebrews 12:14, "Follow peace with 
    all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord." Whatever be 
    your station in the world, be conscientious in the duties of it, looking on 
    the all-seeing God as the party with whom you have chiefly to do. And 
    particularly be modest in your garb, speech, and behavior; that Satan may 
    not carry on his triumph at the rate he has often done in this place, to the 
    dishonor of God, reproach of religion, and the ruin of souls.</p>
<p align="justify">(8.) Lastly, Eye God seriously, and walk by his counsel, 
    in your settlement in the world; Proverbs 3:6, "In all your ways acknowledge 
    him, and he shall direct your paths." Lay your matters before the Lord in 
    prayer, and, in dependence on him for light, weigh them in the balance of 
    sanctified reason, according to the general directions of the word; and walk 
    as the Lord is pleased to discover his mind. Especially in your marriages 
    acknowledge God, and walk by his direction. The neglect of this in the old 
    world was one of the springs of that wickedness that brought on the flood; 
    and that spring is fast running at this day, carrying on the apostasy of the 
    generation.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall give you the following MOTIVES to press you to be 
    perfect in this generation, as you have been exhorted. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It will be a great discovery of your sincerity, and 
    sincere love to the Lord and the way of holiness. "Noah was a just man, and 
    perfect in his generations." A declining time is a trying time, and the 
    naughtiness of many is thereby discovered; it is a sifting time, and there 
    is much refuse appears. In times wherein religion and seriousness are in 
    vogue, as sometimes they have been, many put on the mask of religion that 
    have nothing of it in reality; and then the time turns, and wickedness goes 
    with open mouth; so men cast off their mask, and appear in their own colors, 
    and then appears who have it in reality; 1 Corinthians 11:19, "For there 
    must be heresies among you, that they which are approved, may be made 
    manifest among you."</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a noble, heaven-like disposition, to be perfect 
    in such a generation; to cleave to Christ, when the generation is so 
    generally turning their back on him, John 6:66–68. It speaks a man to have a 
    rooted principle in him for God and his way, and not to be carried by the 
    mean motives of the world's applause, ease, etc. towards religion, but out 
    of conscience towards God.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It will glorify God very much; and that is the great 
    business we have to do in the world, agreeable to what is said; 1 
    Corinthians 10:31, "Whether therefore you eat or drink, or whatever you do, 
    do all to the glory of God." Compare Matthew 5:16, "Let your light so shine 
    before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which 
    is in Heaven." This will be a testimony for God against a sinful generation, 
    the keeping up of a standard for him, while so many standards are displayed 
    against him; Proverbs 28:4, "They that forsake the law, praise the wicked; 
    but such as keep the law, contend with them." Alas! what should come of his 
    declarative glory, if there be none to show a respect to his commands.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is the best service you can do for the generation, 
    like David, who "served his own generation by the will of God," Acts 13:36. 
    No man is born for himself, every man is obliged to seek the good of 
    mankind, and particularly to lay himself out for the good of the generation 
    wherein he lives. Now there is a twofold good to be done the generation this 
    way.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is a proper mean to keep them back from the way 
    of sin, and to gain them to the way of the Lord. Example has a powerful 
    influence. Hence is that exhortation; 1 Peter 3:1, "You wives, be in 
    subjection to your own husbands, that if any obey not the word, they also 
    may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives." And if one 
    soul can be gained that way, from the way of sin, how desirable is it?</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is a proper mean to keep off wrath; it is the 
    bearing up of the pillars of a land, Psalm 75:3. If there had been but ten 
    righteous men in Sodom, the Lord would have spared it for their sakes.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Suppose it should not be effectual to stop the career 
    of any in their sin, yet it would leave a conviction of sin in their 
    consciences. Hence the apostle exhorts the Philippians, chapter 2:15, 16, to 
    "be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of 
    a crooked and perverse nation; among whom" says he "you shine as lights in 
    the world; holding forth the word of life, that I may rejoice in the day of 
    Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain." A holy tender 
    conversation, though wicked men's corruptions rise against it, yet their 
    consciences approve of it; and while they are running down the godly man for 
    it, yet in their consciences they have a secret honor for him.</p>
<p align="justify">6. It is a debt we owe to posterity. Hence says the 
    Psalmist; Psalm 45:17, "I will make your name to be remembered in all 
    generations; therefore shall the people praise you forever and ever." The 
    keeping of the way of God in a declining generation, is a transmitting of 
    the testimony for God to those yet unborn; and the going the way of the 
    multitude is a betraying of them, as it were a conspiring to take the light 
    out of the room they were coming into, that they may have nothing but 
    darkness.</p>
<p align="justify">7. It is an honorable thing. It is to be a witness for 
    God; and this is one of the characters of his people; Isaiah 43:10, "You are 
    my witnesses, says the Lord." Behold, the honorer of God shall be honored, 
    when those that despise him shall be lightly esteemed, 1 Samuel 2:30; 
    Proverbs 10:7, "The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the 
    wicked shall rot." How savory is the name of Noah, Lot, Caleb, and Joshua at 
    this day, while the name of the old world, Sodom, etc. is in disgrace?</p>
<p align="justify">8. It is the best course you can take to be safe in the 
    evil day, when the Lord calls the generation to an account. A sinning time 
    will be followed with a suffering time; and it is good to prepare for it in 
    time. They quite mistake their measures, who go off the Lord's way for 
    safety; Proverbs 10:9, "He who walks uprightly, walks surely; but he who 
    perverts his ways, shall be known."</p>
<p align="justify">9. Lastly, It will be most comfortable in a dying hour; 
    as it was to the good king Hezekiah, when he said, "Remember now, O Lord, I 
    beseech you, how I have walked before you in truth, and with a perfect 
    heart, and have done that which is good in your sight," Isaiah 38:3. Sinful 
    going with a multitude, coming in remembrance on a death-bed, makes bitter 
    reflections; whereas that is sweet, which is mentioned; 2 Corinthians 1:12, 
    "Our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity 
    and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we 
    have had our conversation in the world."</p>
<p align="justify">I shall conclude all with the following directions.</p>
<p align="justify">DIRECTION 1. See, in the first place, to be just by faith 
    in Jesus Christ. Where the soul has not the imputed righteousness of Christ 
    there can be no righteousness of a holy life. For the unjustified man is 
    under the curse; he wants the root of good works, namely, faith But the soul 
    furnished with faith, is furnished for holy walking.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Make the Word of God your rule, and not men. "All men 
    are liars," Romans 3:4. It is dangerous for one to be satisfied with a 
    thing, just because men are so. Most men, good men, will not be a safe 
    standard in a declining time.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Labor for holy courage in the Lord's way; men are in 
    hazard of being ashamed of Christ in a sinful time. There is need of a brow 
    to face the daring wickedness of such a generation.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Labor to be resolute for God, and a good conscience, 
    Ephesians 6:15. They that would row against the stream, must be resolute, 
    like Joshua, chapter 24:15; who, whatever others should do, was resolved 
    with his house, to serve the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Let not the world's account of singularity have weight 
    with you. They will be apt to think it strange that you "should run not with 
    them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you," 1 Peter 4:4.</p>
<p align="justify">But do not regard their opinions or censures. Many comply 
    with sinful courses, because they cannot away with being singular. But 
    better be alone in God's way, than out of it with the whole world.</p>
<p align="justify">God's people can hardly miss to be a world's wonder 
    sometimes, as was the case with Joshua, and his fellows; Zechariah 3:8, 
    "Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows that sit before 
    you; for they are men wondered at."</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, Keep eternity much in view; 2 Corinthians 
    4:18, "Look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are 
    not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which 
    are not seen are eternal." This is an excellent help to get right through an 
    evil world. He who considers, he knows not how soon he may step out of the 
    world into eternity, will take heed to his steps, that he step not wrong in 
    a declining day.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore let the example of Noah, who "was a just man, 
    and perfect in his generations, and walked with God," have a due influence 
    upon you to move you to follow his steps.</p>
