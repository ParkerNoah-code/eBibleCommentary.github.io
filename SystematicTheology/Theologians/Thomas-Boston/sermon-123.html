    1 Thessalonians 5:19 "Quench not the Spirit."</p>
<p align="justify">IT may be reasonably thought, that it was not without 
    some design, that God sent us the solemn ordinance, which we observed last 
    Sabbath; and that the Spirit of the Lord was not idle among us, while the 
    arrows of the word were flying in such numbers, along with the sacrament. 
    Surely several were touched in one way or another. And if these things were 
    rightly managed they might come to a good account. But alas! some as they 
    get touches of the Spirit lightly without seeking, so they let them go as 
    lightly. Others are at pains to earn something, and when got they put into a 
    bag with holes. But whoever would have any lasting good in religion would do 
    well to hearken to this exhortation. Quench not the Spirit. In these words, 
    there is, 1. A holy fire supposed to be kindled in the souls of men. In 
    Matthew 3:11. John said of Jesus, he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit 
    and with fire. Here the Spirit is compared to fire, and in other places to 
    water. This is not meant of the person of the Spirit who cannot be quenched, 
    but of his gifts, operations, and motions, which are often quenched. It is 
    thus expressed because the injury redounds to the Spirit himself.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Our duty with respect to this holy fire. Quench it 
    not. Do not put it out or weaken it in the soul. More is understood. Cherish 
    the Spirit, give fuel to this sacred fire, maintain and keep it in, and blow 
    it up. Be concerned kindly to entertain the operations, and motions of the 
    Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine.—It is the duty of all to take heed that they 
    quench not the holy fire of the Spirit kindled in the soul, but that they 
    nourish and cherish it. To prepare this for application, which I chiefly 
    design. I shall only,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Give you some distinctions of quenching the Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Show how the Spirit is quenched.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Offer reasons why we should not quench the Spirit. 
    We are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To give some distinctions of quenching the Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is a total and a partial quenching of the 
    Spirit. A total quenching is when the Spirit is quite extinguished, his 
    motions and impressions on the soul quite erased so as there remains not one 
    spark among the ashes. Thus Saul and other graceless men have quenched the 
    Spirit, and this ends in giving them up to the lusts of their own hearts. My 
    Spirit, says God, shall not always strive with men. And this Spirit departed 
    from Saul.</p>
<p align="justify">A partial quenching is, When the Spirit is weakened, the 
    force and vigor of his motions and impressions abated, and the fire brought 
    to a very spark. Thus the godly may be guilty of quenching the Spirit. Thus 
    David prayed, "Create in me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit 
    within me. Cast me not away from your presence: and take not your holy 
    Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of your salvation: and uphold me 
    with your free Spirit."</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is a willful and a weak quenching of the Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">The willful quenching is when men resolutely set 
    themselves to put out the holy fire, being resolved not to part with their 
    lusts, they go on in opposition to their light, and strangle their uneasy 
    consciences, and murder their convictions, that they may sin without 
    control. "You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do 
    always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you." This is a 
    dangerous case.</p>
<p align="justify">A weak quenching I call that which flows rather from 
    weakness than wickednesss, rather from carelessness than design. This is 
    called grieving of the Spirit, Ephesians 4:30. It is described, Song 5:2–5.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There is a quenching of the Spirit in ourselves, or in 
    others. The Spirit may be quenched in ourselves by ourselves. God sometimes 
    kindles the holy fire in our hearts, and miserable, we put it out. For 
    though we cannot kindle, we can extinguish it. Though we cannot open the 
    door we can shut it. "For my people, says the Lord, is foolish, they have 
    not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: 
    they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge." Like 
    little children that can do the ill, but not the good.</p>
<p align="justify">We may quench the Spirit in others, even as one may put 
    out the fire in another person's house. "But woe unto you, Scribes and 
    Pharisees, hypocrites! for you shut up the kingdom of Heaven against men; 
    for you neither go in yourselves, neither suffer you them that are entering 
    to go in." Thus ministers may quench the Spirit in people, and people in 
    ministers. One member of a family in another, and one neighbor in another, 
    by discouraging, vexing and oppressing them in what is good and holy, by 
    which means their knees are enfeebled and their hands weakened in following 
    the Lord in the way of duty. I now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show how the Spirit is quenched. This holy fire is 
    quenched,</p>
<p align="justify">1. By doing violence to it, as when one puts his foot on 
    the fire or casts water on it; or blows out a candle. So there is a doing 
    violence to the Spirit, and thus the Spirit is quenched by sins of 
    commission, especially such as are done with a high hand, and in opposition 
    to light. By these the Spirit is grieved. As when one raises an offensive 
    smoke in the room where his guest sits, he is grieved and departs: so the 
    Spirit is grieved by the offensive smell arising from our raging 
    corruptions.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The fire of the Spirit is quenched by the neglecting 
    of it, as when one does not supply fuel to the fire, it will go out, though 
    no violence be done to it. The lamp also will be extinguished if you feed it 
    not with more oil. So the Spirit is quenched by neglecting his motions, not 
    cherishing them, not walking in the light while we have it. For however 
    briskly this wind blow, it will cease, if we do not spread out our sails and 
    make way with it, for it will not blow to no purpose. We are now,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To give reasons why we should not quench the Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because it is the holy fire; and therefore it ought to 
    be kept carefully, and it is dangerous to meddle with it. It is fire from 
    Heaven, not the fire of God's anger, but of his Spirit. When the people saw 
    the fire come down, Leviticus 9:24. They shouted and fell on their faces. 
    They were filled with awe and reverence of God. So should we in this case, 
    especially as it is committed to our care. It is the fire of the altar, the 
    Spirit of Christ, the purchase of his sufferings and death: and therefore 
    when we feel his motions and operations, we should be careful of them as of 
    the purchase of blood.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because we can do nothing without it. Without me, says 
    Jesus, you can do nothing. So far as the Spirit goes away, all true light 
    and heat go with him, and then the soul remains as in a state of death, in 
    darkness, cold and stiff. When the wind ceases, how can the ship sail? And 
    when the Spirit is quenched, how can we make to our harbor?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because when once quenched we cannot rekindle it. We 
    have no command over the Spirit, "We can neither tell whence in comes nor 
    whether it goes." Were it the fire of our own hearths, though it were 
    extinguished, we might kindle it again. But it is from Heaven and we have no 
    command there. He who will not sail while wind and tide serve, must even lie 
    still until they come again. But a fair wind has blown to some for 
    Immanuel's land, which having slighted, they have never again enjoyed, as in 
    the case of Felix.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Because the quenching of this fire, is the 
    raising of another tending to the consuming of the soul. This is a fire of 
    corruption within us. When the Spirit departed from Saul he went to the 
    devil. And some people never come to a height in wickedness until the Spirit 
    of the Lord has been at work with them, and they have quenched his motions. 
    "When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, 
    seeking rest and finds none. Then says he, I will return into my house from 
    whence I came out; and when he is come, he finds it empty, swept, and 
    garnished. Then goes he, and takes with himself seven other spirits more 
    wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state 
    of that man is worse than the first."</p>
<p align="justify">It is a fire of God's anger without us. "But they 
    rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their 
    enemy, and he fought against them." For thus men turn fighters against God, 
    enter the lists with their Creator and oppose themselves to him, who is a 
    consuming fire.</p>
<p align="justify">Use. Quench not the Spirit. And</p>
<p align="justify">I. Quench not the Spirit in others, but cherish and 
    nourish it. When you can perceive any good motions and inclinations wrought 
    in a person, beware of doing anything to weaken them, but help them forward. 
    Let us,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Inquire how one may quench the Spirit in others?</p>
<p align="justify">1. By mocking them, and the way which they are looking 
    after. This is the persecution of the tongue, which Satan raises against 
    persons when once they begin to turn serious. In allusion to the son of the 
    bond woman mocking Sarah and her son, the apostle says, "As then he who was 
    born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so 
    it is now." With this the saints meet not only from the openly profane, but 
    also from the formal professor. "With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they 
    gnashed upon me with their teeth." But lay your accounts with it, and be on 
    your guard that the Spirit be not quenched by it, Jude, verse 17. and 
    downwards. And for such as do it, let them remember these words, "Now 
    therefore be you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong; for I have 
    heard from the Lord God a consumption even determined upon the whole earth."</p>
<p align="justify">3. By speaking evil of the way of God, Acts 19:9. It is 
    said, "divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way 
    before the multitude." There are many who act the devil's part in this 
    matter, who to quench the Spirit in others, bawl out their virulent speeches 
    against sermons, communions, ministers, communicants; a very proper way to 
    stifle any good motions in others, in the very birth. Would to God such 
    would consider. "Behold the Lord comes with ten thousand of his saints, to 
    execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them 
    of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all 
    their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."</p>
<p align="justify">3. By opposing themselves to others aiming at the way of 
    the Lord, setting themselves to crush and bear down real religion and 
    holiness in them. "When the Jews opposed themselves and blasphemed, Paul 
    shook his clothing, and said unto then, your blood be upon your own heads; I 
    am clean; from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles."</p>
<p align="justify">Seldom do any begin to walk with God, but Satan raises up 
    someone or other, to be a dead weight upon them in their way. This is 
    malignancy, and the true spirit of malignants; and such persons are real 
    malignants, profess what they will, and God will treat them as such. But 
    remember that Jesus has said, "Whoever shall offend one of these little ones 
    which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged 
    about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea."</p>
<p align="justify">4. By diverting them from their duty. Thus Elymas the 
    sorcerer withstood the apostles, seeking to turn away the deputy from the 
    faith. There is a generation, who, when the Spirit of God is calling persons 
    one way, they are ready to call them another, and thereby to efface from 
    their minds all impressions of religion. Evil company is one of the chief 
    pillars of the devil's kingdom, and has been the grave of convictions to 
    many. Evil communications corrupt good manners. But let such hear these 
    words, "O full of all subtlety, and all mischief, you child of the devil, 
    you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways 
    of the Lord?"</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, By tempting them to sin. "Thus Balaam, taught 
    Balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things 
    sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication." Sin grieves the Spirit 
    and provokes him to depart, and thus the soul being left dead, alienated 
    from the life of God, the tempter is a quencher of the Spirit, and a 
    murderer of souls. This is the case especially when the tempter knows their 
    weak side and attacks them there, and lays stumbling blocks before them, 
    where they are least able to resist. What is this but to act the devil's 
    part against the Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Let us inquire how we should cherish the Spirit in 
    others.</p>
<p align="justify">1. By the example of a tender holy life. Example has a 
    powerful influence, and will be fuel to the holy fire. Paul tells us that 
    the zeal of the Corinthians has provoked very many. It strengthens good 
    impressions wrought by the Spirit on the souls of others, and confirms them 
    against temptations to apostasy, which they may have from other quarters.</p>
<p align="justify">2. By encouraging them to follow on in the good way of 
    the Lord. Thus when Barnabas "had come to Antioch and had seen the grace of 
    God, he was glad, and exhorted them all, that with full purpose of heart 
    they would cleave unto the Lord. For he was a good man and full of the Holy 
    Spirit and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord." It is a pity 
    that while others have a mouth to speak against God and his way, that we 
    should not have a mouth to open for him. It would not a little contribute to 
    the advancement of holiness, that we showed a tender concern for Christ's 
    little ones, and that they were countenanced and encouraged, according to 
    the inclinations to piety appearing in them.</p>
<p align="justify">3. By stirring them up to their duty, especially when 
    they are in hazard of sloth gaining upon them. This is to blow the holy fire 
    and increase it. "I think it meet, says Peter, as long as I am in this 
    tabernacle, to stir you up, by putting you in remembrance." Mutual 
    admonition is the duty of all Christians, and a part of the communion of 
    saints. "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching 
    and admonishing one another in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, 
    singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">4. By warding off temptations from them, so far as lies 
    in our power. We should try to hold them off altogether, but if we cannot 
    thus prevent them, we should labor to blunt their edge and to support them 
    against them, and do what we can to remove them. "Blessed are the peace 
    makers: for they shall be called the children of God."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, By communicating Christian experiences to them. 
    "Come and hear, all you that fear God, and I will declare what he has done 
    for my soul." How often has this blown up the fire that was nearly being 
    extinguished. "He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God; 
    many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord." The ceasing of 
    this Christian conversation among professors, is one great cause of the 
    decay of religion at this day. "The disciples said one to another, Did not 
    our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and while he 
    opened to us the scriptures?"</p>
<p align="justify">III. I shall present some motives to excite us to this 
    duty.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Your duty to your neighbor calls for this at your 
    hand. It is a graceless tale to say with Cain, Am I my brother's keeper? As 
    you are men, the moral law obliges you to it. You shall love your neighbor 
    as yourself. And how do you love him, if you love not his soul? and how do 
    you love his soul, if you do not cherish the Spirit in him? As you are 
    Christians, our Savior says, "A new commandment I give unto you, that you 
    love one another. By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if 
    you have love one to another." The communion of saints is an article of our 
    creed, but it is much worn out in practice. The sacrament of the Lord's 
    Supper is not only a seal of our communion with Christ, but with one 
    another, and so to bind us effectually to a particular concern for the 
    welfare of one another's souls.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Your duty to our Lord Jesus Christ binds you to it. 
    "For the zeal of your house, says David, has eaten me up: and the reproaches 
    of them that reproached you are fallen upon me." Have you any concern for 
    the kingdom of Jesus Christ? Then it will not be mere speaking for the 
    support of an opinion that will satisfy you, but active endeavors for 
    advancing of real holiness. The Spirit of Christ is a public Spirit, that 
    will lead us to be concerned for the welfare of others as well as our own. 
    For it is natural for each member of the body to be concerned for the 
    prosperity of the body.</p>
<p align="justify">3. As you act in this matter, so you join with God or the 
    devil, and may expect your reward accordingly. If you quench the Spirit in 
    others, then you are fighters against God, you are workers together with the 
    devil, whose work it is to quench the Sprit in the hearts of sinners. Acts 
    5:35–39. If you cherish the Spirit you are workers together with God, and 
    are pursuing the same design with the Spirit of Christ. And now the Lord is 
    saying, who is on my side? Arrange yourselves then on his side, and be 
    exhorted to save yourselves from this untoward generation.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The salvation or damnation of your neighbor, may, 
    for ought you know, depend upon it. If you cherish the Spirit in others you 
    may be the instruments of the salvation of a soul. And remember "that he who 
    converts the sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, 
    and shall hide a multitude of sins." If you quench the Spirit in them, you 
    know not if ever the holy fire may be rekindled, after you have put it out, 
    and so the blood of their souls may be required at your hand.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Quench not the Spirit in your own souls but nourish 
    and cherish it. Before I proceed to prosecute this exhortation, I must speak 
    to three cases.</p>
<p align="justify">I. There may be some, that after all that was going at 
    this solemn occasion, they were looking for nothing, and they have got as 
    little. So this sin cannot fall out in their hand, they cannot quench the 
    Spirit, for the holy fire was never kindled in their hearts. Thus having 
    nothing, they can lose nothing. To such I would say,</p>
<p align="justify">1. What would you think to see the showers of Heaven fall 
    all around on your neighbor's ground, while not one drop fell on yours, and 
    this in time of a great drought? Would you not think yourselves the mark at 
    which God shoots his arrows? Now what can you think of yourselves when God 
    touches the hearts of others, but never touches yours? When he goes by you, 
    and comes by you, speaks by his Spirit to those on your right hand and those 
    on your left, but never one word to you? Is not this very like the case of 
    being given up of God; "Ephraim is joined to his idols let him alone." For a 
    tree to be without leaves, or fruit in the winter is nothing, but to be so 
    in the spring and summer, when all about it is flourishing, says that tree 
    is for the axe and near to the fire.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Do you think that such a state as this will continue? 
    Will you always be secure and sleep in peace? Nay, you shall have an 
    awakening sooner or later, if not in mercy it will be in wrath. "Rise up you 
    women that are at ease; hear my voice, you careless daughters; give ear unto 
    my speech. Many days and years shall you be troubled, you careless women." 
    If you should sleep it out all your days, you shall awaken at length, never 
    to close your eyes more. "And in Hell he lifted up his eyes, being in 
    torments, and sees Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom." God will one 
    time or other take the filthy garments of your sin, wrap them up in 
    brimstone, and set them on fire about your ears.</p>
<p align="justify">II. There may be others, that whether they were looking 
    for it or not, got something, but it is gone from them already, like 
    Nebuchadnezzar's dream. The Spirit is already quenched in them.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider that you have lost a fair wind for Immanuel's 
    land, and that is a great loss. It is a shameful loss, it is gone so soon. 
    And have you even so soon forgot his works? You were told your hazard. You 
    might have taken better heed. Be ashamed and grieved on this account.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Take it in time and there may be hope to recover it, 
    set about it quickly. Rise now and seek a recovery. The longer you delay, it 
    will be the harder to recover. "I will rise now, and go about the city: in 
    the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loves."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Go back and seek where you lost it. Consider what 
    particular neglect of yours, or what particular violence done to the Spirit 
    it was, which provoked him to depart. Seek it out, mourn over it, apply to 
    the blood of Christ for the removal of it, and you will recover. For this 
    blood "purges our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Go over your whole work again, in self 
    examination, viewing the several steps of your way about the communion, and 
    review your covenant with God there sealed, and cry to him by prayer for the 
    return of his Spirit. Song 3:2. and downwards. And hang on about his hand 
    resolutely, until you be revived, and made to walk in the paths of 
    righteousness.</p>
<p align="justify">III. There may be others, that were looking for 
    something. But alas! says the soul, I am sadly disappointed. The Lord has 
    hidden his face. How shall I do, who have little or nothing to do with? To 
    such I would say,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Your case is so far hopeful, as you are sensible of 
    it. Bless God your case is not like Samson's, "when he awoke out of his 
    sleep, and said, I will go out, as at other times before, and shake myself. 
    And he knew not that the Lord was departed from him." The knowledge of the 
    disease is the first step to the cure.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Consider what may have been the procuring causes. It 
    may be there has been some remarkable defect in your preparation to meet the 
    Lord. Perhaps you have not been at pains to prepare yourselves, neglecting 
    self-examination, or being careless in it, not stirring up the sacramental 
    graces. And if so, you may wonder more, that he has not made a breach on 
    you, than that he has hidden his face from you.</p>
<p align="justify">Look there has not been some unrepented of guilt lying on 
    your conscience. "But your iniquities have separated between you and your 
    God, and your sins have hidden his face from you, that he will not hear." 
    Some of the old leaven retained, some bosom idol nourished, some Achan in 
    the camp. "Now if we regard iniquity in our hearts, the Lord will not hear 
    us." If so, search it out and remove that bane of strife between the Lord 
    and you. Look that you have not sat down on your preparation. It is hard for 
    us to be at much pains and not think too much of it. And thus one may be 
    like the bee, that drowns itself in its own work. If so mourn over it. 
    Finally, Look that while you have done many things, you have not neglected 
    the main thing, that is the great duty of believing, believing in the gospel 
    promise sealed by the sacrament. There are some poor tossed souls, who in 
    effect are sometimes not disposed to believe, and they do not see the evil, 
    they refuse to be comforted, or make any believing application to themselves 
    of Christ and his benefits. "If I had called, says Job, and he had answered 
    me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. For he 
    breaks me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause." But pray 
    what do you mean? Must God change his method of grace for you? Hear what 
    Christ says, "said I not unto you, that, if you would believe, you should 
    see the glory of God."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Perhaps you complain more of your case than need 
    requires. As to your disappointment. There are some disappointments not to 
    be complained of. They are useful for carrying on the Lord's work in the 
    soul. There are deadening disappointments, that take away with them all the 
    appetite of the soul after Christ and his benefits, and sharpen the appetite 
    after the world and lusts. Numbers 11:4. and downwards. So that being 
    disappointed at Christ's door, they go the more greedily back to that of the 
    world and their lusts. This is very dangerous. But there are also quickening 
    disappointments, that stir up the soul to seek the Lord more earnestly. Song 
    3:4. Our Lord has sundry dishes at his table. Some for filling the guests, 
    these are sensible enjoyments. Some for appetizing them, and these are these 
    quickening disappointments. If you have got this, quench not the Spirit, for 
    you have that which is of more worth than you are aware, Song 5:4–6. If our 
    Lord has passed by you, but withal thrown this live coal into your heart in 
    passing, cherish it, pursue and you shall find.</p>
<p align="justify">Besides there are different measures of the Spirit, and 
    divers operations of the same Spirit; and the holy fire is not alike 
    vigorous in all where it comes. But the least filing of gold is gold, and 
    therefore precious. And the least motions of the Spirit are to be 
    entertained; the least spark of the holy fire is to be fed and not quenched.</p>
<p align="justify">Question.—How shall I know that the Spirit has been at 
    work in my soul, that any of the holy fire has been kindled in my heart, 
    that so I may know what to do? Answer,</p>
<p align="justify">I. The holy fire has light with it. Is there a new light 
    let into your soul from the word, that is promising. But know that there are 
    very different degrees of that light. The blind man whose eyes our Lord 
    opened, after the first touch, saw men as trees walking, but when Jesus put 
    his hands upon him again, then he was restored and saw every man clearly. 
    The King brings some into his chambers, and by the light shining about them, 
    they see and are assured of the Lord's love to them. They can read the 
    covenant with Christ's name and their own name at the foot of it. O quench 
    not the Spirit, improve the golden spot of time and walk softly for the 
    light is easily put out. "What shall I say? said Hezekiah when his life was 
    lengthened, he has both spoken unto me, and himself has done it: I shall go 
    softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul." Others perhaps have only 
    got some glimmerings of solid hope from the Lord. They came in a dark night 
    of desertion. But the day began to break with them and their head was 
    brought a little above the water, though they could not read the covenant 
    clearly; yet like the blind man, they saw men as trees; had some faint 
    discoveries of their interest in his favor. Quench not the Spirit. Some 
    perhaps have only seen a glory in Christ which they saw not before. They 
    have lived strangers to him hitherto, but now he is more beautiful in their 
    eyes than formerly. O quench not the Spirit, but blow up the spark. Imitate 
    the spouse, Song 5:9. to the end. Think upon the excellencies of Christ, and 
    seek after him.</p>
<p align="justify">All that others have got, is perhaps but some convictions 
    of sin. Some arrows have pierced their consciences. Or perhaps but one 
    single arrow is sticking there. O quench not the Spirit. Has the conscience 
    got a touch, the heart may get one next. One stone in the building of sin 
    loosened, may make way for all falling together. "Now when they heard this, 
    they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the 
    apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do."</p>
<p align="justify">II. The holy fire has a burning heat with it. And this 
    also is of very different degrees. Some perhaps have had the satisfaction to 
    see the holy fire take hold of their corruptions, as that however masterful 
    at other times, yet that fire brought them down, and made them fall to 
    ashes. The Lord has treated them as Joshua did his captains, when he caused 
    them put their feet upon the necks of the captive kings. Some lusts that 
    have long held them under they got subdued. O quench not the Spirit. Wounded 
    lusts getting time to recover, have made sad work at a second onset. Quench 
    not the Spirit, otherwise the brand plucked out of the burning will recover 
    strength. All that it has done for others is, that fire has been set to the 
    bond that bound their hearts and lusts together. They are come the length to 
    be content, that they and their lusts were freely parted, though they know 
    not how it will be done. O quench not the Spirit. You have your lusts now at 
    an advantage. The throne of sin in the heart is shaken. Lusts sit not so 
    fast as they did there. Hold hand to the tottering fence, its breaking may 
    come at an instant.</p>
<p align="justify">With some there may be only an unusual, but weak warmth 
    in the heart after Christ and religion. They have a hankering after him. 
    They are more squeamish as to their lusts than before; though perhaps they 
    cannot yet see, how if they quit them for Christ, their loss will be made 
    up. Truly this is very little, but everything must have a beginning. O 
    quench not the Spirit; the cloud like a man's hand may soon cover the 
    heavens. The conversion of Zacchaeus had as small a beginning. Luke 13:3. He 
    sought to see Jesus, who he was. You have seen and are touched. Take a 
    better look of the plant of renown, and you may come to be pierced, caught, 
    captivated.</p>
<p align="justify">Some may find no sensible warmth in their breasts after 
    him, but there is an uneasiness in their conscience, as by a spark falling 
    from a candle on a person's hand. They have a sort of uneasiness with 
    respect to their soul's case, a secret dissatisfaction with their state. 
    This is very little, but it may be the beginning of good. Then quench not 
    the Spirit, for if the dry bones be but beginning to move, they may come 
    together. Thus it appears the Spirit may be at work, though in different 
    degrees. And though your attainments be not so great as those of others, be 
    thankful for what you have attained, and cherish it.</p>
<p align="justify">Perhaps it has not been so dark a night with you, as with 
    them that have got a clearer day. If you be not lifted up so high as others, 
    it is like you have not been plunged so low as they were. In the 
    dispensation of grace usually the saddest dejection goes before the greatest 
    elevation. "For every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill 
    shall be made low; and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough 
    places plain. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our 
    consolation also abounds by Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">Again, It is like you have not such hard work before you, 
    as they have. God's children are not suffered to eat idle bread. There is 
    commonly hard work appointed for them that get a large meal. "Thus the angel 
    of the Lord came again the second time to Elijah, and touched him and said, 
    arise and eat because the journey is too great for you. And he arose, and 
    did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and 
    forty nights, unto Horeb the mount of God." The clearest manifestations of 
    God to a soul, ordinarily usher in the hardest services. If you compare the 
    life of Isaac with the life of Jacob, the latter had the greatest 
    enjoyments, but so had he the hardest trials. Once more sovereignty 
    challenges a latitude. Is it not lawful for me, says God, to do what I will 
    with mine own? Is your eye evil, because I am good? It takes one piece of 
    clay and sets it upon a throne, another piece of the same clay and sets it 
    upon a dunghill, Job 21:22–25. Every disciple is not the beloved disciple. 
    One is dandled upon the knee, another is led to Heaven by the brink of Hell.</p>
<p align="justify">And however small your attainment be, yet consider, the 
    less it be it will die out the sooner, so there is the more need to be at 
    pains to keep it alive. They that have but one coal had need to cover it 
    well, that it go not out. No person need teach those that have but one penny 
    in their purse to steward it well. O that we were as wise in spiritual 
    things as in temporal.</p>
<p align="justify">Consider also, that however little it be Satan will think 
    it worth his pains to rob you of it. "When any one hears the word of the 
    kingdom and understands it not, then comes the wicked one, and caches away 
    that which was sown in his heart." And is it not then worth pains to keep 
    it. But, alas! we are not so watchful by far for our salvation, as Satan is 
    for our destruction.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, Be it as small as it will, it is your all. The 
    poor man thinks he has as good reason to be careful of his little stock, as 
    another has to be careful of his great one. And if that little be gone what 
    have you more. But if you labor not to preserve the little, you would let 
    more go if you had it. "He who is faithful in that which is least, is 
    faithful also in much: and he who is unjust in the least, is unjust also in 
    much." And therefore it is just with God to give you no more of that kind to 
    abuse. So then God has you on your trials for more, while he puts some 
    little thing into your hand. Take heed how you use it. For the least 
    beginning of good to your souls is of more worth than the whole world. It 
    may be the seed of everlasting life to you, and so virtually comprehend your 
    everlasting happiness, which it will be dreadful to throw away. And the less 
    a precious thing be, it is the more carefully preserved.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, Consider that the kingdom of God in a soul often 
    has a very small beginning. Hence it is compared "To a grain of mustard 
    seed, which indeed is the least of all seeds."</p>
<p align="justify">And now having considered these cases, I resume my 
    exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">Quench not the Spirit in yourselves, but nourish and 
    cherish it.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall show how the Spirit may be quenched by you in 
    your own souls. There are many ways to do this, you should beware of them 
    all.</p>
<p align="justify">1. By unwatchfulness. Hence the exhortation, "Be watchful 
    and strengthen the things that remain, that are ready to die." The holy fire 
    will go out if it be not watched. A careless disposition of mind will soon 
    make an empty soul. "By much slothfulness the building decays, and through 
    idleness of the hands the house drop through." If we consider that our 
    hearts are like wet timber, that it is unfit for keeping fire, and that 
    there are so many temptations like rain falling from the clouds, we will 
    soon see, that there is no keeping the fire in, if we give over our 
    watching.</p>
<p align="justify">2. By neglect of duties. The heart of man touched by the 
    finger of God is like a watch, that if it be not duly rolled up will not go. 
    Thomas being absent from one occasion of communion with Christ, his heart 
    was overspread with the power of unbelief. If a man neglect the means of 
    grace, how can he think his soul will prosper. The neglecting of prayer 
    once, or of any other duty may quench the Spirit. And one such neglect may 
    be a wide door for good impressions to go out at.</p>
<p align="justify">3. By not complying with holy motions raised in the 
    heart. David was aware of this. Hence says he, "When you said, seek you my 
    face; my heart said unto you, Your face, Lord, will I seek." It is a 
    dangerous business to sit still, when the Lord, by a secret working on the 
    soul, may be calling one to rise. To shift a duty while the Spirit of the 
    Lord is inwardly prompting a man to it. Sometimes persons have smarted sadly 
    this way. They would not go when wind and tide were inviting, and afterwards 
    when they would the wind would not serve. The Spirit of the Lord, like a man 
    held too long at the door, being grieved departs, and is gone when the door 
    comes to be opened. "I opened, says the spouse to my beloved; but my beloved 
    had withdrawn himself and was gone."</p>
<p align="justify">But to prevent delusion in this case, Consider that the 
    Spirit of the Lord sets men always on work in season. Accordingly the good 
    man brings forth his fruit in his season. And hence though a motion in 
    itself be good, yet if it be unseasonable, that is an evidence, that it is 
    either from our own spirits, or a worse. "For God is not the author of 
    confusion, but of peace as in all the churches." Again the duty will be a 
    duty of our station. "But as God has distributed to every man, as the Lord 
    has called every one, so let him walk: and so I ordain in all churches." 
    Thus some think Uzzah's error in putting forth his hand and taking hold of 
    the ark, 2 Samuel 6:6. was that he was no Levite. So though it seemed a 
    pious motion, yet not being a duty of his station, it was unacceptable and 
    offensive in the sight of God.</p>
<p align="justify">In like manner, violent motions are to be suspected. For 
    these that come from the Spirit of the Lord, if they bring not a convincing 
    evidence along with them, as light discovers itself, to carry the person at 
    first beyond hesitation; they will admit deliberation, and always trial by 
    the word. "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether 
    they be of God." Whereas delusions shun the light, as unable to abide a 
    trial. "To the law and to the testimony, if they speak not according to 
    these, it is because there is no light in them."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Sins against light, do in a special manner quench the 
    Spirit. "Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins, let them not 
    have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from 
    the great transgression." By these the holy fire is quenched, as by vessels 
    of water thrown upon a fire to put it out. They waste the conscience, erase 
    good impressions from the heart, defile the soul, and provoke the Spirit to 
    depart. Beware of them, for they will quench the Spirit and are highly 
    provoking in the sight of God. For sins of ignorance and weakness make men 
    go halting, but such presumptuous sins do as it were break the legs of the 
    travelers to Zion.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Fleshly lusts have a special malignant influence this 
    way. "Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from 
    fleshly lusts which war against the soul." They are the impure waters, in 
    which good impressions are drowned. To be drunk with wine, and filled with 
    the Spirit are inconsistent and incompatible. "And be not drunk with wine, 
    wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit." What we have, Proverbs 
    23:21. holds true in spiritual as well as in temporal things. "For the 
    drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; and drowsiness shall clothe 
    a man with rags." Filthiness and impurity wear out good motions in a very 
    effectual manner. If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God 
    destroy. They who give themselves up to voluptuousness and sensuality in 
    heart and life, will soon find the Spirit will be quenched by these means. 
    For they who drench themselves in the pleasures of the flesh, will find it 
    hard to get out of the mire to soar aloft.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Inordinate care of and love to the world. "And that 
    which fell among the thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, 
    and are choked with cares, and riches, and pleasures of this life, and bring 
    no fruit to perfection." When the heart is set upon the stretch for gaining 
    and keeping of the things of the world, good motions do evanish, because the 
    hold of them cannot be kept, while such an eager hold is taken of other 
    things, no more than one can grasp at Heaven and earth at once. These are 
    like wasps and flies that disturb the soul, that it cannot rest in God. And 
    how can a man ever think to prosper, while he comes not away with Christ 
    from the deceitful and dangerous world.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Backsliding and returning again to former sins. "The 
    backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways." Therefore take that 
    exhortation. "As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to 
    your former lusts in your ignorance." If men will go back to the same 
    courses, which have before injured their souls, and will play with the 
    serpent that has so often bit them; what can they expect but that the Spirit 
    will be quenched.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The entertaining of any one lust or idol, of 
    jealousy will do it. "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not 
    hear me." While Samson lay in Delilah's lap, he lost his locks and the Lord 
    departed from him. The fly goes about the candle until its wings are burned. 
    And the entertaining of some unmortified idol often rears up a wall of 
    separation between God and a soul. Let us now,</p>
<p align="justify">II. Know how we may nourish and cherish this holy fire.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Be diligent in duties. The soul of the diligent shall 
    be made fat. Let no opportunity of communion with God slip. He who would 
    advance his spiritual stock, must trade in the market of free grace.</p>
<p align="justify">It is observable that persons readily drink in much of 
    the spirit of those whom they love most, and with whom they most converse. 
    And they that converse much with God, will get much of his Spirit. I would 
    recommend to you particularly, the duty of Christian conference. See how 
    much the disciples' going to Emmaus gained by this exercise, Luke 24:17–32. 
    It is a notable mean to cherish good motions both in ourselves and others. 
    It is the way to increase what we have, as well as to retain it. As air will 
    make the coal blaze that was lying hidden under the ashes, so the very 
    speaking of God and religion, is apt to inflame the heart, that otherwise is 
    very dead. And surely the decay of this exercise is one cause of the decay 
    of religion in our day.</p>
<p align="justify">I also recommend the duty of secret prayer. A Christian 
    much alone with God in prayer, will readily be found a thriving Christian. 
    Pray without ceasing. It is a duty in which Christians most commonly have 
    communion, and a duty to which they have access, when they cannot have it to 
    many others. If you neglect this, truly your soul's case will soon go to 
    wreck. Here also let me recommend a conscientious attendance upon public 
    ordinances. "Therefore with joy shall you draw water out of the wells of 
    salvation." Faith comes by hearing and so do other graces, for they follow 
    upon it. And this makes many gracious souls that they cannot live without 
    them. They find their need of them every day, still standing in need to be 
    instructed, warned, directed, comforted, and stirred up to their duty. So 
    that they are as necessary as showers to the parched ground.</p>
<p align="justify">And if you find yourselves in hazard of standing still or 
    going backward, set about the duty of solemn personal fasting and 
    humiliation.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Watch your hearts and labor to keep up a tender frame 
    of spirit. "Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues 
    of life." As the heart is, so will the life be. It is the room where the 
    Spirit lodges, and if untenderness get in there, the Spirit will be grieved 
    and depart. Labor to keep up a horror of sin, a hatred of every false way, a 
    sense of your sinfulness, and your need of Christ's blood and Spirit. For 
    when these are lost, the prosperity of the soul is gone, for that soul grows 
    not, that is not growing downward in self-denial, self-abhorrence, and 
    humility.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Be universally tender in your walk. "Then shall I not 
    be ashamed when I have respect unto all your commandments." The Spirit must 
    needs be quenched, when the conversation is like the legs of the lame that 
    are not equal. If men pretend to the duties of the first table, and make no 
    conscience of the duties of the second; or the reverse. One leak in a ship 
    will sink it, and one sin indulged will ruin the soul's case. Therefore, 
    walk with God as if men's eyes were on you, and with men as having God's 
    eyes on you. Let religion have a universal influence on your walk, your 
    thoughts, words, and actions; exciting you to your personal and relative 
    duties. And herein exercise yourselves to have always a conscience void of 
    offence toward God, and toward man.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Make religion your business, your main work and design 
    in the world. Good reason it be so. "For what is a man profited, if he shall 
    gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" To take religion by fits and 
    starts will bring it to a poor account in the end. And religious chance 
    customers will never enrich themselves with it. The salvation and generation 
    work laid upon us, is too weighty and important, for us ever to think that 
    it will do by the by. It is the one thing needful, therefore should be the 
    main thing aimed at by us.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Let religion be woven into the whole of your 
    conversation in the world. "In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall 
    direct your paths. Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltiness, 
    with which will you season it. Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one 
    with another." Whatever be your meat, salt is necessary to season it, and 
    whatever we be doing, grace is necessary to qualify it, for without it 
    nothing is pure to us, in or about us. "Unto the pure all things are pure, 
    but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure, but even 
    their mind and conscience are defiled." You should take religion with you 
    not only to your prayers, but to your work, to the field, to your bed and 
    table. "Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to 
    the glory of God." Viewing God in all these things, acting from a sense of 
    his command, and as under his eye, managing in them all as may be most for 
    the honor of God, your own and others' spiritual welfare.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Beware of doing anything with a doubting conscience, 
    doubting whether it be lawful or not. "And he who doubts is damned if he 
    eat, because he eats not of faith, for whatever is not of faith is sin." But 
    here there is need to distinguish between a doubting and a scrupulous 
    conscience. A doubting conscience hangs in suspense, between the two parts 
    of the question, and assents to neither of them. A scrupulous conscience 
    assents to one part of it, but there is a certain uneasiness inclining it to 
    the other side. In this case one should endeavor to get their scruples 
    removed by examination of them, but if after all they remain, one may safely 
    act against them, because they are but the weakness of conscience, without 
    foundation, and the clearest light lies to the other side. For example, one 
    conscious of his sincere desire to be the Lord's, to give up with all sin 
    and obey Christ's command, do this in remembrance of me, such an one may 
    approach the Lord's table, notwithstanding that a sense of his unworthiness 
    makes him scruple, whether to go forward or not. "For a bruised reed shall 
    he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench." And if it were not 
    so, people might scruple themselves out of all religion. For it is certain, 
    for example, that though prayer be the necessary duty of all, yet some have 
    been tossed with scruples as to their praying, whether they should give over 
    prayer or not. But in such a case, the scruple should be violently thrown 
    away, if no better can be.</p>
<p align="justify">But in the case of the doubting conscience it is another 
    matter, for in it for want of light the conscience has no ground to go upon. 
    For example, money, or goods are placed before a man, he knows not whether 
    they be his or not; if one take them to himself in this case he sins though 
    it be his own, for the conscience, meanwhile, has no light in that matter. 
    So for ought he knows it may be theft, in which case to let alone must 
    certainly be the safest side which is to be followed. And this gives such a 
    throw and wrong cast to conscience, that it is a ready way to quench the 
    Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Be still pressing forward in religion. Sit not down on 
    any measure attained, but be still laboring for more. "This one thing, says 
    Paul, I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth 
    unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark, for the prize 
    of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." Get what we will here, there 
    will always be a want. Therefore hold fast what you have, that the fire go 
    not out. You must also blow it up still that it may burn the more keenly. 
    The Christian never stands still. If you be not going forward, you are going 
    backward. If you be not adding a cubit to your stature, you are decreasing.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Trade with your talents, improving them for God, 
    however few they be. Matthew 25:22, 23. If a person have but a little fire, 
    yet if it get air and be blown up, it may make a brisk fire. And grace grows 
    by improvement. It is with grace and good motions, as with a spring. If it 
    be stopped the water goes away, but if it be cleared it runs and runs on. If 
    one had but a conviction of sin, if he should improve that in speaking of 
    his sinfulness to God in prayer, to humble him in meditation, and to others 
    in Christian conversation, it would grow.</p>
<p align="justify">9. Be careful and tender of good motions. Rough handling 
    of a spark will make it go out, when wise management would make much out of 
    it. Good motions are tender birds of Heaven, easily checked and put back. 
    When the wind blows, spread out your sails, and when your hearts begin to be 
    warmed with love to Christ and holiness, and hatred of sin, the iron then is 
    hot, therefore strike and seize the golden opportunity of making forward in 
    your journey to Immanuel's land.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Entertain lively hopes of increasing your stock. 
    "But let us who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of 
    faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation." When the heart 
    grows hopeless, the hands will hang down and the knees be feeble. "Cast not 
    away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward. But 
    hope of gaining makes people diligent. What though many attempts misgive. 
    The tree falls not down at the first or second stroke of the axe. And water 
    consumes stones by degrees. Let us,</p>
<p align="justify">III. Enforce this duty by some motives. Quench not the 
    Spirit in yourselves, but cherish it.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive 1. Consider that the workings of the Spirit upon 
    your souls are precious, and should be much prized. "Wherefore is there a 
    price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he has no heart to it." 
    These operations of the Spirit are worthy of our utmost care and diligence. 
    They are the seeds of eternal life in a soul, which duly cherished may end 
    in your everlasting salvation; and which, when crushed, may be fatal to your 
    eternal misery. The living word dropped into the heart is Heaven in the bud. 
    "It is the incorruptible seed, by which we are born again." And this, when 
    quenched, is Hell in the bud.</p>
<p align="justify">These operations of the Spirit are high-born strangers, 
    and should be honorably entertained. They are the sparks of the sacred fire 
    from Heaven, the product of the Spirit of Christ in the hearts of sinners. A 
    fire this which could not be blown up by men, and therefore valuable in 
    respect of its heavenly origin.</p>
<p align="justify">They are also great pledges of God's good will to 
    sinners. By nature we are at a distance from God. But by these, the Lord 
    begins to draw us to himself. He enters into converse with our souls, after 
    a long night of silence, a proof of his good will, to have the distance 
    removed. Finally, these operations are denied to many. Ephraim is joined to 
    his idols, let him alone. How many are there whom God suffers to go on in 
    their evil way, and the Spirit of the Lord does not touch their hearts? How 
    many who have sometimes had them, but now they are gone? And they can no 
    more command them, than they can blow up a fire after it has been 
    extinguished, or light a candle that is burned to ashes.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive. 2. Consider the danger of quenching the Spirit. 
    Take heed to yourselves, while the Spirit of the Lord is at work with your 
    souls. You walk on slippery places, where you may easily or suddenly fall, 
    and who knows how fatal it may be. The Spirit in you, is a fire that may be 
    soon and easily quenched.</p>
<p align="justify">I opened to my beloved, says the spouse, but my beloved 
    had withdrawn himself, and was gone. A fine and tender flower may easily be 
    crushed and caused to wither. "Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that 
    spoil the vines; for our vines have tender grapes." God is a jealous God, 
    and his Spirit is easily grieved and provoked to depart.</p>
<p align="justify">When this Spirit is quenched, you cannot rekindle it. Had 
    the fire in the altar been common fire, there needed not have been so much 
    watching to keep it burning. If it had gone out, they could have kindled it 
    from their own hearths. But it was fire from Heaven, and if once it went 
    out, they could not kindle it again. They could not ascend to the throne and 
    bring it down from Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">When the fire of the Spirit is put out, the soul's case 
    must needs go to wreck. Yes, says God, we also to them, when I depart from 
    them. When the soul is gone, the body is left a lifeless lump, and corrupts 
    in a grave, becoming a feast to the worms. And when the Spirit of the Lord 
    leaves a soul, it dies, and living lusts set up their heads, and swarm there 
    without control. Hence often gross outbreakings as in the cases of David and 
    Peter. Fearful apostasies and defections from God, as in Saul, follow the 
    quenching of the Spirit: so that it is like the breaking out of waters, when 
    the dyke is broken down that dammed them up, Matthew 12:43–45.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive. 3. If you cherish and improve the little you 
    have, it is the way to get more. This will appear if you consider, that it 
    is the Lord's ordinary way in his works, to bring great things from small 
    beginnings. Though he could have made the world in a moment, yet he took six 
    days, he made first a rude mass, which, day by day, he brought to 
    perfection. See 1 Kings 18:43. to the end. See also how great work begins, 
    Esther 6:1.</p>
<p align="justify">Consider also that the work of grace in the soul, 
    commonly arises from a very small beginning. It is like a grain of mustard 
    seed. It is a seed that springs so leisurely, that the springing thereof can 
    hardly be discerned. The beginning may be very low, which the Lord will 
    cherish and bring to perfection. "For a bruised reed he shall not break, and 
    the smoking flax shall he not quench." Besides, consider that no person gets 
    a refusal from Heaven, but those that court it by their own indifference. 
    And indeed a careless faint way of asking from the Lord, is in effect to 
    court a denial. He is more ready to give than we are to seek. Open your 
    mouth, says he, wide, and I will fill it. He loves importunity, and will not 
    deny such a suit. And though some such suiters have stood long at his door, 
    never one fell down dead at it. God has given his word of promise for it. 
    "For unto every one that has, shall be given, and he shall have abundance." 
    A man has no more in God's account, than what he improves. Now God does not 
    set down all his children with equal stocks, some have more, some less. But 
    all have a promise of more, on their improving of what they have. And a 
    little thing with a promise, will be like the five loaves that increased in 
    the distribution.</p>
<p align="justify">Motive 4. If you quench the Spirit, you will be great 
    losers. You will lose what you have attained. "Look to yourselves, that we 
    lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full 
    reward." The good motions will go, and then the tenderness of the heart, 
    love to Christ goes away; and you are set a step further back in your way to 
    Heaven. And who knows if you lose that if ever the wind blow so fair again 
    for you. And if it should, you will have to begin, and it is a sad matter 
    always to be beginning, ever learning, and never coming to the knowledge of 
    the truth.</p>
<p align="justify">You will also lose all your pains which you have taken to 
    get it. "The slothful man roasts not that which he took in hunting: but the 
    substance of a diligent man is precious." How sad is it to be at pains for 
    something, and then when it is got to let it slip through our fingers. We 
    have enough to do, though we do not undo what we have been doing.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, You may lose your souls by quenching the Spirit. 
    "And Jesus said unto him, No man having put his hand to the plough, and 
    looking back is fit for the kingdom of Heaven. Now the just shall live by 
    faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him." And 
    it will heat the furnace of Hell one seven times more, to think that once 
    you were not far from the kingdom of God. Amen.</p>
