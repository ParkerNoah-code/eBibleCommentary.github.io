<p align="justify"><br/>
    Psalm 45:10, "Forget also your own people, and your father's house."</p>
<p align="justify">THIS is the second advice given to the spouse of Christ, 
    in order to the pleasing of her husband, namely, that for him, she renounce 
    all that formerly was dearer to her than he was. The advice is delivered in 
    figurative terms, and in it there is a plain allusion to that law of 
    marriage, Genesis 2:24, by which married persons are obliged to prefer their 
    relatives to their natural parents, in point of affection and interest. When 
    a woman is single, and at home in her father's house, her affection runs 
    strongest to her father's family. Her interest is joined with theirs, and 
    she conforms herself to them. But being married, her husband and his family 
    takes the place with her; her affection must run strongest towards her 
    husband and his family.</p>
<p align="justify">The advice, I think, is equivalent to that, "That you put 
    off, concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt, 
    according to the deceitful lusts." Or that, "as obedient children, not 
    fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance." As 
    if he had said, seeing you are now espoused to Christ, bring not your old 
    manners and ways into your new state, but forsake and forget them, and 
    behave no more as your father's daughter, but as Christ's spouse. In the 
    words there is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The natural relations of Christ's spouse pointed at, 
    in contradistinction to those of her husband. She wants not relations, 
    indeed, but they are such as she can have no credit nor good from them, but 
    will be the worse of them, and therefore her husband has taken her out from 
    among them, and would have her to forget them.</p>
<p align="justify">She has some that are her natural country people, her own 
    people. Who are these, but the world that lies in wickedness; and before she 
    was espoused to Christ, she was one of their own, but he has chosen her out 
    of the world. Every country has its own fashions, and in former times she 
    followed the fashions of the country as well as the rest.</p>
<p align="justify">She has also a father's house in that country. Who is her 
    father naturally but the devil? John 8:44, and though she has left the 
    house, yet he keeps house there still, with his children and servants; Luke 
    15:15. It denotes the state of unregeneracy, which men are in while in the 
    black state of nature, out of which, when they are brought to Christ, they 
    are brought as it were out of their father's house. Every house has its own 
    fashions, and Christ's spouse followed the fashion of the house as well as 
    others, while she was in it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is the duty of Christ's spouse with respect to 
    these. She must forget them, both of them. And here there is something 
    supposed, that is, that Christ's spouse is apt to have a hankering after her 
    own people and father's house, even after she has left them, as Laban 
    alleged that Jacob sore longed after his father's house. There may be eager 
    looks back again, while the soul minds them, and that with too much 
    affection, not sufficiently weaned from them.</p>
<p align="justify">There is something also expressed, that Christ's spouse 
    ought to forget them. Not absolutely, for she not only may, but ought to 
    mind them for her own humiliation and thankfulness. "For we ourselves also, 
    were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and 
    pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another." But 
    in respect of affection, her heart must be weaned from them, she must not 
    desire to return to them; and in respect of practice, she must no more 
    conform herself to them. She must forget also her people, must not conform 
    herself to the world. Rom, 12:2. She must forget also her father's house, 
    her former lusts in her ignorance. A man's country is dear to him, but his 
    father's house is dearer. So what is dearest to us in the world, must be 
    forsaken for Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 1. The hearts of those espoused to Christ, are 
    often found much unweaned from their father's house and former lusts, 
    therefore is she taught to forget them. As it is with a childish new married 
    woman, they have a foolish hankering after the house from which they came.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall show in what this unweanedness appears.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Whence it is that those who are espoused to Christ 
    are so much unweaned from, and cannot forget their father's house and former 
    lusts. We are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show in what this unweanedness from their father's 
    house and former lusts appears.</p>
<p align="justify">1. In the cooling of our zeal against our father's house, 
    and the fashions thereof. Our husband's house and our father's are at war 
    with each other; and this war is zealously prosecuted on both sides, by 
    Michael and the dragon. When Christ's spouse then remits her zeal against 
    sin, she appears partial in favor of her father's house. Christ finds fault 
    with her, because "she has left her first love." And so far as she is not 
    with Christ, in prosecuting the quarrel vigorously, she is so far against 
    him. So far as she is not gathering with him, she is scattering abroad. But 
    O! how quickly does the heart harden, and how soon does sin turn from being 
    such a frightful spectacle, as it was before, and at the espousals.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In kindly reflections on the entertainment in our 
    father's house, remembering with any delight or pleasure our former ways. 
    The Israelites were not sufficiently weaned from the house of their bondage 
    in Egypt, and they gave evidence of this by weeping, and saying, "who shall 
    give us flesh to eat." We should never reflect on our former evil ways, but 
    with shame and sorrow; but often, by kindly reflecting on these things, we 
    as it were return to our vomit. And the looking back on them stirs up love, 
    not loathing.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In uneasiness under the restraints of our husband's 
    house, saying, with the Israelites, "here there is nothing at all besides 
    this manna, before our eyes." A heart used to sinful liberty, cannot easily 
    take up with the restraint. The soul used to gadding abroad, will not easily 
    become a keeper at home. But were the soul duly weaned, it would be very 
    easy under all the holy restraints of the house of Heaven, and would find a 
    free walk within the inclosure of the divine law. The soul will say with 
    David, "I will walk at liberty, for I seek your precepts."</p>
<p align="justify">4. In hankering after our father's house, and former 
    lusts, in our hearts turning back to Egypt. Nothing can be more plain 
    evidence, than these rueful looks to our old lusts. This was the fault of 
    Lot's wife, for which she was turned into a pillar of salt, yet it is most 
    incident to the children of men. When Adam was in paradise, his heart was 
    hankering after the forbidden fruit; and though Christ brings sinners into a 
    paradise on earth, yet they are still greedily looking over the hedge.</p>
<p align="justify">5. In kindly entertaining any sent from our father's 
    house; by this people express their old kindness to the house. Our father, 
    as long as we are in the world, will be sending to us; we will not want 
    messengers of Satan, even temptations to our old sins; but if we were duly 
    weaned from the house, we would deny them; we would deny ungodliness and 
    worldly lusts. We would do with them, as Elisha did with the messenger whom 
    the king of Israel sent to take away his head; we would shut the door, and 
    hold them fast at the door, saying, Is not the sound of their master's feet 
    behind them.</p>
<p align="justify">But alas! they are readily received, they are welcomed 
    and fed by us, according to their kind. 2 Samuel 12:4.</p>
<p align="justify">6. In serving our husband after the fashion of our 
    father's house; like a new married woman, who though she has changed the 
    house, yet she keeps the fashions of that from which she came. So though the 
    man will not neglect prayer, hearing, and other duties, yet he is so far 
    unweaned, that he performs these often only as they do who are still in his 
    father's house. This our Lord peremptorily discharges: "When you pray," says 
    he, "you shall not be as the hypocrites are." He will have his own work done 
    after the fashion of his own house.</p>
<p align="justify">7. In our stealing visits to our father's house, and 
    secret tampering with former lusts. Stealing it must be, for our Lord and 
    Husband will never give his consent to the meeting again. Ezekiel 6:9. But 
    alas! how often is Christ's spouse missed out of her husband's house; her 
    Lord is seeking her, but she is not at home, but gadding abroad, even lying 
    in the embraces of former lusts and lovers. And though the soul that is 
    truly married, will never rest there, but return to her first husband, Hosea 
    2:7, yet that woeful departing is a sad appearance of a heart unweaned from 
    former lovers.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Many that have been espoused to Christ before the 
    world, but not from the heart, quite forsake their husband, and go back, for 
    altogether, to their father's house by their apostasy. Like the mixed 
    multitudes that came out of Egypt, but before they were gone far in the 
    wilderness sounded a retreat back to the place from which they came. "The 
    dog is thus turned to his vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her 
    wallowing in the mire. These are they that draw back into perdition." The 
    case of many, alas! is like that of the Levite's concubine; Judges 19. 
    Concubines were indeed wives contracted to their husbands, though not with 
    so great solemnity as proper wives; but they were bond servants, not free, 
    not mistress of the family, nor could their children inherit. She played the 
    harlot and went back to her father's house; and though means were used, yet 
    she never came back to her husband's house, but perished in the way she had 
    chosen. We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show whence it is that those who are espoused to 
    Christ are so much unweaned from, and cannot forget their father's house and 
    former lusts. There are some who have been joined to Christ only by the 
    hand, who have given him the hand, but never gave him the heart. They are 
    hypocrites, who have in profession only accepted of Christ in the marriage 
    covenant. Others are joined to him with the heart who have really given 
    themselves away to Christ without any dissimulation, as all true believers 
    have done. Both these may fall under this charge, though they cannot go back 
    an equal length to their former ways. Now for the reasons:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The consent of many to Christ is an involuntary 
    consent. It was but a forced pretense, that ever they came into the 
    covenant, no wonder then that they quickly look back. There are many things 
    that may force a consent to the gospel covenant from a man; such as the 
    power of the rod, an awakened conscience, and the like, may do it. Psalm 
    78:34, 36, 37. The stone thrown up in the air, will fall down of its own 
    accord, when the force ceases. So will a rod forcibly bowed together extend 
    itself again, when the hand that bowed it is removed; and a sow brought into 
    a palace, will return to wallow in the mire, as soon as the restraint is 
    removed. So will the heart return that is driven, but not drawn by love, 
    into the covenant.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because the heart has not been freely loosed from 
    someone sin or another. Satan sometimes makes such an offer to his vassals, 
    as Pharaoh did to Moses. "I will let you go," said he, "that you may 
    sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very 
    far away." They accept. They go a great length with that young man, Mark 
    10:20, but still, as he, so they lack one thing, verse 21. There is someone 
    lust or another, with which they can never freely part. Anything but that 
    they will do, and when they seem to be putting their lusts in Christ's hands 
    to destroy them, the secret voice of their hearts concerning that one is, 
    what David charged Joab concerning Absalom, "Deal gently with the young 
    man." And this serves Satan as a handle, by which he draws them back.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because sin has never been made bitter enough to them, 
    they have never been thoroughly weaned from their father's house. Hence, 
    they are as the drunkard, who says, "they have stricken me, and I was not 
    sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will 
    seek it yet again." Men will never forget, nor cease to suck the breasts of 
    their lusts, until God lay gall and wormwood on them in such measure as to 
    make the enjoyment of them more bitter than the want of them. What lightly 
    comes, lightly goes. They who never had the fallow ground of their hearts 
    ploughed up, and ploughed deep enough, must needs sow among thorns. Jeremiah 
    4:3, 4. The child that never found bitterness on the breasts, is easily set 
    on again; and the soul that never tasted the bitterness of sin, will break 
    over purposes, vows and resolutions, to get to it again.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Because by reason of their not living by faith on 
    Christ, they find not that soul satisfaction in him which they expected. No 
    wonder she long to be back at her father's house, who is disappointed of 
    comfort in her husband's. The heart of man is an empty, hungry thing, that 
    must always have something to feed upon; and if it feed not on Christ, it 
    will go back to feed on lusts. The mixed multitude that came out of Egypt, 
    not being brought, as they expected, to Canaan directly, they soon began to 
    long after the enjoyment of Egypt.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Because there is a principle of corruption in the 
    best, which still inclines the wrong way. "But I see," says Paul, "another 
    law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into 
    captivity to the law of sin which is in my members." Hence the best have 
    deceitful hearts; "yes, deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked." 
    They are as deceitful bows, ever ready to carry beside the mark. They are 
    difficult to be known, and unworthy to be trusted. The root of all sin, the 
    spawn of all iniquity is in them.</p>
<p align="justify">We are naturally simple souls. However resolute and 
    peremptory we may be in things carnal, we are all of an easy temper, easily 
    led aside to our own spiritual loss: easily beguiled in things that concern 
    our souls' welfare. Esau, though a cunning hunter, was easily betrayed in 
    the matter of the birthright.</p>
<p align="justify">We are also unstable souls. Unstable as water. A good 
    frame is hard to get, and easily lost. It is like letters written in the 
    sand, that a blast of wind does obliterate. Hence the soul often turns aside 
    very quickly, and on very slender occasions, as Peter at the voice of a 
    maid, and that even soon after some remarkable manifestations from the Lord. 
    Thus it is said, that even "the disciples considered not the miracles of the 
    loaves, for their heart was hardened."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Because those of our father's house are still 
    exerting themselves to make those espoused to Christ to keep up their former 
    correspondence with them. While we are in the world, we will not want 
    temptations. Satan is very diligent to improve all opportunities to make 
    Christ's spouse deal falsely in her covenant. "Be sober, be vigilant, 
    because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking 
    whom he may devour." He is a subtle enemy, and has his devices, by which to 
    entrap unwary souls. So we may blame our unwatchfulness for this.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. This may serve for our conviction and humiliation. 
    We may lament and be ashamed of this bias of our hearts, so ready to look 
    back to our former lusts, and after vows to make inquiry. Alas! are we not 
    already found guilty in this point. How quickly is our zeal gone against our 
    father's house, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Beware of looking back, and of hankering desires 
    after your father's house and former lusts. For motives, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The evil of this, the retaining any kindness to your 
    former lusts in your ignorance, will be very grievous to the Spirit of 
    Christ, whom you call your Lord and Husband. And no wonder, will you love 
    them that hate the Lord, will you retain kindness to the enemies of your 
    Lord; will you embrace those that were the cause of his death, and long to 
    return to these, to deliver you from which Christ has done and suffered so 
    much.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It will mar your communion with Christ. If you grieve 
    his Spirit, he will depart. If you do not leave off your adulterous glauces 
    to your idols, it will procure you his frowns instead of his smiles. If we 
    regard iniquity in our hearts, the Lord will not hear us. So much of our 
    hearts as our lusts get, so much Christ loses of them; and so much as we 
    enjoy of them, so much we lose of the enjoyment of the Lord. Our loss, 
    therefore, will be far greater than our gain.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It will keep you still unfixed and unstable in 
    religion, so as you shall not make progress in it. They will never look to 
    purpose to the house of their husband, nor duly take his interest to heart, 
    that do not forget their father's house. A divided heart will never be 
    hearty for the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is very dishonorable to Christ. Is not this blessed 
    match with the Son of God sufficient to compensate the loss of what you had 
    in your father's house. Can anything be more dishonorable, than that the 
    soul should still be hankering to be away, as if they repented the bargain 
    with the Lord of glory.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is the fountain of apostasy. They that are 
    often looking away, will be fair to break away at length. The way of sin is 
    down the hill, from less to greater. This is the blowing of the coal, which 
    in time may proceed to a consuming flame.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 2. Those that are espoused to Christ, must 
    forget their own people and their father's house. There are two points here: 
    namely, first, the forgetting of our own people; and secondly, the 
    forgetting of our father's house. I will speak to these in order. And in 
    speaking, first, of forgetting our own people, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show who are our own people, whom we must forget.</p>
<p align="justify">II. In what respects we must forget them.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Why we must forget them. I am then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show who are our own people, whom we must forget. 
    In a word, it is the wicked world, "the children of disobedience, among 
    whom, in time past, we had our conversation." When the soul comes to Christ, 
    it must say as Ruth to Naomi, "your people shall be my people, and your God 
    my God." When Christ calls a soul to himself, he calls it out of the world. 
    The church is a congregation gathered out of, and separated from the world; 
    though not in place, yet in respect of affection, which is the greatest 
    separation. But to be more particular, a saint may know who are his own 
    people, by taking a look of himself, as corrupt and carnal.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Then they are our own people, who are yet living in 
    darkness, unacquainted with the corruption of their nature, and misery of 
    it; strangers to the spirituality of the law of God; strangers to the 
    majesty and holiness of God, their absolute need of Christ, and his 
    preciousness and excellency. The saints may remember the day in which they 
    lived in that same region of darkness, and knew not more of these things 
    than they, and may hence conclude these are their own people. "Be not you 
    therefore partakers with them. For you were sometimes darkness, but now are 
    you light in the Lord: walk as children of the light."</p>
<p align="justify">2. They who are living in the same way and manner that 
    the spouse of Christ did before her espousals; they are their own people 
    walking on in the way which they have left; Ephesians 2:2, 3. Are they 
    following the course of the world? do they venture frankly over the hedge of 
    God's laws? You may know, then, by your former conversation, that they are 
    your own people, from among whom Christ plucked you, as brands out of the 
    burning.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They who are going the same way your carnal hearts 
    would go, if they were left to their own corrupt choice. These are your own 
    people; for as in water face answers to face, so do your hearts, as corrupt, 
    answer to theirs. It is grace only that makes the difference, for the same 
    nature is in both, only the power of that corrupt nature is broken in those 
    that are espoused to Christ, but it is entire in others. There is another 
    principle beside it in the godly, but it is alone, and sways all, in others.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They who are living in the same barren region, in 
    which the saints lived, before their espousals to Christ. The state of 
    nature is that barren region; that is a far country, far from God and his 
    covenant, and therefore there is no communication between God and them, no 
    influences for making them fruitful in the works of holiness; but a fullness 
    of these our grapes of wickedness. These are our own people: "For we 
    ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers 
    lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy; hateful, and hating one 
    another." We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show in what respects we must forget them.</p>
<p align="justify">1. We must forsake their company; it is evil company, 
    unfitting Christ's spouse. "Forsake the foolish and live, and go in the way 
    of understanding." While we are in the world, indeed, there is no shunning 
    of evil men altogether; but you must not make wicked men your familiar 
    friends, you must not choose their company; and if necessity lead you into 
    their company, you must take heed to yourselves in it, and haste out of it 
    as a plague house. They that are espoused to Christ, and yet keep wicked 
    company as before, give no great evidence of their sincerity. Birds of a 
    feather flock together, and you may know what a man is, by the company which 
    he loves best.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We must not conform ourselves to them, nor be like 
    them in their way. The command is, "be not conformed unto this world.' If we 
    pretend a difference in our state from theirs, let there be a visible 
    difference between our way and theirs. Do Satan's drudges bear the devil's 
    mark, let us hate to take it on, or learn of them their ways. All that have 
    a mind for Heaven, must be nonformists to the world, because the way of the 
    world is against God and his law.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We must forget them in affection, saying, Depart from 
    me, you bloody men. Though we are to wish well to the persons of all men, we 
    must hate their evil ways, saying with David, "I hate the work of them that 
    turn aside, it shall not cleave unto me." We must no more esteem their way 
    as we were accustomed, nor desire to return into it. Have we been coming out 
    of Sodom, we must not look back with a rueful look, otherwise we are not fit 
    for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Why we must forget them.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because they are not going our way. All men are on a 
    journey to Heaven, or to Hell. There is a strait and narrow way that leads 
    to Heaven, a broad way to Hell. If we are espoused to Christ, then we are on 
    the narrow way; and how can we but forsake them that are going the quite 
    opposite way. Nothing is more opposite than the way of holiness, and the way 
    of the world; therefore we must either give up pretenses to Christ, or give 
    up with the way of the world, "wherein in time past we walked according to 
    the course of this world."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because the godly and the wicked world are on two 
    different sides, under two opposite heads, Christ and the devil. All the 
    world is divided between these two, the Savior of the world, and the God of 
    the world. Christ's party are his spouse, brethren, members of his body. The 
    devil's are his captives, prisoners, slaves. And though these of Satan's 
    party may come over, yet the truly godly will never mix with them in their 
    ways. "You shall keep them, O Lord, you shall preserve them from this 
    generation forever."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because, in consenting to Christ, we give up with 
    them. If you take me, let these go their way. Their company is infectious. 
    "Evil communications corrupt good manners." Their way is destructive, 
    therefore let not your hearts go after them and their ways. When you engaged 
    with Christ, you engaged against both, and said, "your people shall be my 
    people, and where you go I will go."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Because the world's friendship is enmity with God. 
    James 4:4. What is wicked company but a combination against God, to trample 
    on his laws, dishonor his Son, and grieve his Spirit. What are the ways of 
    the world, but a direct opposition to God. So far, then, as we go with them, 
    so far we go away from God. So much as they and their ways get of our 
    affections, so much we lose of affection to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Because there will be a total separation at last 
    of the godly and wicked, Matthew 25. Grace begins it here. Grace gives a new 
    nature, new principles, new designs, and new motives, all which make a new 
    conversation, opposite to the way of the world. Therefore if we would not 
    lodge with them in eternity, we must give up with them in time.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. Be exhorted then to forsake evil company, to stand 
    at a distance from it, and conform not yourselves to the way of the world.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. Consider how unaccountable it is, that Christ's 
    sheep should be found among the devil's goats; and Christ's servants joining 
    issue with the devil's slaves? 2 Corinthians 6:14â€“16. If you have given up 
    your name to Christ, why are you found on the devil's ground. Let the swine 
    of the world feed together on the husks of sin, lie down together on the 
    dunghill of their filthy lusts; but what has any to do among them that 
    pretends to be a child of God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The closer you are linked with them, the farther are 
    you from God. Mix with the world and their way, and God will not know you as 
    his. He commands a separation from these, if you would have a reception from 
    him. "Wherefore," says he, "come out from among them, and be you separate, 
    says the Lord; and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you." Men 
    must go to the one side or the other; there is no keeping up with both God 
    and ungodly company. Will men be swearing a covenant with God one day, and 
    swearing with profane swearers another; drinking at the Lord's table, and at 
    the table of drunkards, 1 Corinthians 10:21. God will never own such 
    vagrants for members of his household. See their doom, Jude 13.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It hardens the wicked in their way. It is Solomon's 
    observation, "they that forsake the law, praise the wicked; but such as keep 
    the law contend with them." The sins of professors, going the way of evil 
    men, is a practical testimony to the way of sin, emboldening the wicked to 
    go on in their way. Whereas a testimony is to be kept up for God in the 
    world, by a walk contrary to the way of the world. Thus Noah contended 
    against the security and wickedness of the world, by a holy life, "by which 
    he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by 
    faith."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Evil company is an affecting plague. "Evil 
    communications corrupt good manners." How many fair blossoms of religion 
    have been killed in the bud, by the poisonous breath of evil company? How 
    many have been dragged over the belly of good principles, vows, and 
    resolutions, by the violence of it. There is a mighty efficacy in it to 
    advance the devil's kingdom, and men being once drawn in, it is a thousand 
    to one if they go not far beyond these bounds which they had prescribed to 
    themselves. For the devil's agents have that off their master, let them once 
    get in a finger, and they will endeavor to get the whole hand to follow.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, If you do not be separated, you will share with 
    them. Weighty is that word, "a companion of fools shall be destroyed." How 
    many have cursed the day that ever they saw the face of those by whom they 
    have been first led into sin, and next to ruin. It will be no comfort to 
    suffer God's wrath with company, whatever may be in sinning together. If we 
    go in the way with the wicked, we must go to the same place with them. And 
    though mercy should rescue you, it will be so as by fire, as we see in Lot's 
    case.</p>
<p align="justify">Let all take this warning, and observe it in their 
    occasional encounters, that they be on their guard, and likewise in their 
    fixed communications, in all changes of our lot, choose good company; and 
    when you see that you are inevitably connected with naughty companions, mark 
    them, that you may avoid them as much as possible.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I proceed now to speak of the forgetting of our 
    father's house. This father is our father the devil, who keeps house in a 
    wicked world, and in every unregenerate heart. But we must give up with it, 
    if ever we would see the house of our father in Heaven. Here we shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show with what of our father's house we must give up.</p>
<p align="justify">1. You must part with the master of the house, Satan, and 
    renounce your relation to the house. Though you have no express compact with 
    him, you have need to do this. There is a twofold relation all natural men 
    have to the house. They are servants of the house, hence it is said, you 
    were the servants of sin; their work is sin, and their wages is death. It is 
    sad work, miserable wages; for he is the worst of masters, and they are the 
    meanest sort of servants. Sinners have no term when they may leave their 
    master, for they are slaves to Satan, and wholly in their master's power, 
    taken captive by him at his will. He has a threefold title to them as his 
    slaves. They are his slaves taken in war, "for of whom a man is overcome, of 
    the same he is brought in bondage." The devil having proclaimed war against 
    Heaven, attacked man as heaven's ally and confederate, and gained the 
    victory over him. He is pursuing this war still against mankind, and driving 
    the unrenewed world before him as prisoners of war, and so at his will. 
    Isaiah 49:24, 25. They are also his bought slaves. Men, in general, like the 
    Israelites, "have sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord, to 
    provoke him to anger." Where there is such a sale, Satan must needs be the 
    buyer. It is a very low price, indeed, even for nothing. The foolish sinner 
    thinks not so, while he makes the bargain; but when the latter end comes, he 
    will see it is all naught he has gained, in comparison of the soul that is 
    lost. Rome drives this trade. Revelation 18:13. Where have they learned it, 
    but from the devil, who early set it up, buying our first parents for a 
    parcel of forbidden fruit, and had the impudence to order the second Adam to 
    fall down and worship him. He is daily buying a drunkard for some strong 
    drink, a covetous worldling for a little pelf, a hypocrite for a name, 
    unjust persons and liars for a very little thing. They are also his born 
    slaves, born in his house, Ephesians 2:3. Many are born of parents, slaves 
    to the devil, themselves, all their days; even those who themselves are 
    free, yet their children are not therefore free too, for "they were shaped 
    in iniquity, and in sin did their mothers conceive them." It is not the 
    first birth, but the second, that will make us free men. Now we must give up 
    that relation to the house. We must renounce our service, and break away 
    from our old master, and betake ourselves to Christ, as a new master, who 
    makes all his servants free men.</p>
<p align="justify">They are sons of the house. "You are of your father, the 
    devil," said our Lord to the Jews. A sad sonship, for it is an ill house; it 
    is to be a son of Hell, a prison house, a dark house, a dreadful house. 
    Never was a child liker a father, than unregenerate persons are like the 
    devil. His nature is enmity against God and his law, so is theirs. He is 
    fallen, and so are they; lying in wickedness, and so are they.</p>
<p align="justify">Now we must give up that relation to the house. We must 
    be born again, we must be new creatures, or we will be ashamed of our 
    pretended espousals to Christ. For if any man be in Christ he is a new 
    creature: old things are passed away; behold all things are become new." The 
    image of Satan must be defaced, the image of God restored in sanctification, 
    and that work advanced in daily mortification to sin, and living to 
    righteousness.</p>
<p align="justify">2. You must quit the work of the house. We must cast off 
    the works of darkness. There is never an idle person about our father's 
    house. Satan keeps all his children and servants busy at their task, that so 
    they may not think of ways to escape, or of leaving him, as Pharaoh did with 
    the Israelites. And what are they always about that keeps them busy. They 
    are always at one of two things, they are either weaving the spider's web, 
    or hatching the cockatrice egg. "They are weaving the spider's web." They 
    are very busy doing nothing. Nothing for God, their souls, or eternity. 
    Their webs will not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves 
    with their works. All that they are busy about, will do no more to help 
    their souls in the day of wrath, than a cobweb will clothe a man to defend 
    him against the cold. The broom of death will sweep them and it away 
    together; and about this heads and hands are employed. Or "they are hatching 
    the cackatrice' eggs. He who eats of their eggs dies; and that which is 
    crushed breaks out into a viper. They weary themselves to commit iniquity. 
    They draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and treasure up wrath against the 
    day of wrath." This is work. It is hard, toilsome, and dark work, 
    soul-ruining work. Yet it is the work of the house, in which each strives to 
    outdo another, and undo themselves. But as in other houses some are employed 
    in coarser work, and others in finer, so it is in this house. The master of 
    the house puts his coarser work in the hands of the profane, ignorant, earth 
    worm, that has not so much as a form of godliness; and their task is "to 
    fulfill the lusts of the flesh." He employs their tongues in swearing and 
    lying, their bellies in gluttony and drunkenness, their bodies in impurity, 
    their hands in picking and stealing; and their heads, hearts, hands 
    continually about the world; so that on their belly they must go, and can 
    never get up their head above the world, and their eye must never be 
    satisfied with seeing, nor their ear with hearing, but like the grave, cry 
    give, give; and loading themselves with thick clay, which they will never 
    let go, until death separate them.</p>
<p align="justify">He puts his finer work in the hands of the hypocritical 
    professors, who work such a coat to themselves, as they shine in it like 
    angels of light, and their task is, "to fulfill the desires of the mind." He 
    employs them to deceive the world with their hypocritical pretenses to 
    piety, and to deceive themselves also. Their business is to oppose 
    themselves to the very heart and life of the gospel, by their unbelief, 
    self-righteousness, pride, and self-conceit; and to keep in the life of some 
    lusts by their form of religion, and shelter them under a cover of religious 
    duties; to do much mischief to the church of God, and stumble and bring to 
    ruin many poor souls.</p>
<p align="justify">Now you must quit the work of the house, of whatever sort 
    it be. You must not be like those that will give over their master, engage 
    with another, and yet come back, and fall to their work again. You must take 
    other work in hand: I do not say more work, for as the watch that goes 
    wrong, goes as fast as that which goes right, you will have as much work in 
    your father's house as in your husband's.</p>
<p align="justify">3. You must part with the provision and entertainment of 
    the house. People use to get their meat where they work their work, and 
    Satan's slaves get their meat also in their father's house. And what is 
    their entertainment? He sets them down "to eat dust with the serpent," 
    Isaiah 65:25. He feeds them on filthy lusts, which may nourish their 
    corruptions, but is poisonous to their souls. Satan did once eat angel's 
    food in the enjoyment of God, but now dust is his meat with the serpent, 
    that is, as it was the meat and drink of Christ to do the will of his 
    Father, so it is Satan's to sin against God and to do mischief, all the 
    pleasure he has lies there. So it is with Christless sinners, the sweetest 
    milk which they suck is out of the breasts of their lusts; the enjoyment of 
    God was never so sweet to those whose God is their belly, as meat and drink; 
    the dishonest person has not so much pleasure in the gospel treasure, as in 
    some thing that he can catch to please the covetous heart.</p>
<p align="justify">He sets them also "to eat husks with the swine," Luke 
    15:16. He feeds them with the empty dry things of the world, and they are 
    dressed up according as every one likes best. Some get the pleasures, others 
    the profits, others the honors of it set before them, and on these they 
    feed. So the voluptuous man has more delight in carnal pleasures than in 
    communion with God; "for they are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of 
    God." The worldling has more pleasure in his goods and chattels, than in all 
    the spiritual gains of true godliness. These things are to him but shadows, 
    but what he can hold is substance. "I am become rich," says he, "I have 
    found me out substance." The ambitious man has more delight in a name and 
    honor among men, than in the honor of God's approbation. "How can you 
    believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that 
    comes from God only."</p>
<p align="justify">Now you must quit the entertainment of the house, and 
    betake yourself to the entertainment and provision of the house of Heaven. 
    "Wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread, and your labor 
    for that which satisfies not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat you that 
    which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness." You ask bread 
    in your father's house, and he gives you a stone, for what he gives is not 
    bread, and satisfies not the soul. The dust of lusts is not good, change 
    your dust then, and "eat that which is good." God, grace, communion with 
    God, and all the benefits of the covenant are good. They are good for the 
    soul and the body, for time and eternity. The husks of the world have no 
    fatness in them, change them therefore, and "let your souls delight 
    themselves in fatness." Spiritual things are full of sap, and will make your 
    souls prosper.</p>
<p align="justify">4. You must quit the fashions of the house. Every house 
    has its own fashions, and so has your father's; but that must not keep them 
    up. "Be not conformed unto this world." They are evil fashions, you are not 
    to bring them along with you to your husband's house. The fashion of the 
    house, in natural actions, is to follow these actions in a mere selfish way, 
    to gratify a carnal appetite, without any eye to God in them, or fitting us 
    thereby for his service. You must quit it, and must not be like your 
    father's house in them. Modesty and sobriety, and referring all to the honor 
    of God, is the fashion you must fall in with, as the fashion of your 
    husband's house. "Whether, therefore, you eat or drink, or whatever you do, 
    do all to the glory of God." The fashion of your father's house, in civil 
    actions, is to be sunk and swallowed up in these things, to be minding them 
    more "than the one thing needful," and to have no respect to the command nor 
    honor of God in them; and so to make these things either jostle out duty to 
    God altogether, or to take such a lift of them, that no vigor of spirit, and 
    sometimes even no strength of body, is left for duty to God. To be untender 
    in these things, and even to give conscience a stretch, if a person can gain 
    any profit or ease by it. To count truth in words, and exact uprightness in 
    dealing, and to do no other way to others, than we would they should do to 
    us, but needless nicety. If you quit not these fashions, you will never see 
    the house of Heaven. Luke 10:41, 42; 1 Corinthians 6:8, 9; 1 Thessalonians 
    4:6. If ever men get more religion, they will get more moral honesty.</p>
<p align="justify">The fashion of your father's house in religious actions, 
    (for there is some religion even in that house, but it is of the fashion of 
    the house), that is to hold with the one half, and that too the worst half, 
    the outer half, the mere form of godliness. To hold with bodily exercise, 
    but endeavor not to worship God in spirit. So that men in that house shut 
    the eyes of their bodies, yet their hearts are going after their 
    covetousness; they bow their knees, but their hearts remain inflexible. It 
    is their custom to seek to please themselves more than God, Matthew 6:2. To 
    go about these duties that they may sin the more freely, and so make a 
    covering of them to some lust, Proverbs 7:14, 15. They put them in Christ's 
    room, "going about to establish a righteousness of their own." If you quit 
    not these fashions, you are not God's people, "for God is a spirit, and they 
    that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth." "His people are 
    the circumcision, who worship him in spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and 
    have no confidence in the flesh." Hypocrisy is a mask which God will pluck 
    off.</p>
<p align="justify">5. You must quit the garb of the house. Under the Old 
    Testament, when people were to make any solemn appearance before God, they 
    were called to change their garments, Genesis 34:2. And if you would show 
    yourselves Christ's spouse, you must part with the garb of the house, off 
    which you are come. You must part with the inner garment of the house, "that 
    is the old man with his deeds." Ephesians 4:22; Colossians 3:9. The old man 
    is the corrupt evil nature; his deeds are the corrupt workings of that 
    nature in heart and life. These cleave close to us, as a belt to the loins 
    of a man, but we must be putting them off by daily mortification. In vain do 
    we pretend to be espoused to Christ, if we still retain our former lusts. 
    Christ has another garment for his spouse, which we must put on, if ever we 
    see Heaven, that is "the new man," the new nature with a new life, Ephesians 
    4:24. It is made up of two pieces: righteousness, the whole of our duty to 
    man; and holiness, the whole of our duty to God. For true religion is 
    universal, and therefore it is called a man; not a member or two of a man, 
    but a whole man.</p>
<p align="justify">You must also part with the upper garment of the house, 
    that is the filthy rags of your own righteousness, Isaiah 64:6; Zechariah 
    3:4. The way in our father's house, is to cover their unrighteousness with 
    their own righteousness, their evil with their good, their sins with their 
    duties. But alas! all this is but a covering of rags, that will not hide 
    your shame before the Lord; a covering of filthy rags, that will make you 
    more vile. Christ has provided the white clothing of his own righteousness 
    for you, that must be put on by faith; and all you do must be washed in the 
    blood of the lamb, or you will be ruined with it. You must learn that lesson 
    in your husband's house, that never one could yet learn in their father's 
    house, even to work in religion, as if you were to win Heaven by working, 
    and then to overlook all, as if you had done nothing.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, You must quit the interest of the house. People 
    readily are concerned for the interest of the house of which they are 
    members, and none more than the members of our father's, that do their 
    utmost to support it. Now, if you mind for Heaven, you must quit this 
    interest, and pursue the interest of the house of Heaven. You must not 
    interest yourselves in the quarrels of that house. That house has a quarrel 
    against the image of God, the power of godliness, and the people of God, 
    Genesis 3:15; and all the members of the house interest themselves in the 
    quarrel, one way or another, to bear down the exercise of godliness. 
    Persecutors strike it down; mockers jest upon, and laugh at it; the worldly 
    man gravely pronounces it to be folly; the hypocrite's heart rises bitterly 
    against it, and bears it down and smothers it, with contention and strife 
    about outward things. All join together in the quarrel, though they go 
    different ways to work. But you must stand upon the side of godliness.</p>
<p align="justify">You must not support the interest of your father's house. 
    Christ was sent to pull it down, "to destroy the works of the devil;" do not 
    you put to your hand to hold it up. The members of the house are very much 
    concerned to hold it up. They will not give their help to curb sin, but, 
    upon the contrary, they encourage one another by example and otherwise, like 
    Babel-builders, to go on with the work. Let none that mind for Heaven, 
    support the interest of Satan in the family, or in any place where they are. 
    We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To give reasons, why these that are espoused to 
    Christ, must forget their father's house.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because our father's house, and husband's house, are 
    quite contrary the one to the other, as Heaven and Hell, light and darkness, 
    and there is no reconciling them, 2 Corinthians 6:14, 15. Therefore we must 
    renounce our part in, and relation to the one, if we mind to plead a part 
    in, and relation to the other. They never shall mix. "God will preserve his 
    people from this generation, forever." They never can mix. "You cannot serve 
    God and mammon." The heads of these houses are opposite, the work, the 
    entertainment, the fashions, and interests; therefore, as you would not 
    renounce your part in Christ, forget your father's house.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because, as our husband's house is most honorable, so 
    our father's house is most base. These that are espoused to Christ, as 
    Christ is their husband, they are God's children; they are of the same 
    family with the angels; nay, the very angels are ministering spirits, to 
    take care of them who are joint heirs with Christ. They are honorable in 
    their relations, and rich in their title to Heaven and glory. But our 
    father's house has nothing in it but baseness, for it is a fallen house, 
    fallen from honor to the deepest disgrace, from happiness to extreme poverty 
    and misery. For us to follow the ways of it, is as if one brought into a 
    noble family could not forget, but bring along with her, the way of the 
    beggarly family from which she came.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because we will never apply ourselves to the way of 
    our husband's house, if we forget not our father's house. While the hearts 
    of the Israelites were set on the flesh pots of Egypt, they could make no 
    progress in their journey to Canaan. Laban knew that Jacob could not enjoy 
    his service, when he much longed after his father's house. The affectionate 
    remembrance of the work and provision of our father's house will be a dead 
    weight on those that have begun to run the race set before them; and always, 
    the more we give way to our corruptions, the more tenderly we handle our 
    lusts, religion will be the more difficult.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Because it is the worst of houses. No wonder, for the 
    devil, the worst of masters, is the master of the house. No slavery like the 
    service of that house. It is soul slavery. No entertainment like it, for it 
    can never satisfy; nay, it is destructive to the soul. The work thereof is 
    sin, the wages death, eternal death. The fashions of the house are the very 
    reverse of all that is good. The interests of the house are the dishonor of 
    God, the ruin of mankind. The garb of the house is filthy rags, and the 
    shame of their nakedness will at length appear before the world.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of Information. It informs us,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In vain do we pretend to be espoused to Christ, if we 
    do not reform our lives according to the rules of the gospel, but still hold 
    on the old way, 2 Corinthians 5:17. The old life, with a new profession and 
    an engagement to be the Lord's, will make men but whited sepulchers; or like 
    an old rotten wall new plastered, that will burst out fearfully, and go to 
    ruin.</p>
<p align="justify">It is not enongh to be like neighbor and other. It is but 
    a sorry character. All the people of God must be nonconformists to, and 
    dissenters from the world. The broad gate is room enough for multitudes, but 
    they that will be at Heaven, must be a singular sort of people, for they are 
    men wondered at; content to take on them the hatred of their native country, 
    and father's house.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. 2. It reproves those that will not forget their 
    father's house, but cleave to it and to the way thereof. And who are these?</p>
<p align="justify">1. Those that, in the midst of gospel light, yet continue 
    in the darkness of the house; even all grossly ignorant persons. They that 
    are brought out of their father's house to Christ, are brought out of 
    darkness to light, though they know not a letter. "They were sometimes 
    darkness, but now are they light in the Lord." If people remain ignorant 
    under gospel means, we know what is the cause, their father has put out 
    their eyes. 2 Corinthians 4:8, 4. This will end in eternal darkness. "It is 
    a people of no understanding, therefore he who made them will not have mercy 
    on them; and he who formed them, will show them no favor."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Those that retain the language of the house. When 
    Peter spoke, the damsel knew what countryman he was. "You are a Galilean, 
    for your speech betrays you." And what shall we say of you, that are a 
    curser, a swearer, a liar, a filthy speaker, but you are a Hellilean. I 
    appeal to your own consciences, what sort of language that is, whether it 
    sounds like Heaven or Hell. To hear a man speak as if Hell were opening; 
    breathing out lies, as if inspired by the father of them; speaking, as if an 
    unclean devil were speaking out of him; what can one think in such a case, 
    but that the person speaks like the house to which he belongs. But if you 
    will not forbear that language, it will turn to blaspheming at length 
    through a long eternity. For the former is the language of the house in 
    time, the other in eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Those that wear the badge of the house on their 
    breasts, the master of the house's mark on their foreheads, so that those 
    who go by may easily know who they are. Profane people. You that will not 
    bow a knee to God. "The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will 
    not seek after God." You that take room to yourselves in all licentiousness, 
    that have nothing to do with religion, but to show aversion to all that is 
    good; if not to mock and reproach others that seem to be religious. Will you 
    pretend to any portion in Christ? No, no, you know not Christ, and he will 
    dishown you. A dumb devil possesses you now, that you cannot, will not pray 
    to God now; the day will come, that you will cry to the hills to fall upon 
    you, and hide you from the face of the judge. You will have a merry life of 
    it now, but you shall weep; you will make a jest of religion now, but that 
    will make you roar at length. Your heart is averse to all that is good now, 
    the copestone will be put on it in Hell. You care not for prayers, godly 
    discourse, examinations, or sermons; but some of you will go to the hill 
    with the beasts, Sabbath after Sabbath, and desire no person to take that 
    task off your hand. Well were it for you, if, as you live with the beasts, 
    you were to die with them also.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Those that give up themselves to the trade of the 
    house, minding nothing but the world, earthly things. They have no trade 
    with Heaven. They know not what communion with God means. They will have 
    their work on earth as far advanced as their neighbors, but their work for 
    eternity is yet to begin. They are so busy they cannot get time for it. They 
    have so much to do otherwise, they cannot get anything done to purpose for 
    their perishing souls. That is folly, for the world will be consumed in 
    flames, when that soul of yours shall continue to exist, to be either 
    eternally happy or miserable, as it is now seen to be in time.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Those that are the hidden servants of the house. 
    It has been said of some, that they have stealed away to Heaven, without 
    being observed; but there are others that steal away to Hell, and the world 
    never hears the sound of their feet: even deep veiled hypocrites, whited 
    sepulchers. "They are disobedient, deceiving, serving divers lusts and 
    pleasures." They wear Christ's livery, but yet are Satan's drudges. There 
    are always some lusts that have such persons absolutely under their power. 
    The broad way is wide enough, so that they can easily get a bye path in it, 
    to go by themselves to destruction, without mixing with the profane rabble 
    that keep the highway. However, all come to one lodging at length. "As for 
    such as turn aside to their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth 
    with the workers of iniquity."</p>
<p align="justify">USE OF EXHORTATION. Be exhorted to forget your father's 
    house. Leave the master of the house, the work, and the provision of the 
    house. Renounce the devil, the world, and the flesh, and betake yourselves 
    to Christ and his service.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. Your father's house will remove, and it will be 
    a sad removing. Our Lord's family will remove also, but it will be a happy 
    removing. Christ has a higher house in Heaven, to which he will remove all 
    the family he has on earth. The devil has a higher and a lower house also. 
    His higher house is in this world, and it is a throng house; but the day is 
    coming that his family will remove into the lower house, the bottomless pit, 
    so as not one shall remain behind. There are some removing out of it daily, 
    and then the rest that remained behind are secure, but it will not be always 
    so. There was a horrible cry at Dathan and Abiram's removing, Numbers 
    16:31â€“34; what a cry will there be when the family goes away together, and 
    "shall all be cast into the lake of fire," which is their new house! Leave 
    it then quickly, lest you perish with it.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. It is highly reasonable, if you will have any 
    part in Christ. You can have no part in him, but as espoused to him; and if 
    espoused, then "you must leave your father and mother, and cleave to your 
    husband." Did he not say to you in the offer made, If you take me, let these 
    go their way. "Will you come into this house, and not forget your father's 
    house? Nay, if you do not, he will pursue you as he did Israel, like those 
    who break wedlock. You have all professed your acceptance of the marriage 
    covenant, all have had the seal of it in baptism, and some of you in the 
    ordinance of the supper. Remember, then, you have lifted up your hands to 
    the Lord, and cannot go back.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Consider the motive in the following verse, "So 
    shall the king greatly desire your beauty." From this you have several 
    arguments, your leaving off these will truly beautify you in the sight of 
    the Lord. Holiness is a beauty, it is soul beauty, a lasting beauty. Now, 
    thus beautified, you shall be amiable and acceptable in the sight of your 
    Lord and Husband, and he will take pleasure in you. He is a King worthy to 
    be pleased, and his favor worthy to be sought. Finally, you shall be at no 
    loss, whatever you part with for his sake. Communion and fellowship with him 
    will make up all your losses. Amen.</p>
