    Translation Explained; with a Description of Walking with God, as That in 
    Which the Life of Religion Lies</b></font></p>

<p align="justify"><br/>
    Genesis 5:24, "And Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him."</p>
<p align="justify">IT is too evident, that the generation we live in is in a 
    declining condition; that professors are few, but real Christians fewer by 
    far. Religion with many is turned to be the object of their ridicule; and 
    among those that own it, to merely dry and sapless notions, for the most 
    part. Few now are added to the church, or brought over out of the devil's 
    camp. True godliness languishes, and serious experimental religion wears 
    out. Therefore I would press religion in the life and power of it, on those 
    that would save themselves from this untoward generation.</p>
<p align="justify">Here shines the brightest star in the patriarchal age, 
    which having given light to the lower world for a time, was afterwards 
    translated into a higher sphere, and passed out of the world in as un usual 
    a manner as he lived in it. For as men live in the world, so ordinarily they 
    go out of it.</p>
<p align="justify">There is a long account here, where nothing is marked but 
    names and numbers, men's living and dying, until we come to Enoch, whose 
    singular piety is recorded. OBSERVE. The life of man is for the most part a 
    vain thing, of which, by the sleeping of some, and the slumbering of others, 
    nothing remains remarkable, but that they I lived and died. But close 
    walking with God serves another and better purpose, than to cause one just 
    fill up room in the world for a while.</p>
<p align="justify">From the short history of these antediluvian patriarchs, 
    we may learn one lesson, that will serve us all our days, namely, That we 
    must die, however long we live. It is reported of one, that by hearing this 
    chapter read in the church, he got such an impression of his own death, that 
    he turned religious, that he might die well. </p>
<p align="justify">But from the history of Enoch we may learn two lessons. 
    1. How to live well in this world. 2. The happiness that abides those in 
    another world, who so live here; even eternal happiness of soul and body 
    with the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">In the words there is remarked a real preaching that was 
    given to the old world by Enoch; a life-preaching; for his conversation 
    preached to them, what religion was, and what was their great duty, namely, 
    walking with God; a removal-preaching, (we cannot say his death preached, 
    for he did not die; but his passage out of this world preached), that there 
    is another and a better life with God in another world, both for soul and 
    body. And this is no doubt marked, to show us the mercy bestowed on that 
    generation, that the godly in it might be encouraged, and the wicked left 
    without excuse, while such a bright star shone so fair in that dark age. For 
    it is observable, that his walking with God is twice told, once, verse 22, 
    and here again in the text, in conjunction with his happy removal, giving us 
    a compendious body of divinity, written for the use of that age especially, 
    (not excluding others), in this man's life and translation out of the world. 
    So that God left not himself without a witness in that degenerate age. They 
    not only heard, but saw in him, the power of godliness, and the reward of it 
    too.</p>
<p align="justify">OBSERVE, Men will not only have the best instructions and 
    warnings they get from the world, but those they get from the examples of 
    holy men, to answer for in the day of accounts. There are silent preachers, 
    who yet speak home, as Noah, who "being warned of God of things not seen as 
    yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the 
    which he condemned the world;" Hebrews 11:7; and the men, of Nineveh, and 
    the queen of the south, of whom our Lord says, Matthew 12:41, 42, "The men 
    of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn 
    it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater 
    than Jonah is here. The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment 
    with this generation, and shall condemn it; for she came from the uttermost 
    parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than 
    Solomon is here." Examples of a holy life, if they do not lead spectators to 
    Heaven, will drive them more deeply into destruction.</p>
<p align="justify">Though it is charitably thought, that all the patriarchs 
    were good men, yet surely the age wherein Enoch lived was a very degenerate 
    and profane age, Methuselah his son died the same year the deluge came on. 
    He lived nine hundred and sixty-nine years. Enoch walked with God three 
    hundred years. So from his translation there were six hundred and sixty-nine 
    to the deluge. Of that they got one hundred and twenty years' warning of the 
    deluge; so that to that time there were but five hundred and forty-nine 
    years. There were none of those here mentioned but they lived more than 
    seven hundred years. And God's Spirit had been long striving with the 
    generation before the last hundred and twenty years. So that we may well 
    reckon that many of those who lived in Enoch's days, were of those God's 
    Spirit had so long striven with, and that were swept away by the deluge; and 
    consequently that it was a very degenerate and profane age he lived in, 
    wherein men had come the length to talk and act boldly against the God that 
    made them, as appears from Jude 14, 15, "Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, 
    prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of 
    his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are 
    ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly 
    committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken 
    against him."</p>
<p align="justify">OBSERVE, Be the times never so bad, it is men's own fault 
    they are bad too. Eminent holiness, and intimate communion with God, may be 
    attained in the worst of limes. While that generation was running to ruin, 
    Enoch walked with God.</p>
<p align="justify">The reasons are,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because however men grow worse and worse, Heaven in 
    still as good and bountiful as ever; Isaiah 59:1, 2, "Behold, the Lord's 
    hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy that it 
    cannot hear, but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, 
    and your sins have hidden his face from you, that he will not hear." God's 
    door still stands open, though the generation conspire to trouble it very 
    little for supply. Our Lord will never shut his door upon his people, 
    because they are few; but it shall stand open as long as there is one that 
    has business in his house; Micah 2:7, "O you that are named the house of 
    Jacob, is the Spirit of the Lord straitened? are these his doings? do not my 
    words do good to him that walks uprightly?"</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because those that mind for Heaven, must row against 
    the stream always; and if they do not, they will be called down the stream 
    in the best of times; for, says our Lord, Matthew 11:12, "From the days of 
    John the Baptist, until now, the kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the 
    violent take it by force." If people will ply the throne of grace, and 
    resolutely set themselves against the epidemic disease of their day, they 
    may keep lively in the midst of a dead crew, though with much difficulty, as 
    our Lord observes; Revelation 3:4, "You have a few names even in Sardis, 
    which have not defiled their garments."</p>
<p align="justify">3. The badness of the times affords matter to excite 
    God's people the more to their duty, and close walking with God. The 
    profaneness and formality of those they live among, and the dishonor done to 
    God thereby, should be like oil to the flame of their holy love and zeal, as 
    it was to David; Psalm 119:126, 127, "It is time for you, Lord, to work, for 
    they have made void your law. Therefore I love your commandments above gold, 
    yes, above fine gold." The prospect of what must needs be the issue of such 
    apostasy of a generation may also quicken them; even as one is the more 
    concerned to see to his own safety, that the rest of the family are pulling 
    down the house about their own ears; as was the case with Noah, who, among a 
    very wicked and abandoned people, had this character, "Noah was a just man 
    and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God," Genesis 6:9.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly. Because as the Lord shows himself most 
    concerned for the welfare of those who are most concerned for his honor; so 
    the worse the times are, they that cleave to him closely may expect to fare 
    the better, as Noah also did, when the Lord said to him, "Come you, and all 
    your house into the ark: for you have I seen righteous before me in this 
    generation," Genesis 7:1. Moses never had a more glorious manifestation of 
    God, than at the time when the Israelites had fallen into the idolatry of 
    the golden calf, and God was about to destroy the whole nation; as you will 
    find by comparing Exodus 32:10, and chapter 33 and 34.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Learn that those who keep not up communion with 
    God, in the life and power of religion, in evil times, are in God's account 
    joined and embarked with the generation of his wrath; and be who they will, 
    they will smart with the rest for it, though they pot not forth their hands 
    to the notorious abominations of the times they live in. Hence is that 
    threatening, Zephaniah 1:12, "It shall come to pass at that time, that I 
    will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on 
    their lees; that say in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will 
    he do evil." It is a heavy word that sets formal hypocrites and profane 
    wretches on one and the same bottom; Psalm 125., "As for such as turn aside 
    unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of 
    iniquity."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Bad example with its influence will not excuse people 
    before the Lord. While it is no comfort to go to Hell with company, there 
    can be no safety in following a multitude to do evil. What! will men think 
    that because the conspiracy against God and holiness is strong, therefore 
    they may join in it; that because serious godliness is going over the brae, 
    therefore they may give it a push? But we will be to them that give an 
    unhallowed touch to God's wain when it is at the halting.</p>
<p align="justify">3. To be complaining of the evil of the times, sighing 
    and going backward in religion, is a fruitless unavailing complaint, neither 
    pleasing to God, nor profitable to one's self. For at no time does religion 
    consist in talking, but in walking with God. And that is but to condemn 
    ourselves out of our own months.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly. Let us be exhorted to study the power and 
    reality of religion in these dregs of time. Let us draw the nearer to God, 
    that we see so many going far from him. And as we would not bring the wrath 
    of God on ourselves, let us neither join with a profane generation, nor 
    continue on our lees with a formal dead-hearted generation, strangers to the 
    power of godliness. Consider here,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Enoch's holy life in this world.</p>
<p align="justify">2. His happy removal into a better world.</p>
<p align="justify">FIRST, Let us consider Enoch's holy life in this world; 
    "Enoch walked with God." The Spirit of God puts a special remark on this. It 
    is Enoch's honor, that he did not walk as others did, after their lusts. 
    Yes, he walked more holily and closely with God, than other good men of that 
    age.</p>
<p align="justify">OBSERVE 1. God takes special notice of those who are best 
    when others are worst, Genesis 6:9. We see this in the instance of Noah in 
    the old world, and of Lot in Sodom; likewise of those mentioned Ezekiel 9:4, 
    concerning whom the Lord said, "Go through the midst of the city, through 
    the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that 
    sigh, and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst 
    thereof;" and those taken notice of Malachi 3:16, 17, "Then they that feared 
    the Lord, spoke often I one to another, and the Lord hearkened, and heard 
    it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared 
    the Lord, and that thought upon his name. And they shall be mine, says the 
    Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels, and I will spare them 
    as a man spares his own son that serves him."</p>
<p align="justify">1. To be thus argues a sincere spirit, a love to the Lord 
    for himself, and a love to his way for its likeness to himself; that the 
    soul is carried thus to it against the stream of the corruption of the age.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It argues not only grace, but the strength of grace. 
    It must be strong faith, love, etc. that so much bear out against the strong 
    temptation to apostasy, arising from the combination of a generation against 
    God and his way. To be holy when the helps to a holy life are least in the 
    world, argues the vigor of grace in the heart.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. Labor you then to be best while others are worst, to 
    confront the impiety of the generation wherein you live. Do they indulge 
    themselves in licentiousness? be you the more strict and holy in your walk. 
    Do they take up with mere externals in religion? strive you the rather to 
    get into the inner court, to taste and see, and here to have communion with 
    God.</p>
<p align="justify">OBSERVE. 2. It is the honor of a professor of religion, 
    to outdo others in the matter of close walking with God. God himself is 
    glorious in holiness. The more holy one is, the more like is he to God. The 
    liker he is to God, the more honorable is he.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. This lets us see what would be a blessed emulation 
    among professors, namely, that we were striving who should be most tender, 
    holy, and circumspect. O that that were brought in, in the room of all our 
    strifes and contests about practices and opinions, which eat out the life of 
    religion in our day! But alas! real holiness is little regarded, and 
    therefore little striven for.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It must be a godless-like mark in any person, to have 
    the serpentine grudge rise in their breasts against others, as they see them 
    eminent for holy and tender walking. These are the persons most beloved and 
    honored of God; and it looks devilish-like to hate them, and have one's 
    heart rise against them, for that very reason for which God loves them.</p>
<p align="justify">In the first part of the words we have,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The person characterized; and that is Enoch. There was 
    another of this name descended from Cain, who had a city called after his 
    name; Genesis 4:17. Immortality is desired of all; and because men cannot 
    stave off death, they follow after a shadow of immortality, that at least 
    their name may live when they are gone. Therefore that has been an ancient 
    custom, for men to call their lands after their own names; Psalm 49:11. How 
    much better was it with this Enoch, that took that course to get on him the 
    name of the city of God, which Christ promises to write on all his people? 
    Revelation 3:12. The city called by the name of the other Enoch was 
    destroyed by the deluge, and is now unknown; but the city of God lasts 
    still, and will last forever.</p>
<p align="justify">OBSERVE. True piety is the best way to honor, even to 
    true honor. For "the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance," when 
    "the memory of the wicked shall rot."</p>
<p align="justify">Enoch signifies dedicated, initiated, instructed. His 
    life answered his name, for he lived as one devoted to the Lord. OBSERVE. It 
    is the duty of those devoted to God by their godly parents, to devote 
    themselves to the Lord. And where grace comes in with good education, it 
    ordinarily makes men famous in their generation, and signally serviceable to 
    God.</p>
<p align="justify">He was the seventh from Adam, and a prophet, who foretold 
    the last judgment, even in that early age of the church; Jude 14, above 
    cited. He was like Noah, a preacher of righteousness in his day; and like 
    John Baptist, a burning and shining light, burning in his conversation, 
    shining in his doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">OBSERVE. They that live near God, are most likely to be 
    put upon his secrets, and to know most of his mind; Psalm 25:14, "The secret 
    of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant."</p>
<p align="justify">2. His character; he "walked with God." He lived like a 
    man of another world; a life of close communion with God. It imports,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That he was really religious; not only religious 
    before men, but before God. OBSERVE. Religion lies inwardly. We are that 
    really which we are before the Lord; Romans 2., "He is a Jew which is one 
    inwardly."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) He was eminently religious. OBSERVE. Men may attain 
    to eminency in religion, in very bad times, by setting the Lord always 
    before them. See here,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, What he was; a spiritual traveler through the world; 
    he "walked." Whereas it is said of others, they "lived;" it is said of 
    Enoch, "He walked with God." He looked on himself as a pilgrim and stranger 
    in this present world; Hebrews 11:13, compare verse 5, and did not sit down 
    in it to take up his abode on this side Jordan.</p>
<p align="justify">OBSERVE. They that would live a life of communion with 
    God, must live as pilgrims in this world, as travelers through it to a 
    better country.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Their hearts must be loosed from the world, bidding an 
    eternal farewell to it as a portion; 1 John 2:15. The heart gone from God 
    naturally sits down on the creature, to suck the sap of it, and to pursue it 
    as its chief good. Now, the first step to the sours thriving, is to lift the 
    heart from the creature, and once fairly to give up with the vain world.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They must be fixed on the better country; Hebrews 
    11:14. They must look to the land that is afar off, resolutely aiming to be 
    there, and therefore habitually keeping it in their eye, as the mark they 
    desire to hit; Philippians 3:20. Thus we shall be heavenly in the frame and 
    disposition of our spirits.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They must keep death much in their view, the passage 
    out of this world into the other; Job 14:14, "If a man die, shall he live 
    again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait until my change come." 
    See what a familiarity he had contracted with it; chapter 17:14, "I have 
    said to corruption, You are my father; to the worm, You are my mother and my 
    sister." This is the way to wean our hearts from the world, and to stir us 
    up to converse much with another world.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly. They must beware of dipping deep in things of 
    this life, but go through the world lightly, like travelers, who serve 
    themselves with a passing view of those parts they go through; 1 Corinthians 
    7:29–31, "But this I say, brethren, the time is short. It remains, that both 
    they that have wives, be as though they had none; and they that weep, as 
    though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; 
    and they that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use this 
    world, as not abusing it; for the fashion of this world passes away."</p>
<p align="justify">The reason is, because the world is one of the great 
    make-bates between God and a soul. And so far as it gets in between God and 
    us, it causes an eclipse of the light of the Lord's countenance.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. As ever you would live a life of communion with God, 
    live as pilgrims in this world. The manna never fell from Heaven in the 
    wilderness, until the provision brought from Egypt was spent and done. Deny 
    yourselves to this world, if you would have the taste of things of a better 
    world. When the vessels of your hearts are emptied of the love of the world, 
    the oil of grace will run.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The company he kept while he was in the way; "He 
    walked with God." He did not walk with the generation he lived in; did not 
    go on with the multitude, thinking it enough to do as they did; but he 
    "walked with God," being a follower of the Lord, keeping his eye on him.</p>
<p align="justify">OBSERVE. True religion makes one give up with the way of 
    the world, and set God before them for all. It is the way of strangers from 
    God to follow the course of this world; Ephesians 2:2. They that mind for 
    Heaven, must be nonconformists to the world; Romans 12:2. They must be 
    practical separatists from the world, in life and conversation; Psalm 12:7, 
    as it was with Joshua, who said, chapter 24:15, "As for me and my house, we 
    will serve the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. See here what a graceless-like thing it is for 
    people to content themselves to be like neighbor and others. Ah, Sirs, 
    though all the world should approve you, if God condemn you, what will it 
    avail? They that pin their faith or holiness on other people's sleeve, have 
    neither faith nor holiness, and will never see Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">2. See the necessity of a religion beyond the reach of 
    the common gang of the world; Zechariah 3:8. You must not satisfy yourselves 
    with the religion that most part do; but press forward to leave them behind 
    you, because they do not walk with God.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, His constancy in the way of the Lord; he "walked 
    incessantly" as the word signifies. He did not take his religion by fits and 
    starts, as many do, but he kept a constant course of it. Verse 22 tells us, 
    he walked with God three hundred years, all the time he lived after he begat 
    Methuselah. Though perhaps he was a good man while he lived single in his 
    young days, yet his last days were his best days. His greatest eminency for 
    piety was in the days of his married life; while his family was increasing, 
    his soul was increasing too.</p>
<p align="justify">OBSERVE. A married state is a state of life very 
    consistent with the soul's flourishing in religion.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. How unreasonable, then, is that excuse, which goes 
    mighty far with the world; Luke 14:20, "I have married a wife, and therefore 
    I cannot come?" It was not so with Enoch; the comforts of it did not so 
    bewitch him, nor the cares of it so rack his spirit, but that he was one of 
    the holiest and heavenliest men that ever lived. What a pity is it, that 
    that state should be a state of declining in religion to so many, and that 
    as their family increases, their soul's case goes to wreck? So that of their 
    marriage-day it may be said, as John 6:66, "From that time many of his 
    disciples went back, and walked no more with him." It is a holy state, and a 
    helpful one, by God's appointment. It must needs be a dreadful business, 
    where the one proves a snare to the other, for apostasy from the life of 
    God.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, There is Enoch's happy removal into a better 
    world.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider his leaving of this world; "He was not:" no 
    more in this world. Of all the rest it is said, they "died;" but of him 
    only, "he was not," for he died not, but got out of the world without dying. 
    He was taken off,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Soon, being only three hundred and sixty-five years 
    of age. That was in the midst of his days; for there were none of the 
    patriarchs before the flood, but lived more than as long again.</p>
<p align="justify">OBSERVE. God often takes them soonest out of the world 
    that are dearest to him. Why then should we be fond of long life? He was a 
    man that was dear to God, and useful for God. And if he did not live long, 
    he lived fast, and did more in his few days, than others in double the time. 
    He had no loss, for the remainder of his days he got in Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Suddenly; so the phrase seems to import; Psalm 
    37:36, and so the nature of the thing requires it to be; as in the case of 
    Elijah; 2 Kings 2:11, and those who shall be changed; 1 Corinthians 15:51, 
    52, cases parallel to this. He evanished.</p>
<p align="justify">OBSERVE. A sudden removal out of the world may befall the 
    best of God's children. Why should the Lord's people then be afraid of 
    sudden death? It does but make sore work short work; and they that are in 
    Christ can never be taken habitually at least unprepared; and they that 
    always walk habitually with God, are always actually prepared. Good old Eli 
    died such a death.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Consider his transportation to Heaven; "God took him;" 
    took him home, took him up soul and body at once to himself into Heaven; 
    Hebrews 11:5. God made a change on his corruptible body without death, even 
    such a change as will be made on the bodies of the saints that shall be 
    alive at Christ's second coming. So there was as great a difference between 
    his removal and that of others, as between his life and theirs.</p>
<p align="justify">OBSERVE. When the saints leave the world, God takes them 
    home to himself.</p>
<p align="justify">All the patriarchs mentioned in this chapter were alive 
    at Enoch's translation, except Adam, who died some time before, and Noah, 
    who was born some time after. Adam himself had heard the voice of God, and 
    Noah got an eminent confirmation of his faith in his preservation in the 
    ark. Enoch's translation might be confirming to the rest, in the faith of a 
    future happy state of the saints, both in soul and body. And it was a sure 
    pledge of the resurrection, that was then far off, and not yet come.</p>
<p align="justify">OBSERVE. The weight of the doctrine of the resurrection 
    of the dead, which God so early confirmed. It is worthy to be remarked, how 
    Enoch's body was carried to Heaven before the law, Elijah's under the law, 
    and Christ's under the gospel. So that each of the three great periods of 
    the world's age had in it a notable pledge of the resurrection of the body.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. Let us then live and die in the faith of it; and 
    while we live, live as those that look for it.</p>
<p align="justify">Having thus given a large practical explication of the 
    text, I proceed to observe a point of doctrine from them, as the ground of 
    some further discourse.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. The life of religion lies in walking with God; 
    or, the great thing we should aim at for practical godliness, is to walk 
    with God.</p>
<p align="justify">Here I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Explain this walking with God.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Confirm the doctrine, that the life of religion lies 
    in walking with God.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Lastly. Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. For explication of this walking with God, I shall 
    consider it,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In the foundation thereof, with respect to our state.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In the matter of it, in respect of our frame and 
    conversation.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In the properties thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">FIRST. I am to consider walking with God in the 
    foundation thereof, with respect to our state. And so it pre-supposes,</p>
<p align="justify">First, Spiritual life restored to the soul in 
    regeneration. Men are naturally dead to God and holiness; Ephesians 2:1, 
    "dead in trespasses and sins." A dead man cannot walk, and a dead soul 
    cannot walk with God. Before Lazarus once in his grave could move again, he 
    behooved to be quickened and raised again. No wonder that many cannot walk 
    with God, seeing they are strangers to the life of God. They live as they 
    were born in a natural state. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The eye of the understanding is out, and man naturally 
    is blind; Ephesians 5:8. Walking with God is a regular walk; how then can 
    the blind soul walk so? To walk at random is to walk contrary to God; 
    Leviticus 26:21. Hebrews Never a soul will stumble on the way of God; for 
    while in the state of blindness, Satan and lusts lead the soul. Therefore we 
    must be cured by divine illumination; and for this cause the gospel is 
    preached; Acts 26:18, "to open men's eyes, and to turn them from darkness to 
    light."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The feet of the soul, the will and affections, are 
    quite indisposed for walking with God, and they must be cured. Hence is the 
    promise, Ezekiel 36:26, 27, "A new heart will I give you, and a new spirit 
    will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your 
    flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit 
    within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and you shall keep my 
    judgments, and do them."</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They are distorted, disjointed, and cannot ply to 
    the way of God; Jeremiah 13:23, "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the 
    leopard his spots? then may you also do good, that are accustomed to do 
    evil." They have got a set to backsliding from the Lord, and they cannot be 
    cured without a miracle of grace. That must give them a new set, or we are 
    undone forever; Psalm 85, "Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set 
    us in the way of his steps."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They are weak, and unable to bear us in his way, 
    Romans 5:6. We lost our strength in the loins of our first parents, and 
    never recover it until we be in Christ, to partake of his Spirit. If the 
    soul aim to rise, it cannot; if to walk, the legs fail under us. Nay,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) They are powerless, John 15:5, and 6:44. There is 
    power in them to carry us still further out of God's way, but they are 
    absolutely unable to move heavenward, until they be endowed with power from 
    on high. Therefore we are to be concerned for the new nature, the principle 
    of spiritual life.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Faith in God through Jesus Christ. We must come 
    to God before we can walk with him, it is by faith we come to him, Hebrews 
    11:6. We are naturally at a distance from God; in the everlasting covenant 
    God offers to meet us in Christ. So by coming to Christ we meet with God, 
    that we may set off in our way with him. Whoever would walk with God,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Must take God for their God in the covenant, Hebrews 
    8:10, renouncing all others for him, and accepting him as their God and 
    portion, to walk with him as their covenanted God. The world bears great 
    bulk in sinners' eyes naturally, but we must look over it and above it, to 
    the God that made it, that we may take up our souls' everlasting rest in 
    him. So did Enoch, while the rest were following vanities; he closed his 
    eyes on them, and came to God as his soul's home.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They must embrace Christ in the offer of the gospel, 
    seeing in him only we can meet with God. God out of Christ is a consuming 
    fire; but veiled with the flesh of Christ, he is a refreshing son. We cannot 
    walk with an absolute God, more than dry fuel can lie before a consuming 
    fire.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly. A state of reconciliation with God; Amos 3:3, 
    "Can two walk together, except they be agreed?" Man naturally is in a state 
    of enmity with God. And while that lasts, he can never walk with God 
    dutifully to him, nor comfortably to himself. For in that state what we do 
    can never be acceptable to God, nor can we look for comfort to ourselves by 
    it; and hence Eliphaz advises, Job 22:21, "Acquaint now yourself with him, 
    and be at peace; thereby good shall come unto you." Therefore we must be in 
    a justified state, having our sins pardoned for the sake of Christ, and so 
    in a state of peace through the great Peace-maker. When God and a sinner in 
    a state of enmity meet, what can be expected but,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Angry looks? No wonder he turn his back on such; so 
    that though they come to Jerusalem, they see not the King's face; Hosea 5:6, 
    "They shall go—to seek the Lord; but they shall not find him, he has 
    withdrawn himself from them."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Angry words? God can speak so as to make the 
    conscience hear, where there is no audible voice; Psalm 50:16, "But unto the 
    wicked God says, What have you to do to declare my statutes, or that you 
    should take my covenant in your month?" That is a question that imports 
    anger, upbraiding, accusing, and grief for the contempt put upon him. And O 
    what a sad matter is it to have him angry with us in whose favor life lies; 
    him to upbraid us, who does us all the good we get; him our accuser, who is 
    our only intercessor; and him to be grieved with us, who only can make us 
    glad?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Angry strokes? When enemies meet, no wonder there be 
    blows a-dealing. Sometimes there are strokes on the body, 1 Corinthians 
    10:1–6; strokes on the soul, Malachi 1. See how it was with the Israelites 
    in the wilderness; Psalm 106:15, "He gave them their request, but sent 
    leanness into their soul." Wherefore let us labor to have God for our friend 
    in Christ, that we may walk with him.</p>
<p align="justify">Fourthly, Conversion, or turning to God. We are naturally 
    turned away from God, and therefore are called to return to him, Hosea 14:1. 
    Our hearts are turned away from himself; our feet are turned away from his 
    way. We must turn back again before we can walk with him.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Our hearts must be brought off the world to God; 
    Canticles 4:8, "Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: 
    look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the 
    lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards." The first removing of the 
    heart was from God to the creature, from the fountain to the muddy streams 
    and broken cisterns, Jeremiah 2:13. There men naturally seek their 
    happiness, comfort, and satisfaction. But it must remove again, leave the 
    bulky vanity, the fair deceitful nothing, and return to God. Our hearts must 
    be lifted, our love, joy, delight, etc., off the creature, and set on God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Our hearts must be brought from our lusts to the Lord, 
    from our sins to our Savior; we must say, "That which I see not, teach you 
    me; if I have done iniquity, I will do no more," Job 34:32. That day the 
    soul returns to the Lord, the idols will be cast to the bats and to the 
    moles, Isaiah 2:20. For if God get the throne in the heart, they will get 
    the cross. It was in this case God observed Ephraim, and was well pleased 
    with him; Jeremiah 31:18–20, "I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself 
    thus, You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed 
    to the yoke; turn you me, and I shall be turned, for you are the Lord my 
    God. Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was 
    instructed, I smote upon my thigh; I was ashamed, yes, even confounded, 
    because I did bear the reproach of my youth. Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a 
    pleasant child? for since I spoke against him I do earnestly remember him 
    still, therefore my affections are troubled for him; I will surely have 
    mercy upon him, says the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">3. We must be brought out of ourselves unto God; Matthew 
    16:24, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself." Man turning 
    off from God turned into himself, and made himself his chief end, acting 
    from himself and to himself. So we are naturally hemmed in within the cursed 
    circle of self, out of which we must be turned before we can walk with God. 
    And,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Out of our self-wisdom, put in the room of Christ as 
    a prophet For thus says God to all that would walk with him, "I will 
    instruct you, and teach you in the way which you shall go; I will guide you 
    with mine eye," Psalm 32:8. Whoever would give up themselves to the Lord, 
    must, as it were, put out their own eyes, resolving never more to guide 
    themselves, that they may follow the Lord, as Abraham did, Hebrews 11:8, 
    who, at God's call, went out, not knowing where he went.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Out of our self-righteousness, put in the room of 
    Christ as a priest. We must come up to duties, and then come over them, 
    renouncing all confidence in them, laying no weight on them in the point of 
    oommending us to the favor of God. For what stress is laid on them that way, 
    derogates from the honor of him on whom the Father has laid help, and is 
    inconsistent with the character of the true circumcision, Philippians 3:3. 
    Otherwise we cannot walk with God in duties.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Out of our self-will and self-ability, put in the 
    room of Christ as a king. Man is naturally willful, and will have his own 
    liking, and do what seems good in his own eyes. But in the day that one 
    comes to walk with God, he gives up with his own will, saying, "Your will be 
    done on earth, as it is in Heaven." He gives it to be led as a captive after 
    Christ's chariot wheels, so that he may draw it and drive over it, as seems 
    good in his eyes, 2 Corinthians 10:5.</p>
<p align="justify">Man also naturally goes into himself for strength with 
    which to do commanded duty, being ignorant of Christ as the head of 
    influences for sanctification. But in the day one comes to walk with God, he 
    renounces his own stock as insufficient, and gives up himself to live by 
    Christ, in the way of being daily supplied, John 6:57. For then he sees the 
    truth of that saying, "He that trusts in his own heart is a fool; but 
    whoever walks wisely, he shall be delivered," Proverbs 28:26.</p>
<p align="justify">SECONDLY, I shall consider walking with God in the matter 
    of it, in respect of our frame and conversation. And indeed this duty goes 
    as broad as the whole law. I must take it up in some particulars. If we 
    would have the life of religion in our walk, we must not walk at random.</p>
<p align="justify">First, We must walk with God in the way of habitual 
    eyeing of him in all things. It is the neck-break of many, that God is not 
    in all their thoughts, and the ruin of religion among professors, that they 
    forget God, though he is not far from any of us. The heart is like a common 
    inn, so thronged with strangers, that the master is not noticed, but thrust 
    out to make room for others. It was otherwise with David; Psalm 16:1, "I 
    have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall 
    not be moved."</p>
<p align="justify">1. We must eye him as our witness in all things. Let us 
    say everywhere as Hagar, Genesis 16:13, "You God see me," Let us fix on our 
    hearts awful apprehensions of his omniscience and omnipresence, as Psalm 
    139:7, "Where shall I go from your spirit, or where shall I flee from your 
    presence?" There is a root of Atheism in our hearts that says, "The Lord has 
    forsaken the earth, and the Lord sees not," Ezekiel 9:9. And O how ready are 
    the best to forget, though they are ever under the chalk of his eye, that he 
    is a witness to every thought, word, and action! Thus walking with God 
    implies,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The believing of his all-seeing eye, embracing it 
    with a firm faith, that he is intimately acquainted with all our ways, 
    Hebrews 4:13. His eye is on us where no other eye can see us, yes, where our 
    own eyes cannot reach, that is, into our hearts. And where the true faith of 
    this is, it will not want an impression of proportionable depth with the 
    strength of the faith with which it is apprehended.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) An habitual minding of this all-seeing eye that is 
    on us, Psalm 16:8. Walkers with God are frequently sisting themselves in the 
    presence of this God; and especially when the temptation comes, they look to 
    him that sees them, and say, "Shall I do this great wickedness, and sin 
    against God?"</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) A suitable respect to this all-seeing eye, 
    influencing our hearts, lips, and lives, to beware of sin, and to be 
    diligent and upright in duty. The eyes of a child will restrain people 
    sometimes; how much more should the eye of God that is never off us?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Eye him as our Judge, to whom at length we must give 
    an account, Romans 14:10. Let us remember and often have in our mind, that 
    word which at length will reach our ears, "Rise you dead, and come to 
    judgment." We might walk as we list, if we were never to be called to 
    account. But there is not a thought, word, or action, but what must be 
    judged, Romans 2:16; Ecclesiastes 12. We can never say there is more than a 
    step between us and the judgment-seat, and therefore there is good reason we 
    should walk as prisoners going to the bar.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Let us walk as under the eye of an infinitely holy 
    Judge, who cannot look on sin but with abhorrence, Habakkuk 1:13. He can 
    never be brought by any means to approve of sin, how little soever we think 
    of it. The least spot is offensive to the eyes of his jealousy, and he 
    cannot away with it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Let us walk as under the eye of an accurate Judge, 
    from whom no crime can be hid, whose eyes no pretenses nor fair colors can 
    deceive. Let us remember when we come there, our crimes cannot be hidden for 
    want of evidence; for the omniscient Judge himself is witness to all, and 
    that omniscience will pierce through all the veils with which we now cloak 
    our sins.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Let us walk as under the eye of an impartial Judge. 
    He is one that cannot be biased either by feud or favor. He is no respecter 
    of persons, but rewards every one according to his work. The belief of this 
    would make us impartial in our own cause; and if we were walking with God, 
    we would abandon our own cause without partiality.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Eye him as our Redeemer and Savior; Isaiah 45:22, 
    "Look unto me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, 
    and there is none else." To eye God as our witness and judge, without eyeing 
    him as a God in Christ, atoned by his blood, would fright us away from him, 
    so as we could never walk with him more. But that a guilty creature may walk 
    with God, let him,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Eye the mercy of God in a Mediator; Isaiah 55:7, 
    "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and 
    let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our 
    God, for he will abundantly pardon." That is a large covering under which 
    may be hidden all the guilt of our walk. It reaches deep and extends very 
    far, Psalm 86:13, "Great is your mercy toward me: and you have delivered my 
    soul from the lowest Hell." In our most accurate walking, and when we have 
    done our utmost, there will be need of grace and mercy. And we must 
    believingly apply to it, that when we have fallen, we may rise up again and 
    walk.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Eye the righteousness of a Redeemer. Had the most 
    close walker with God nothing to look to but the righteousness of his own 
    works, he would never have ground of joy all the way through the wilderness. 
    But the naughtiness of his own righteousness makes him look often to the 
    imputed righteousness, and there he joys; Isaiah 45:24, 25, "Surely, shall 
    one say, In the Lord have I righteousness and strength.—In the Lord shall 
    all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Eye the conscience-purging blood, Hebrews 12:22, 24. 
    If you have come up into Christ's chariot of the covenant, the covering of 
    it is a covert of purple, that is ever over your head. When conscience is 
    wounded with guilt, it is like a thorn got into the foot of the traveler, 
    who can walk no more until it be drawn out, Hebrews 9:14.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Eye him as the fountain of strength, Isaiah 45:24, 
    forfeited. This is the way that David resolved to walk with God, Psalm 
    71:16, "I will go in the strength of the Lord God." The way we have to go is 
    difficult, we have little strength, and there is much opposition; we need to 
    keep our eye on him in whom the believer's strength lies, Psalm 84:5. None 
    walk with God but those that draw strength from him, for the whole of their 
    walk. And that lies in two things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Believing the promise of strength and furniture, for 
    whatever piece of the way we are called to go through, Psalm 116:9, 10, "I 
    will walk before the Lord in the land of the living. I believed, therefore 
    have I spoken." The spiritual traveler has many a difficult step in his way 
    to Immanuel's land, but in the covenant there is strength promised to carry 
    him through them all. He must keep his eye on the promise, and firmly 
    believe it, for that is the way to suck the breasts of these consolations.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Using the means on the credit of the promise. God's 
    institutions have promises annexed to them, and they become effectual, being 
    thus believingly used; Hebrews 4:2, compare John 17:17. To pretend to 
    believe without the use of means, is presumption; to use the means without 
    believing the promise, is lifeless formality. Is there a lust to mortify, or 
    a temptation to resist? let us use the means, and believe the promise of 
    sanctification with close application to ourselves.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Eye him as our Master, Lord, head, and husband; Psalm 
    45:11, "He is your Lord, and worship you him." See how the spouse comes out 
    of the wilderness walking with God, even leaning on him as her Head and 
    Husband; Canticles 8:5. We must walk with him, as obedient servants with a 
    master, dutiful subjects with a king, etc. Whoever others serve, let it be 
    our resolution to serve the Lord; Joshua 24:15. And this imports, that we 
    must be ready,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) To receive his orders, and the least indications of 
    his mind to comply with them, signified to us by his word or providence. How 
    closely did the psalmist thus walk with God? Psalm 123:2, "Behold, as the 
    eyes of servants look unto the hands of their masters, and as the eyes of a 
    maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our 
    God, until that he have mercy upon us." And this is the duty of all 
    pretending to be espoused to Christ. So that it must needs be great 
    untenderness, that "God speaks once, yes, twice, yet men regard it not."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) To do his bidding; "Lord, what will you have me to 
    do?" said Paul; Acts 9:6. Our Lord lets us see, that it is not talking of, 
    but thus walking with God, that is religion indeed; Luke 6:46, "Why call you 
    me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?" And it is not the 
    hearers, but the doers of the word that shall be justified. There is no 
    walking with God, if we walk not in the road of obedience to his commands. 
    If we take our own way, we walk not with him, but Satan.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) To be careful to please him in all things; 1 
    Corinthians 7:34, to give content to the heart of Christ in whatever we do; 
    Colossians 1:10, not only to do the thing he commands, but to do it to his 
    mind, so as he may take pleasure in us, and delight to do us good. For thus 
    the duty of Christ's spouse in walking with God is summed up; Psalm 45:10, 
    "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your 
    own people, and your father's house."</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly. Eye him as our chief end. As he who walks with 
    God sets off in his way in him and by him, so he walks to him as the great 
    end of his walk; Psalm 16:8, "I have set the Lord always before me." Romans 
    11., "For of him, and through him, and to him are all things; to whom be 
    glory forever. Amen." This implies two things,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Aiming at his glory in all things; 1 Corinthians 
    10:31. We must make that the great scope of all our actions, and of our 
    whole life. He who walks with God displaces self, which is the dead sea into 
    which all our actions naturally run, and sets up the honor of God instead 
    thereof; reckoning his life no more useful in the world than it tends to the 
    honor of God. For we are as trees in a vineyard, of no use, but as they 
    bring forth fruit to their master's use; Luke 13:7.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Seeking to enjoy him as our chief happiness; Psalm 
    73:25. Man can never be self-sufficient, (no not angels); that is the 
    peculiar prerogative of God, whose perfections are infinite. So he must 
    needs seek his happiness without himself. While he is without God in a 
    natural state, he seeks it in the creatures; when he comes to God, he takes 
    God for it. And walking with God, he habitually seeks it in the enjoyment of 
    him, and feeds at that table he sits down to in conversion. And so if you 
    would walk with God,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) You must seek to enjoy him in all things, in the 
    measure he is to be enjoyed here; Psalm 27:4; seek to enjoy him in 
    ordinances; Psalm 63:1, 2, public, private, and secret. You must not stay in 
    the shell, nor in the outer court; but seek to believe, taste, and feel; 
    Psalm 34:8. You must seek him in providences; Psalm 94:4, merciful and 
    favorable, smiling and frowning. He will be the sap of mercies to the walker 
    with God; Genesis 33:10, and they will see his name in cross dispensations; 
    Micah 6:9.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) You must seek to enjoy him in Heaven hereafter. If 
    you walk through the world with God, you will walk as pilgrims bound for 
    another and better country, keeping that in your view as your only rest; 
    Hebrews 11:13, 16. He who walks with God, walks as one living that he may 
    die well, making it the business of this life that he may learn to die, and 
    to get beyond it to a better life.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, We must walk with God in the way of the heart's 
    going along with him in all things, as the shadow goes with the body. Hence 
    it is called "walking after the Lord;" Hosea 11:10, "following the Lord;" 
    Numbers 14:24. Walking with God is no bodily motion, but a spiritual motion, 
    a moving of the heart and affections; and so it must import necessarily the 
    heart's going along with him. I will take it up in these three things. If 
    you would walk with God, your hearts must go along with him,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In the way of believing in all things. Thus Enoch 
    walked with God; Hebrews 11:5. God is a Spirit, and our souls are spirits. 
    The way of communion between God and us is in the way of believing, for we 
    cannot know him to our salvation, but as he has revealed himself to us in 
    his word. So God manifesting himself by his word, we cannot walk with him, 
    but as our hearts go along with these manifestations of himself, in the way 
    of believing; hence is that account the apostle gives us of his walk; 
    Galatians 2:20, "The life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith 
    of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." So walking with 
    God imports,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Believing his commands. Faith discerns the stamp of 
    divine authority on the commands, and so gives them a suitable weight on 
    one's own spirit. It esteems and judges them all right and reasonable; Psalm 
    119:128. So they are believed to be not only from God, but suited to the 
    divine perfections, and to man's real welfare. Which cannot miss to 
    influence the person to obedience.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Believing his promises, the promises of the gospel; 
    Hebrews 11:13. He who walks with God, does not only believe the great 
    leading promises of the covenant, of God himself being their God, and of 
    eternal salvation, but the lesser promises depending on these. And while 
    others take other things for their heritage, they take the promises for 
    theirs; Psalm 119:111. So the great thing that sways them in their course of 
    life, is the prospect of unseen things;</p>
<p align="justify">(2 Corinthians 4:18,) to be had in another world, and 
    likewise the prospect of what is promised even in this life.</p>
<p align="justify">So the promises are apt to influence obedience; and when 
    they do, that is walking with God; when one ventures on, and follows the way 
    of duty on the credit of the promise; e.g. giving out of their substance at 
    God's call, upon the faith of the promise; Proverbs 3:9, 10, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Believing his threatenings; Hebrews 11:7. We find 
    holy men have thus walked with God, being influenced to a tender holy walk 
    by the faith of God's threatenings in his word; Job 32. David was not of a 
    servile legal spirit, when he says, Psalm 119:120, "My flesh trembles for 
    fear of you, and I am afraid of your judgments." Hence they that walk with 
    God, will not venture on an ill thing, more than they would take fire into 
    their bosom, because the terror of God makes them afraid of sin.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In the way of compliance with his holy will. If we do 
    not thus in all things, we walk contrary to him. When man fell off from God, 
    his own will became his law, and was set in opposition to the will of God. 
    When he returns to God, his will is inclined by grace to God's will; and 
    walking with God it goes along therewith, complying with it in all things. 
    So walking with God imports,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Complying with the will of his command in all 
    things; Acts 9:6. The heart of the believer is reconciled to, and approves 
    of the law as holy, just, and good; and while he walks with God, he labors 
    sincerely to suit his walk thereunto in all things, being grieved at any 
    reluctancy that is in the heart against any piece of obedience, crying with 
    David, Psalm 119:5, "O that my ways were directed to keep your statutes!"</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Complying with the will of his providence, the heart 
    being reconciled to that lot which God is pleased to carve out; Psalm 47:4. 
    O what walking contrary to God is there in this respect, while the proud 
    unhumbled heart will not, cannot accommodate itself to divine dispensations! 
    but murmurs, frets, and repines, and rebels against the Lord, as the 
    sovereign Governor of the world.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In the way of habitual moving of the heart towards 
    him. Grace has an attractive virtue in the heart drawing it towards God. And 
    when it is in exercise, it will make the heart to be moving towards him, 
    whereas otherwise it settles on other things besides him. So in walking with 
    God there is,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Frequent thinking and meditating on him, Malachi 
    3:16. That is a black character of the wicked; Psalm 10:4, "God is not in 
    all his thoughts." And the saint is in a backslidden condition that begins 
    to forget him; Jeremiah 2:32. Yes, fleeting thoughts are not sufficient; if 
    we walk with God, he will be the subject of our meditation, both occasional 
    and stated; Psalm 63:6. If we walk with a man, he is ever in our view, and 
    so we cannot miss to think on him.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Habitual moving of the heart towards him, in love, 
    desire, trust, etc. He is the chief good and the best of beings, which 
    should ever command our love, Deuteronomy 6:5. That is the holy fire that is 
    kept glowing and flaming in the heart of one that walks with God, loving him 
    for himself, and for his goodness to us. Desires after him are the 
    breathings of a soul touched with the love of God, tending to perfect 
    enjoyment. And the continual wants and weakness that such a one finds 
    himself compassed with, turn him very naturally to trust and dependence on 
    him.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Frequent use of ejaculatory prayer, 1 Thessalonians 
    5:17. This is that kind of prayer to which we have access at all times, the 
    darting up of a desire to the Lord, whatever be the lawful business we are 
    about, or whatever be our case. And hardly can people be thought to walk 
    with God, that are not frequently sending these swift, though silent, 
    messengers to Heaven. We find Jacob, in the midst of his testament, using 
    such a devout ejaculation; Genesis 49:18, "I have waited for your salvation, 
    O Lord." See Moses' practice, Exodus 14:15, and Nehemiah's, before he 
    answered a king, Nehemiah 2:4.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, We must walk with God in ordinances, Luke 1:6, 
    submitting to, and seeking communion with God in all ordinances as we have 
    access. The ordinances are the banqueting-house of Christ wherein he feasts 
    his people, Canticles 2:4, the galleries wherein the king is held by those 
    that walk with him there, Canticles 7:5. Particularly the communion with God 
    is to be sought and kept up,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In secret prayer, Matthew 6:6. We must walk with God 
    in a due and ordinary observance of that kind of prayer. It is a duty 
    wherein the people of God have had as much communion with God as in any 
    other; witness Jacob's experience, Genesis 32:24, and Daniel's, chapter 
    9:22. The Lord promises his people a particular familiarity with him in that 
    duty; Canticles 7:11, "Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let 
    us lodge in the villages." And however some may be happy to get it shifted, 
    yet the truly-exercised would find it hard, nay, they could not at all live 
    without it. And how people can walk with God, taking it only now and then, 
    and not making conscience of ordinary observing of it, I see not. And indeed 
    people will readily know by their disposition in secret prayer, whether they 
    be in a thriving case or not.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In family prayer, Acts 10:2, 3. Never one that gives 
    Christ heart-room, but they will be willing to give him house-room too. And 
    there are none that walk with God themselves, but they would gladly all 
    their family walked with God too, Joshua 24:15. And there are none who have 
    gone about it seriously, but must say, that family worship is an ordinance 
    in which God is to be found. Prayer-less families are in a dangerous 
    condition; they are as if the owners should uncover the roofs of them, that 
    wrath may be showered down on them; Jeremiah 10., "Pour out your fury upon 
    the heathen that know you not, and upon the families that call not on your 
    name." And I think if people were walking with God in family-duties, they 
    would not lay by the morning-exercise, as many of you do. And what is it 
    that hinders it? What but the weary world? You cannot get time for it, 
    because of your business. But are you not afraid of God's curse on that 
    business that shuts out his worship? And if it should thrive, you take the 
    way to get leanness to your souls. It looks not like walking with God to 
    stand off from family worship, until they have no other thing ado, and it is 
    a graceless-like thing to offer only that time to God that costs you 
    nothing.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In reading of the word, John 5:39. We find the 
    truly-godly have been great lovers of the Bible. O how does David commend 
    it, especially in the 119th psalm, though it was but a small part of it that 
    was written in his time. One that would walk with God, should even walk 
    through the Bible, reading it, and acquainting themselves with the mind of 
    God in it. And you will see, that whenever persons come to be in earnest 
    exercised about their case, they will very naturally go to their Bibles in 
    quite another manner than they used to do.</p>
<p align="justify">4. In extraordinary prayer, setting time apart for it, 
    either in secret, or in families; of which I have spoken before.</p>
<p align="justify">5. In hearing the word. Whenever the Lord puts an 
    occasion of hearing the word in your hand, he says in effect, Come walk with 
    me in the galleries; and "with joy shall you draw water out of the wells of 
    salvation," Isaiah 12:3. And every believing soul will reply with David, 
    Psalm 65:4, "Blessed is the man whom you chose, and causes to approach unto 
    you, that he may dwell in your courts: we shall be satisfied with the 
    goodness of your house, even of your holy temple." The Sabbath-day is a day 
    of blessing, the preaching of the gospel is the great means for the 
    salvation of sinners, 1 Corinthians 1:21. Is it not then a slighting of 
    communion with God, for people to idle away so many Sabbaths at home, in 
    making so little conscience of attending on public ordinances? Read through 
    the whole Bible, and you will not find a gracious person but was much 
    addicted to the place where his honor dwells, to public ordinances. And I 
    assure you, the godly in some places would wonder if they could have any 
    good in them at all, that can contentedly sit at home, when they are neither 
    sick nor sore, nor have any providential necessity put upon them. It is very 
    observable, Numbers 9:10–13, "that if any man of Israel, or of their 
    posterity should be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey 
    afar off, yet he should keep the Passover unto the Lord—but the man that was 
    clean, and was not in a journey, and forbore to keep the Passover; even the 
    same soul should be cut off from his people, because he brought not the 
    offering of the Lord in his appointed season." Whence observe, that as those 
    who against their wills are forced to be absent from God's ordinances, may 
    expect the favors of his grace under their affliction; so those who of 
    choice absent themselves, may expect the tokens of his wrath for their sin.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly. In the sacrament of the Lord's supper. That is 
    an ordinance especially appointed for communion with God; 1 Corinthians 
    10:16. And it has been so in the experience of many souls. Wherefore it must 
    be strange how those can walk with God, that never set their foot on that 
    holy ground, though they have one opportunity after another.</p>
<p align="justify">And if you would walk with God in these duties,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) You must make conscience of preparation, even 
    prepare for secret prayer, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Seek and press forward for communion with God in 
    these ordinances, and take not up with the external work.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Do not take them by starts, but keep an ordinary, as 
    you have occasion, otherwise you cannot be said to walk with God in them.</p>
<p align="justify">FOURTHLY. We must walk with God in providences. These are 
    his ways wherein he walks towards us, and we must walk with him in them; 
    Hosea 14., "Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and 
    he shall know them? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall 
    walk in them." Sometimes he goes with us in the way of smiling, sometimes of 
    cross providences; but whether he take the high road of lifting up, or the 
    low one of downcasting, we are to follow, and walk with him. This lies in 
    these seven things,</p>
<p align="justify">1. We must notice his hand in all that we meet with from 
    any hand whatever. God guides the world by wisdom, and without him second 
    causes cannot move; Ezekiel 1:20. Whether you meet with a mercy or a cross, 
    say in your heart, This is the finger of God; Genesis 33:10. The not 
    noticing of this is a spice of atheism, that God is highly displeased with; 
    Psalm 28:5, "Because they regard not the works of the Lord, nor the 
    operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up." See 
    how the Pagan Chaldeans do with smiling providences; Habakkuk 1:16, "They 
    sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them 
    their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous." And see what the 
    Philistines say of their afflictions, "It is a chance." But he who walks 
    with God, takes all out of the Lord's hand.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We must accommodate ourselves to the aspect of 
    providence, whether it be shining or louring; Ecclesiastes 7:14. For without 
    this we show a contempt of providence, which the Lord takes heinously, as 
    you may see by looking to Isaiah 22:12–14. We must rejoice in his mercies, 
    and walk soberly and concernedly under the strokes of his hand.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We must labor to find out the design of providence. 
    Providence has a voice, and it is a voice of speech which may be understood; 
    Ezekiel 1:24. The works of providence are a book which the walker with God 
    labors to read the mind of God in. Merciful dispensations are preachers of 
    repentance, and happy are they that hear their voice; Romans 2:4. Cross 
    dispensations have a language to the same purpose; Micah 6:9, "The Lord's 
    voice cries unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see your name; hear 
    you the rod, and who has appointed it."</p>
<p align="justify">To help you to know the particular design of providence 
    in cross dispensations that you meet with.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Pray in faith for it, believing that God will 
    discover it to you in the use of means, in his own time; Job 10:2, "Show me 
    wherefore you contend with me." Compare Matthew 21:22, "All things whatever 
    you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive." But take good heed 
    that your souls be truly and honestly laid open to divine instruction, that 
    you be disposed to know it at any rate, though it should touch you in a most 
    sensible part; Psalm 25:9, "The meek will he guide in judgment; and the meek 
    will he teach his way."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Search for it, as the Israelites did for the 
    accursed thing; Psalm 77:6. Think upon it, in order to find it out. Take a 
    view of your way, what it was before and at the time when you met with the 
    cross; even as when men have lost anything, they go back until they come to 
    the place where they are sure they had it.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Take help of the word in this matter. Consider 
    scripture-threatenings, or examples, that may be apposite to your case. All 
    that you or I meet with is but a fulfilling of the scripture; Hosea 7:12. 
    And as providence gives light to the word, so the word gives light to 
    providence. And thus Moses opened up the meaning of a dark providence to 
    Aaron from the word; Leviticus 10:3, "This is it that the Lord spoke, 
    saying, I will be sanctified in them that come near me, and before all the 
    people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace."</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Listen to the whispers of conscience under the rod. 
    The sin that under the rod conscience casts most in your teeth, is very 
    likely to be the sin that God is aiming at, as in the case of Joseph's 
    brethren; Genesis 42:21, who "said one to another, We are truly guilty 
    concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he 
    besought us; and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon 
    us." Even as the man that has a sore finger, whatever touches his hand, the 
    finger smarts; an evidence that there his sore lies.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Consider what sin it is that you have had most 
    reproofs for from the word, most checks for by some lesser steps of 
    providence, most challenges for from conscience, and yet you have not 
    reformed. That is likely to be it. For God's rods follow his rebukes, as 
    Absalom did with Joab: Jeremiah 22:21, 22, "I spoke unto you in your 
    prosperity, but you said, I will not hear; this has been your manner from 
    your youth, that you obey not my voice. The wind shall eat up all your 
    pastures, and your lovers shall go into captivity, surely then shall you be 
    ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness."</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly. Consider the nature of the stroke or cross, 
    for very readily there is a discernable affinity between sin and the stroke. 
    Sometimes God punishes men in the same kind with their sin, as in the case 
    of Adonibezek; Judg. 1:7. Sometimes in the occasion of their sins, as Eli's 
    indulgence to his children was punished by the death of them. Sometimes 
    their punishment is in what is most contrary to their sin, as David's sin in 
    numbering of the people. Sometimes God measures to us in temporals, as we do 
    to him in spirituals; Hosea 4:12, 13; 1 Corinthians 11:30, and several other 
    ways.</p>
<p align="justify">One that walks with God will have so much ado with these 
    things, that they should very carefully observe them, for daily practice of 
    taking up God's mind in what they meet with.</p>
<p align="justify">4. We must endeavor to comply with the designs of 
    providence; Job 36:10, 11. Providences in favorable dispensations are God's 
    cords of love and bands of a man, whereby he draws sinners to himself. In 
    afflicting dispensations they are God's furnace for melting of souls, that 
    they may take on suitable impressions. And O but it is sad when the effect 
    of all is that; Hosea 11:2, "As they called them, so they went from them." 
    Jeremiah 6:29, 30, "The bellows are burnt, the lead is consumed of the fire, 
    the founder melts in vain; for the wicked are not plucked away. Reprobate 
    silver shall men call them, because the Lord has rejected them." That is a 
    grievous complaint; Jeremiah 5:3, "You have stricken them, but they have not 
    grieved; you have consumed them, but they have refused to receive 
    correction; they have made their faces harder than a rock, they have refused 
    to return." But he who walks with God makes it his business to comply with 
    the dispensations of providence in the design of them, to serve the Lord 
    more cheerfully that God is kind to him, and to bring forth the peaceable 
    fruits of righteousness under afflictions.</p>
<p align="justify">5. We must notice the harmony of providences with the 
    word; Psalm 48:8, "As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord 
    of hosts." This is the way to get communion with God in providences. And a 
    sweet feast they often afford to those that are thus exercised to discern 
    them; hence, says David; Psalm 92:4, "You, Lord, have made me glad through 
    your work. I will triumph in the works of your hands?" and said Jacob to his 
    brother Esau; Genesis 33:10, "Therefore have I seen your face, as though I 
    had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me." The word is the 
    scheme and draught of the government of the world; and the lines of 
    providence are all drawn accordingly. So that whatever you meet with, it is 
    an accomplishment of scripture-promises, threatenings and doctrines. And a 
    child of God in applying them thus to the rule, may have sweet communion 
    with God.</p>
<p align="justify">6. We must follow the conduct of providence in 
    subserviency to the word, keeping our eye on the promise; Psalm 32:8, "I 
    will instruct you, and teach you in the way which you shall go; I will guide 
    you with mine eye." To separate providence from the word, and then make it a 
    rule, is dangerous; Jonah 1:3. But to follow the conduct of it with an eye 
    to the word, is a notable part of the Christian's walking with God. 
    Providence is the hand of the Lord whereby be opens the way in the 
    wilderness to his people, that they may follow him. And go where they will, 
    as long as they can thus keep their eye on their guide, they may judge 
    themselves in the safest way.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly. We must live in the exercise of the graces 
    suitable to the dispensations of providence with which we are tried; 
    Ecclesiastes 7:14. Some dispensations are sweet and comfortable; let us by 
    them be stirred up to love the Lord the more; Psalm 116:1. Let any comfort 
    that we find in the creature be used to enlarge our hearts in thankfulness 
    to, desire of, and cheerfulness in serving the Lord. Some are heavy, and 
    require patience; some dark and doubtful, and require faith. Some take away 
    our created supports, and dry up our cisterns, and put out our candle; and 
    such require trust in the Lord, and to rejoice in him; Habakkuk 3:17, 18. 
    Thus he who walks with God, follows him wherever he goes.</p>
<p align="justify">FIFTHLY, We must walk with God in the stations and 
    relations wherein he has placed us. These are the sphere that God has given 
    us to move in, in the world. And whoever walks not with God in them, will 
    never please him. There are two pieces of work which a Christian has to do.</p>
<p align="justify">1. One for himself, and that is his salvation-work; 
    Philippians 2:12. That is, to secure his eternal welfare in the enjoyment of 
    God, so to make sure his gracious state, to maintain a gracious frame and 
    disposition, by getting incident controversies between God and his soul done 
    away, grace actuated, strengthened, and nourished, until he come to the 
    stature of a perfect man in Christ. This lies in his personal walk.</p>
<p align="justify">2. One for God, and that is his generation-work; Acts 
    13:36. This lies in his relative walk. Whence we may conclude, that so far 
    as a man or woman is defective in their relative duties, so far they are 
    useless for God, and take up room in the world for no purpose. And so far as 
    they do ill instead of good in their relations, they walk contrary to God. 
    We see how the Lord in the works of nature has joined together the 
    creatures, the sun to shine by day, and the moon by night, the beasts to 
    serve man, and the earth with the products thereof to serve both. The beauty 
    of the world lies in every one's keeping their place, and being serviceable 
    in the place wherein God has set them. And so relations are the joints of 
    society; and they that would walk with God, must walk with him in them.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) We must labor faithfully to discharge the duties of 
    our stations and relations, as under the eye of God, who is our common 
    Overseer, Witness, and Judge; Psalm 101:2. God has shaped out our work to 
    us, whether in the church, commonwealth, or family, wherein some are as 
    eyes, some as hands, and some as feet. Though the work of others may be 
    higher and more honorable than ours, our greatest honor will be to approve 
    ourselves to God in our own part. God observes how every one does his duty, 
    the husband, the wife, the master, the servant. And they that walk with God, 
    will behave themselves in these things as under the eye of God, as well as 
    when they are at prayers; etc. Colossians 3:22.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) We must do the duties of our relations under a sense 
    of the command of God. It is not enough that the husband love his wife, or 
    the wife submit herself to her husband, etc., if conscience of duty towards 
    God do not sway them thereto; Ephesians 5:21. We must make God our great 
    party in all these things, otherwise we do not walk with God in them. There 
    is no relation one stands in, but God has set them their duty; and so the 
    performance of these duties is as much the trial of our obedience, as the 
    most religions actions we are capable of.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) We must do the duties of our relations with an eye 
    to the real good of our relatives. "You shall love your neighbor as 
    yourself," is the sum of the second table. No man is born for himself but to 
    be serviceable to God and his fellow-creatures; Romans 15:2. And the more 
    useful we are to others, the more we serve God, and the more we are like 
    him; for he does good unto all, even unto the unholy and unthankful.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Lastly. We must do the duties of our relations with 
    an eye to the honor of God; 1 Corinthians 10:31. O the dishonor that is done 
    to God by the little conscience that is made of relative duties, by crying 
    relative sins. Should the fabric of the world run into confusion, sun, moon, 
    stars, day and night, go out of their courses, where were the honor of God 
    arising from the beauty of an orderly management of the world? But ah! how 
    often are the foundations in churches, states, and families out of course, 
    and there nothing but disorder and confusion, contention and opposition, 
    every one going out of their course; and so the honor of God, and their own 
    good and comfort lying buried in the ruinous heap? This is walking contrary 
    to God.</p>
<p align="justify">This walking with God is particularly noticed concerning 
    Enoch; Genesis 5:22, "And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah 
    three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters." He walked with God in 
    his family, as a father and a husband, in the married state. So if you be a 
    walker with God, it will appear in the relations wherein you stand; for 
    grace makes a good husband, a good wife, a good master, a good servant, etc. 
    And the duties of relations will readily try both the reality and strength 
    of grace.</p>
<p align="justify">SIXTHLY, We must walk with God in all our actions, 
    whether natural, civil, or religious; 1 Corinthians 10:31, "Whether 
    therefore you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God." 
    Religion is to our conversation like salt to meat, necessary to season our 
    whole life, whatever it is that we are about.</p>
<p align="justify">First, We must walk with God in our natural actions, such 
    as eating, drinking, sleeping, etc. These are common to us with the beasts; 
    but we must not be like the beasts in the use of them, but walk with God 
    therein. Now, if we would walk with God in these things,</p>
<p align="justify">1. We must do them under a sense of the command of God. 
    Eating and drinking, etc., are duties of the sixth command; and therefore we 
    ought to do them because God has said, "You shall not kill." Wherever there 
    is a divine ordinance respecting any natural action, we ought therein to 
    have respect to that ordinance; 1 Timothy 4:4, 5, "For every creature of God 
    is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving; for 
    it is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer." Our bodies are the Lord's, 
    and he binds us by all lawful means to preserve them; and then do men walk 
    with God in these things, while they patch up the mud-wall house under the 
    sense of the command of the owner.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We must depend on the Lord for benefit by them; 1 
    Timothy 4:5. Without the blessing on the means, the end cannot be obtained. 
    Without God our meat cannot nourish us, nor our clothes warm us; so that the 
    emptiness of the creature points us to God at every turn, agreeable to what 
    our Lord says; Matthew 4:4, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every 
    word that proceeds out of the mouth of God." It is no less than spiritual 
    idolatry to overlook the Lord, and look for the benefit from the creature 
    itself; Jeremiah 17:5; Hosea 4:10. If he would say the word, we might eat 
    and not be filled, sleep and not be refreshed. So that even in these we are 
    called to walk by faith with God, looking for the benefit of God's ordinance 
    and appointment about these things.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We must use them for God and his service; as the 
    traveler takes his staff in his hand, not to be a burden or a carriage to 
    him, but to help him on his journey. While the soul is in the body, it has a 
    mighty dependence thereon; and so it is as the horse that must be cared for, 
    to the end we may accomplish the journey; 2 Kings 3:15. So walking with God 
    in these things, would make us use them so, as may most fit us for the work 
    of our Christian calling, haring that as our great scope before our eye.</p>
<p align="justify">4. We must keep a holy Christian moderation in these 
    things; Philippians 4:5. We must be like Gideon's lappers, even when waters 
    of a full cup are set before us. People may easily fall into a sinful 
    eagerness in these things; Genesis 25:30, and sink their hearts into these 
    things, wherein they should only lightly go along with wariness; Luke 21:31, 
    regulating ourselves in the use of them, by what is best to fit us for our 
    salvation and generation-work, which is the true rule of moderation. For the 
    heart must not sit down on them as its end and rest; but pass through them 
    as a means and way; 1 Corinthians 7:29–31.</p>
<p align="justify">5. We must ascend by the creature unto the Creator, from 
    creature-sweetness to that infinite fullness that is in God; Zechariah 9., 
    "How great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the 
    young men cheerful, and new wine the maids." Seeing all perfection in the 
    creature is originally from God, it must be in him, and that infinitely. If 
    there be anything desirable in the streams, it must be more so in the 
    fountain. If the light of the sun be so pleasant to the eyes, be who is 
    light itself must be infinitely more so. Whatever pleasure or delight we 
    find in meat, drink, etc. it points us to God, from whom that sweetness is 
    derived, as drops from the ocean.</p>
<p align="justify">6. We must look on them as covenant mercies, and the 
    fulfillment of promises; Deuteronomy 26:3, etc. God has secured our 
    necessary comforts by promise; Isaiah 33:16. "Bread shall be given him, his 
    waters shall be sure." Psalm 127:2, and 84:11. So when we receive them, we 
    should look on them as such; and then however coarse the meat be, being 
    served up in the dish, not of common providence, but of the covenant, it 
    will have an uncommon sweetness, and we will have communion with God in that 
    which others find no more in than beasts do.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly. We must be thankful for all our mercies, unto 
    God as the giver; 1 Thessalonians 5:18. We must pay to him verbal 
    Acknowledgments; Hosea 14:2; Deuteronomy 8:10, and real Acknowledgments, 
    serving him in the strength of our mercies, and that cheerfully, as he deals 
    graciously with us in these things. What we have from him must be used for 
    him; Romans 11; and the more liberally he deals with us, the more cheerfully 
    ought we to serve him; Deuteronomy 28:47, 48.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly. We must walk with God in our civil actions, 
    such as are competent to men in society, as trading, buying, selling, 
    working, and in a word, managing our worldly business: that as we may not 
    act like beasts in the former, so we may not act as men that know not God in 
    the latter. Now, if we would walk with God in managing of our temporal 
    affairs,</p>
<p align="justify">1. We must act in these matters as under a sense of a 
    command or appointment of God in them. God has given each his calling, 
    station, and work; and we are to act therein suitably in obedience to him; 1 
    Corinthians 7:24, doing our proper business as to the Lord, who is our great 
    Master; Ephesians 6:7. Thus a man should go about his worldly business, 
    whether for his own or another's advantage because God has said, "You shall 
    not steal;" looking on it as a piece of his duty to God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We must depend on him by faith, for direction in our 
    business; Proverbs 3:6. We must pray for it, and trust God for it. Temporal 
    affairs are not excepted; Philippians 4:6, "In everything by prayer and 
    supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God." 
    Whence is a dexterity and skill to manage a temporal business, to do a piece 
    of work to purpose without or within doors? Is it not from the Lord? James 
    1:17, "Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above." Isaiah 28:26, 
    "For his God does instruct him to discretion, and does teach him." Common 
    influences of the Spirit are as necessary to the exercise of a gift, as 
    saving influences are to the exercise of grace. Remember the error the 
    princes of Israel fell into; Joshua 9:14, "The men took of their victuals, 
    and asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord;" and Lot's unhappy choice, 
    wherein he did not own God; Genesis 13:11, 12.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We must depend on the Lord by faith, for the success 
    of our lawful endeavors; Psalm 127:1. Whatever men undertake with an eye to 
    God in it, they may depend on him for the success of it; Psalm 1:3. An 
    unsanctified confidence of success God often blasts, that he may let all men 
    see in everything, that "by strength no man shall prevail;" 1 Samuel 2:9, 
    and that "the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong;" 
    Ecclesiastes 9:11. And while people torment themselves with anxiety as to 
    events, he brings their fears often on them, and lets them see, that by 
    taking thought no man can add a cubit to his stature.</p>
<p align="justify">4. We must cut and carve in them as may be most for the 
    honor of God and our soul's welfare. This is the great mark that we would 
    always keep in view, and according to which we must steer our course. Our 
    eternal interest is our greatest, and all other interests must veil to it. 
    The honor of God is the sheaf to which all others must bow; and the balance 
    is to be cast on that side always on which these are; Matthew 26:26, "For 
    what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own 
    soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" Where is the gain 
    where the foot is lost to save the shoe? The world, with whom gain is 
    godliness, and a penny more or less determines them in their affairs, would 
    have thought Moses a foolish man for missing a good bargain; Hebrews 11:24. 
    But he acted even as wisely, as a man who cares not for gaining that pound, 
    in gaining which he must lose a talent. Therefore consider in your worldly 
    affairs, what will be best for your souls.</p>
<p align="justify">5. We must deal with men as under the eye of God, a holy 
    jealous God, whether we be masters, servants, neighbors, etc. Ephesians 
    5:15. Be strict and precise observers of common justice, according to the 
    golden rule, "Whatever you would that men should do unto you, do you even so 
    unto them." Whatever occasions you have to do an unjust thing, let the eye 
    of God be a sufficient restraint; Job 31:21–23. Let men pretend to what 
    strictness they will otherwise, while they are not strict in their morals 
    this way, they do more ill to religion, than perhaps they will ever be 
    capable to do good.</p>
<p align="justify">6. We must observe Christian moderation in these things; 
    1 Corinthians 7:29, 30. Do not give yourselves wholly to them, to relish 
    nothing but what savors of them, as those of Solomon did; Luke 17:28. Let 
    them not steal away your heart, and jostle out religion, like those 
    mentioned, Luke 14:16, etc., but remember still you have greater business in 
    hand than that; and therefore dip no farther into them, than you may do with 
    safety to your soul's case.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly. We must be suitably affected with the 
    providence of God in these things; ascribing the success of our affairs to 
    the Lord, and giving him thanks for blessing the work of our hands; 
    acknowledging disappointments and crosses in them to come from the same 
    hand; taking them kindly as trials with which the Lord sees meet to exercise 
    us, and laboring to know and comply with the design of them.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, We must walk with God in our religious actions, 
    and so distinguish ourselves from hypocrites, who do the things, pray, hear, 
    etc., but do not walk with God in them. Now, if we would walk with God in 
    religious duties,</p>
<p align="justify">1. We must do our duty out of respect to the command of 
    God; Psalm 119:4. We must say in this case, as Simon did in another; Luke 
    5:5, "At your word I will let down the net." When people are led to duties 
    from a custom, or some such low principles or motives, they do not walk with 
    God in them. He who walks with God in them, discerns the stamp of divine 
    authority on every duty, and that awes his heart into a compliance 
    therewith.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We must seek the honor of God in all we do; John 8:50. 
    And indeed if we be let into a view of his glory in duties, the advancing of 
    it will be our great aim. If you be in duty with others, let God himself be 
    your scope, and take heed of parting the glory between him and yourself. If 
    you be alone, seek to give him the glory of all his perfections, by 
    acknowledging of, and carrying as under the impression of, the same.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We must go about our duty in his own strength; 
    Zechariah 10; Psalm 71:16, renouncing all confidence in ourselves; 2 
    Corinthians 3:5. No gifts are to be trusted to in this, for they may soon be 
    blasted, and no bare gift can make one act graciously. Nay, habitual grace 
    is not to be trusted to for that end; for the fire not blown cannot give us 
    light. Actual grace needs still to be preserved and fed, else it will fail. 
    Therefore we must lean on the Lord himself for it; Isaiah 45:24. And we must 
    stretch out the withered hand in duty, in hopes of influences from him, and 
    set to sea in confidence of the blowings of the Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">4. We must be spiritual in our duties; John 4:24; 
    Philippians 3:3. One that walks with God will not take up with bodily 
    exercise, or lip-labor; but endeavor after inward worship, which is the work 
    of the heart. This lies in loving, fearing, trusting, desiring, humbling of 
    the heart before him; believing his word, etc. And so he will reckon no more 
    to be done in worship of God, than what is done with the heart.</p>
<p align="justify">5. We must seek to enjoy God in duties, and not be 
    satisfied without it; Psalm 27:4. When you come to the galleries, let your 
    aim be to see the King in his glory. And let not the empty chair of state 
    satisfy your soul; for nothing is sufficient for the soul, but the enjoyment 
    of God himself; Psalm 73:25. And if this be your aim, you will pursue it, 
    and thurst forward until you come even to his seat.</p>
<p align="justify">6. We must carry in duties as under the eye of God, in a 
    special manner; Psalm 89:7, "God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of 
    the saints; and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him." That 
    looseness of heart, whereby it wanders here and there at duty, proceeds from 
    the want of a due fear of God upon the soul; and is most contrary to walking 
    with God; Jeremiah 12:2, "You are near in their mouth, and far from their 
    reins." The fixing of the heart under the impressions of his awful presence, 
    that so the soul may carry suitably before him, is to sanctify the Lord in 
    our heart; Leviticus 10:3.</p>
<p align="justify">7. We must be frequent in duties; 1 Thessalonians 5:17. 
    They that walk with God are frequent in solemn duties; but in the interval 
    of these they will be taken up with others of a less solemn nature, such as 
    thinking, meditation on God, ejaculations, etc. And thus they will be 
    readily kept in tune for the return of the more solemn duties. And indeed 
    people then cease to walk with God, when they begin to be more remiss and 
    infrequent in solemn duties, and to be less careful of the frame of their 
    hearts in the interval.</p>
<p align="justify">8. We must let new occurrences send us to our duty. This 
    has been the practice of walkers with God, that whatever they have met with 
    remarkable, it sent them to God? and "therefore," says the prophet, "I will 
    look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will 
    hear me;" Micah 7:7. And where can a gracious heart have such a vent, as 
    before the Lord, whatever it be full of, whether joy or grief?</p>
<p align="justify">9. Lastly. We must observe the fruit of our duties; Psalm 
    5:3, carefully notice what speed we come in our applications to the throne; 
    and what effect God's speaking upon his throne has upon us. This is 
    communion with God, to be sending word to, and receiving word from Heaven; 
    to be importing something thither in duties and the exercise of grace, and 
    to be exporting something thence for the spiritual enriching of the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">THIRDLY, I shall consider walking with God in the 
    properties thereof. Walking with God is religion; and it is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Practical religion, religion in deed, not in word 
    only; and there is no other sort of religion that will bring us to Heaven; 
    hence says our Lord; John 13:17, "If you know these things, happy are you if 
    you do them." Talk as we will, if we do not walk with God, we are naught. 
    Jacob dissembling with his father was the lively emblem of a hypocrite, the 
    voice Jacob's, the hands Esau's. There is a great difference between saying 
    and doing in religion. The former is easy, the latter is difficult.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) One may talk well of God and the things of God, and 
    yet have nothing of the truth of religion. He may have a clear head in 
    matters of religion, that has a dark heart; he may have a ready tongue to 
    speak of them, whose feet are shackled with divers lusts, that he cannot 
    walk in the way he speaks of; 1 Corinthians 13:2. How many are ready in the 
    history of the Bible, that are strangers to the mystery of practical 
    godliness? It is said of Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, that people were chained 
    to her rather by the ear than by the eyes. So many, if you hear them speak, 
    they are something; but if you look to their life, they are naught.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) One may talk well for God, and yet have nothing of 
    the truth of religion. But though they talk for him, they walk contrary to 
    him. A man may preach for God, and teach others the way, that yet he never 
    sets his foot on himself; Matthew 23:4. Being like a boatman that ferries 
    others over the water, but still with his own back towards the shore. Both 
    ministers and professors may contend zealously for the faith of doctrine, 
    while they are utter strangers to the life of faith; like a physician 
    prescribing remedies to others, while himself is dying of his disease, 
    without applying of proper remedies.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) One may talk well to God, that yet never walks with 
    him. Many speak fair to the Lord, whose walk is ever foul, never cleansed; 
    as in Israel's case; Deuteronomy 5:27, 29. Fair professions, resolutions, 
    promises, are often seen going up as dust. Look to their words, they are 
    like Napthali giving goodly words, but still as Rachel, though beautiful yet 
    barren; Matthew 7:21, "Not every one that says unto me, Lord, Lord, shall 
    enter into the kingdom of Heaven."</p>
<p align="justify">But religion being a practical thing, let no man think he 
    has begun to be religious, until he come to practice; James 2:16, 
    17.—"faith, if it has not works, is dead being alone."</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is inward and heart religion; 1 Peter 3:4. They 
    that have no religion but what is visible to the world, have no true 
    religion; for God is the invisible God, and walking with him must be so too; 
    Romans 2:28, 29, "He is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that 
    circumcision, which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew, which is one 
    inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in 
    the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God." It may be very hard to 
    make any difference between the life of a hypocrite and a sincere person; 
    when the thread of hypocrisy is fine spun, it may pass the skill of the best 
    discerner to discover it. And therefore one that walks with God, has a view 
    beyond what he can see in others, or others can see in him. You must 
    distinguish between two things in religion.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The shell of it; and that is all you can see of my 
    religion, or I of yours. This shell is religious bodily exercise, preaching, 
    praying, works of piety, justice, mercy, and charity; 1 Tim 4:8. These 
    things are not very frequent in the world; but at the great day many of them 
    will be found like deaf nuts, which being cracked and their inside 
    discovered, are cast into the fire.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The kernel of it; and that is what none can see but 
    God and their own consciences that have it; and that is soul-exercise, 
    heart-work; 1 Timothy 4:7; Acts 24:16. That only is godliness, and not the 
    other. Preaching and praying, though it were with tears and the greatest 
    seeming seriousness, is not godliness; it is the faith, fear, love, 
    humiliation of heart, hatred of sin, resignation to the will of God, and 
    conformity of the heart to his mind, which is in the preaching or prayer, 
    that is religion in God's account. It is not the works of piety, etc., 
    themselves, but the love to God for his own sake, and love to our neighbor 
    for his, the holiness of the principle, manner, motives, ends that is in 
    these works, that is religion. The bodily exercise is but the vehicle, in 
    which these sacred drops are taken.</p>
<p align="justify">Let no man deceive himself. No kernel grows without a 
    shell, and none can have the power of godliness without the form of it; but 
    there is many a shell without a kernel, and much form where there is nothing 
    of the power.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is heavenly religion; Philippians 3:20. According 
    to men's state and their nature, so will their actions be; for as is the 
    tree, so will the fruit be. The heart of man, according as grace or 
    corruption reigns in it, will tincture everything that comes through it. 
    Hence a natural man's very religion is carnal and earthly; James 3:15. His 
    best things in religion smell of the earth. If a gale blow at any time on 
    his soul, it rises low; if he sorrow for sin, it is the sorrow of the world; 
    if he offer fire, it is strange fire. On the other hand, religion tinctures 
    the very natural actions of one that walks with God; for this is a walking 
    as one of another world.</p>
<p align="justify">Walking with God is indeed walking like one of the other 
    world, namely, the upper world. The man conforms no more to the way of this 
    world; Romans 12:2, keeps no more its course; Ephesians 2:2, but is coming 
    through it as a pilgrim, and coming out of it; Canticles 4:8. And,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) His root in this lower world is loosed, that he may 
    be in due time transplanted into the upper world. The believer is no more 
    one of the "world's own;" John 15:19. There is a certain sweetness to a man 
    in his native soil; and so there is to natural men in the world, they are 
    rooted in it by the greedy gripe their hearts take of it; Psalm 17:14. But 
    when grace comes, that gripe is loosed, and fixes on Heaven; and so that 
    sweetness goes off, and the world turns the weary land to him; Isaiah 32:2. 
    They do not find that sweet in it which others find, and which they 
    themselves sometimes found in it. Their hearts are on the way-gate.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The other world is the main thing he has in view; 2 
    Corinthians 4:18. While the present world bears most bulk in the eyes of 
    others, the world to come bears most bulk in the eyes of those that walk 
    with God. That is their designed and desired rest, that sways them in the 
    course of their life; their desires, hopes, and endeavors center there. They 
    overlook, and put on a holy regardlessness both of the good and ill of the 
    present world, if by any means they may escape the ill of the world to come, 
    and attain the good thereof. The purchase they design lies there.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) He is making way to the other world, as a man on his 
    journey; Canticles 8:5; not only by the course of nature, as all others, but 
    in heart and affections, by which the soul moves; hence the apostle says, 
    Philippians 1:23, "I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, 
    and to be with Christ; which is far better." It is true, when grace is not 
    in exercise, a believer may be for building tabernacles here, he may be very 
    unwilling to pass over Jordan; but then he is not walking with God, but 
    standing still. Sometimes when believers are in the dark as to their state, 
    or for some other reasons, they may be crying, as Psalm 39:13, "O spare me, 
    that that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more." 
    Nevertheless there is never a groan they give under the body of death, never 
    a desire they have of perfection of holiness, but there is enrapt up in it a 
    desire to be with Christ, which is best of all.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) He is conforming himself to the fashions of the 
    other world; Psalm 45:10. It is his own country, being born from above; he 
    is a pilgrim here, and therefore a man wondered at, as one of strange 
    fashions. He sets himself to be like God in holiness, for that is the 
    happiness of those that are above. As men serve an apprenticeship in a 
    trade, that afterwards they may set up in it; so the life of a walker with 
    God is an apprenticeship in holiness here, to set up in glory hereafter.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Lastly. He draws his great comfort from the unseen 
    things of another world; Hebrews 11:27. The apostle will have those in the 
    Christian race to look off to Christ, "who for the joy that was set before 
    him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right 
    hand of the throne of God;" Hebrews 12:2. When this world smiles, his chief 
    encouragement is not from it, but from the other world. When it frowns, 
    thence is his support; Hebrews 10:18. This has made the saints choose rather 
    poverty and reproach, confinement, banishment, prisons, and death, than to 
    act against the laws of Heaven; and to undergo these joyfully, while the 
    world wondered how they could bear up under them.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is lively and active religion, being a walking with 
    the living God, wherein there is not only grace, but grace in exercise; 
    Canticles 1:12, That is a remarkable character given to Christians; 1 Peter 
    2:5, "You also as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house." What? 
    "Stones," and yet "lively? Lively," and yet "stones?" Yes. The power of 
    godliness is a compound of these two. It makes men lively in God's matters, 
    yet as stones for solidity; solid, yet active, such as their spirits will 
    stir within them in these matters. There are three sorts that cannot be 
    walkers with God,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Dead people; they must be borne to their place, for 
    they cannot go. Unregenerate graceless people cannot walk with God. What is 
    the reason that so few walk with God. Why, truly the most part of 
    gospel-hearers are dead people; Ephesians 2:2; and until they be raised out 
    of the grave of a natural state, it is not to be expected of them. There was 
    a great cry in Egypt while one was dead in every family; but alas! there are 
    many so in many families.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Sleeping people; they are not fit for walking; and 
    sleeping Christians cannot walk with God; Canticles 5:2. Sometimes the 
    saints are going pleasantly on their way in the exercise of grace; their 
    desires, love, faith, etc., are awake and stirring. But though 
    unwatchfulness, security creeps on; and then they must lie down, they can go 
    no further, until the Lord waken them; Matthew 25:5. And this is one reason 
    why there are so many that have the root of the matter in them, who are not 
    walking with God at this day.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Lame and wounded people, that have got broken bones 
    by some grievous fall into sin; Psalm 51:8. They that have a thorn of guilt 
    in their conscience, cannot walk until it be drawn out. For the conscience 
    is defiled, the power of grace is weakened, the soul's communion with God 
    marred; and they cannot recover their liveliness until they make new 
    application of the blood of Christ, and renew their repentance.</p>
<p align="justify">5. It is regular religion, and uniform; for he who walks 
    with God must needs walk by a constant rule, eyeing him not in some things 
    only, but in all; Galatians 6:16; Psalm 16:8. He gives one rule of walking, 
    extending to man's whole conversation; and so he who walks with him, walks 
    regularly, aiming at a holy niceness, preciseness, and exactness, in 
    conformity to that rule in all things; Ephesians 5:15, [Gr. Noticing 
    carefully the prints of his feet with whom be walks.] Now this imports,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) A design and fixed purpose in religion, namely, a 
    purpose of conformity to God in it; Acts 11:23.—"and exhorted them all that 
    with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord." The words are 
    emphatic, "that they would cleave unto the Lord," abide by his side; "with 
    purpose of heart," laid down and determined beforehand. A man may do a good 
    thing in religion, which yet will not be reckoned good indeed to him; 
    because though he did it, he had no mind to please God in it. Religion's 
    chance customers will never be esteemed walkers with God; Leviticus 26 
    "walking contrary;" [Hebrews By accident, at all adventures.]</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A constancy in religion, in opposition to wavering; 
    Hebrews 10:23. Hither and thither in religion is not walking with God, who 
    "is of one mind, and who can turn him?" Job 23:13. They that walk with men, 
    or according to their own affections and inclinations, it is no wonder to 
    see them at one time destroying what at another time they were building up; 
    of one way in religion today, and another tomorrow; for these are changeable 
    like the moon. But walking with God, people would go even forward, and keep 
    their way they were on; neither going off on the right hand, because others 
    go off at the left; nor going off at the left, because others go off at the 
    right; Proverbs 4:25–27.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) An evenness in religion, in opposition to a 
    detestable uneveness; Matthew 23:23. To run with vigor in the lesser things 
    of religion, and move like a snail in the greatest matters of it, is not 
    walking with God. A wide conscience in substantial, and a narrow one in 
    circumstantials, is a conscience of a profane and godless make and mold; 
    hence is that intimation; Hosea 6:6, "I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; 
    and the knowledge of God, more than burnt-offerings." A sincere conforming 
    of ourselves to the duties required in the ten commands, summed up in love 
    to God and our neighbor, is true holiness. Instituted ordinances are the 
    means of holiness, which will be laid aside in Heaven, when perfection in 
    holiness is obtained. Now to be hot in these last, and cold in the other, is 
    as detestable as to be concerned to give meat to your neighbor, while in the 
    meantime you stab him to the heart, to take away his life.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) A universalness in religion; Psalm 119:6. He who 
    makes no bones of balking some steps, walks not with God. They that confine 
    their religion to their religious actions, and extend it not to their 
    natural and civil actions, have no religion at all. What does it avail to 
    pretend to a tenderness of conscience in one thing, and yet in other things 
    to swallow a camel; to a tenderness in dealing with God, while no tenderness 
    appears in their dealings with men? Psalm 119:128; Matthew 23:24. This is 
    one of the causes of atheism and contempt of religion in the generation; 
    Romans 2:23, 24, "You that make your boast of the law, through breaking the 
    law dishonor you God? For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles, 
    through you, as it is written."</p>
<p align="justify">6. It is laborious and painful religion; for it is no 
    easy life they have whose trade it is to walk on their feet; Hebrews 6:10. 
    And it is no easy religion to walk with God. Religion is not a business of 
    saying, but doing; not of doing carelessly, but carefully, painfully, and 
    diligently. If you would be religious indeed, you mast put to your hands to 
    work, set down your feet to walk, run the Christian-race, ply all your 
    strength to strive to enter in at the strait gate, wrestle with all your 
    might against principalities and powers, etc. This will be evident, if you 
    consider these following things, (for an easy religion is the ruin of many).</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Consider the scripture-notions of walking with God, 
    in which the life of religion lies, and you will see they imply 
    laboriousness. It is a working and laboring; John 6:27, "Labor not for the 
    meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures unto everlasting life;" 
    [Gr. work.] Here he who works not, shall not eat. It is not only a working, 
    but a "working out;" Philippians 2:12, a bringing the work to perfection, 
    otherwise what is wrought will be lost; 2 John 8. Some labor is easier than 
    other; but religion is compared to that which is the hardest labor.</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] It is compared to the husbandman's work, which is no 
    easy labor, ploughing, sowing, reaping; Hosea 10:12, "Sow to yourselves in 
    righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground." There is no 
    ground so hard to labor, as the hard heart is to the spiritual gardener. No 
    ground does so quickly and incessantly bring forth thorns and briers as the 
    corrupt nature. And whereas the gardener for ordinary finds his work as he 
    leaves it, the Christian rarely finds it so.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] To the soldier's labor; 2 Timothy 4:7, "I have 
    fought a good fight." He must watch while others sleep and take their ease, 
    otherwise the enemy will be upon him. He must fight, he must not flee, but 
    so fight as to overcome his spiritual enemies; Revelation 3:21. He must 
    pursue; Hebrews 12:14, namely, as one follows a flier, until he catch him. 
    Heaven must be taken by storm; Matthew 11:12. The gate is strait, there is 
    no entering with ease; men must press into it, else they cannot come 
    thither; Luke 16:16.</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] To the wrestler's labor; Ephesians 6:12, such as 
    makes all the body to shake again, ðáëç. They must put forth their utmost 
    strength, as those that are agonizing, wrestling with death; Luke 13:24. 
    This the Christian finds in wrestling with strong lusts and violent 
    temptations.</p>
<p align="justify">[4.] To the runner's labor in a race; Hebrews 12:1. That 
    requires patience and great eagerness; Philippians 3:13, 14; for they must 
    so run as to obtain the prize; 1 Corinthians 9:24.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Consider the way the Christian has to walk in 
    towards Immanuel's laud, and you will see that religion is a laborious 
    business. For,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] It is a difficult way; though plain in itself, yet 
    to us it is difficult to know; Canticles 1:7, 8. How much precious time do 
    the travelers spend in disputing which is the way, that might be better 
    improved in going forward? Nay, many spend all their days in disputing about 
    the way, until the sun go down on them, and night overtake them, before they 
    have begun to set off. Many mistake the way quite and clean; Ecclesiastes 
    10:15, some going in the way of bare morality, some of drowsy wishes, and 
    some of formality, etc. And many good Christians in the way are brought to 
    that pass, that they know not where to set down the next step; but have hard 
    work to know the road they should take.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] It is a wilderness way, and therefore very solitary; 
    Canticles 3:6. Canaan was a type of Heaven, and to it the Israelites came 
    through the waste howling wilderness, where they had many a weary step. An 
    emblem of the way to Heaven. There the Christian often suffers hunger and 
    thirst, there he is bit with fiery serpents, there he is attacked by furious 
    enemies, and there he has the Jordan of death to pass.</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] It is a rising, an upward way; Canticles 8:5. The 
    way of sin is down the hill, easy, and therefore much frequented. But the 
    way to glory lies up the hill; and hence so many are frightened from it at 
    first sight; and many that seem to set fair off once, are quickly out of 
    breath, and so retire. The temple, a type of Heaven, was situate on a hill, 
    Moriah; 1 Kings 10:5. Much hard travel had some of the Jews before they got 
    to Jerusalem, Psalm 84:6, 7; and when they came there, they had the hill of 
    God to ascend into; Psalm 24:3.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Consider what he has to walk through, that walks 
    with God in the way of the life of religion. He will meet with troops of 
    opposition, but he must break through them all. They must walk through,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Opposition from the devil; 1 Peter 5:8, 9. No sooner 
    does a soul set on the way of God in earnest, but the armies of Hell are set 
    in battle-array against him. The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the 
    way," etc., but the Christian resolutely walks forward. But it is hard work 
    when a poor Christian is engaged with a malicious and subtle devil, that has 
    had five thousand years' experience of the black are of temptation.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Opposition from the world. The world agents the 
    devil's cause for him, and never ceases to take the ill cause of the dragon 
    against Michael by the end. But they that mind for Heaven, must set their 
    face against the storm, and weather all the blasts that come from that 
    quarter. They will not want the counsel of the ungodly, but they must refuse 
    it; Psalm 1:1; the mockeries of the wicked, but they must despise them; 
    Psalm 119:51. Nay, sometimes it comes to persecution, and resisting even to 
    blood; but they that walk with God, must go through even a sea of blood when 
    called; Matthew 16:15. Daniel would not leave his prayers for thirty days, 
    when praying was death by the law; Daniel 6:7, 10.</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] Opposition from their own hearts' lusts. A man's 
    enemies are those of his own heart; Rom 7:24. Sometimes the false heart will 
    be saying within the man, "Arise and let us. go back to Egypt;" sometimes 
    with Peter, "Master, spare yourself;" sometimes with Judas, "What needs all 
    this waste?" sometimes with Pharaoh, "I will not let you go." But the 
    Christian must, over the belly of all these, walk forward; Matthew 11:12, 
    "The kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force."</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Consider what he has to walk over. There are some 
    things in the Christian's way to Heaven, which it may be he cannot get 
    through, but he must go over them.</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Over the belly of discouragements, Hebrews 10:35. 
    Satan plies the engine of discouragement with all his force, and often 
    mightily prevails by it, to make the Christian halt in his Christian course. 
    And they may long sit still, if they mind to sit until they be removed. Nay, 
    they must even break over them and go forward, though it be hard labor to 
    get over them, saying with David, Psalm 42:5, "Why are you cast down, O my 
    soul? and why are you disquieted in me? hope you in God, for I shall yet 
    praise him for the help of his countenance."</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Over the belly of stumbling-blocks laid in the way, 
    Matthew 18:7. The world is ruined by offences. Some give the offence, and 
    others take it; that is, some fall in the way, and others cannot go by the 
    stumbling-block, but break their necks over it. But he who walks with God, 
    when he cannot get them removed out of the way, he goes over them; but will 
    not go off his way for them, as people generally do; Job 17:9, "The 
    righteous shall hold on his way, and he who has clean hands shall be 
    stronger and stronger."</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] Over the belly of their credit and reputation 
    sometimes. Many a time a Christian must make a stepping stone of his credit, 
    to follow his duty; as David did, when he said unto Michal, "I will yet be 
    more vile than thus, and I will be base in mine own sight," 2 Samuel 6:22. 
    And it is a general rule in the practice of godliness, that they must be 
    fools who will be wise. That is hard; but sometimes they must even make a 
    stepping-stone of their reputation with carnal and untender professors, and 
    lay their account with their obloquy and reproach for following their duty, 
    as you may see Matthew 26:7–10.</p>
<p align="justify">[4.] Over the belly of their affections and inclinations. 
    It was Levi's commendation, "Who said unto his father and unto his mother, I 
    have not seen him, neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own 
    children," Deuteronomy 33:9. They have little sense of practical religion, 
    that do not see they must put the knife to the throat of their own 
    inclinations and affections many times, to follow duty laid before them by 
    the Lord. These are not the rule of our walk; but they that walk by their 
    own inclinations and affections, walk not with God, but walk as they that 
    are "sensual, not having the Spirit." And this is hard work, and so much the 
    harder when they meet altogether, as sometimes they do in the case of the 
    godly.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Lastly, Consider the little strength we have to walk 
    with; 2 Corinthians 3:5, "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think 
    anything as of ourselves." We got all of us a bruise in the loins of our 
    first parents. Even such as walk with God are healed but in part, the broken 
    bones are but beginning to knit. Well, if the iron be blunt, he must put to 
    the more strength; the less one has, he mast make the better use of it. All 
    these considerations show that religion is a laborious and painful business.</p>
<p align="justify">Well, Sirs, a slothful easy religion is a dangerous 
    business. Take heed to it; it will not be found walking with God. The 
    sluggard is lost by his own sloth; he "will not plow by reason of the cold," 
    says Solomon; "therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing," 
    Proverbs 20:4. He is the unprofitable servant; see his doom, Matthew 
    25:26–30, "Cast you the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there 
    shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." He is unprofitable to himself, for 
    he neglects his salvation-work; unprofitable to his Master, for he neglects 
    his generation-work. Mark the sentence; he loved darkness to sleep in, he 
    shall have his fill of it, "outer darkness." For carnal mirth, he shall 
    "weep." He would not work because of the cold, in Hell he shall "gnash his 
    teeth."</p>
<p align="justify">7. It is self-denied religion; Matthew 16:24, "If any man 
    will come after me, let him deny himself." Thus our Lord Jesus walked when 
    he was in the world; and "he who says he abides in him, ought himself also 
    so to walk, even as he walked," 1 John 2:6. Self-denial is one of the first 
    lessons that Christ puts in the hands of his scholars, and they have need of 
    it in practice through the whole of their conversation. In the religion of 
    walkers with God these two things are remarkable, laboriousness and 
    self-denial, which sweetly meet together in it, as the wings of the cherubim 
    over the ark.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Laboriousness, working as if they were to win Heaven 
    thereby, 1 Corinthians 9:24, following holiness with all eagerness, as 
    knowing that Heaven is not given to loiterers, but laborers; and endeavoring 
    to take the New Jerusalem as by storm. For walking with God, they look on 
    themselves as under his eye, and therefore ply their salvation and 
    generation-work. And the love of Christ constrains them to be serviceable to 
    him, and to ply themselves for conformity to his image.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Self-denial.</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Overlooking their work and labor, as if God had not 
    required it, putting no confidence in it before the Lord, nor valuing 
    themselves upon it in his sight, Philippians 3:3; but laying the whole 
    stress of their acceptance with God on the merits of Christ. This must needs 
    be so; for,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) He who walks with God is acquainted with the 
    holiness and spotless purity of himself, the exceeding breadth of his law, 
    and the jealousy of his Holy Spirit; and therefore he cannot miss to see the 
    imperfections of his best works in these bright glasses, and say as Psalm 
    19:12, "Who can understand his errors?" and 130:3, "If you, Lord, should 
    mark iniquities: O Lord, who shall stand?"</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) He honors the Son, living by faith in him, Galatians 
    2:20. And that is one's going out of himself for all to Jesus Christ, out of 
    his own ill in point of practice and self-loathing, and out of his own good 
    in point of confidence, Isaiah 64:6.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Overlooking their own strength for working, as mere 
    weakness, 2 Corinthians 3:5. Self-denial makes one go out of himself for 
    sanctification to the Spirit of Christ, as well as for justification to his 
    blood, 1 Corinthians 1:30; Isaiah 45:24. For walking with God is a walking 
    and leaning on him to be carried on the way, Canticles 8:5; a staying one's 
    self upon him, as the traveler does upon his staff. This must needs be so; 
    for,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Whoever tries the way of walking with God, will 
    quickly find he is not man enough for the opposition he will meet with in 
    the way, not able to go but as he is led, nay nor stand but as he is held 
    up, John 15:5. The least temptation or unmortified lust, how hard is it to 
    one left to grapple with it in his own strength? Peter falls at the voice of 
    a silly maid.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The scripture declares, that there is no safety in, 
    nor good to be had from, one's working merely from his own inherent stock, 
    Proverbs 28:26, "He who trusts in his own heart is a fool." Nay there is a 
    curse denounced on him that does so, which will cause that he will never 
    bring his work to perfection, Jeremiah 17:5, 6, "Cursed be the man that 
    trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from the 
    Lord. For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when 
    good comes, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness." And 
    therefore have we that watchword, Hebrews 3:12, "Take heed, brethren, lest 
    there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the 
    living God."</p>
<p align="justify">8. It is humble religion, Micah 6:8. For however any may 
    set up before men, they must needs veil their faces when they see themselves 
    in the presence of a holy God. Proud and conceited religion is of the wrong 
    stamp, for it is quite unlike the Spirit of the holy Jesus; and of the 
    saints, who, the more religious they were, were always the more humble. And 
    the more proud and conceited professors be of their religion, be sure they 
    are so far strangers to walking with God. Now, this humble religion will 
    appear,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) In low thoughts of ourselves, and honorable thoughts 
    of others, in whom the image of God appears, Philippians 2:3. Paul counts 
    himself the chief of sinners, though the chief of New Testament saints. A 
    high conceit of ourselves, with an undervaluing of others, is a shrewd sign 
    of little acquaintance with walking with God. For it is impossible but the 
    man that walks with God, must see more evil in himself, than he can see in 
    any other, that bears anything of the holy image of God. But he who has the 
    foul face, but looks not into the glass, may think it more beautiful than 
    any that he sees.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) In being denied to vain glory, Philippians 2:3. He 
    who walks with God will not have occasion to hunt after the applause of men, 
    unless he go off his way, and so far leave his Leader. It is a sad sign of 
    little walking with God, to affect so much honor and respect from men, and 
    for one to trumpet forth his own praise; a disposition smelling rank of a 
    naughty heart, Proverbs 27:2, "Let another man praise you, and not your own 
    mouth." John 12:43, "They loved the praise of men more than the praise of 
    God." It may nourish one to death, but not to life, like the chameleon, to 
    live on air.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) In refusing to stoop to nothing, whereby the honor 
    of God, and the edification of the souls of others may be advanced; as 
    exemplified in our Lord's humbling himself, Philippians 2:5–8. He who walks 
    with God will be content to make a stepping-stone of his credit, ease, etc. 
    for these ends, counting nothing too low for him whereby he may follow the 
    Lord. But alas! there is a cursed respect for ourselves, that so prevails 
    with many, that they count some duties of religion below them. And their 
    pretended credit must spread, though it should darken the heavens, and wrap 
    up the glory of God in a cloud.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) In a kindly accommodating of our spirits to humbling 
    providences, Job 1:21. Sometimes the Lord leads his people very low, through 
    afflictions, crosses, poverty, and wants. The humble will follow him 
    wherever he goes. But the proud, nothing will satisfy them, but rising, and 
    they will blacken the heavens with their murmurings and complaints when they 
    are falling. But if our lot be not brought up to our spirits, let our 
    spirits be brought down to our lot. We are on our journey out of this world, 
    and we may come as soon, and more safely, to an happy end of it, the low 
    way, as the high way.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Lastly, In an absolute resignation to the will of 
    God, saying in everything, "Not my will, but your be done," Luke 22:42. 
    Walking with God is a following of him as the shadow does the body. It 
    causes men put a blank in the Lord's hand, that he may fill up in it what he 
    pleases. But so far as we come short of the great duty of absolute 
    resignation to the will of God, we come short of walking with God.</p>
<p align="justify">9. It is constant religion. Walking is not a rising up 
    and sitting down again, but a continued action, like that of a traveler 
    going on until he come to his journey's end. Enoch walked on through the 
    world, until he was not. It is constant in two respects.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Without interruption. It is not a religion taken by 
    fits and starts but going on evenly; Psalm 16:8, "I have set the Lord always 
    before me." Some people's religion is like an ague, wherein they have their 
    hot fits and their cold fits. They go to and fro; they will be one day for 
    God, and another for the devil. Whatever good mood they be found in at any 
    time, they do not abide at it, Hosea 6:4. And so they can never bring it to 
    any good account; for they are always beginning, ever learning, but never 
    come to the knowledge of the truth. These people's religion consists in two 
    things.</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Flashes, and that is all they have for Heaven; 
    flashes of affections like those mentioned, Psalm 78:34, "When he slew them, 
    then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God." The 
    spirit of holiness does not rest on them, but some light touches of his 
    common influences they get, which do not abide. Hence with convictions 
    sometimes, and with melted but unsanctified affections, their hearts will be 
    as when in the time of great rain every pool is full, but quickly dry again, 
    because it has no spring. Whereas it is otherwise with those that walk with 
    God; John 4:14, "The water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of 
    water springing up into everlasting life."</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Overleaps into the holy ground; and that is all that 
    Heaven has from them; Job 27:9, 10, "Will God hear his cry when trouble 
    comes upon him? will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call 
    upon God? They do not usually feed on God's pastures, but at the table of 
    the world and their lusts. God saw this was the temper of the Israelites, 
    which made him say concerning them, "O that there were such an heart in 
    them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it 
    might be well with them, and with their children for ever," Deuteronomy 
    5:29. They will be today crying Hosanna, tomorrow, Crucify him. Religion is 
    not their element, and so they cannot abide with it, Job 24:13.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Without defection and apostasy. We read of some, 
    John 6:66, that "went back, and walked no more with him." They cast off 
    religion, and laid it by for good and all. These people's walking with God 
    (if we may call it so), will be no more remembered but to their 
    condemnation, Ezekiel 3:20. They will never see Heaven; Luke 9., "No man 
    having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom 
    of God." Lot's wife was an emblem of such; she looked back to Sodom, and God 
    turned her to a pillar of salt, for a terror to apostates. For such he 
    abhors, Hebrews 10:38. But they that walk with God will not be,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Bribed away from him, by the allurements of the 
    world and flesh, which is one engine of Satan whereby he makes many 
    apostates, as Judas, Demas, etc. How many are there who have sometimes, by 
    their addictedness to the way of God, promised great things, and so have 
    gone on for a time flourishing? But afterwards Satan has led them aside by 
    temptations, and always farther and farther off the way, until he has got 
    them to cast off religion altogether.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Boasted away from him, by the severities they may 
    meet with in following the Lord; Canticles 8:7, "Many waters cannot quench 
    love, neither can the floods drown it." Sometimes Satan plays the fox, by 
    cunning wiles to draw sinners to apostasy; and sometimes the lion, to drive 
    them to it by hardships, mockeries, hard usage, and persecutions. But 
    religion, where it is of the right stamp, will last, whatever methods may be 
    used to put it out.</p>
<p align="justify">10. Lastly, It is progressive religion; religion that is 
    going forward; Proverbs 4:18, "The path of the just is as the shining light, 
    that shines more and more unto the perfect day." There is a mark the soul 
    aims at when it sets off in the Lord's way; and that is perfection in 
    holiness, and walking with God is a pressing forward to it, Philippians 
    3:13, 14. Such a one is adding a cubit to his spiritual stature. When the 
    seed of grace is sown in the heart in regeneration, the man must walk with 
    God, that so the seed may grow and shoot forth. And so in walking with God 
    the new creature grows,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Inward, growing into Christ, Ephesians 4:15; uniting 
    more closely with him, and cleaving more firmly to him as the head of 
    influences, which is the spring of all other growth.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Outward, in good works, in life and conversation. 
    Not only like Naphtali do they give goodly words, but like Joseph they are 
    as fruitful boughs.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Upward; for their conversation is in Heaven, 
    Philippians 3:20; in heavenly-mindedness and contempt of the world.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Lastly, Downward, in humility and self-loathing. 
    Thus he who walks with God makes progress in sanctification.</p>
<p align="justify">There is also in it a progress in experimental knowledge 
    of religion, 2 Peter 3. The traveler the farther he goes on, he knows the 
    country the better; and he who walks with God gets Christian experience. Not 
    only is his head more filled with raw unfelt notions, but his soul is stored 
    with saving acquaintance with truth. The further be goes on, he becomes the 
    more expert a traveler to the heavenly Canaan. He observes what has worsted, 
    and what bettered his soul's case; and so will labor to eschew the one, and 
    follow the other. And when he comes to a dark step, he can bear out the 
    better, that it is not the first he has gone through.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus far of the nature of walking with God.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I shall next confirm this doctrine, That the life of 
    religion lies in walking with God. In order to this consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That religion is not a matter of speculation, but of 
    practice. Whatever light it brings into the mind, it is for moving the heart 
    and affections. And therefore it is called the doctrine according to 
    godliness. And the greatest mysteries of our religion are mysteries of 
    godliness; 1 Timothy 3:16. I think the devil may be a greater speculative 
    divine than the best of us can pretend to be. And the apostle supposes one 
    may understand all mysteries, and all knowledge, and yet be nothing; 1 
    Corinthians 13:2. So little worth is the knowledge of religion without the 
    practice, the word without the power.</p>
<p align="justify">2. All other practice of religion, without walking with 
    God, is but bodily exercise, little worth, 1 Timothy 4:8. The Jews wrote on 
    their synagogue-doors, "Prayer without intention is as a body without the 
    spirit." And where walking with God is wanting, there is the carcass of 
    religion, but the soul of it is away. It can never be pleasing to God, 
    because it is not agreeable to his nature, John 4:24.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The great difference between the sincere Christian and 
    the hypocrite lies here, Philippians 3:3, "We are the circumcision, which 
    worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no 
    confidence in the flesh." What makes the sincere Christian differ from the 
    hypocrite in his walk? Is it that he performs external duties? No, you 
    cannot pitch upon one of these, but a hypocrite may perform the same? Is it 
    that he knows and can speak of religion better? No, a hypocrite may excel a 
    good Christian in these gifts. Is it that he has sometimes a flood of 
    affections? No; Pharaoh, Esau, and the stony-ground hearers wanted not 
    these. But the hypocrite never comes up to walking with God, which the 
    sincere does, though not always.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Without this there is no sanctification, because 
    without it there is no communion with God, and so no sanctifying influences. 
    A man may pray many a prayer, hear many a sermon, and be many a year a 
    professor of religion, and yet never be a whit the more holy unless he walk 
    with God. All without that in this point, is but the washing of a black man, 
    labor in vain. For spiritless lifeless walking will never heal our unholy 
    nature. Hence when the heart is away from God, the man is as "the heath in 
    the wilderness, and shall not see when good comes," Jeremiah 17:5, 6.</p>
<p align="justify">5. This is that part of religion that will remain in 
    Heaven forever, 1 Corinthians 13:8. Thus the happiness of Heaven is held out 
    under the notion of walking with God, Revelation 3:4. All divine 
    institutions tend to this. For this was the course the first Adam was set 
    on, but broke off from; this course the second Adam held; and to be brought 
    back to this will be man's greatest happiness. So that without controversy 
    the soul of religion lies here.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, Our spiritual life lies in communion with God. 
    In ourselves we are dead spiritually, being slain in Adam. Now our life is 
    in Christ, Colossians 3:4, and we cannot partake of that life, but by 
    communion with him, Galatians 2:20, "I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in 
    me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the 
    Son of God." It is that communion with Christ that makes men truly lively, 
    and their religion, religion indeed, in so far as it makes men walk with 
    God.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall now make some improvement of this subject, in 
    uses of information, reproof, and exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">USE I. Of information. This lets us see,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That the religion of those is little worth, that are 
    utter strangers to walking with God. It is but the carcass of religion 
    without the soul. The apostle speaks of "vain religion;" James 1:26, "If any 
    man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives 
    his own heart, this man's religion is vain." This is such. It is vain with 
    respect to God's approbation, for be will never approve of it; Romans 2:28, 
    29; and vain with respect to their own salvation, it will never bring them 
    to Heaven, nor abide the trial; Matthew 7:22.</p>
<p align="justify">2. True religion lies not in a form, but has a power with 
    it causing a holy walk; 2 Timothy 3:5. True religion is not a vain 
    inefficacious thing, but has a commanding power with it. It is in the heart 
    like the centurion, when it says to the man, "Go," he "must go;" and when it 
    says, "Come, he comes." It has a restraining power, it binds up the man from 
    sin. Job was tempted to blaspheme, but the power of godliness restrained 
    him. It sets the man in God's way, it keeps him on it, and causes him to go 
    forward in it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. That no man has more true religion than what 
    influences his walk. God will never measure people's religion by fair words 
    or a shining profession, but by the course of their life and actions, in 
    faith, love, and other moral duties. God has written his law in the Bible, 
    has transcribed it again into the renewed heart, and they write it over 
    again in their holy conversation.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is little of the life of religion in the world, 
    there is so little walking with God in it. There are few that have the form 
    of godliness in comparison of those that want it; and yet but few of those 
    who have the form, that have the power too. How few are there that eye God 
    in all things, whose hearts go along with him as the shadow with the body, 
    that walk with him in ordinances, in providences, in their stations and 
    relations, and in their actions, natural, civil, and religious! O how rare 
    is practical, inward, heavenly, etc. religion!</p>
<p align="justify">USE II. Of reproof. Hence we may reach a reproof to 
    several sorts of persons, that do not walk with God.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Those that have never yet risen up from their sin. 
    Walking with God is a motion of the soul from sin to sanctification; Isaiah 
    1:16, 17. It is like the going up a stair, where the first step raises a man 
    from the ground, and so he goes up by degrees until he come there where he 
    would be. Heaven is the upper room, faith and holiness are the stairs, and 
    the state of sin is the ground. But alas! many have not come the length of 
    the first step yet; they are still in their sins, under the guilt of them, 
    and under the power of them. They have not with Lazarus come out of the 
    grave, with Matthew left the receipt of custom, nor with the palsied man 
    risen out of their bed; and far less with Enoch do they walk with God.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Consider, we cannot say of you, "You are not far 
    from the kingdom of God;" for truly you are even as far from it as Adam led 
    you and left you. The way to the pleasant land is long, and your day is far 
    spent; but to this day you have not entered on the way, nor stirred a foot 
    from your old sins. Are you not afraid, that your be gone day before you are 
    able to undertake the journey?</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) If you lie still, you will never see Heaven. As soon 
    shall Heaven and Hell meet, as you shall get to Heaven in that state and 
    case. If you sit still you die; and therefore rise and walk, and flee from 
    the wrath to come.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Those whose life is a mere wandering; Ecclesiastes 
    10:15, "The labor of the foolish wearies every one of them, because he knows 
    not how to go to the city." Many spend their days thus wandering; among the 
    creatures their souls wander, and from one they go to another; they take a 
    miserable round in the vanities of this world; but never go beyond them to 
    God. They wander up and down in the way of sin; sometimes they fall into one 
    miserable course, sometimes into another, but never into the course of 
    holiness. They walk in a round, whereof the center is Hell, and the 
    circumference sin and vanity. All their life they go from one sin and one 
    vanity to another, and at death, when they leave the world, they are in the 
    same place they were in when they came in to it; that is As they were born 
    in sin they die in it, and tumble down to Hell, their miserable life being 
    not a walking with God, but a wallowing in one puddle of sin all along.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Your thus wandering is a clear evidence that your 
    natural blindness is not removed; Revelation 3:17. Your plague is in your 
    head, and so your heart cannot be right. You have never yet discovered the 
    excellency of Christ the Captain of our salvation, nor the glory of the land 
    that is afar off, and you know not the way leading to it. Therefore your 
    case is sad.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Remember the generation that wandered in the 
    wilderness, died there, and never saw the land of Canaan; 1 Corinthians 
    10:5. This will be your doom, if you continue. You are walking in a mist 
    among fearful precipices and fiery serpents; how can you miss to fall?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Backsliders, that have turned their backs on God's 
    way, John 6:66. These, instead of walking with God, fall away from him, back 
    to their old sins. They gave up their names to him, listed themselves under 
    his banner, but now they have turned runaways. They came under bonds to God 
    and his way; but they have broken his bonds, and cast away his cords from 
    them. They once appeared on God's side, but they have got over into the 
    devil's camp.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Your sin is greater than if you had never set off in 
    the Lord's way. You know that relapses into a disease are most dangerous, 
    and most hopeless; and so "it had been better for you not to have known the 
    way of righteousness, than after you have known it, to turn from the holy 
    commandment delivered unto you," 2 Peter 2:21. For then men sin over the 
    belly of more light than before, they cast a particular infamy upon the way 
    of God, as if they would make the world to believe from their experience 
    that Christ's yoke is intolerable.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Your condemnation will be the greater. It is a 
    fearful word, Hebrews 10:38, "If any man draw back, my soul shall have no 
    pleasure in him." Proverbs 14:14, "The backslider in heart shall be filled 
    with his own ways." As the sorest fall is from the highest place, so the 
    deepest plunge into the lake of fire is from the threshold of Heaven. And 
    when the backslider is taken in the snare of destruction, it will be a 
    peculiar worm in his conscience forever, that once in a day he had well near 
    escaped.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Resisters of the Holy Spirit, whom God is using all 
    means with to draw them to his way, but they will not come on it, Jeremiah 
    2:25, "I have loved strangers, and after them will I go." Not only are they 
    called by the word, but by providence. God meets some in their evil ways, 
    like the angel with the drawn sword in his hand meeting Balaam, and yet they 
    will not leave it. God hedges up their sinful ways with thorns, yet they 
    break through the thorn hedge. Their consciences tell them they are wrong, 
    and give them many a secret blow to drive them into the way: but they follow 
    their corruptions over the belly of their consciences.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) This is dreadful and dangerous work, as being a 
    fighting against God and against yourselves, Acts 7:51. But though the 
    potsherds of the earth strive among themselves, it is miserable folly to 
    strive with their Maker. The voice of the word, providence, and conscience 
    is the voice of God; take heed how you entertain the same.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The issue must needs be terrible, if it be continued 
    in, Job 9:4. For when God judges, he will overcome. What can be expected of 
    it, but that God be provoked to cease striving with you, and to lay the 
    reins on your neck, Genesis 6:3; Psalm 81:11, and afterwards call you to an 
    account as willful rejecters of salvation?</p>
<p align="justify">5. Enemies to the way of God, who not only do not walk in 
    it themselves, but hinder others to walk in it, as the scribes and 
    Pharisees, Matthew 23:13. There are agents for the devil in the world, who 
    have a malignant hatred against the power of godliness, and set themselves 
    to quench the Spirit in others, by mocking, tempting them to sin, etc. 
    Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That is the devil's trade, and therefore a sad 
    indication of one that is a child of the devil. Let such hear what the 
    Spirit of the Lord says to them, Acts 13:10, "O full of all subtlety, and 
    all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will 
    you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?" God is especially an 
    enemy unto those that are enemies to his ways, and so set themselves to 
    advance the devil's kingdom.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The blood of souls will be a heavy load; and such as 
    turn others from the way of God, their blood will be upon their head. And 
    those that set themselves that way, they need not doubt but that in such a 
    corrupt world they will always be successful with some, Luke 16:27, 28.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Loose and licentious professors, who walk so 
    scandalously that the world may see they do not walk with God, Jeremiah 
    7:8–10, "Behold, you trust in lying words, that cannot profit. Will you 
    steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto 
    Baal, and walk after other gods whom you know not; and come and stand before 
    me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to 
    do all these abominations?" There are many that profess religion, that it 
    were telling religion they did not pretend to it. For hearken to their 
    words, take a view of their life, there is no tenderness to be seen there. 
    The voice is Jacob's, but their rough hands declare them to be profane 
    Esau's. There is nothing that looks like holiness about them, but the 
    profession of the truth; but their tongues and their lives are profane. 
    Whoever sees them, may see their light hearts and offensive lives have 
    nothing of the ballast of the power of godliness. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) A loose and licentious life, under whatever 
    profession it appear, argues a godless and graceless heart, Philippians 
    3:18, 19. It is an easy thing for people to make a profession, which costs 
    them not the life of a lust; to addict themselves to this or that opinion, 
    while they do not addict themselves to the study of a holy life; to pin a 
    new creed to an old life. But were grace in the heart, and they made 
    partakers of the new nature, it would make them study holiness in all manner 
    of conversation.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) What will the end of that way be, think you? See 
    Psalm 125., "As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord 
    shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity." And if there be a 
    hotter place in Hell than another, the hypocrite that has a profession of 
    religion, but a licentious life, shall get it, Matthew 24. And their 
    profession will serve but to make them so much the more marks for the arrows 
    of God's vengeance.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Close hypocrites, whose outward conversation is 
    blameless, but in the meantime they are strangers to the life of religion, 
    and walking with God, "having a form of godliness, but denying the power 
    thereof," 2 Timothy 3:5. They go about duties, but they are strangers to 
    communion with God; they walk blamelessly, but walk not with God; they 
    abound in bodily exercise, but are estranged to spiritual worship; they 
    exercise gifts, but they have nothing of the exercise of grace. Their souls 
    are estranged from the life of God, and are dead within them; and they are 
    like some dead beasts, there is nothing of them profitable but the skin, 
    that is, the outward form.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Consider that religion may serve to blind your own 
    eyes, and the eyes of the world, but not the eyes of God. The close 
    hypocrite will be like Ahab in disguise, but the arrow hit him for all that; 
    for there is no deceiving the eyes of the Almighty.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It will have a miserable issue. God loves to 
    discover hypocrites, Revelation 3:16, "Because you are lukewarm, and neither 
    cold nor hot, I will spue you out of my mouth." Sometimes he withdraws his 
    restraint that he has on them, and turns out their inside in this life 
    before the world, as Judas, Ananias, and Sapphira. But he will not fail to 
    do it at the great day, when every one shall be judged according to his 
    works.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Lastly, Gracious persons, whose grace is not in 
    exercise, who though they be spiritually alive in respect of their state, 
    yet are not lively, but dead in their frame, Canticles 5:2. They are not 
    walking with God as sometimes they have been, but are fallen asleep, and are 
    going after the way of their own hearts. O Sirs, you are off the way, and I 
    will tell you how you may know it. A gracious person may know that he is not 
    walking with God,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) By the decay of his love to his Guide. This was 
    God's controversy with the church of Ephesus; Revelation 2:4, "I have 
    somewhat against you, because you have left your first love." And may not 
    the Lord say to many of his people this day, as Jeremiah 2:2, "I remember 
    you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals, when you went 
    after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown?" While the soul 
    walks with God, it keeps its eye upon Christ, and seeing him cannot but love 
    him. But the soul loses sight of Christ; then out of sight, out of mind; and 
    what the eye sees not, the heart rues not. A sad sign that you are off the 
    way.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) By decay of love to the fellow-travelers; Matthew 
    24:12, "Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold." 
    There has been a day wherein the people of God have dearly loved one 
    another, delighted to pray, converse, etc., together; and the wrong done to 
    any one of them was, by reason of their sympathy, as done to them all. But 
    alas! where is that now? Christian love is much decayed. What is the reason? 
    Why, travelers as long as they are going out the road together, have a 
    particular kindness one for another; but when they begin to stay by the way 
    and scatter, one going to his business, and another to his, love wears off. 
    Even so the Lord's people taking different ways, and scattering from one 
    another, their love to each other cools.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) By the decay of zeal for the honor of their Leader. 
    If one would affront a captain on the head of his troop, all the soldiers' 
    hearts would stir within them. But when he is left alone, there is none 
    concerned to resent the injuries done to him. I never like that zeal, that, 
    overlooking the substantial of religion, burns out on the lesser things. But 
    this I will say, that were there more walking with God among us, there would 
    be more zeal for the great things of religion; and if so, then more for the 
    lesser things too. Were we more concerned for the kingdom of Christ within 
    us, we would be more zealous for the kingdom of Christ without us.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) By the decay of tenderness, and care to please the 
    Lord; Colossians 1:10. While David was walking with God, he was tender of 
    the least sin, his heart smote him when he had cut off the lap of Saul's 
    garment. But at another time he lay long under horrible guilt in the matter 
    of Uriah, his heart being hardened. Sometimes Christians could have had no 
    rest without the enjoyment of God in duties; but alas! at other times they 
    are formal in performance of their duty as a task. And an evil deed will not 
    be so heavy to them, as a rash word or vain thought would sometimes have 
    been.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) By the decay of diligence in duties, instead whereof 
    slothfulness creeps in; Ecclesiastes 10:18. He who walks with God will be 
    diligent to note every step of his way; so it is an ill sign when the heart 
    turns careless. He will be much conversant with God in the duties of 
    religion, often found on the road to the throne, because he has much 
    business with Heaven; but when he walks not with God, he remits of his 
    diligence, and comes far short of his former pains in his soul-matters.</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) By a decay of heavenly-mindedness, instead of which 
    there creeps in carnality and earthly-mindedness. Walking with God is a 
    heavenly life; Philippians 3:20. And while a child of God holds at it, it 
    tinctures all his thoughts, words, and actions with a savor of Heaven; 
    Canticles 3:6. But when that fails, all these savor of death.</p>
<p align="justify">(7.) Lastly. By a decay of liveliness and earnestness in 
    duties. Sometimes a child of God is like Jacob wrestling for the blessing; 
    he is very peremptory, and will not take a naysay; Genesis 32:26. Sometimes 
    again as Ephraim, like a "silly dove, without heart," Hosea 7:11; having 
    neither heart nor hand to ply the throne of grace; a sad sign of not walking 
    with God.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, to such I would say two things,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Horrid ingratitude is stamped on your ceasing to 
    walk with God; Jeremiah 2:31. The pleasantest and most profitable days a 
    Christian ever has, are those wherein he walks with God; and when he gives 
    over that, his real good days are done; Hosea 2:7. Then his bones flourish 
    as an herb, but otherwise they wither like the grass. Therefore may we say, 
    "Do you thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise?" Deuteronomy 
    32:6.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] It is easy to go off the way, but not so to get on 
    it again; it is easy to halt and sit down, but not to rise up again and 
    walk. You had need to awake in time, lest the Lord give you a fearful 
    wakening, either by some heavy stroke, or, which is worse, by letting you 
    fall into some grievous guilt, as he did David.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. Of exhortation. Study the life of religion, in 
    walking with God. Walk not after your lusts, nor in the way of the world, 
    either its way of profaneness, or its way of formality; but go through the 
    world walking with God. I offer the following motives,</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 1. You are going fast through the world, and before 
    long will be at your journey's end. Time runs with a rapid course; and 
    whether you sleep or wake, you will soon find yourselves pass the border of 
    time; Job 9:25, 26. The watch going wrong may run as fast as when she goes 
    right; and the man that walks after his own lusts, makes as great speed to 
    the end of his journey, as he who walks with God. And since we must walk 
    through the world, and cannot abide here, why will we not choose the best 
    company in our way, and walk with God?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Walking with God is the only way to get safe to our 
    journey's end; Hebrews 2:10. It was only Caleb and Joshua that got to 
    Canaan, for they followed the Lord fully. All the world is on a journey; but 
    there are two ways, and two companies. There is the way of holiness, and all 
    the saints walk there, with the Lord on their head; and the end of this way 
    is salvation. And there is the way of sin, a broad way, wherein are many 
    roads, bare civility, morality, profaneness, and formality; all the 
    unregenerate walk there, and the God of this world on their head, and the 
    end is destruction. Choose you with whom you will walk.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Religion is not a matter of speculation and talking, 
    but a matter of practice and walking with God; Psalm 116:9, "I will walk 
    before the Lord in the land of the living." Your eternal state lies at 
    stake, which you will never bring to a comfortable issue without this. Until 
    you enter on this way, you are to begin to be religious, how long soever 
    your standing in a profession has been. After children are born, it is long 
    before they begin to walk; but as soon as one is born again, and becomes a 
    child of God, he immediately falls a walking with God.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is a pleasure, a refined, undreggy pleasure, in 
    walking with God; Proverbs 3:17, "Wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness, 
    and all her paths are peace." This pleasure arises from the testimony of 
    conscience, which is a feast to the soul; 2 Corinthians 1:12, enough to make 
    a sick man whole; from the intrinsic pleasantness in the way of holiness, 
    which has a surpassing beauty in the eyes of those that are capable to 
    discern; Psalm 119:97 and 165; and from the soul's communion with God which 
    it finds in that way; Psalm 4:6, 7.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECT. But what can it do to us for a through-bearing in 
    the world? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Very much, "having promise of the life that now 
    is," as well as "of that which is to come;" 1 Timothy 4:8. Those that walk 
    with God have a promise of provision in this word; Psalm 37:3; Matthew 6:30. 
    It is no maybe, but as sure as the covenant can make it; Isaiah 33:16, 
    "Bread shall be given him, his water shall be sure." It is true, God's bond 
    is not always paid as it were in money: but if not, it is always paid in 
    money-worth, If they get not the thing itself, they get as good; 2 
    Corinthians 6:10,—"as having nothing, and yet possessing all things."</p>
<p align="justify">6. Walking with God is the best security in evil days. 
    There are sinning and ensnaring times; who can be so safe in them as they 
    that walk with God? even as in a dark day, those that keep closest with 
    their guide, are likeliest to get safest through; Proverbs 11:3, "The 
    integrity of the upright shall guide them." There are suffering times, days 
    of common calamity; and then those that walk with God are likeliest to be 
    brought through, as Noah; Genesis 6:9.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly. This is the way all have taken, that have 
    walked through the world to Immanuel's land. God's children only are heirs; 
    and they that are his children must follow him; Ephesians 5:1. There is no 
    walking with God in Heaven, but for those that walk here with him in 
    holiness. And therefore remember," If you live after the flesh you shall 
    die; but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you 
    shall live;" Romans 8:13.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall now shut up all with some directions, and advices 
    for walking with God.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Labor to be sure you are Christians indeed, and once 
    fairly set on the way, by closing with Christ. Renounce the world and your 
    lusts; and look on yourselves as men bound for another world, under the 
    conduct of the Captain of the Lord's hosts; Canticles 4:8.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Lay it down for a certain conclusion, that religion is 
    quite another thing than mere external performances. It is a conforming of 
    the soul to the image of Christ, and of the life and conversation to the 
    holy law, by a participation of the virtue of his blood and Spirit. And 
    therefore there must be constant endeavors to abide close by Jesus Christ, 
    in the exercise of faith, love, and universal tenderness, not only in life, 
    but in heart; Proverbs 4:23.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Being set on the way, labor to hold by it. You must 
    learn not to be shamed out of God's way, by the reproaches of the world. 
    Care not for the name of singularity, and be not ashamed to be fools in the 
    world's eyes; 1 Corinthians 3:18, 19, not to be bribed nor boasted out of 
    God's way, by any advantage or loss in the world; Hebrews 11:24.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Closely ply the work of mortification; Galatians 5:24. 
    What is your need of Christ, if it be not to save you from your sins? 
    Matthew 1:21. Beware of making Christ the minister of sin, by going the 
    round between sinning and confessing, without suitable endeavors for 
    mortification. Mortification is no easy business; but most necessary.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Beware of indulging yourselves in those things that 
    are accounted but small sins, and abstain from all appearances of evil. No 
    man will walk with God, to whom any sin is so small that he will make no 
    bones of it. And those that stand not to go frankly into the borders of sin, 
    will very readily step over.</p>
<p align="justify">6. When you fall lie not still, but get up again by a new 
    application of the Redeemer's blood, and renewing your repentance. For no 
    man can walk so but he will stumble; but then the suitable remedies are to 
    be improved for recovery.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Be frequent in self-observation and examination. Take 
    notice how often the pulse of your affections beats. Retire into yourselves, 
    and observe the way of your hearts and lives; Hag. 1:7. And examine 
    yourselves often as to your state and case; 2 Corinthians 13:5. Ask 
    yourselves whether you be going forward, or backward, what profit you make 
    of duties?</p>
<p align="justify">8. Be diligent observers of providence; Psalm 107., 
    towards yourselves and others.</p>
<p align="justify">9. Be tender of waiting on the Lord, to know sin and duty 
    in particular cases.</p>
<p align="justify">10. Be diligent in all religious duties, missing none of 
    them, and being frequent in them all. For these are the trysting places for 
    communion with God, which they that walk with him must diligently attend.</p>
<p align="justify">11. Prepare for duties before you set about them; not 
    only public duties, but private and secret ones. For the rushing on these 
    without consideration, is the high way to make them vain and fruitless.</p>
<p align="justify">12. Labor to be spiritual in all things; in religious 
    duties seeking to exercise grace, and enjoy communion with God; and even in 
    other things, to act as under his eye, and by influence of his command.</p>
<p align="justify">13. Lastly. Live by faith; 2 Corinthians 5:7. For it is 
    by faith that the soul is set and kept in this walk.</p>
