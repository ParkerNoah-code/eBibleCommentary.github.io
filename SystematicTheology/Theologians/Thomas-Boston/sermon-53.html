        <p align="justify">
          <br />
          James 3:6, "The tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THE keeping of the tongue is one of those duties, that entitles a man
          to safety from evil times, and therefore must now be urged as a
          seasonable duty. "What man is he who desires life, and loves many
          days, that he may see good? Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips
          from speaking deceit." The difficulty of this duty is such, that James
          says, "If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and
          able also to bridle the whole body." The wisest monarch could hardly
          govern a great part of the world; how difficult then must it be to
          govern a world, and that a world of iniquity. The tongue is a world of
          iniquity, a heap of evils; as in the world many things are contained,
          so in the tongue.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I shall endeavor to make some discovery of this world of iniquity. As
          it is beyond my power, so it is not my design to make a full discovery
          of it. We must leave a void for the unknown parts of it. But behold a
          few of them: This world of iniquity is divided into two parts, undue
          silence, and sinful speaking. These are the higher and lower parts of
          this world, yet quickly may men travel from the one to the other. I
          shall speak of these in their order.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Undue silence, when the tongue rests idle, when God calls it to
          work. Our tongues are our glory, and should not be involved in a dark
          cloud of silence, when God calls them to shine forth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Silence is unseasonable, when sin rages and roars. When men are
          dishonoring God, it is sad that our tongues should be nailed. When men
          declare their sin, as Sodom, it is sad that in our mouths there should
          be no reproofs. "You shall in any wise rebuke your neighbor, and not
          suffer sin upon him." Our tongues testify that we are men, and they
          should show we are Christians and in a covenant with God, offensive
          and defensive. "For the zeal of your house," says David, "has eaten me
          up: and the reproaches of them that reproached you, are fallen upon
          me." By this undue silence, we are injurious to God, in that we do not
          vindicate his glory, bespattered with the sins of others. His glory, I
          say, who has given us a tongue as a banner, to be displayed because of
          truth. To run away here with flying colors, doubles the dishonor of
          God; while he is once dishonored by the sinner, and again, by the
          silent professor, Mark 8:38.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This undue silence is also injurious to our neighbor. We see him
          pulling down the house about his ears, and yet we will not help him;
          selling his soul for a trifle, and yet we do not bid him rue his
          bargain. O horrid cruelty! to stand with our tongues in silence, when
          the devil often casts our neighbor into the fire.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is injurious likewise, to ourselves, for thereby we adopt the
          devil's children brought forth by others, and set down their debts to
          our own account, Ephesians 5:7–11. Other men's sins that we have
          occasioned, become ours, by silence, which gives consent; and the
          flame that burns up their house, will consume our own, if it be not
          quenched with a testimony against it. This silence also leaves a sting
          in our conscience, which remains inactive in the hearts of some for a
          while; but when the opportunity of bearing testimony against sin is
          gone, it bites dreadfully the hearts of those, whose consciences are
          not seared.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. When an opportunity of edifying others invites us to speak, "let no
          corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth; but that which is
          good, to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the
          hearers." O what iniquity is contracted, by the neglect of heavenly
          discourse among professors. A dumb Christion is a very unprofitable
          servant. A philosopher seeing a man with a fair face and a silent
          tongue, bade him speak, that he might see him. When scholars or
          merchants meet, we know what they are by their discourse; and why
          should not Christians also discover themselves. When men of the same
          nation, meet in foreign countries, they speak the language of their
          own country. I will say but three things of this neglect:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Dumb Christians are very unlike Christ, whose ordinary way it was
          to spiritualize all things, and turn the current of the discourse
          toward Heaven. This we see exemplified in every part of his history.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Either there is no religion at all, or but very little, in that
          heart. Nearest the heart, nearest the mouth. If fire be upon the
          hearth, the smoke will come out at the chimney. "Let the word of
          Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing
          one another, in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing with grace
          in your hearts, to the Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. They are very useless sort of people; like the vine that is
          fruitless. "Shall wood be taken thereof, to do any work? or will men
          take a pin of it, to hang any vessel thereon."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Silence is unseasonable when our wants are crying. These should
          make us cry to God, like that woman, who cried to the king of Israel,
          saying, "Help, my Lord, O King." O! what a dreadful thing is it, to
          think that a dumb devil should so possess the hearts of many, who will
          not call upon God. That tongue shall be tormented in Hell flames, that
          will not now cry to God by prayer. "God will pour out his fury upon
          the heathen, and upon the families that call not upon his name." They
          have tongue enough for the world, that have none for God and their
          poor souls. The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not
          seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Sinful speaking; when the tongue is exercised, but ill exercised;
          and this is a throng piece of this world of iniquity. I may divide it
          again into two parts, one against our duty to God, the the other
          against our duty to man, where mind ourselves is our nearest neighbor.
          Only there is one part of this world of iniquity, that scorns to be
          bounded by either of these, and that is talkativeness, or much
          speaking; of which we may say they set their mouths against the
          heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth. Some are ever
          talking, and are never in their element, but when they are prattling;
          and when once they begin, it as difficult to stop them, or get word
          about, as to stop a flood of water, and turn the stream another way.
          Though they speak little, yet long. Their words clatter like a loose
          window in wind; whereby, though they give vent to their own pride, yet
          they grate the ears of others, and make them sit on thorns. I will say
          but two things of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is a sign of a loose and frothy heart, where there is little of
          the fear of God. "Be not rash with your mouth, and let not your heart
          be hasty to utter anything before God: for God is in Heaven, and you
          upon earth; therefore let your word's be few." God has given us two
          ears, and but one tongue, and that with a twofold guard upon it.
          "Wherefore, my beloved brethren," says James, "let every man be swift
          to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath." "Wise men lay up knowledge,
          but the mouth of the foolish is near to destruction."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is the fool's badge. "A fool's voice is known by multitude of
          words." It is the empty barrel that makes most noise. Such persons
          from want of acquaintance with themselves, present a fool to others,
          while they think him a wise man. They that are given to much speaking,
          seldom speak well. This made an orator ask a double fine of a
          talkative scholar; one to learn him to speak well, another to teach
          him to hold his peace. We should be like the virtuous woman. She opens
          her mouth with wisdom. Her mouth is not always open, but duly shut,
          and discreetly opened. Her words are few, true, and useful. Now come
          we to the
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Which is against our duty to God. Here I shall pitch on,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Rash swearing by the name of God. "Swear not at all," says our
          Savior. O how is the name of God rent by black mouthed atheists in our
          day, whose discourse betrays them to be cursers. There is swearing
          also by the creatures, as by our conscience, faith, truth, and the
          like. These, men will rather mince and keep, than fairly give up;
          hence a brood of minced oaths, as Mary, good faith, and the like. And
          the little faith that is in the world, makes men hang by a hair of an
          oath, after they have been beaten from the more gross expressing of
          it; so by faith, is turned to faith, and by is cut off; then it is
          turned to fakes; and they will rather eat in letters, and keep three,
          than lose that hellish ornament of discourse. And persons using these,
          we will see at our own communion table. But, sinners, what pleasure or
          profit accompanies this sin. Other sins have something of this nature;
          this has nothing. You must then love it for itself; a pure devilish
          love indeed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, know you what a terrible one God is, that you dare abuse his
          name; even that dreadful name, at which the devils tremble; that name,
          to which you shall bow at length, whether you will or not. Are you not
          afraid he banish you to Hell, while the oath is in your mouth; where
          you will get a long eternity to blaspheme his name. And you that dare
          not swear by God, but by your faith and the like, how dare you swear
          by them that are no gods, Jeremiah 5:7. This is a piece of idolatry,
          and I fear your God (I mean your faith), will not save you at length.
          They have little or nothing of faith in their hearts, that have it so
          often in their mouths.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Once more, God will be avenged on you for these things, if you repent
          not, Jeremiah 5:7–9. Your swearing will damn your soul. "Above all
          things, my brethren," says the apostle James, "swear not, lest you
          fall into condemnation." O! then swear no more, lest God swear in his
          wrath, that you shall not enter into his rest. "You shall not take the
          name of the Lord your God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him
          guiltless, that takes his name in vain."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION 1. God forbid that be true, that God will be so severe for
          words.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. Words are a wind that will blow you to Hell: For by your words
          you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned. Mind
          also the roll's dimensions, Zechariah 5:2, 3. There it is contained,
          every one that swears, shall be cut off as on that side, according to
          it. The roll exactly answers the dimensions of their houses, and of
          the porch of the temple where the law was taught, 1 Kings 6:3. It will
          make you completely miserable, the execution exactly answering the
          threatening.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">OBJECTION 2. I never swear but when angry.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. Nor does God ever damn a man for swearing, or any other sin,
          but when he is angry. Is it God that offends you? Why do you set your
          tongues against the heavens, when your fellow worms displease you?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">OBJECTION 3. I have got a custom of it.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. Custom is no defense. Is not your sin then the more heinous?
          If a man has a custom of reproaching you, will that justify his
          conduct? Whence is this custom, but from your casting off God's fear.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">OBJECTION 4. It is a common thing.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. So much the worse. The men of the world conspire against God
          and dishonor him, and therefore you do so too; then, you shall perish
          with the world. Sooth not yourselves with that, that if it be ill with
          you, it will be ill with many one; for although most men should perish
          eternally, surely it will be no comfort to go to Hell with company.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. A light, irreverent, and profane using of the name of God, in
          common talk. We are not worthy to take his name in our mouths, much
          less ought we to abuse it in common talk. Would we speak of God with
          reverence, we should speak as in his sight and hearing, and this would
          cut off the irreverent use of God's name in any little matter that
          fools wonder at, or pretend to wonder at, and fear, as "God bless us,
          save us, Christ, have a care of us, Lord have mercy on us." My
          brethren, the blessing of God is a matter of great moment, and you
          should either seek it on the bended knees of your body, or, at least,
          of your heart. But it is not they that are serious with God for these
          things, that use to seek them in this way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It would cut off also, the irreverent use of God's name in
          obsecrations; "as for God's sake, love of God, Christ's sake," etc.
          These things may be used in weighty matters, but in trifles they are
          horrid. Let them be great things, that concern your own or your
          neighbor's life or salvation, that you will seek for God's sake. When
          you do it, do it with reverence, as in his sight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It would likewise cut off irreverence, in appeals to God in mere
          trifles, as, "God knows, where he is I know not." The omniscience of
          God is no matter of moonshine. The serious thoughts of it may make the
          best of us to tremble, and the worst of us not to make light of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It would do this also in prayers for the dead. Some cannot speak of
          the dead without a prayer, that perhaps never prayed for them while
          living. The dead are in an unchangeable state; and by these things you
          may bring down wrath on the living, but no help to the dead.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Many such ways is God's name abused. Yes, it is common with many to be
          very liberal of God's name, as "let him do it in God's name." Nay,
          many will have God or Lord in their discourse, when neither others nor
          themselves know what they would be at by it, as, "Lord man!" But I
          fear we are not at the bottom yet of the dunghill. Know you God, that
          he is the Lord, and holy is his name.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Cursing; whereby we wish some horrid ill to ourselves or neighbors;
          but, because it is a kind of profane prayer, I speak of it under this
          head. This is done, either, 1. By expressing the name of God, as in
          these, "God damn, confound," etc. Oh! what if God should take these
          poor wretches at their wish, they would find that damnation is no
          matter of sport. 2. The name of God sometimes is supposed, but the
          profane prayer is belched out, as, "I would you may break your neck,"
          &amp;c., in which men call on God to be an executioner of their wicked
          and passionate sentences on themselves or others. 3. Hitherto I refer
          to the invocating of the devil. O! what homage does the devil get from
          many Christians, who are found oftener praying to him than to God, as,
          "Devil take me." Sometimes they change, and mince his name, as, "foul
          fiend, sorrow one, for devil one," etc. These are the Goliath's, that
          boast and curse themselves or others by their God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          O! beware of cursing, James 3:9–11. It is very provoking to God, and
          pleasing to the devil, who is also ready to take you by your word,
          when he can get leave. It is the character of a wicked man. "His mouth
          is full of cursing, and deceit, and fraud; under his tongue is
          mischief and vanity." Cursing will bring a curse upon you, if
          repentance prevent not. "As he loved cursing, so let it come to him;
          as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. As he
          clothed himself with cursing, like as with his garment, so let it come
          into his affections like water, and like oil into his bones."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Profaning of scripture phrases, by jesting or scoffing on the
          scriptures; or using them to express the conceptions of men's wanton
          wits, alluding to them in common talk, and the like. Alas! this is
          much used by the profane generation, who hold forth their contempt of
          the word, by these means. It is knowing persons readily, that are
          guilty. This is an affronting of God, whose sacred oracles the
          scriptures are. The heathens paid a profound respect to the oracles of
          their gods. The Jews and primitive Christians, had a great respect for
          the scriptures; so have all the godly, in all ages. If men should
          treat our letters to them at this rate, how would we take it. Remember
          the Scriptures are the word by which you shall be judged. The man that
          would burn his rights to land, or like a child, tear them and dress
          babies with them, would soon be denuded of his estate; so they who
          thus treat the Bible, will soon be denuded of Heaven, of which the
          scriptures are the rights.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Mocking of religion and seriousness. There are some, in whose
          consciences the piety of others leaves a sting, and therefore they
          endeavor to laugh it away, and mock at those who are serious, and
          reproach them for that which is their glory. "They that sit in the
          gate, speak against me," says David, "and I was the song of the
          drunkards." To mockers, I would say,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Your sport is not that of God's people. Let me see an instance in all
          the Bible, of a mocker that was a godly man. "The godly man sits not
          in the seat of the scorner." And as this practice of mocking leads the
          way to the sin against the Holy Spirit, so there is scarcely anything
          except that sin, that is so sure a sign of a ruinous state.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, you do but make the cords with which you shall be bound under
          the wrath of God forever. "Now, therefore, be not mockers, lest your
          bands be made strong." If ever you get repentance, and be saved, you
          must be saved in that way you mock now. Either you must be like them
          you mock, or perish forever: "For without holiness no man shall see
          the Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">OBJECTION. It is but hypocrisy that we mock.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. But that is a horrid untruth. If it be so, why do you not
          imitate those you mock, so far as they do well? Why do you not show as
          ranch distaste of the ways of the openly wicked? But how come you to
          judge men's hearts, when their outward actions appear good? Nay, let
          us entreat you to try religion, and be not as these, who speak evil of
          the things they know not, but what they know naturally, as brute
          beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves. I would give you such
          advice as was given to the Athenians, that they should be sure that
          Philip was dead, before they expressed joy for his death. Be sure that
          there is no reality in religion, before you mock at it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Reasoning against religion, and defending sinful opinions and
          practices. This is very frequent with men who love carnal liberty, and
          so endeavor to shelter sinful practices, under the cloak of reason;
          yes, and the Scriptures too, by which they bring God himself to be a
          patron to their wickedness." But the curse is denounced against these.
          "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness
          for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and
          sweet for bitter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Murmuring and complaining. Proud hearts make us fret at the
          dispensations of providence. This sets the tongue on fire, and hence
          some are ever complaining, as if their tongues had been given them for
          no other end, but to accuse God. Read Jude 14, 15, 16. It is a base
          tongue that will proclaim our crosses, and bury our mercies, though
          the last are far more numerous than the former.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Against our duty to man. I shall here specify these following
          things,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Idle speaking. That is, words spoken to no good purpose, tending
          neither to the glory of God, nor the good of ourselves or others,
          either in spiritual or temporal things. This is condemned. "But I say
          unto you," said Jesus, "that every idle word that men shall speak,
          they shall give account thereof, in the day of judgment." It may be
          comprehonded under that foolish talking which is not convenient; rash,
          roving, and impertinent discourse, which does no good to the hearers,
          but betrays the folly of the speaker. It will not be long before our
          speech be laid, so that it is sad to waste our little breath so idly.
          We have enough besides, to fill our accounts, though we wanted that. A
          gracious soul will beware of idle words, as of vain thoughts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. A trade of jesting. Paul says, "Neither filthiness, nor foolish
          talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient." It is not unlawful to
          pass an innocent jest, to produce a moderate recreation. But if a jest
          be allowed to be sance to our conversation, yet it is impious to make
          it the meat. For a man to make every word a jest, is fitter for a
          stage than Christian gravity. And seldom, if ever, is it so managed,
          but it is offensive both to God and man; but some will rather lose
          their friend than their jest.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Lying; of which there are four sorts: 1. Pernicious. 2. Officious.
          3. The sporting lie. 4. The rash lie; when men through inadvertency,
          and customary looseness, tell an untruth; as when tidings were brought
          to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is
          not one of them left. This is so common, that we may say truth has
          fallen in the streets. Few so tender, as to avoid making a lie.
          Consider God is a God of truth, and therefore it is most contrary to
          his nature, and the devil is the father of lies. It is a badge of the
          old man. "Lie not one to another, seeing you have put off the old
          man." The godly are children that will not lie. A lying tongue is an
          abomination to the Lord, and lies will lodge the soul with the devil
          forever. All liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with
          fire and brimstone. Say not it is only to do good to others, for we
          must not speak wickedly for God. Some lie to keep others from sin, but
          it is an excess of charity for a man to damn his own soul, to save
          another's. If it is to make sport, surely that grieves the Spirit of
          God, and is indeed sport to the devil. Or, if you say you know no
          better, remember God has given you a heart to think before you speak,
          and before you speak you should be sure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Uncharitable speaking of truth, to the wounding of the reputation
          of others. It is not enough, that what ill we speak of others be true,
          but the speaking of it must bring a greater, than the disadvantage the
          party gets by it. This brought the curse on Ham and his posterity,
          Genesis 9:22. And we should imitate Shem and Japheth, with respect to
          the faults of others. This uncharitable speaking is readily the effect
          of pride, while others are cast down, that we may rise on their ruins;
          or of envy which, like the flies, pass over the sound parts, and feed
          on the sores in the body. It is most contrary to charity, which covers
          the multitude of sins. Truth may come from a malicious heart, as in
          Doeg's case, 1 Samuel 22:8, 9 This does not stop at the real faults of
          others, but oftentimes breaks out to the natural defects of others, or
          to that which is really their affliction; in which that holds true, he
          who despises the poor, reproaches his Maker.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Slandering or backbiting. Of this, three sorts of persons are
          guilty: 1. He who raises a false report of his neighbor, Exodus 23:1.
          Here is a true son of the devil, with malice and lying in conjunction.
          2. He who readily reports it, though he knows it to be false, as
          readily receives, though he is not sure it is true. 3. He who spreads
          it. This is a very common sin. Tale bearers and whisperers are found
          everywhere, whose tongues are swords to stab the reputation of others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You do the devil's work, who is the accuser of the brethren. You are
          his special errand-bearers, and no doubt, will get such wages as he
          has to give. Consider that sad passage, Psalm 50:20, 22. "Therefore,
          speak not evil one of another, brethren. He who speaks evil of his
          brother, and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law, and judges
          the law."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Censoriousness, which construes the words and actions of others,
          always to the worse. Many are of such a waspish nature, that they can
          suck poison out of the sweetest flowers, and have an evil tale of
          every person, Matthew, 7:1, 2.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Flattery; a base kind of sin, by which men strive to humor others,
          at the loss of truth, to the great hurt of the party flattered. Of
          such a person it may be said, "The words of his mouth were smoother
          than butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil,
          yet were they drawn swords." But this is remarkable, that these that
          will speak fair before a man's face, will not stand to wound him
          behind his back. The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the
          tongue that speaks proud things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. Boasting; by which men talk big of themselves, or others concerned
          in them; trumpeting out their own praise, a sin which is odious in the
          sight of every man. Some boast themselves of what they have not.
          "Whoever boasts himself of a false gift, is like clouds and wind
          without rain." Others, of what they have, setting it in a magnifying
          glass. These are the black roll, 2 Timothy 3:2.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Obscenity. "Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your
          mouth." This argues a rotten heart, and is ready to infect others.
          "Evil communications corrupt good manners." O! how like the devil,
          that unclean Spirit, do they look, who cannot hold within the bounds
          of common modesty. These are some of the most common parts of the
          world of iniquity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          INFERENCE 1. If the tongue be a world of iniquity, what must the heart
          be; for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. You may
          know the lion by his paw.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. See wherein true greatness consists: to govern a world of iniquity.
          Here is work for you. To help you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Labor to get the heart purified from these sins and lusts that it
          vents by the tongue. Quench the fire on the hearth, and the smoke will
          cease.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Get the fear of God impressed on your hearts, and walk as under the
          eye of an all-seeing God. This will be a bridle and a spur to the
          tongue, for it needs both. Amen.
