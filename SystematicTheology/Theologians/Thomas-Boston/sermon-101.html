    Psalm 81:10, "Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it."</p>
<p align="justify">THE great design of the gospel, and of all 
    gospel-ordinances, is to make souls happy, and for this end to bring them to 
    God through Christ, in whom they may find solid and complete satisfaction. 
    All men desire to be happy; they are conscious to themselves of wants, which 
    the natural desire of happiness influence them to get supplied. But, alas! 
    they apply to improper quarters, and suck at those breasts which can never 
    fill them, even those of their lusts. Since Adam forsook God for the 
    creature, mankind have been so intoxicated with creature-sweetness, that 
    they stand as it were chained at the creature's door, begging satisfaction, 
    even after a thousand denials. They cannot lift their eyes to the Lord, they 
    cannot move their feet towards him, until grace break the bands of iron and 
    brass with which they are held.</p>
<p align="justify">In the text, the Lord comes to sinners as thus situated, 
    and outbids all others which they in their hearts and lives are following 
    after; and he does this even while they will not look over their shoulder to 
    him, from their madness on their idols. This is the scope of the text: for 
    in this verse the Lord pleads the grand purpose of love laid down, verse 9, 
    which is, that they should renounce all others for him, give up with their 
    idols, and take him for and instead of all. And to enforce this, he thus 
    reasons with them: 1. I have done for you what all your idols never did, and 
    never could have done, "I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the 
    land of Egypt." Where were all your strange gods, when Pharaoh refused to 
    let you go? Deuteronomy 32:11, "So the Lord alone did lead him, and there 
    was no strange God with him." Look to all the real good that ever you met 
    with, and say, Was it the Lord or your idols that did it for you?—2. I will 
    do and can do for you, what they cannot all do for you: "Open your mouth 
    wide, and I will fill it abundantly." Many a time you have opened your 
    mouths, and wide enough, to your idols; so wide that it has been no small 
    pain to get them shut again; and yet they remain still empty for them, they 
    were never filled. But says the Lord, "Open your mouth wide, and I will fill 
    it." Where more particularly observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That there is an emptiness supposed in poor sinners, 
    which needs to be filled. They have lost God, and a thousand worlds cannot 
    fill up his room. That man who has Christ in his heart, has enough to 
    satisfy him, want what he will. And let a man have what he will, if he has 
    not Christ in him, he has not what can satisfy him. All the devil's trash 
    can never fill the heart; many an empty space is in that heart where Christ 
    is not; which plagues them with a dog-like appetite, which is never 
    satisfied.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is a fill proposed and offered to empty sinners. 
    This is a soul-fill; a filling with all the fullness of God. This is the 
    only thing which can fill the mouth of the soul, which is the mouth meant in 
    the text; for it is an easy thing to find among the creatures a fill to the 
    mouth of the body, which can hold but little; but the whole creation cannot 
    fill the mouth of the soul. The Lord only can fill it, he only can satisfy 
    and still the restless soul, and so make it, after many years, disappear, 
    and fall asleep in the bosom of God; and after the most pinching straits to 
    say, "I have all, and abound."—We have,</p>
<p align="justify">3. The party communicating this soul-fill to the sinner: 
    I, more generally, "I the Lord," in opposition to strange gods. That fill 
    you could never get from your idols, you shall have from me. More 
    particularly, it is Jesus Christ, the second person, the great treasurer of 
    Heaven, and steward of the fullness of God. It is plain that it is the same 
    Lord who brought the Israelites out of Egypt; and this was no other but 
    Christ, who was known under the Old Testament by the God of Israel, Exodus 
    3:2–8. It was he who wrought that deliverance, as a type and pledge of the 
    great redemption. It was he whom the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire 
    did represent, even God veiled with flesh. He who brought them out of the 
    land of Egypt, he whom they tempted in the wilderness, and this was Christ; 
    1 Corinthians 10:19, "Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also 
    tempted, and were destroyed of serpents."—We have,</p>
<p align="justify">4. The sinner's duty in order to this communication: 
    "Open your mouth wide." The word here used is, in Genesis 26:22, rendered 
    "making room." O the freedom of grace! only make room for a fill, and you 
    shall have it. Let the soul only, as an hungry infant, lay its mouth by 
    faith on the breasts of Christ's consolations, and they shall flow 
    abundantly. If the spiritual appetite be not wanting, you shall have a fill; 
    and what can be desired more? unless we would have him to force it upon us. 
    Open your mouth, do not keep it close, and say you will have none of him. 
    Open to receive, and he will give. Open it wide, the wider you open, the 
    more that your souls desire of him, you shall get the more. I cannot think 
    the wideness in the text is intended to straiten the offer, but rather 
    informs us that there is a fullness in Christ, sufficient to satisfy the 
    most extended desires of the soul.—From this subject, I take the following</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE, That Christ Jesus can and will fill the soul 
    whose mouth is opened wide to receive of and from him.—For illustrating this 
    doctrine, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what it is to open the mouth of the soul wide to 
    Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">II. How Christ fills the soul, so as no other can do. And 
    then,</p>
<p align="justify">III. Conclude with some improvement.—We are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show what it is to open the mouth of the soul wide 
    to Christ.—This opened mouth consists,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In a sight of wants. The soul must be brought to a 
    sight of its own emptiness, before it will open its mouth for a fill from 
    the Lord: Proverbs 27:7, "The full soul loathes an honey-comb: but to the 
    hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet." The want of this was Laodicea's 
    ruin. She thought herself rich, and increased in goods, and having need of 
    nothing, and knew not that she was wretched, and miserable, and poor, and 
    blind, and naked. When Christ comes to the soul, he says to it, as he did to 
    the blind man, "What will you that I should do unto you?" He makes persons 
    sensible of their diseases, before he applies the remedy, that his free 
    grace may thus be glorified. Jesus, by his word and Spirit, gives the soul a 
    view of God in his glory; and then the soul cries, I want peace with God: a 
    Mediator, a Christ to stand between me and his consuming fire. He gives the 
    soul a view of the tribunal of God, before which it must soon appear: and 
    then it cries, Ah! I want a righteousness, a better righteousness than my 
    own, a complete and everlasting righteousness, without which I can never 
    appear with acceptance before this tribunal.—A view of his sins: and then he 
    cries, Where shall I find pardon?—A view of what the law requires, and of 
    what the sinner is in himself: and then he cries, Ah! I am all wants. I have 
    nothing of myself good, and can do nothing.—This opened mouth consists,</p>
<p align="justify">2. In a sense of need. Persons may see their want of 
    those things who are not pinched with felt need, but reign as kings without 
    Christ, and say unto God, Job 21:14, 15, "Depart from us, for we desire not 
    the knowledge of your ways. What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? 
    And what profit should we have if we pray unto him?" But the soul whose 
    mouth is opened wide, says, with the prodigal, "How many hired servants of 
    my father have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!" Luke 
    15:17. They find that they are undone without Christ. The soul is pressed 
    with that question, What shall I do to he saved? No happiness to the soul 
    without the enjoyment of God, and no enjoyment of him, but through Christ 
    the Mediator between God and man.—This opened mouth consists,</p>
<p align="justify">3. In a holy dissatisfaction with all things besides 
    Christ. Clothe a starving man with scarlet, and fill his pockets with gold, 
    and advance him to the highest honors; all this is not meat, and therefore 
    he cannot be satisfied. And to the hungry soul there is none, nothing but 
    Christ, which can give satisfaction. They loathe their lusts, which they 
    loved before. A thousand worlds will not satisfy the soul which sees its 
    need of Christ. When the soul comes to itself again, after it has gone the 
    round of the whole creation for satisfaction, it returns with the report, 
    Ecclesiastes 1:2, "Vanity of vanities, says the preacher, vanity of vanites, 
    all is vanity." It finds at length that the bed is shorter than that one can 
    stretch himself upon it.—This opened mouth consists,</p>
<p align="justify">4. In the soul's removing its desires from off vanities, 
    and fixing them on Christ for satisfaction. Like the hungry infant, which 
    has been sucking in vain at this and the other object which was nearest it, 
    and could never rest; when the breast is put in its mouth, it opens its 
    mouth, and fixes there to suck. The soul gives over the pursuit of happiness 
    in lusts, he finds that gall and wormwood are now on these breasts. It 
    ceases from hammering its happiness out of the law, and finds that there is 
    no pleasing that rigorous husband; the ladder of their duties has so often 
    broken with them, that they despair of ever climbing to Heaven this way. And 
    so, like men out of breath, in seeking their happiness from other things 
    than Christ, they lie down before the Lord, turning their eyes towards him, 
    that he may take them up, and give them what in vain they have been looking 
    for elsewhere. Their language is, Jeremiah 3:23, "Truly in vain is salvation 
    hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains; truly in the 
    Lord our God is the salvation of Israel."—This opened mouth consists,</p>
<p align="justify">5. In an assured expectation of salvation from Christ: 
    Hosea 14:3, "Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither 
    will we say any more to the works of our hands, You are our gods; for in you 
    the fatherless finds mercy." Matthew 21:22, "And all things whatever you 
    shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive." The soul believes that 
    Christ can do it: and so far believes he will do it, as that it ventures on 
    him. Without this, the soul cannot open its mouth to Christ, but shuts it 
    without hope. Though the hopes may be very faint, yet the trembling hand may 
    receive Christ, and the quivering mouth may be filled.—This opened mouth 
    consists,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, In a hearty willingness to receive Christ as he 
    offers himself in the gospel. Christ says, "I am the bread of life;" the 
    soul is well content to receive him as such, for all and instead of all. 
    They fed on the husks before, and loathed the manna; now nothing relishes so 
    well with them as the bread which came down from Heaven. They are brought 
    over all their objections against him, and are well content to venture their 
    souls on him, as it is he alone who can fill them with all the fullness of 
    God.—We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show how Christ fills the soul so as no other can 
    do: "Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it." This promise imports four 
    things.—It imports,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Such a suitableness in him to the necessities of the 
    soul, as is to be found in no other. Sinners seeking a fill of the 
    creatures, are but feeding on wind, which can never satisfy. There is no 
    suitableness between the desires of an immortal soul, and the produce of 
    this earth: Isaiah 55:2, "Wherefore do you spend money for that which is not 
    bread, and your labor for that which satisfies not? Hearken diligently unto 
    me, and eat you that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in 
    fatness." What avail riches, honors, and pleasures, to a soul pressed with 
    guilt! But Christ is suited to all the wants of the soul. Speaking of the 
    excellence, suitableness, and fullness of his salvation, he says, "I counsel 
    you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white 
    clothing, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness do 
    not appear: and anoint your eyes with eye-salve, that you may see," 
    Revelation 3:18. His blood and Spirit will answer all cases which the soul 
    can be in.—The words import,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That there is a sufficiency in Christ for all their 
    needs: Colossians 1:19, "It pleased the Father, that in him should all 
    fullness dwell." There is enough in him to satisfy all the desires of the 
    soul. Persons may travel through the whole creation, before they find an 
    object commensurable to the desires of their souls; but when the soul comes 
    to Christ, it then and there finds an object, than which the soul, when 
    extending its desires to the utmost, cannot crave more. Here, though our 
    boundless desires should launch forth into this ocean, they shall never be 
    able to reach the bottom, or find the shore.—The words import,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That there is a communication of this suitable 
    sufficiency unto that soul which opens its mouth wide to receive it. Thus,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Christ gives himself to that soul, so that such an 
    one might say, Song 2:16, "My beloved is mine, and I am his;" or, with 
    Thomas, cry, "My Lord, and my God." They have him by the surest tenor of an 
    indissoluble union; John 6:56, "He who eats my flesh," says Jesus, "and 
    drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him," A wicked man may have many 
    poor mys, Daniel 4:30, compare chapter 2:47. But they cannot call God 
    theirs; and besides, they want a thousand things more than what they have. 
    But what want can they have who want Jesus, who is all in all?</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ gives them all good with himself: Romans 
    8:32, "He who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how 
    shall he not with him also freely give us all things?" Psalm 84:11, "For the 
    Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord will give grace and glory; no good 
    thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly." Having a right to 
    himself, they may write their names upon, and claim a title to, all that are 
    his. They are rich, seeing they are married to Jesus, the heir of all 
    things. No sooner does the soul close with Christ, than they get this right; 
    and though they get not all presently in hand, yet they have all in hope; a 
    hope of which they will never be ashamed.—The words import,</p>
<p align="justify">4. The soul's satisfaction upon that communication. In 
    what measure the soul opens its mouth to Christ, in that measure Christ 
    communicates of his fullness; for this is the standing rule, "According to 
    your faith, so be it unto you." And in what measure Christ communicates of 
    himself to the soul, so the soul has that satisfaction. Accordingly the soul 
    rests in Christ, and having enough in him, never goes out, as it was 
    accustomed, to beg at the world's door: John 4:14, "Whoever drinks of the 
    water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall 
    give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up to everlasting life." 
    "It is enough," said Jacob, "Joseph is yet alive." When all the cisterns are 
    dried up, the believer has enough. He can rejoice in the Lord, and joy in 
    the God of his salvation, Habakkuk 3:17. He can say also with Paul, 
    Philippians 4:18, "But I have all, and abound." I am full; and no wonder, 
    for the soul having Christ, has,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) A fullness of merit to look to: 1 John 1:7, "The 
    blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, cleanses us from all sin." When the soul 
    looks within itself, it sees a fullness of guilt, debt, misery, and poverty. 
    It sees heart, lips, life, and duties, all full of sin; sins which tears of 
    blood and rivers of oil cannot wash away. But, looking to Christ, it sees a 
    fountain opened for sin and for impurity, Zechariah 13:1. The rock struck by 
    the rod of justice, and the waters gushing out, and following them through 
    the wilderness, a sea to overwhelm all their guilt! Micah 7:19, "He will 
    turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; 
    and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea."—The soul sees,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A fullness of spirit in Christ to take away the 
    power of sin. He has the seven Spirits of God, Revelation 3:1. When they 
    look within themselves, they see a very scanty measure of the Spirit. When 
    they look above them to the Head, they see it there without measure poured 
    out upon their Head, to that very end that it may go down to the skirts of 
    his garments, even to every member of his mystical body.—The soul sees,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) A fullness of grace in him, lodged in him as the 
    common storehouse of all the saints: John 1:16, "And of his fullness have 
    all we received, and grace for grace." If they want wisdom, or 
    righteousness, or sanctification, they have it in him: 1 Corinthians 1:30, 
    "But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, 
    righteousness, sanctification, and redemption." They have all in him; and 
    seeing God treats with them no other way but as in him, they are complete in 
    him, "For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And you are 
    complete in him, who is the Head of all principality and power."—I come now,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To conclude with some short improvement. And this 
    only in a use of exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">I would exhort you, then, to come to Christ with enlarged 
    desires, that your souls may be filled. I direct you to one who can give 
    your souls full satisfaction. Open your mouths wide, O communicants! Open 
    your mouths wide, one and all of you, make enlarged demands from Christ the 
    Savior.—To prevail with you in complying with this exhortation, I offer you 
    the following motives—</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 1. You have many times opened your mouths wide to 
    the world, and your lusts, but were you to this day ever filled? Proverbs 
    23:5, "Will you set your eyes upon that which is not? For riches certainly 
    make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle towards Heaven." Have you 
    not enlarged your desires as Hell? If there had been any satisfaction which 
    you could have got out of Christ, have you not squeezed so hard as that you 
    would certainly have pressed it out? But you have never got it, and never 
    shall get it there. Come, then, to Christ, and try him.</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 2. Has not the world and your lusts often rewarded 
    your love with hatred? When you have been hammering for satisfaction at 
    these things, have you not struck fire instead of water, out of these barren 
    rocks, and lain down in sorrow? O! if you had bestowed that strength of 
    affection and desire on Christ, which you have on these things, you had 
    never been so rewarded.</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 3. If Christ fills you not, you shall never be 
    filled. Many have sucked at these breasts which you are on, but never one 
    came speed; as little shall you; Ecclesiastes 2:12, "And I turned myself to 
    behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that comes 
    after the king? even that which has been already done?" There was a sign of 
    emptiness hung out at the creature's door in paradise, the tree of knowledge 
    of good and evil. And has that vanity which sin subjected them to since 
    filled up that emptiness? No, no. Ah! you shall as soon grasp your arms full 
    of shadows and dreams, as fill your souls without Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 4. Consider that Christ can and will fill your 
    souls, if you will only open your mouths wide, and receive him.—For 
    consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That all fullness is in him: Colossians 1:19, "For 
    it has pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell." He is the 
    storehouse of all fullness: it dwells in him, it can never be missed there. 
    The fullness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily, Colossians 2:9. Can there 
    be ever any want with him?—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That the fullness that is in him is to be 
    communicated by him: John 1:16, "And of his fullness have all we received, 
    and grace for grace." It is lodged there to be communicated from him to poor 
    souls: Zechariah 13:1, "In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the 
    house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for 
    impurity." The fullness of Christ is not the fullness of a vessel, but of a 
    fountain that casts forth its waters, and yet has still enough.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That it belongs to him, and to him alone, to 
    distribute that fullness: John 5:22, "For the Father judges no man, but has 
    committed all judgment unto the Son." He is the great steward of the 
    fullness of God. The keys hang at his belt. Never any soul was filled, but 
    whom he filled. The Father directs the hungry soul to his Son: Matthew 17:5, 
    "This," says he, "is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear you 
    him." The Spirit points you to Christ. And Christ is saying to you what 
    Joseph said to his Father and brethren: Genesis 45:9–11, "Haste you, and go 
    up to my father, and say unto him, Thus says your son Joseph, God has made 
    me lord of all Egypt; come down unto me, tarry not. And you shall dwell in 
    the land of Goshen, and you shall be near unto me, you and your children, 
    and your flocks, and your herds, and all that you have. And there will I 
    nourish you, (for yet there are five years of famine), lest you, and your 
    household, and all that you have, come to poverty."—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) That you have his word for it, that he will do it: 
    Isaiah 55:1, "Ho every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he who 
    has no money, come you, buy and eat, yes, come, buy wine and milk, without 
    money, and without price" John 6:37, "All that the Father has given me, 
    shall come unto me, and him that comes unto me, I will in nowise cast out." 
    And you have the testimony of them who have gone before you: Luke 1:52, 53, 
    "He has exalted them of low degree. He has filled the hungry with good 
    things."</p>
<p align="justify">Here, however, there may be proposed this objection. Is 
    it possible for a person to find satisfaction in such a course, turning his 
    back on the world and its lusts? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Come and see. The saints have found and do find 
    satisfaction, and this such as has made them despise the smiles and frown of 
    the world: Psalm 4:7, "You have put gladness in my heart, more than in the 
    time when their corn and their wine increased: Hebrews 11:24–26, "By faith 
    Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's 
    daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than 
    to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. Esteeming the reproaches of 
    Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect unto 
    the recompense of reward." Is there any perfection or sweetness in the 
    creature but what comes from God? does not the whole creation shine with 
    borrowed light? If so, then God must be more sweet, infinitely more sweet, 
    than all the creatures, even if combined together. And does not the natural 
    constitution of the soul call for the enjoyment of an infinite good? It must 
    then be the greatest reality.</p>
<p align="justify">Still, however, some may press this objection, But will 
    he fill me who am full of sin? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Christ fills freely, as freely as the rain falls, 
    and the sun shines, without hire, and his fullness will wear out the 
    fullness of sin: Isaiah 1:18, "Come now, and let us reason together, says 
    the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow: 
    though they be red as crimson, they shall be as wool." Amen.</p>
