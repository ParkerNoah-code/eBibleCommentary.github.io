    1 Samuel 12:21, "Turn you not aside; for then should you go after vain 
    things, which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain."</p>
<p align="justify">YOU have been professing to forsake your wandering life 
    through the empty creation, and to turn to the Lord as your portion, as your 
    soul's rest, and as your great Lord and Master from henceforth. There is one 
    thing of which I would persuade you, the faith of which would keep you ever 
    with him; and this is, that if you were to change every day, you can never 
    do better, never do so well. This is the scope of our text; in which we have 
    Samuel's reason to the Israelites for their not turning aside from the Lord 
    in any case; which is, "For then should we go after vain things, which 
    cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain."</p>
<p align="justify">These words (without any supplement, and to the same 
    sense, but more forcibly expressed) may be read word for word thus: "And you 
    shall not turn aside, but after vain things," etc; that is, you cannot turn 
    aside, but you must, by doing so, go after vain things. The text is a 
    defiance held out to men in their attempts to mend their condition by 
    departing from the Lord. In which there is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A case supposed, which is, That they should turn aside 
    from the Lord; and having done so, they have the wide world to choose upon, 
    let them take to the right hand, or to the left, choose the best they can 
    pitch on, some or all, that what is wanting in one, may be made up in 
    another. This is the utmost extent to which it can be carried.—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">2. The determination in this case, which is expressed in 
    the text with all confidence. You shall not, you cannot for your hearts, 
    turn aside, but after vain things; I defy you to find out a substantial good 
    for yourselves in the whole creation, separate from God. Betake yourselves 
    to what you will, to idols that are so already, to other things to make 
    idols of them, make your best of them, you shall never make more of them 
    than vanity, they are unprofitable, empty, helpless nothings.—From this 
    subject I take the following</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE, That no man shall mend his condition, but will 
    ruin it, by turning aside from the Lord, let him turn to whatever hand he 
    will.—For illustrating this doctrine, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Offer some things for explaining this point.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Evince the truth of this weighty point.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Add the practical improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">We are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To offer some things for explaining this point.—Here I 
    observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That no man, by turning aside from the Lord, shall 
    mend his condition, but ruin it, in point of rest to his heart, and 
    satisfaction to the desires of it: Isaiah 57:19, 20, "I create the fruit of 
    the lips; peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, says 
    the Lord; and I will heal him. But the wicked are like the troubled sea, 
    when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. There is no peace, 
    says my God, to the wicked." Every man's heart within him is naturally an 
    hungry, empty thing, which must be filled from something without itself, or 
    it cannot rest. Some, hearing of the soul's satisfaction to be had in God, 
    come away to ordinances, and are for a time found about the Lord's hand, 
    like the mixed multitude from Egypt among the Israelites. They do not at the 
    very first find that satisfaction for which they look, and they cannot wait; 
    but for haste to be filled, they go back to the world and their lusts. In 
    this case, the more haste, the less speed; they are farther from it than 
    ever.—I observe,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That no man, by turning aside from the Lord, shall 
    mend his condition, but ruin it, in point of comfort and ease to his 
    conscience; Psalm 32:3, 5, "When I kept silence, my bones waxed old, through 
    my roaring all the day long. I acknowledged my sin unto you, and mine 
    iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the 
    Lord; and you forgave the iniquity of my sin." This is the true way to get 
    ease. But some awakened sinners seek ease by their tears, confessions, 
    resolutions, and the like, not by the blood of Christ: but, alas! those 
    plasters will not stick, they will never draw out the thorn of guilt. Some 
    divert the pain of conscience, by filling their hands and heads with 
    business, like Cain. Some stifle it by sinning, yet more over the belly of 
    convictions. But the sore healed with any of these, which are but mere 
    palliatives, will break out more dreadfully than ever, though perhaps not 
    until there is no remedy. And how is the case thus mended? is it not 
    ruined?—I observe,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That no man, by turning aside from the Lord, shall 
    mend his condition, but ruin it, in point of his interest and advantage: 
    Jeremiah 2:13," For my people have committed two great evils; they have 
    forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns 
    broken cisterns, that can hold no water." He who changes, changes for what 
    he accounts the better for himself; yet men often find themselves 
    disappointed. Nothing draws persons more away from God than interest; but 
    Heaven shall be turned nethermost, and earth uppermost in the universe, 
    before any man, manage as securely as he will, shall ever be a gainer by 
    turning aside from God. For this you have the concurring testimony of all 
    true penitents, whose eyes have been opened: Hosea 2:7, "And she shall 
    follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek 
    them, but shall not find them; then shall she say, I will go and return to 
    my first husband, for then was it better with me than now."—I observe,</p>
<p align="justify">4. That no man, by turning aside from the Lord, will 
    better his condition, but ruin it, in point of security from evil: Proverbs 
    28:18, "Whoever walks uprightly, shall be saved; but he who is perverse in 
    his ways, shall fall at once." Sin often promises, but can never afford a 
    solid shelter. Any hiding-place or defense to which persons betake 
    themselves, turning away from God, is but vanity, and cannot deliver; nay, 
    it exposes them to the way of evil: Amos 5:19, "As if a man did flee from a 
    lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand upon 
    the wall, and a serpent bit him." The Jews, in their crucifying of Christ, 
    are a standing witness to this: John 11:48, "If we let him alone," said 
    they, "all men will believe on him, and the Romans shall come, and take away 
    both our place and nation." Matthew 22:7, "But when the king heard thereof, 
    he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, 
    and burnt up their city."—We now come,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To evince the truth of this weighty point. That no 
    man shall mend his condition, but will ruin it, by turning aside from the 
    Lord, let him turn to whatever hand he will.—We shall do this,</p>
<p align="justify">First, By considering to what a person turns aside when 
    he turns from God.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, By taking a view of what he turns aside from. 
    And,</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, By inspecting the pretended gain which he 
    acquires by turning aside from the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">First, We are to evince the truth of this weighty point, 
    by considering to what a person turns aside when he turns from God. It is 
    but vanity, which cannot profit or deliver. There are but two things to 
    which a person can turn aside, though the particulars are numberless. The 
    character agrees either,</p>
<p align="justify">1. To sin, that is, to sinful ways, courses, or 
    practices. And while there is a God in Heaven to avenge the affront, no man 
    shall mend his condition in this way. You will not, indeed, want an 
    invitation to turn aside, and go in at this door; but know for a certain 
    that it will ruin you, for "the dead are there, and her guests are in the 
    depths of Hell," Proverbs 9:18. Sin is the way in which you will never find 
    rest to your souls; on the contrary, it will produce a sting to your 
    conscience, a constant restlessness to your heart, and eternal ruin to the 
    whole man, if mercy recover you not, and bring you back to God.—Or the 
    character agrees,</p>
<p align="justify">2. To the creature, to which, when men are turning aside 
    from God, they turn to seek their happiness. This comprehends all created 
    comforts whatever. Of them we have two things to say.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They are all uncertain, a person can never get a 
    sure hold of them: Proverbs 23:5, "Will you set your eyes upon that which is 
    not? for riches certainly make themselves wings, they flee away as an eagle 
    towards Heaven." Unchangeableness is an essential property of that which 
    makes truly happy and fully satisfies, for otherwise the very fear of losing 
    the thing mars the full rest of the heart in it. But where is this to be 
    found but in God? The creature is so uncertain, that there is not one moment 
    in which we may not either be taken from it, or it from us; so that a person 
    may rest as well on the top of a wheel, as on any creature. And turning 
    aside from God to it, is turning from the fountain to a cistern, which, in 
    that very moment when a person goes to drink out of it, may run dry.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They are utterly insufficient. It is not in them to 
    answer the cravings of the human heart, of an immortal soul. Hence it is 
    said, Isaiah 55:2, "Wherefore do you spend money for that which is not 
    bread, and your labor for that which satisfies not?"</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] There is no suitableness in them to the soul, for 
    they are not commensurate to the desires of it; God only is so, being an 
    infinite good. Wherefore, wherever you go to make your bed among them, you 
    will find it shorter than you can stretch yourself upon.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] They have no divine appointment for that end, 
    without which grass would be no more satisfying to the flocks than sand. God 
    has kept the satisfying of the soul to himself, as his peculiar 
    prerogative.—Therefore the turning aside to such emptiness can never make a 
    man happy.—Here, however, may be stated this</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION, What! does not every body know that there is a 
    goodness in the creature? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. But every body should likewise know that it is 
    uncertain and insufficient, and therefore not worth the turning aside to 
    from a good God. Besides, know this farther, that no creature can be to you 
    more than this God, from whom you turn aside, makes it to be. So you may get 
    it, and at the same time there may come a withering curse with it, that you 
    shall find no more sap in it than Haman in his riches, family honors, which, 
    by his own confession, availed him nothing, Esther. 5:13. Yes, your ruin may 
    rise from it, as Achan's from the golden wedge.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, For evincing the truth of this weighty point, 
    consider what a person turns aside from, when turning aside from God. He 
    turns from an upmaking portion; Psalm 73:25, "Whom have I in Heaven but you? 
    and there is none upon earth that I desire besides you." Cleave to the Lord, 
    turn not aside from him: for,</p>
<p align="justify">1. You are enriched for time: 1 Timothy 4:8, "Godliness 
    is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life that now is, 
    and of that which is to come." The everlasting covenant secures all that you 
    need. Your provision is sure: Psalm 37:3, "Trust in the Lord, and do good; 
    so shall you dwell in the land, and truly you shall be fed." Isaiah 33:16, 
    "He shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall be the munition of 
    rocks; bread shall be given him, his water shall be sure." You shall not 
    want lodging: Psalm 90:1, "Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all 
    generations." Fear not want of clothing: Matthew 6:30, "For if God so clothe 
    the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, 
    shall he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?" What want you 
    more, then? Why, some would have land also. Then cleave to Christ as your 
    Lord and Husband. He is Lord of all the land in the world; the earth shall 
    be your in the right of your Husband: Matthew 5:5, "Blessed are the meek, 
    for they shall inherit the earth." But what will a person do for money? Why, 
    cleave to the Lord: Job 22:24, 25, "Then shall you lay up gold as dust, and 
    the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. Yes, the Almighty shall be 
    your defense, and you shall have plenty of silver."—Here some may propose 
    this</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION, These are fine words, but what will they bring 
    into our mouth, or on our back, what will they bring into the coffers? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. They are God's words, and his words are better 
    than all the world's good deeds. Some to whom God has no special love, he 
    gives them their portion in their hand, and sets them off; others, who are 
    his dear children, he gives them the good words of a promise, and keeps them 
    at home with himself. Say now, which of these have the best of it? The 
    following words determine it: Matthew 25:34, "Then shall the King say unto 
    them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom 
    prepared for you from the foundation of the world." God approves not of 
    those men who say to the needy, Depart in peace, and be you warmed, and be 
    you filled; notwithstanding, they give them not those things which are 
    needful to the body," James 2:16. And will He himself treat his people so? 
    No, no. Many a saint has trusted to these words, when they had nothing else 
    to trust to, and they have all been made oat to them: Psalm 34:8, 9, "O 
    taste and see that the Lord is good! blessed is the man that trusts in him. 
    O fear the Lord, you his saints! for there is no want to them that fear 
    him." The unbeliever's mistake is, that God's bond cannot be paid, but in 
    giving the very thing itself. Even this is often done, but he also gives his 
    people more frequently what is as good. Moses, wanting meat forty days, had 
    no reason to complain, when God in those days took away his stomach, and 
    satisfied him otherwise than by meat. Adam lived well when the heavens were 
    the roof of his house, and God was his God. All the enjoyment of God still 
    will abundantly compensate the want of all these things.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Cleave unto the Lord, turn not aside from him, and 
    thus you are enriched for eternity, 1 Timothy 4:8, quoted above. Come death 
    when when it will, what then? you shall be carried where your happiness 
    shall be completed: John 14:2, "In my Father's house are many mansions; if 
    it were not so I would have told you: I go to prepare a place for you." The 
    law cannot debar you from this happiness, it is satisfied; justice has 
    nothing to say against you, for the debt is paid: God is your God; and the 
    tongue of men, nor of angels, cannot fully express this privilege.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, The truth of this weighty point in the text will 
    farther appear, by inspecting the pretended gain which is acquired by 
    turning aside from the Lord.—It may all be summed up in these two 
    particulars.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is nothing; Proverbs 23:5, (quoted above). All the 
    gain is but children's gain, which they have won off their fellows, of which 
    grown persons make no account; and as little will a spiritual heart account 
    of gain got by turning aside from the Lord. It is a poor trade where a 
    person is not gaining for his soul; and no person will gain for this by 
    turning aside from God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is worse than nothing. Whatever you think you gain 
    by turning aside from the Lord, a thousand times more is going to 
    destruction in the meantime. Count what you give out, as well as what you 
    get in, and you will soon see the gain worse than nothing: Matthew 16:26, 
    "For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his 
    own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"</p>
<p align="justify">From all which it is evident, that no man shall better 
    his condition, but ruin it, by turning aside from the Lord, let him turn to 
    whatever hand he will.—I now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To make some improvement of this subject, in an use 
    of information.—Hence,</p>
<p align="justify">1. You who have never yet turned to the Lord, but have 
    been going aside from him all your days, know, that you are yet in a ruinous 
    condition; there is nothing you can call yours, but what is vanity, and 
    cannot profit or deliver. You will not be persuaded of this; but remember it 
    is explicitly told you; and if grace do not open your eyes to see it timely, 
    death will open them to see it when it is out of time to mend the matter.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Backsliders, be all of you convinced of the foolish 
    choice you have made, repent, and turn again unto the Lord. What have you 
    gained by your departures from him? Where is the advantage of the sad 
    exchange? Blasted profits! short-lived pleasures! leaving a sting behind 
    them in the conscience these will not compensate for what you have lost.</p>
<p align="justify">3. You who have got near God in this ordinance, you may 
    see that it is your duty and interest, by a holy tender walk, a living by 
    faith, to hold where you are. If you step aside from God, you may well mar 
    your case, you will never mend it this way. Entertain no curiosity to be on 
    the other side of the hedge; satisfy yourselves that there is nothing there 
    but vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain: Isaiah 
    30:7, "For the Egyptian shall help in vain, and to no purpose; therefore 
    have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Disappointed communicants may hence be satisfied, that 
    if you love your own souls, it is not for your profit to go aside to another 
    door, to get your loss at the door of God's house made up another way. Your 
    case, it is likely, is sad, and Satan will strike in with the occasion to 
    make you a fair offer. But know of a truth, if you embrace it, instead of 
    mending your condition, you shall make your sad case yet sadder. Be 
    peremptory in your resolutions that you will wait upon the Lord, and not 
    give over, how long soever you be without sensible success: Genesis 32:26, 
    "And the angel said to Jacob, Let me go, for the day breaks; and he said, I 
    will not let you go, except you bless me." Go you, and do likewise.</p>
<p align="justify">5. You carnal ones, who are weary of waiting about the 
    Lord's hand, and are longing to be back to the world as your element, saying 
    in your heart, "When will the Sabbath be over?" You may see the propriety of 
    checking these carnal motions: stir up yourselves to seek the Lord, and to 
    improve the present opportunity for making a happy settlement for your 
    souls; otherwise, if you miss such an occasion of mending your condition, 
    you know not if ever you shall have it again: and by neglecting it, you run 
    towards the ruining of your souls.</p>
<p align="justify">Let all be exhorted to cleave to the Lord, and tremble at 
    the thought of turning aside from him. Be exhorted, with purpose of heart to 
    cleave unto the Lord, Acts 11:23. Turn not aside from his precious truths, 
    his holy ordinances, the way of holiness and tenderness in the whole of your 
    conversation; but cleave to the Lord, his word, his way, and to whatever 
    bears his stamp. Turn not aside, whatever may be the temptation or 
    allurement. Know of a truth, that it is but poison presented in a golden cup 
    to you, which will work the ruin of your condition; it is but a gilded 
    vanity, to cheat you to cut off a substantial good: it is what will not fail 
    to be bitterness in the end. Have your eyes in your head, then, and forfeit 
    not God's favor or smiles for lying vanities.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, turn not aside, whatever be the hazard of holding 
    on. Let devils and men run that as high as they will, as sure as God's word 
    is truth, the greatest hazard is ever on the other side; and they who turn 
    aside run the most fearful risk.—Wherefore, take it home with you, lay it up 
    in your hearts, and improve it in your daily walk; decide all your 
    controversies with temptation, managed by a subtle devil, a carnal heart, or 
    the men of the world, by this,—That you cannot turn aside, but "after vain 
    things, which cannot profit, nor deliver, for they are vain." Amen.</p>
