          Isaiah 61:1, "The Lord has anointed me to preach good tidings to the
          meek."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IN these and the following words, we have represented the great, the
          important work for which Jeans was appointed, and to which he was
          specially called by his heavenly Father,—work for which he was
          completely qualified, by the Spirit of the Lord God being upon him. We
          propose to consider the several parts of this work, in that order in
          which they are set before us; and accordingly begin with that part,
          his having "to preach good tidings to the meek."—In which words we
          have,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The work itself in which the Son of God was employed, and to which
          he was called: "To preach good tidings." He was a minister by office;
          Romans 15:8, "Now I say, that Jesus Christ was a minister of the
          circumcision, for the truth of God, to confirm the promises of God
          made to the fathers;" the great minister of the gospel. He was the
          best among men; he brought good tidings, the best of tidings; by these
          tidings is meant the gospel, Luke 4:18. This is the good news, the
          tidings of peace and salvation, which Jesus brought from Heaven to
          earth.—We have,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The special object of this part of the work, "the meek." The word
          signifies, such as are meek, humble, and submissive, being made so by
          poverty and affliction. In the parallel place, it reads poor, and the
          one explains the other. If it is inquired, what poor ones are meant? I
          think it is plain, it is not those who are mean in the world, but poor
          in spirit, for these poor ones are meek. These meek ones are classed
          with the broken-hearted, and both distinguished from the captives and
          prisoners, by the original accentuation. So that by the meek here is
          meant, the poor in spirit, those who, as being convinced by the law,
          have seen themselves to be poor, that they have nothing in which they
          could stand before God as righteous, but look on themselves as
          wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked, Revelation
          3:17. And it is remarkable, that our Savior's sermon on the mount
          begins with good tidings to such persons: Matthew 5:3, "Blessed are
          the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But here there occurs a question: Was Christ to preach the good
          tidings of the gospel to none but these? To this I answer, The gospel
          was in itself good tidings unto all: Luke 2:10, "And the angel said
          onto them, Fear not, for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy,
          which shall be to all people." Our Lord preached to all who heard him
          promiscuously these good tidings, but in effect they were not good to
          any but to the poor in spirit among them. None but these could relish
          the goodness of them; to others they were tasteless, but to the poor
          in spirit, they sunk like a refreshing oil into their bones.—From
          these words I take the following
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE, That as the tidings of the gospel will indeed be good and
          welcome tidings to those who are meek, and poor in spirit, so Jesus
          is, by his heavenly Father, employed on the great work of preaching
          the good tidings of the gospel to sinners, especially to such who are
          meek, and spiritually poor in their own eyes.—In handling this
          doctrine we propose,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To consider this meekness and poverty, and show who are these meek
          poor ones.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To explain the good tidings of the gospel, and, as we go along,
          show that they are good and welcome tidings to such persona.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Show how this great work of preaching is, and has been performed
          by Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">IV. Give the reasons of the doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          V. Make some practical improvement of the whole.—We are then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. To consider this meekness and poverty, and show who are these meek
          poor ones.—As to this, we observe, that this meekness comprehends in
          it,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. A pressing scene of utter emptiness in one's self: Romans 8:18,
          "For I know that in me (that is in my flesh) dwells no good thing." A
          poor man going abroad, sees this and the other thing, in the houses of
          the rich; but when he comes home, he sees none of them there. Thus,
          the meek poor soul looks through himself, and there, in himself, he
          sees nothing but emptiness of all goodness, no holiness, wisdom, nor
          strength. The heart, which should be the garden of the Lord, appears
          as a wild waste. He is ready to cry out, O barren, dry, sapless heart
          and nature of mine! Agur looks for knowledge, and he says, Proverbs
          30:2, 3, "Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the
          understanding of a man. I neither learned wisdom, nor have the
          knowledge of the holy." The prodigal looks to his provisions, and
          says, "How many hired servants of my father have bread enough, and to
          spare, and I perish with hunger?" Paul reckons up his whole self, and
          the sum total is nothing: 2 Corinthians 12:11, "For in nothing am I
          behind the very chief apostles, though I be nothing."—This meekness
          comprehends,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. A pressing sense of sinfulness: Romans 7:14, "We know that the law
          is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin." He looks to the whole
          of himself, and he sees nothing on him but rags; a sinful nature, a
          corrupt heart, unclean lusts, and an unholy life. He must rank his
          righteousness with his unrighteousness, his duties with his sins, for
          he is defiled with them all: Isaiah 64:6, "But we are all as an
          unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags, and we
          all do fade as a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken
          us away." These meek poor ones see themselves the very picture of rank
          poverty, having only filthy rags, death painted on their face by want,
          and overgrown by the vermin of filthy lusts. They see themselves not
          only nothing, but worse than nothing, while they look over these
          frightful accounts of the debt of sin, which stand against them, and
          for which they have nothing to pay.—This meekness comprehends,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. A pressing sense of misery by sin. Like the prodigal, they see
          themselves ready to perish with hunger. Debt is a heavy burden to an
          honest heart, and filthiness to one that desires to be clean: Romans
          7:24, "O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of
          this death?" They look about them, and see themselves in a cloud of
          miseries, arising from their sins. Their poverty presseth them down.
          They are obliged to do many things which otherwise they would not, and
          cannot attain to other things which they desire to arrive at: Romans
          7:19, "For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would
          not, that I do." It separates them from that communion with God which
          they would otherwise enjoy, makes them sit within, mourning without
          the sun, when otherwise they might walk abroad in the light of the
          Lord's countenance. This presseth their souls to the dust.—It
          comprehends,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. A sense of utter inability to help one's self: 2 Corinthians 3:5,
          "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of
          ourselves." They see themselves in the mire, but unable to help
          themselves out; therefore these poor men cry unto the Lord: Psalm
          34:6. They see an emptiness and weakness in all their external
          privileges, their gifts, duties, yes, their graces, to save and help
          them. They count all things but loss for Christ, and wish to be found
          in Christ, not having on their own righteousness, which is of the law.
          They find the sting in their conscience, but cannot draw it out; guilt
          is a burden, but they cannot throw it off; lusts are strong and
          uneasy, but they are not able to master them; and this presses them
          sore.—This meekness comprehends,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. A sense of the absolute need of a Savior, and of help from Heaven:
          2 Corinthians 3:5, "But our sufficiency is of God." The pride of the
          spirit is beat down, they lie down at the Lord's feet, saying,
          (Jeremiah 31:18,) "You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a
          bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: tarn you me, and I shall be turned,
          for you are the Lord my God." They see they will be ruined if their
          help come not from above. Their case appears desperate to all
          remedies, but those which are under the management of an eternal
          omnipotent hand. They say to their souls, as the king of Israel said
          to the woman in the time of famine, "If the Lord do not help you,
          whence shall I help thee?"—It comprehends,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. A sense as to utter unworthiness of the Lord's help; they see
          nothing which they have to recommend them to the Lord's help. They
          dare not stand upon worth, like those proud beggars, who value
          themselves, on what they have been or done. Like the centurion, they
          say, "Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof." Hence
          there is a word put in for them, Isaiah 55:1, "Ho! every one that
          thirsts, come you to the water, and he who has no money, come you, buy
          and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk, without money and without
          price." They own the Lord would be just, if he should never grant his
          mercy and grace to them, but exclude them forever from his presence;
          Jeremiah 3:22, "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed,
          because his compassions fail not." They see a loathsomeness in the
          best things about them, in their reformation, mourning, their desires
          of Christ, wrestling, and prayers for mercy; so that they conclude, if
          ever he notice them, it must be altogether for his own name's
          sake.—This meekness comprehends,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. An earnest desire as to the supply of soul-wants: Matthew 5:6,
          "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for
          they shall be filled." A greedy man, we say, is always poor, because
          natural poverty consists rather in the desire of what we want, than in
          the want itself. There are many who want spiritual good things, yet
          are not poor in Spirit, because they are not pained with the want of
          them. But the poor in spirit are pained with the want of spiritual
          good things. They pant for them, Psalm 42:1; long for them, thirst for
          them, Psalm 63:1. Hence we read of the expectation of the poor, which
          shall not perish forever, Psalm 9:18.—It comprehends,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, A hearty contentment in submitting to any method of help which
          the Lord will prescribe: Acts 9:7, "Lord, what will you have me to
          do?" Beggars must not be choosers; these meek poor ones are content
          with Christ on any terms, while others stand contending about them.
          Necessity has no law, and hunger will break through stone walls.
          Whoever are thus situated, will be for a Savior, a righteousness, and
          holiness, at any rate. They are content to be taught, content to be
          managed: Psalm 25:9, "The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek
          will he teach his way." They are content to part with all, for the
          enriching pearl of great price.—We are now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To explain the good tidings of the gospel, and, as we go along,
          show that they are good and welcome tidings to such persons.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The poor in spirit are wounded by the law: the gospel brings a healing
          medicine to these wounds. It suits their case fully, and declares to
          them the good news of a salve for all their sores. Solomon tells us,
          Proverbs 25:25, "As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news
          from a far country." Applicable this to nothing so much as the good
          tidings brought us from Heaven in the gospel. I cannot enumerate all
          the articles of these good tidings, but shall take notice of the
          following—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The gospel-tidings are tidings of a complete salvation. And are not
          these good tidings? Luke 2:11, "For unto us is born a Savior, who is
          Christ the Lord." O! lost sinners, there is a salvation purchased for
          you, a great, a complete salvation, a salvation from sin, Matthew
          1:21, and from the wrath of God, John 3:16. It is offered to you, and
          offered freely, though it was dear bought; it is offered without money
          and without price, Isaiah 55:1. If you ask what you shall do to be
          saved?—Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved. Though
          you are lost, though you have destroyed yourselves, yet here is help
          for you. Though you are insensible sinners, the tidings are to you; it
          will in particular be good and welcome tidings to the meek poor ones,
          who see their lost and undone condition. A Savior will be as welcome a
          sight to them, as a rope cast out from the shore will be to a drowning
          man. They will eagerly embrace the Savior and his salvation: Song 1:3,
          "Because of the savor of your good ointments, your name is as ointment
          poured forth: therefore do the virgins love thee."—These tidings
          relate,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. To a redemption, to a ransom paid: Galatians 3:13, "Christ has
          redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us." Sin
          and Satan made war upon the world, and overcame them all in Adam; so
          that by nature we are captives and Blares. No more God's free men, nor
          our own men, but slaves; and the rattling of the chains of divers
          lusts upon us are evidences of it. But good tidings, O captives! the
          King's Son, out of his princely bounty, has purchased for you
          redemption, he has paid a complete ransom, even his own blood: and
          whoever will, may come to him. your freedom is bought; come, take the
          benefit of it, by following him out of the land of your captivity;
          Zechariah 9:11, 12, "As for you also, by the blood of your covenant, I
          have sent forth your prisoners of the pit wherein there is no water;
          turn you to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope." But what avails
          this to those who account it a kind captivity, who love their master,
          and his drudgery work? they will not come to Jesus. But never were the
          tidings of a ransom so welcome to a slave in Turkey, as these were to
          meek poor ones, who are groaning under their bondage, and breathing
          for the liberty of the sons of God.—These tidings relate,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. To an indemnity, a pardon to criminals who will some to Jesus: Acts
          13:38, 39, "Be it known unto you, therefore, men and brethren, that
          through this man is preached onto you the forgiveness of sins; and by
          him all that believe are justified from all things, from which you
          could not be justified by the law of Moses." The world of mankind,
          God's natural subjects, have joined his grand enemy, and risen up in
          rebellion against their sovereign Lord. The law has proclaimed us all
          traitors, justice demands vengeance on the criminals, and we cannot
          escape by flight or by might. But good tidings, O criminals! the
          glorious Mediator has got an act of grace, of indemnity and pardon,
          passed in the court of Heaven, in favor of a ruined world, bearing,
          that whoever will in, and lay down their arms, shall have a full and
          free pardon, written, for the better security, in the blood of the
          Mediator. It is proclaimed to you, Isaiah 55:7, "Let the wicked
          forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him
          return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God
          for be will abundantly pardon." In this indemnity, there are no
          exceptions: Isaiah 1:18, "Come now, let us reason together, says the
          Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
          though they be red as crimson, they shall be as wool." Now, whatever
          this be to others, it will be welcome tidings to the meek poor ones,
          whose consciences are galled with the sting of sin, bowing down under
          a sense of guilt. Never was a pardon more welcome to a malefactor on
          the scaffold, than this will be to them: Isaiah 33:24, "And the
          inhabitants shall not say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein
          shall be forgiven their iniquities."—These tidings relate,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. To a glorious physician of souls, who never misses to cure his
          patients: Matthew 9:12, 13, "They that be whole need not a physician,
          but they that are sick. I am not come to call the righteous, but
          sinners to repentance." That forbidden fruit which was eaten by our
          first parents, has entailed dreadful diseases on all their posterity;
          so that this world is no better than an hospital, where there is not
          one sound person; and the sickness is unto death. But good tidings, O
          sin-sick soul! There is a glorious physician come from Heaven, who
          will cure all who will come to be cured by him. He cures in fallibly,
          his blood cleanses from all sin. He cures freely: Hosea 14:4, "I will
          heal their backsliding, I will love them freely. "He rejects no
          patients: John 6:37, "Him that comes unto me, I will in no wise cast
          out." The medicine of his blood and Spirit removes all diseases. What
          is your disease? It is a stony heart? He takes it away and gives an
          heart of flesh. Is it blindness, deafness, dumbness, lameness? He
          makes the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, and the
          lame to walk. Is it the falling evil of backsliding? the consumption
          or decay of grace? the running issue of predominant lusts? the fever
          of raging lusts? the universal leprosy of the corruption of nature?
          All these he can cure, for. he heals all manner of diseases. They who
          see not their diseases, will indeed slight him; but it will be good
          tidings to the meek poor ones, who are groaning under their diseases.
          O! then will such an one say, I will take my stony heart to him, my
          blindness to him, etc.—These tidings are the tidings,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Of a feast: Isaiah 25:6, "And in this mountain shall the Lord of
          hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on
          the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees, well
          refined." Since man has left God, he has had nothing to feed upon, but
          the dust with the serpent, or the husks of created things with the
          swine. He has never been satisfied, be never could get enough; still
          red hunger has been upon him, like those who eat but are not
          satisfied. But good tidings, O famished sinners! our Lord Jesus Christ
          has made a feast for hunger-bitten sinners, and they are all invited
          to it: Isaiah 55:2, "Hearken diligently unto me, and eat you that
          which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness." It is the
          best of feasts, where the soul may feed to the full. Jesus himself is
          the maker, and also the matter of it; all the benefits of the covenant
          are the provision which are served up at this feast, he who eats
          thereof shall never die. It is true, that most men put no value upon
          it: Proverbs 27:7, "The full soul loathes an honey-comb." But, Psalm
          22:26, "The meek shall eat and be satisfied." It will be good tidings
          to hungry souls, who are sick of the dust and of husks, and are
          longing to eat bread in their Father's house, where there is plenty
          and to spare.—These tidings relate,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. To a treasure: 2 Corinthians 4:7, "But we have this treasure in
          earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and
          not of us." Man was broken by his fall, he lost all his goods, and all
          his credit in Heaven; so that absolute poverty reigns among Adam's
          sons, who have neither in them nor on them for the present necessity,
          and besides are drowned in debt to the justice of God. But good
          tidings, poor sinners! There is a treasure hidden in the field of the
          gospel, which will enrich you; and by the gospel you are pointed to
          it. O buy the field; Matthew 13:44. In this field are the most
          precious things, precious promises, and within them precious Christ,
          with all his merits; gold tried in the fire, white clothing and
          eye-salve, Revelation 3:18. Here is variety of all good things, and
          abundance. They who are rich in their own eyes will not value this
          treasure; but to the meek poor ones it will be glad tidings. They will
          readily do as the man, Matthew 13:14, who sold all that he had, and
          bought the field in which the great treasure was hid.—These tidings
          relate,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. To a marriage, a most happy match for poor sinners: Hosea 2:19, 20,
          "And I will betroth you unto me forever; yes, I will betroth you unto
          me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in
          mercies; I will even betroth you unto me in faithfulness, and you
          shall know the Lord." The Bridegroom is the Royal Mediator, who is
          content to match with poor captive souls. We are naturally of the
          house of Hell: John 8:44, "You are of your father the devil, and the
          lusts of your father you will do." This being our case, we could have
          no hopes of being comfortably disposed of. But good tidings, O
          children of the devil's family! you may be married to the Son of God,
          who for that end has taken on our nature; he says, Matthew 22:4, "All
          things are ready; come unto the marriage." This match is the most
          honorable, the richest, the happiest of which we are capable. There is
          nothing to hinder the match, he will make you lovely; and, what is
          more, he will make you willing. Most men despise this marriage, they
          prefer their farms and merchandise to it. But the poor meek ones will
          as gladly embrace it, as ever a captive woman, to save her life, would
          match with the most desirable conqueror.—These tidings relate,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. To a victory, a glorious victory: Isaiah 25:8, "He will swallow up
          death in victory; and the Lord will wipe away tears from all eyes."
          There is no getting to the heavenly Canaan, without fighting our
          enemies; which would, if possible, keep us out there. We are not able
          for them; sin, Satan, and death are too strong for us. But, good
          tidings! Christ has fought that battle, and obtained a glorious
          victory; he offers you a share of the victory and spoils; Revelation
          3:21, "To him that overcomes, will I grant to sit with me in my
          throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his
          throne." Join the conqueror, come up at his back against your
          spiritual enemies, and you shall be more than conquerors through him
          that loved us, Romans 8:37. They who have not yet broke their covenant
          with death, and agreement with Hell, will slight this victory. but it
          will be good tidings to the meek poor ones, who would gladly break
          through the host of their spiritual enemies, but know not how to make
          it out. These tidings relate,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, To a peace, a most desirable peace: Ephesians 2:14, "For he
          (Christ Jeans) is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken
          down the middle wall of partition between us." Sin made discord, and
          broke the peace between Heaven and earth; so that God and the sinner
          became enemies. All access to God, all communication between Heaven
          and earth was blocked up. But good tidings! Christ has made peace by
          his own blood. It is offered to you, Isaiah 27:4, 5, "Fury is not in
          me; let him take of my strength, that he may make peace with me, and
          he shall make peace with me." It is a firm peace, on the most solid
          foundation, a lasting peace which will never terminate, a peace which
          will before long be complete in all its parts; peace external,
          internal, eternal.—This will be good tidings to the meek poor ones,
          who are wounded with the apprehensions of God's anger, and affrighted
          with the thoughts of his wrath.—We are, then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To show how this work of preaching is and has been performed by
          Jesus Christ. As to this, we observe, that he performed it under the
          Old Testament, and under the New Testament dispensation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, He performed this work under the Old Testament dispensation.
          Under this dispensation,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The first proclamation of these tidings was done personally by
          himself in paradise, to the compendized world, our first parents:
          Genesis 3:15, "And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and
          between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you
          shall bruise his heel." The Son of God, appearing in human shape, as a
          prelude of his incarnation, sat as their Judge, and as the first
          interpreter of his Father's mind, preached the first gospel to them in
          that promise, which contains the substance and abridgement of the
          whole gospel. He was absolutely the first, in all respects, who
          preached the good tidings of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The second proclamation was by his ambassadors in his name, who
          were of two sorts—Extraordinary; namely, the prophets whom he inspired
          infallibly to teach the people: 2 Peter 1:21, "For the prophecy came
          not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they
          were moved by the Holy Ghost."—And ordinary teachers, such as priests
          and Levites under the law, priests and others before the law. And in
          respect of this preaching by men in his name, he is said to have
          preached to those who lived before the flood: 1 Peter 3:19, "By which
          also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison." There was also
          a proclamation,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. By his written word, Deuteronomy 30:11–14. This is his own word,
          where the meek poor ones may always find the glad tidings of
          salvation. Before it was written, they never wanted inspired men, and
          when it was written, though for a time they might want prophets, yet
          this they had always from him as an infallible rule.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, He preached and preaches under the New Testament dispensation.
          This he did,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. By his own personal preaching in the days of his flesh, when he
          went about among the Jews, preaching to them as the Minister of the
          circumcision: Romans 15:8, "Now I say, that Jesus Christ was a
          minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the
          promises made unto the fathers." So that he himself, by himself, did
          begin this dispensation. The gospel at the first began to be spoken by
          the Lord, Hebrews 2:3, "He spoke as never man spoke, and taught as one
          having authority." He did it,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. By inspiring his apostles to preach and write the doctrines of
          salvation, contained in the New Testament, on whom he poured out his
          spirit, and by their writings, they being dead, yet speak to us from
          him and by him. He does it,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. By raising up and continuing always a gospel-ministry in the
          church: Ephesians 4:11–13, "And he gave some, apostles; and some,
          prophets; and evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the
          perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
          edifying of the body of Christ: until we all come to the unity of the
          faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man,
          unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." And with
          them he has promised to be present always, even unto the end of the
          world; Matthew 28:20. These preach in his name, as deputed by him to
          declare these good tidings.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus you see this work is performed by the Son of God, not only by
          himself, but by his servants in his name. And though the mistakes,
          errors, and unfaithfulness of ordinary ministers, both under the Old
          and New Testament, are solely their own, their preaching of the true
          doctrine of the gospel is indeed his; they are but as it were the
          voice, he is the speaker. For, he gave and gives the gifts whereby
          they are fitted to preach the gospel. All their candles are lighted at
          his shining lamp: John 1:9, "That was the true light, which lights
          every one that comes into the world." Their wisdom and knowledge in
          divine mysteries is given them by him, for the good of his church,
          Ephesians 4:8. Their commission is from him, and from him they derive
          their power and authority, Matthew 28:19, 20. They are his ministers
          and servants, sent out upon his work, and to him they must give an
          account. Lastly, The efficacy of their ministry is solely owing to him
          and his Spirit, 1 Corinthians 3:7, "So then, neither is he who plants
          anything, neither he who waters; but God that gives the increase." He
          makes it effectual to his elect ones.—We are,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. To give the reasons of the doctrine, or show, that none but he was
          fit to he employed in this work. This will appear if we consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That none but he could reveal the secrets of love, which were
          hidden from eternity in the breast of God: John 1:18, "No man has seen
          God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the
          Father, he has declared him." Neither man nor angel could open up
          these. But he was privy to his Father's counsels, as being in the
          bosom of the Father from all eternity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. None but he was fit to be a universal preacher to all persons for
          whom these tidings were designed, and to whom they were to be carried,
          and this in all ages. Who else could have the great charge of this
          weighty business? This required one of infinite wisdom, and one
          everywhere present.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Whose testimony but his could be a sufficient ground of faith
          in this, of all matters the most important? Here lies the weight of
          God's honor, and the salvation of an elect world; and this required no
          less solid a bottom than the testimony of truth itself.
        </p>

        <p align="justify"><b>SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</b></p>
        <p align="justify">
          HAVING gone through the doctrinal part of this subject, by offering
          what was intended on the several heads of method which we laid down,
          we shall now, as was proposed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. Make some practical improvement; and this in uses of information,
          trial, and exhortation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We are, in the first place, to improve this subject in a use of
          information.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Hence you may learn what is the great cause of slighting the
          gospel, of that cold entertainment which it gets among most of its
          hearers, that little relish which there is for the great truths of the
          gospel; why so few do comply with the gracious calls which it affords.
          People may attribute this to what causes they will, but the true cause
          is the want of this meekness and poverty of spirit. Instead of this,
          there are pride and self-conceit, unsubdued and unmortified. I may
          branch these out into several particulars, as opposed to this
          meekness. There is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) No due sense of spiritual wants: Proverbs 27:7, "The full soul
          loathes the honey-comb." Most men are sick of a Laodicean disease,
          saying in their practice as they said in their hearts, that "they are
          rich and increased in goods, and stand in need of nothing," Revelation
          3:17. They are not mourning under their want of light, of life, and of
          holiness. They reign as kings with what they have, though, as with
          King Saul, God is departed from them. Hence they do not value that
          treasure which is hidden in the field of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Men have no true sight and sense of their own sinfulness. They
          see not the sinfulness of their nature, of their hearts, lips, and
          lives, but are like Samson, without his two eyes: Matthew 9:12, "They
          that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick." They are
          pining away in their sins; their sickness has not yet taken them by
          the heart; their wounds are not lanced; the law has not had its effect
          upon them, and therefore the gospel is not relished.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Their eyes are veiled, so that they see not their misery by sin,
          and as being without Christ: Hosea 7:9, "Strangers have devoured his
          strength, and he knows it not; yes, gray hairs are here and there upon
          him, yet he knows not; and they do not return to the Lord their God,
          nor seek him for all this." Did they see the clouds of wrath which are
          hanging above their heads, the quick approaches which death with its
          sting is making towards them, their separation from God, and from all
          the privileges of the covenant, they could not be at ease. The
          gospel-tidings would be to them as life from the dead.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) They are strangers to their utter inability to help themselves.
          They are like Samson, in another case, who knew not that his strength
          was departed from him. We may see how corrupt nature changes itself
          into various shapes on this point. If you urge men to ply the work of
          their salvation, Alas! say they, we can do nothing; they thus make it
          a covert for their sloth. Urge them with the necessity of reformation
          and repentance, they say, It is time enough, they will attend to this
          afterwards; as if it were in the power of their hand to do this
          business at any time: they thus make it a covert for their delays, and
          still have no relish for the gospel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (5.) They do not feel their need of Christ: Revelation 3:17, "They
          need his blood and Spirit, but they are not duly sensible of their
          need." Their own works are big in their own eyes, and appear to them
          sufficient in order to obtain God's favor. Their natural and acquired
          abilities are also with them sufficient in order to their
          sanctification; they are by no means shaken out of themselves;
          therefore the offer of the gospel is but an offer of food to the full
          soul, and so is loathed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (6.) They see not their own unworthiness of a Savior's help; they come
          to the market of grace with their money in their hand. They look on
          themselves as worthy of what Christ should do for them, Luke 7:4.
          Though they be perhaps so far humbled as to see they must have mercy
          and help from the Lord, yet they look on their reformation and duties
          as what cannot but recommend them to Christ beyond many others. They
          cannot see how the Lord can reject those who come so far a length as
          they do. Hence the doctrine of free grace is but tasteless to them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (7.) They have no anxiety for the supply of their soul-wants. They
          want grace and holiness, but they can be easy without them. Like
          foolish virgins, they sleep on at ease, while they have no oil for
          their lamps: Proverbs 6:10, "Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a
          little folding of the hands to sleep." Their desires are keen after
          the world, but weak, faint, and languishing after spiritual good
          things. They have no hunger and thirst after them. Hence they value
          not the gospel, nor the fountain of living waters.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (8.) They are not content with Christ but on terms of their own
          making. They are like those who seek to buy a commodity which yet they
          can be without. If they can get it at their own price, they will take
          it; if not, they can want it. There are right-eye sins, yet they will
          by no means part with them. They are not pleased with the covenant,
          some things are in it which they must have out; there are some things
          out which they must have in, else they will not come into it. Hence
          they care not for the gospel, or that covenant which it reveals.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Hence learn, that slight the gospel-call who will, the meek, the
          poor in spirit will gladly receive it. They who are shaken out of
          themselves by the law, will be glad to creep under that shelter which
          is held forth in the gospel. These souls will feast sweetly on what is
          tasteless to others, what others tread under feet and despise. The
          hungry are glad of that for which the full soul has no appetite; and
          just it is in this case.—This subject informs us,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Of the dignity and honor of the work of the ministry. With Paul, we
          would not be ashamed to magnify that office which is conversant about
          those things which are most necessary for the world, which bring the
          highest honor to God, and the greatest good to mankind. It is true, it
          is often a despised office in the world; but wisdom is justified of
          her children. God had but one Son, and he made him a minister, a
          preacher of the gospel. He is the chief shepherd and bishop of souls,
          and therefore the office of the ministry will be esteemed by all those
          who have a true esteem for Christ. It informs us,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Of that good-will which the Father and the Son jointly bear to
          sinners; since the Father put his own Son into this work, and the Son
          readily engaged in it. Do they not by this say, "Why will you die?" It
          was good-will to men in its utmost height, that ever such tidings were
          to be carried, and that ever such a messenger was employed. It informs
          us,

        <p align="justify">
          5. How acceptable meekness and poverty of spirit are unto the Lord,
          who has put a peculiar article in Christ's commission for such. As to
          others, he is to humble and bring them down; as to these, he is to
          refresh and revive them with good news. It informs us,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. As to the goodness and weight of the good tidings of the gospel,
          which are brought to us by such a hand. Surely the weight of the
          matter must be great, when such a messenger was sent to publish it. We
          are informed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. As to the danger of slighting these tidings, though men be employed
          in carrying them; for they speak in the name of the great Messenger,
          preach in the name, and by the authority of, the great preacher. So he
          who "despises them, despises him that sent them:" Hebrews 2:3, "How
          shall they escape, if they neglect so great salvation?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">This subject may be improved,</p>
        <p align="justify">Secondly, In an use of trial.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          Hereby we may try whether we be meek and poor or not. What relish have
          we for gospel truths? The meek, the poor in spirit, (and such all must
          be who are true Christians), have a singular relish for the word of
          the gospel. It tastes to them very differently from what it does to
          any in the world besides. Job says, "I have esteemed the words of his
          mouth more than my necessary food," chapter 23:12. David says, "They
          are more to be desired than gold, yes, than much fine gold; sweeter
          also than honey, and the honey-comb;" Psalm 19:10.—For,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. They are admitted to partake of the kernel of the word, while
          others break their teeth on the shell. It comes to them as it did to
          the Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians 1:5, "Not in word only, but also in
          power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance." It has not been
          a dry channel to them, or a dead letter, but the ministration of the
          Spirit. Therefore the apostle says, 1 Peter 2:2, 3, "As new-born
          babes, desire you the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow
          thereby; if so be that you have tasted that the Lord is gracious." And
          this first taste of it leaves a relish behind it: the drawing by of
          the veil has discovered the treasure in the earthen vessels.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is their food, food proper, and suitable to their new nature:
          Deut 32:47, "For it is not a vain thing for you, because it is your
          life." All living creatures have their proper food; thus one relishes
          and delights in that which another does not desire. The new creature
          is nourished by the sincere milk of the word, 1 Peter 2:2. This is
          natural to them, for the saints have had their life by it, they are
          born again by the incorruptible seed of the Word of God, 1 Peter 1:23.
          Thus the saints have a peculiar relish for the Word of God, while
          others do not regard it; more than the dog does the hay, which, though
          the ox feeds sweetly on it, yet it is not agreeable to the dog.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, All their hopes are in it; it is all their salvation, and all
          their desire; 2 Samuel 23:5; take this from them, and what have they
          more? Hence they are content to part with all to buy this field;
          Matthew 13:44, and to part with life itself rather than the gospel,
          Mark 8:35.—What wonder is it that a landed man should have delight in
          reading his charter, the pardoned criminal in reading the king's
          pardon, which another has not? As natural is it that the Christian
          should have a delight peculiar to himself in reading and hearing the
          gospel. Here occurs a
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          QUESTION, Since hypocrites may have a relish of the good tidings of
          the gospel, how shall I distinguish between their relish and the
          relish of a sincere Christian, who is meek and poor in spirit?—To this
          I
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER, Hypocrites may have some desire, and wait upon public
          ordinances; Isaiah 58:2. Like the stony-ground hearers, they may
          receive the word joyfully, Matthew 13:20; but yet there are great
          differences between their desires and those of a sincere
          Christian.—Such as,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The sincere Christian relishes the good tidings of the gospel as
          good, yes, as the best for him, so as that he can lay the weight of
          his salvation, for time and eternity, upon this word, and choose it
          for his portion; Psalm 119:111; whereas the hypocrite may relish them
          as good, but not as the best for him; so that, for all the relish he
          has of this word, he has another thing which he looks on as still
          better for him. He has something else on which he is disposed to lay
          at least part of his weight before the Lord; for he is never poor in
          spirit, nor shaken out of his own righteousness. But the Christian has
          no confidence in the flesh; Philippians 3:3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The Christian gets his relish for the gospel, by seeing the extreme
          bitterness of sin; Acts 2:37, "When they heard this they were pricked
          to the heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, Men
          and brethren, what shall we do?" But the hypocrite comes easier by
          his; "When he hears the word, he anon with joy receives it," Matthew
          13:20. No man can relish health at the rate one does who is brought
          back from the gates of death. Many relish the sweetness of the word to
          whom sin was never made bitter; or if it was, it was never the
          bitterest of all things. Hence the relish for such is very
          superficial. But God puts in more and more bitterness in sin to his
          own people, until it becomes of all bitters the bitterest; and then
          they truly relish the good tidings of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The Christian's relish for the gospel is the most powerful and
          overcoming relish which he has. The hypocrite's is not so; Psalm 27:4,
          "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I
          may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold
          the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple." So says the
          Christian, but of the hypocrite it is said, Ezekiel 33:31, "They come
          unto you as the people comes, and they sit before you as my people,
          and they hear your words, but they will not do them; for with their
          month they show much love, but their heart goes after their
          covetousness." The sincere Christian chooses Christ peremptorily, if
          they should beg with him. They see such a suitableness in him to their
          case, that they must have him on any terms; whereas the hypocrite gets
          only half a look of Christ in the gospel. Hence he has only half
          affection for him, a kind of hankering after him. Christ is sweet to
          them, but still someone lust is sweeter; so that, like Orpah, they
          leave him, but not without some affection for him. But the
          Christian-like Ruth cleaves unto him, and thereby is brought to honor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, The Christian relishes all the tidings of the gospel in every
          particular of them, whereas the hypocrite has always something in them
          which he does not approve of. The Christian without shame has respect
          to all God's commandments, Psalm 119:6. He relishes the goodness of
          the promises, and also the holiness of the commandments. "He esteems
          all God's precepts concerning all things to be right," verse 128.
          Herod heard John gladly until his beloved lust was touched. And so do
          many, they love the word, with the exception of that which strikes
          against their beloved lusts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">This subject may be improved,</p>
        <p align="justify">Thirdly, In an use of exhortation.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          As ever you would relish the good tidings of the gospel, labor to be
          meek and poor in spirit. Would you have your souls refreshed at
          ordinances? Would you partake of the goodness of our Lord's house, and
          find that in ordinances, which is the hidden manna, which the carnal
          world knows not of? Well, take this course; it is the way to prepare
          yourselves for it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Keep up always a deep sense of your own sinfulness, wretchedness,
          and absolute need of Christ. Our Lord was called the friend of
          publicans and sinners, because they who saw the least good in
          themselves got most of his converse; 1 Peter 5:5, "God resists the
          proud, and gives grace to the humble." The low valleys have the waters
          running in them, when they run off the high hills as fast as they come
          on; Isaiah 40:4, "Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain
          and hill shall be made low." The man who feels his disease prizes the
          remedy, while he who is raving and insensible disregards it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Be of a teachable disposition; this is true meekness; Psalm 25:9,
          "The meek will he teach his way." They who sit down to judge the word,
          rather than to be judged by it, may meet with what may disgust or
          please their fancy, but are out of the way of the true spiritual
          relish for the word; James, 1:21, "Wherefore, lay apart all filthiness
          and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the
          engrafted word, which is able to save our souls." How many a week
          Christian's soul is refreshed with that word, in which men who have
          knowledge, but not grace, find nothing. They will be sure to profit
          who lie down at the Lord's feet, to learn and receive the word as the
          Word of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Be much in reviewing and mourning over your spiritual wants. Look
          not so much to what you have attained, as to what you are yet short
          of. Imitate Paul, in "forgetting the things that are behind, and
          reaching forth to those things that are before," Philippians 3:13.
          Mourn over your darkness, deadness, and unholiness. Let these be your
          continual burden, and you shall not want a word in season, Isaiah
          50:4. Jesus has the tongue of the learned, to speak a word in season
          to him that is weary. This would make you lie at the catch for a word
          from the Lord, like Benhadad's servants in another case, and receive
          the Lord's message greedily, as what in one way or another will profit
          you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Cry much to God for communion with him in gospel-ordinances. Come
          to ordinances in a believing expectation of enjoying it. Set
          yourselves to receive the gospel as the Lord's word to you, which
          works effectually in you that believe. The Lord appoints sinners to
          meet with him there, saying, "In all places where I record my name, I
          will come into you, and I will bless you," Exodus 20:24. Propose a
          meeting with him there also, and you may be sure it will hold. Like
          Jacob, you will prevail with God to bless you, Hosea 12:4, compare
          Genesis 35:1. Christ had promised the Spirit, and commanded the
          disciples to wait for him, Acts 1:4. They continued in prayer, verse
          14. See the fruit of it, chapter 2.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Be thankful for the least of God's mercies, and be submissive
          to the Lord under every trying dispensation, as sensible of your utter
          unworthiness. When was it that Jacob got the blessing? Was it not when
          in this frame, "I am not worthy," said he, "of the least of all the
          mercies, and of all the truth which you have showed unto your servant;
          for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two
          bands." A sense of unworthiness as to the least mercies, cannot miss
          to produce in you a relish for the great mercies of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are many complaints as to the want of God's presence in
          ordinances. There is not that found in them which was in former times.
          Many lay the blame of this on ministers; and, I dare say, there is not
          either a godly minister in Scotland, or a godly Christian, acting as
          such, who dare refuse that he has a real share in it. The clean, to
          cast stones at the guilty, must come out from among those ministers
          and people who are strangers to their own hearts, and see better into
          others than they do into themselves. But however it be, I dare
          promise, in the name of the Lord, that the hungry shall not be sent
          empty away. The meek poor ones shall be feasted in ordinances; and
          their hungry souls shall be refreshed with the gospel, fare with
          others as it will; Psalm 22:24, "The meek shall eat, and be
          satisfied," Matthew 5:6, "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst
          after righteousness, for they shall be filled." O! but the spiritual
          relish for the word is well worth all the trouble which is necessary
          for having it. For,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. This is the hidden manna peculiar to God's hidden ones on earth:
          "To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna,"
          Revelation 2:17. We read, Exodus 16:13, 14, of the dew under which the
          manna lay. The ordinances are that dew; communion with Christ in
          ordinances, by relishing his word, is the manna under it. The
          ordinances are the cabinet; this is the opening of the cabinet, and
          the finding of the jewel, the drawing by the veil, and beholding the
          glory; the digging up the field, and falling on the treasure; the
          breaking the shell, and getting out the pearl.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. This would make the Sabbath the most pleasant day in all the week,
          the hours of worship the most pleasant hours, which now to most are a
          weariness. See how the Gospel, felt in its power, does affect: Isaiah
          9:3, "They joy before you according to the joy in harvest, and as men
          rejoice when they divide the spoil." Compare verse 2. If you had ever
          any experience of this relish, dare you say but that these were your
          golden days, even the best time ever you had in your life, and that
          all the world could never make up your loss since you wanted them? You
          who never tasted of it believe others, since you are not capable of
          judging in the matter: Psalm 84:10, "For a day in your courts is
          better than a thousand." Believe those who have got that at
          ordinances, which has made them joyfully embrace persecution,
          banishment, a scaffold, and a fire.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. This would readily hang about you all the week, in a holy, savory,
          tender disposition, and make you rejoice at the return of the Sabbath:
          Psalm 122:1, "I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the
          house of the Lord." It is good being in Christ's company in his
          sanctuary; wherever they go afterwards, they smell of his good
          ointments: knowledge is taken of them that they have been with Jesus,
          Acts 4:13. Remember what is said of the Gospel, 2 Corinthians 2:16,
          "To the one we are the savor of death unto death, and to the other the
          savor of life unto life." Alas! how rank and unsavory are the
          conversations of most, because they never get a relish for the word.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. This would make you useful Christians. The woman of Samaria, as
          soon as she relished the Gospel, she got another spirit. As she had
          been formerly a prop of the devil's kingdom, and an agent for him in
          the place where she lived; she now, when converted by grace, turns
          useful for others. This would make you naturally commend the way of
          God to others, would make you useful in your families, in the
          congregation, and in the country-side.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, This would be a Heaven on earth. What is the happiness of the
          saints in glory? They enjoy God, and this is in the utmost perfection.
          You should relish that enjoyment of him, which in your measure you
          have for the present, as a prelude, an earnest of what shall be your
          privilege hereafter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I shall have done with a word to all in general, and in particular to
          meek poor ones.—To all in general, I would say, Entertain the good
          tidings of the Gospel, slight them not, give them a suitable
          entertainment. Believe them as undoubted truths. When God speaks, it
          is reasonable we believe; for he is Truth, he is the faithful and true
          Witness, Revelation 3:14. The carnal mind is apt to fall into unbelief
          of the Gospel, which reflects great dishonor upon God: 1 John 5:10,
          "He who believes not God, has made him a liar, because he believes not
          the record that God gave of his Son." And this also makes the Gospel
          unprofitable to ourselves: "The word preached did not profit them, not
          being mixed with faith in them that heard it," Hebrews 4:2. Embrace
          these tidings joyfully and thankfully; they are tidings of great joy,
          and should be received with the greatest joy and cheerfulness: as a
          malefactor on the scaffold should receive the tidings of a pardon, or
          as an indemnity would be received by those who have forfeited their
          lives by their treason. And the greater the danger is from which the
          Gospel proclaims deliverance, the more welcome should the tidings be.
          Finally, lay the weight of your souls on these tidings for time and
          eternity, fall in with the Gospel-contrivance, and embrace the
          covenant as well ordered in all things, and sure, Matthew 13:44.
          Embrace the salvation; come away with the Redeemer, accept the ransom,
          accept the indemnity, put your case in the hand of the great
          physician, and all shall be well. To prevail with you as to this,
          consider, for MOTIVES,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          From whence the tidings come. It is from a far country, from Heaven,
          the throne of God, yes, the depths of the counsel of God, John 1:18.
          Behold tidings of love and good-will from Heaven, of a mercy-seat set
          up there for poor sinners, from whence they could have looked for
          nothing but wrath! Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Who brings the tidings,—the Son of God. O! glorious messenger, who
          left the Father's bosom, and came down into this earth, to proclaim
          the glad tidings. And now that he is ascended into Heaven, he has sent
          his ministers in his name to proclaim them, with his certification,
          That he who hears you, hears me; and he who despises you, despises me;
          and he who despises me, despises him that sent me. Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What are the tidings. Tidings of a salvation, a redemption, etc. They
          are good tidings, the best of tidings that ever came into the world.
          Good to refresh and revive the spirits of those whom nothing else can
          comfort, even sinners depressed under apprehensions of wrath; and the
          more to be esteemed that they are peculiar to sinful men, not fallen
          angels. "Unto you, O men! I call, and my voice is to the sons of men."
          Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The need there was of these tidings in the world. Never did tidings
          come so seasonably to any, as those of the Gospel to the world ruined
          by sin. We were as Isaac, with the knife at our throat, when the
          tidings came of Jesus Christ, as the ram caught in the thicket. Let us
          but suppose the world without the Gospel, we will then have a fiery
          law, flaming on our faces, and no way whatever to escape. Thus will we
          see the seasonableness of Gospel tidings.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          To meek poor ones, in particular, I would say, O! sensible sinners,
          pressed with the sense of your spiritual wants, your sinfulness,
          misery, inability to help yourselves, you who see your absolute need
          of Christ, and withal your unworthiness of his help, who are longing
          for supply, and content with Christ on any terms, to you is the word
          of this salvation sent particularly; come away, and joyfully embrace
          these good tidings. To influence you to this, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That your names are particularly in Christ's commission. He was sent
          to preach good tidings to the meek. The Lord knows that the poor
          convinced sinner will have many doubts and fears, which will be hard
          for him to overcome, so as to get the tidings believed. Therefore, as
          in Mark 16:7, the angel said unto the woman, "Go your way, tell his
          disciples, and Peter, that he goes before you into Galilee, there
          shall you see him, as he said unto you." So here particular notice is
          taken of the meek. God has a special eye on the outcasts of Israel to
          bring them in to himself, Isaiah 55:1. Again, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That the grand end for which the Lord discovers to you your spiritual
          poverty is, that you may come to Christ for supply; Galatians 3:24,
          "Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster, to bring us unto Christ, that
          we might be justified by faith." God brought a famine on Jacob's
          household in Canaan, when there was corn in Egypt, that Joseph's
          brethren might have an errand to him. Therefore reject not the counsel
          of God against yourselves. Consider farther,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That Christ is able to supply all your wants: "Open your mouth wide,"
          says he, "and I will fill it," Psalm 81:10. Were your wants as great
          as Paul's, as Mary Magdalene's, as Manasseh's were, he has enough to
          supply them all, a fullness of merit and of spirit. If all the world
          were so poor in spirit, there is enough for them all, and to spare;
          there is an infinite value in his blood, and an infinite efficacy in
          his spirit. Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That you cannot get the supply of your wants anywhere else; Acts 4:12,
          "Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name
          under Heaven, given among men, whereby we must be saved." Alas! poor
          sinners are ready to go to wrong doors for supply, and to seek to have
          their wants supplied by themselves. But all your duties, prayers,
          watchings, mournings, will do no good, unless you believe; John 6:29,
          "This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent."
          Consider, lastly,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          That our Lord makes you welcome to him and his fullness, and that
          freely, Isaiah 55:1. I dare not come to Christ, says one. Why so?
          Christ is a gift, even the gift of God, John 4:10; and what is freer
          than a gift? Nothing is required of you but to receive it. Incline,
          then, your ear, and come unto him; hear, and your souls shall
          live.—Amen.
