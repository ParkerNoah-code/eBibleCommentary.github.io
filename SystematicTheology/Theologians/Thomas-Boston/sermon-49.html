    Romans 2:28, 29, "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that 
    circumcision which is outward in the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one 
    inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in 
    the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God."</p>
<p align="justify">THESE words are a reason why no man ought to value 
    himself on the externals of religion, for they will go but short way. 
    However they please men, they will never please God. The scope of them is, 
    to show who are the people of God. The Jews of old were the people of God; 
    the Christians are so now, being come in their room. The apostle here 
    distinguishes the people of God into nominal and real ones, calling them 
    Jews, because he was speaking to Jews; the case is the same as to 
    Christians.—In these words, he shows two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Who are not true Jews, real Christians, or saints 
    indeed, verse 28; for these are they whom he means by Jews, saying, "He is 
    not a Jew." Not those who are Jews outwardly, Christians and saints by 
    profession, that is, who are only so, and no more; for God requires 
    externals of religion as well as internals, though the former, separate from 
    the latter, avail nothing. But those who have no more religion than what is 
    outward, namely, what men see or may see, they have nothing of the reality 
    of it.</p>
<p align="justify">The Jews valued themselves on circumcision, as Christians 
    on baptism; but true circumcision is not what is outward in the flesh, nor 
    baptism what is by water; that is only so. These external rites signify an 
    inward grace, without which they signify nothing before God. Circumcision 
    was in a hidden part of the body, yet it was on the body, and what might be 
    seen; so religion might be in saints; yet being only what may be seen, will 
    not constitute a person truly religious.—He shows,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Who are true Jews, real Christians, or saints indeed? 
    There are two characters of these, which distinguished them from the other. 
    They are,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Those who are so inwardly, or in the hidden part, 
    which is open to God alone, as well as in the outward part, which appears to 
    the world. These who have the hidden part of religion, which being hidden 
    from the world's view, they cannot certainly judge of. Those who have the 
    true circumcision, the spiritual baptism, that is, the circumcision of the 
    heart, Deuteronomy 10:16, by which corrupt lusts are cut off, and the body 
    of sin put off, Colossians 2:11. This is the spiritual, not fleshly 
    circumcision only. It touches on, reforms, and renews our spirit, our soul, 
    the hidden, but most valuable part of a man. The carnal is but the cutting 
    off a bit of the flesh of the body, which might be done while the spirit 
    remained overgrown with unmodified lusts, and the soul quite defiled. The 
    spirit is here opposed to the letter, which last cannot be well understood 
    of the body, but of circumcision, and therefore the spirit also; and 
    circumcision of the heart, which is circumcision in the spirit or grace of 
    it, (not in the letter, or external rite of circumcision), is the true 
    circumcision. So they have the spirituality of it, which is as the soul 
    thereof, as well as the letter, which is as the body thereof. The spirit of 
    circumcision is the invisible grace signified by it, and joined with it, 
    when it is effectual; the letter of it is the sensible sign or external 
    rite.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They are such as have God's approbation, 
    commendation, and praise, whether they have men's or not. There is an 
    allusion here to the word Judah, from whom that people, now called Jews, had 
    their name; it signifies praised, Genesis 48:8. These are the true Judahs, 
    whom not only their brethren, but their Father, even God, praises. Outward 
    religion may gain praise of men, who cannot discern what is within; but the 
    true Jew the real Christian, is one approved even by the heart-searching 
    God, according to the reality, and not the appearance.—From this subject I 
    take this</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE, That he is not a true Christian, who only in 
    the outward part, and in the letter of religion, approves himself to men; 
    but he who, by the inner part of religion, and the spirituality thereof, 
    also approves himself to the heart-searching God.</p>
<p align="justify">In illustrating this important truth, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Speak to this point generally.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Consider it more particularly.—I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Speak to this point more generally.—Here I propose,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show that there is such a difference in the visible 
    church, that there are some who are only Christians outwardly, and that 
    there are others who are also Christians inwardly.</p>
<p align="justify">II. To inquire what are the causes of this difference?</p>
<p align="justify">III. To point out what is the outside and letter of 
    religion, which only makes an outside Christian, and what the inside and 
    spirit of religion is which makes a genuine Christian.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To confirm the doctrine.—I am,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show that there is such a difference in the visible 
    church, that there are some who are only Christians outwardly, and that 
    there are others who are also Christians inwardly.</p>
<p align="justify">This difference appears many ways. It appears,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In the very different characters given those who 
    profess the same faith and true religion. The preachers of the gospel are 
    fishers of men, but they are not all good that come by profession into the 
    net, Matthew 13:47, 48. The tares and the wheat grow together in the field 
    of the church, the goats and the sheep go together all the day, until the 
    great Shepherd separate them. And as to virgin-professors, some are wise, 
    and have oil in their vessels, with their lamps; others are foolish, Matthew 
    25 who mock God with fair promises, befool even the godly, who looked well 
    upon them, and, worst of all, befool themselves in the latter end, when the 
    Bridegroom cometh.—This appears,</p>
<p align="justify">2. In the very different effects religion has on the 
    lives of those who are called Christians. There are some whose religion has 
    a powerful efficacy on their hearts and lives to make them holy, others who 
    have nothing but an idle form, having no more sanctifying power with it, 
    than a painted fire has to burn: 2 Timothy 3:5, "Having a form of godliness, 
    but denying the power thereof. The knowledge of some is confined to their 
    heads, it never gets down to their hearts: Titus 1:16, "They profess that 
    they know God, but in works they deny him." Others, by reason of their 
    light, dare not venture on an ill thing, more than on a precipice. Religion 
    makes some persons godly, sober, and righteous, binds powerfully on them 
    their duty to God, to themselves, and to their neighbor. The pretended 
    religion of others, leaves them loose as to all those things. It never 
    checks them when neglecting secret prayers, or prayers in the family, or 
    when disposed to swear, drink, lie, defraud, &amp;c.—This appears,</p>
<p align="justify">3. In the very different acceptance with God which 
    persons' prayers get. There are some whose duties are very pleasing to God, 
    they have a sweet savor in his nostrils: their words are registered before 
    him, their tears are bottled, their sighs and groans are regarded, their 
    will is accepted for the deed. But there are others whom God abhors, and 
    also their duties. The word is preached to them, but it never reforms them; 
    yet they hold on with their attendance on ordinances, and it may be also 
    with their prayers. What says the Lord of all such? "He who turns away his 
    ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be an abomination." "For all 
    these things has my hand made, and all those things have been, says the 
    Lord; but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a 
    contrite spirit, and trembles at my word. He who kills an ox is as if he 
    slew a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that 
    offers an oblation, as if he offered swine's flesh; he who burns incense, as 
    if he blessed an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul 
    delights in their abominations." "To what purpose is the multitude of your 
    sacrifices to me? says the Lord; I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, 
    and the fat of fed beasts, and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of 
    lambs, or of he-goats," Proverbs 28:9; Isaiah 66:2, 3, and 1:11.—This 
    appears,</p>
<p align="justify">4. From the very different sense and feeling which those 
    have of the advantage of religion, the ordinances and duties thereof. Some 
    are acquainted with the gain of religion, and, from their own experience, 
    can give a solid reason why they follow it: 1 Timothy 6:6, "But godliness 
    with contentment is great gain." They have tasted of communion with God in 
    duties, and of access to him, of the sanctifying influences of the Spirit in 
    ordinances: Micah 2:7, "O you that are named the house of Jacob, is the 
    spirit of the Lord straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good 
    to him that walks uprightly?" But unto others all these things are in very 
    deed but as empty husks: Proverbs 14:10, "The heart knows his own 
    bitterness, and a stranger does not intermeddle with his joy." They abide in 
    the outer court of religion all their days; they see not its intrinsic 
    glory, nor taste of its kernel or marrow. They keep up a form of duties from 
    custom, and an unenlightened conscience; but they feel nothing in them 
    kindly to draw their hearts towards God.—This appears,</p>
<p align="justify">5. In the very different effects of the religion which 
    those profess. Grace is of a growing nature, and it will grow, though not 
    visible at all times: Proverbs 4:18, "But the path of the just is as the 
    shining light, that shines more and more unto the perfect day." And the 
    longer that saints have a standing in religion, they will be the more firmly 
    rooted; though perhaps their affections be not always so vigorous, yet solid 
    tenderness will display itself with them: Psalm 92:13, 14, "Those that are 
    planted in the house of the Lord, shall grow up and flourish in the courts 
    of our God. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age: they shall be fat 
    and flourishing." And if they fall, they will not lie still, but recover 
    again: Psalm 37:24, "Though be fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for 
    the Lord upholds him with his hand." But what are the effects which the 
    religion of many has? Some grow up to their false pitch, and there they 
    stand without motion: Proverbs 26:14, "As the door turns on his hinges, so 
    does the slothful upon his bed." They think they are right, and they seek no 
    farther. Some, instead of growing better, grow worse and worse; the longer 
    they live, they are the more unholy, more untender in the substantials of 
    moral duties; and some throw aside the mask altogether, and, in sight of the 
    world, desert to the devil's camp, by falling into some profane course, 
    apostatizing upon some temptation or other, and so, as they were before 
    loathsome before God, they become also loathsome before his people: 
    Revelation 3:16, "So, then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor 
    hot, I will spew you out of my month." This appears,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, In the very different passage which those have 
    out of time into eternity. True, all must die, that is the point in which we 
    all meet; but as true is it, that it is the point where outside and inside 
    Christians part forever: Psalm 37:37, 38, "Mark the perfect man, and behold 
    the upright, for the latter end of that man is peace. But the transgressors 
    shall be destroyed together; the end of the wicked shall be out off." Though 
    they have lived in the same church together, under the same ordinances, gone 
    to prayers together, to one communion-table, when they come to that step 
    where their ways part, they separate never to meet more. The one goes to the 
    society of God, angels, and saints; and their unseen religion terminates in 
    a glorious open reward, their grace in glory, their inward beauty in shining 
    as stars in the firmament. The other gets his portion with reprobates, and 
    those who had as little of the show, as of the reality of religion: Psalm 
    125:5, "As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall 
    lead them forth with the workers of iniquity."—I shall point out,</p>
<p align="justify">II. What are the causes of this difference which obtains 
    between Christians and others.—Among others, there is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The very different way that persons come by their 
    religion; if we examine outside and inside Christians, how they came by the 
    religion they severally have, it will be found, that the religion which they 
    have is answerable to the way they came by it.—Thus,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) There is a difference in the weight which their 
    entering on their religion had on their spirits. Some come very lightly by 
    their religion; hence it sits lightly upon them, and often goes as lightly 
    from them. They venture upon building a tower, without deliberately counting 
    the cost. To others it is not so easy, but they are brought to the utmost 
    seriousness in the matter, Luke 14:28, 29; hence they go to the bottom of 
    the matter, while others satisfy themselves with superficial work.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) There is a difference in the depth of their 
    conviction and humiliation: Luke 6:48, 49, "He is like a man which built an 
    house, and dug deep, and laid the foundation on a rock, and when the flood 
    arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it, 
    for it was founded on a rock. But he who hears, and does not, is like a man 
    that, without a foundation, built an house on the earth, against which the 
    stream beat vehemently, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house 
    was great." The plough of conviction lightly going over the fallow ground of 
    the heart, is sufficient to make an outside Christian: Matthew 13:5, 20, 
    "Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth, and forthwith 
    they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth. But he who received 
    the seed into stony places, the same is he who hears the word, and anon with 
    joy receives it." If he have as much of it as to let him see the evil and 
    danger of a life quite profane, without so much as the form of godliness, it 
    is sufficient to make him put on the form. But it must be carried deeper, to 
    make an inside Christian, even to the root of the most inward beloved lust, 
    to the sin of one's nature, and to the discovery of Christ for 
    sanctification, as well as justification.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) There is a vast difference in their light and 
    illumination in the knowledge of Christ: John 4:10, "Jesus answered, and 
    said unto her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says unto 
    you, Give me to drink, you would have asked of him, and he would have given 
    you living water." This is plainly intimated in the wise and foolish 
    builders and virgins; so that an outside Christian has never been right in 
    the head. All their insight into the excellency of Christ and religion, has 
    left them fools, while others have been made really wise, their judgment 
    rectified, their taste purified, so as to be capable to discern things 
    concerning their souls in their native colors. Hence that glory in Christ 
    has been seen by the one, which has darkened all created glory, made them 
    content to part with all for him, while the other has always some lust or 
    other more dear to them than Christ and religion.—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) A difference in the outcome of their exercises about 
    their soul's case. In the one they have issued in the change of their 
    nature, the taking away of the heart of stone, Ezekiel 36:26, the making of 
    them new creatures, putting off the old man, and putting on the new. But in 
    the other, whatever stir has been made in the affections, whatever griefs or 
    joys they have had, the stony heart has remained untaken away, Matthew 13:5; 
    so, though they have become other men than they were before, yet not new 
    men.—Another cause of difference is,</p>
<p align="justify">2. The different ways in which professors follow 
    religion. This, if attended to, cannot fail to make a mighty difference.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Some make religion their business, their main 
    business, in the world: Genesis 5:24, "And Enoch walked with God, and he was 
    not, for God took him." Religion is their all. They see nothing they have to 
    do in the world, but it is either their salvation-work or their 
    generation-work, so that they must observe God in all things. And this makes 
    an inside Christian: Psalm 119:6, "Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have 
    respect unto all your commandments." Others make religion but a bye-work; 
    their main business is on another kind, how to please themselves, how to 
    advance their temporal interest; and this makes an outside Christian. In 
    regard to the one, all things else about him bow to his religion, he cuts 
    and carves them as may best suit God's honor, and his soul's welfare; 
    whereas, as to the other, he makes his religion bow to his other designs, 
    takes so much of it, and no more, as may leave him in quiet possession of 
    some lust or other.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They follow religion from different principles, 
    motives and ends.</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] Some follow it from natural principles and motives; 
    that which moves them to it is a natural conscience, in some sort 
    enlightened by the word and providence, which will give them no rest in the 
    utter neglect of religion. Fear of punishment, or hope of reward, are 
    powerful enough to make an outward Christian. But an inside Christian has a 
    gracious principle of love to God and holiness implanted in him, the law is 
    written in his heart, he has a new nature, which inclines him unto universal 
    holiness, and thereby he is kindly drawn to follow religion, upon a view of 
    its inward beauty; and thus he fills up his character.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Some aim at approving themselves to men in their 
    religion. They seek a name by it, they desire thus to advance their credit 
    and reputation among the sober part of the world, Matthew 6:2; and seeming 
    to be religious will satisfy, because men can judge no farther than the 
    outward appearance. But others study to approve themselves to God: 2 
    Corinthians 5:9, "Wherefore we labor, that whether present or absent, we may 
    be accepted of him." Now, since God cannot be deceived with outward 
    appearances, this engages them to be careful of the hidden man of the heart, 
    and to value no approbation of any, if the Master approve them not.—From 
    what has been observed, we may learn,</p>
<p align="justify">That there is something in religion above nature's reach. 
    O study to attain it! The mystery of godliness is a great mystery. It is no 
    easy thing to be a Christian. The difference between the godly and others 
    lies not in externals, but in internals, things removed out of the view of 
    the world, and open to God only. O labor to study internal religion, and to 
    approve yourselves to God who searches the hearts!—Try yourselves. Consider 
    to which of the two sorts you belong, whether you be real Christians or not. 
    Never value yourselves on the outward part or letter of religion, for you 
    may have that and be stripped of all by apostasy to which you lie open, and 
    will be turned out with the workers of iniquity at last, though you still 
    keep on the mask. We must all appear before the tribunal of Christ. Study 
    that religion which will be approved by him there.—I now proceed to 
    consider,</p>
<p align="justify">III. What is the outside and letter of religion, which 
    only makes an outside Christian, and what is the inside and spirit of it, 
    which makes a Christian?—Here I observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That the outside of religion is that part of it which 
    lies open to the view of the world, by which men form their estimate, not 
    God: 1 Samuel 16:7, "But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his 
    countenance, or on the height of his stature, because I have refused him; 
    for the Lord sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, 
    but the Lord looks on the heart." It comprehends all church privileges, 
    duties, whether of doing or suffering, and attainments lying open to the 
    view of men. Men may come a great length in this, and yet be nothing in 
    God's esteem.—I observe</p>
<p align="justify">2. That the letter of religion is that part of it which 
    is agreeable to the letter of the law, whether in externals or internals. 
    And it comprehends not only the outside, which is open to man's view, but 
    also internal dispositions, exercises and attainments, as to the matter of 
    them; for example, Judas's sorrow for sin, the stony ground's joy at 
    receiving the seed of the word, and the hypocrite's delight in approaching 
    to God, Isaiah 58 which have the matter, but not the form and manner, and so 
    is like a body without the soul.—I observe,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That the inside of religion is that part of it which 
    is open to the all-seeing eye of God, Matthew 6:4, "That your alms may be in 
    secret, and your Father which sees in secret, himself shall reward you 
    openly." What persons go about, out of mere conscience towards God, as 
    knowing that the world either is not, or cannot be witness to it, and though 
    it was a witness, it does not know right or wrong; but such setting 
    themselves in the presence of God, are carried to their duty as if the eyes 
    of all the world were upon them, Acts 24:16. But this is not all.—I observe,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, That the spirit or spirituality of religion is 
    the internal grace, joined to the external performance; it is the right 
    manner, joined to the right matter of religion: John 4:24, "God is a Spirit, 
    and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth." 1 
    Timothy 1:5, "Now, the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure 
    heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith sincere," as when 
    heart-humiliation is joined with bending of the knees to God in prayer, and 
    the duty is gone about from right principles, and directed to a right 
    end.—It remains that,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. I confirm the doctrine,</p>
<p align="justify">That not the former, but the latter sort of religion, 
    marks a true Christian, is evident, if we consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That there is nothing in the outside or letter of 
    religion, but what one may reach in an unregenerate state, in which no man 
    can ever please God, Romans 3:8. The hypocrite's mask may take in the whole 
    outward man, and the devil's goats may resemble Christ's sheep, in all but 
    the hidden man of the heart. All these are but acts of moral discipline, not 
    requiring a new nature from whence to spring, but may arise from the old 
    corrupt nature, assisted by external revelation, and the common influences 
    of the Spirit.—It will be farther evident, if we consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That the outside and letter of religion may be without 
    any true love to God in the heart, which yet is the substance of practical 
    holiness, and the comprehensive duty of the whole law: Ezekiel 33:31, "And 
    they come unto me, as the people comes, and they sit before you as my 
    people, and they hear your words, but they will not do them; for with their 
    mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their covetousness." 
    Love to God makes all duties run in a right channel; but how can this be 
    found, when the natural enmity is not overcome by regenerating grace? 
    Self-love may supply its place, so far as the outside and letter of religion 
    go, and that upon this principle, Job 3. "Skin for skin, yes, all that a man 
    has will he give for his life."—This will also be evident, if we consider,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That the outside and letter of religion may consist 
    with the reign of sin in the heart: 2 Timothy 3:5, "Having a form of 
    godliness, but denying the power of it." Such in themselves are weak, and 
    can never turn sin off the throne in the soul. Hence it is that every 
    hypocrite is a slave to some lust or other; whatever be his attainments, 
    this always remains true of him, Mark 10:21. This kind of religion is ever 
    like the legs of the lame, unequal.—This will be evident, if we consider,</p>
<p align="justify">4. That men are in religion only what they are before 
    God, not what they are before men. When God directs Abraham to a holy walk, 
    he says, "Walk before me," Genesis 17:1. If God did not observe the hearts, 
    the insides of men, the principles of their actions, an outside religion 
    would be sufficient. But what does it avail before the all-seeing God, to 
    cleanse the outside of the platter, while the inside is full of ravening, 
    while that is wanting which God chiefly requires and delights in? Psalm 
    51:6, how is it possible that the man should be approved of God?—This will 
    be evident, if we consider,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, That the great difference of accepted and 
    unaccepted performances, dispositions, &amp;c., does not lie in the letter but 
    in something else. Cain and Abel both offered, the one acceptably, the other 
    not. Genesis 4:3, 4, 5, where lay the difference? The apostle shows it, 
    Hebrews 11:4, "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice 
    than Cain, by which he obtained witness, that he was righteous, God 
    testifying of his gifts; and by it he being dead yet speaks." Peter and 
    Judas both mourned, and we need not hesitate to say, that the mourning of 
    the latter in itself was fully as hearty as that of the former, but they 
    differed in their kind, the one was godly sorrow, the other was the sorrow 
    of the world. The trial of men's works is not only by what they have 
    wrought, but how they have wrought: John 3:21, "But he who does truth comes 
    to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in 
    God."</p>
<p align="justify">V. I now come to make some brief improvement.—We infer,</p>
<p align="justify">1. What are those Christians, who do not so much as 
    approve themselves to men, by the outside, and letter of religion. Those 
    surely have nothing of God, and shall never see Heaven, if they change not 
    their course of life: Matthew 5:20, "Except your righteousness shall exceed 
    the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter 
    into the kingdom of Heaven." How many are there among us this day, whose way 
    of life is a scandal to Christianity, who are in the church, as boils, 
    botches, and sores, are in the body, serving for nothing but to grieve the 
    spirits of others who have any concern in them? What sort of Christians are 
    prayerless persons, liars, Sabbath-breakers who loiter away whole Sabbaths, 
    unclean persons? etc. 1 Peter 4:18, "And if the righteous scarcely be saved, 
    where shall the ungodly and sinners appear?" The day will come, when such 
    will see that it had been their happiness to have lived and died among 
    Pagans.—We infer,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That those also are a sad sort of Christians, who, if 
    they can approve themselves to men, make it none of their business to 
    approve themselves to God: Revelation 3:1, "I know your works, that you have 
    a name that you live, and are dead." How many are there, with whom their 
    credit goes farther than their conscience! And therefore, if they can carry 
    their wickedness, so as none but God may see it, they value not his eye on 
    them: Numbers 32:23, "But if you will not do so, behold you have sinned 
    against the Lord; and be sure your sin will find you out." This practical 
    atheism will be bitterness in the end, when the day comes, when God shall 
    judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to the gospel, Romans 
    11:16. Ah! how many cast a fair cloak of profession over reigning lusts; but 
    behold their end: Psalm 125:5, "As for such as turn aside unto their crooked 
    ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity; but peace 
    shall be upon Israel."</p>
<p align="justify">II. I shall consider this point more particularly, and 
    show, in some particulars, how far one may go, and yet be an outside 
    Christian, and in what respects the inside Christian goes beyond him, and 
    these jointly, in the following propositions.</p>
<p align="justify">I. That he is not a true Christian who only bears the 
    visible badges of Christianity, but he who, with the visible badges, also 
    partakes of the invisible grace.</p>
<p align="justify">II. That he is not a true Christian, whose outward man is 
    only cleansed from the gross pollutions of the world, but he whose inward 
    man is also cleansed.</p>
<p align="justify">III. That he is not a true Christian who only performs 
    the duties of external obedience, but he who, with them, joins the duties of 
    internal obedience.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. That he is not a true Christian, who has inside 
    religion only in the letter, but he who has it also in its 
    spirituality.—These I shall illustrate in their order.—I observe,</p>
<p align="justify">I. That he is not a true Christian, who only bears the 
    visible badges of Christianity, but he who, with the visible badges, also 
    partakes of the invisible grace.—Mark 16:16, "He who believes, and is 
    baptized, shall be saved; but he who believes not shall be damned." The 
    visible badges of Christianity are the sacraments, baptism, and the Lord's 
    Supper; by partaking of these, we are distinguished from Pagans; but there 
    is an invisible grace, without which these avail nothing to salvation.—For,</p>
<p align="justify">1. One may be baptized in the name of Christ, and yet be 
    no true Christian, but even at the last only an outside one; as in our text, 
    "For he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision 
    which is outward in the flesh." We find some have been bred Jews or pagans, 
    and, by their own free choice, have turned Christians, and received the seal 
    of the covenant, and after all been naught: Acts 8:13, 21, "Then Simon 
    himself believed also; and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, 
    and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs that were done. But Peter 
    said to him, You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is 
    not right in the sight of God!" How much more may persons among us be such, 
    who were baptized in their infancy with water, which was not their choice, 
    but a benefit they had by their parents' care, and from Christianity's being 
    the religion of our country! And how little it avails many, and what good 
    they make of it, may be learned from this, that the impressions of their 
    baptismal engagements are so slight on them that they never mind them, many 
    baptized persons pass year after year, without preparing themselves for the 
    Lord's table. But he is a true Christian, who has the invisible grace 
    signified by baptism. See the difference between outside and inside 
    Christians in this, Matthew 3:11, "I indeed baptize you with water unto 
    repentance: but he who comes after me is greater than I, whose shoes I am 
    not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with 
    fire." 1 Peter 3:21, "The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now 
    save us, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of 
    a good conscience towards God), by the resurrection of Jesus Christ." The 
    outside Christian may be baptized with water, but the inside is baptized 
    with the Holy Spirit, working like fire, burning up the lusts of the flesh. 
    He is born of water, and the Spirit, working like water, to the washing away 
    of the natural filthiness of the spirit with which he was born, on whose 
    conscience Christ's blood is sprinkled, on whose soul Christ's spirit has 
    savingly operated to his spiritual cleansing. In this the inside goes beyond 
    the outside Christian.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In like manner, persons may be admitted to the Lord's 
    table, and yet not be true Christians. Though this be only the privilege of 
    saints, yet a person may be a communicant, who is nothing more than an 
    outside Christian. While others are debarred, they may be admitted to an 
    external partaking of the children's bread, and yet be but dogs in the sight 
    of the heart-searching God: Luke 12:26, "Then shall you begin to say, We 
    have eaten and have drunk in your presence, and you have taught in our 
    streets." Matthew 22:13, "And he says unto him, Friend, how came you in 
    hither, not having a wedding-garment? and he was speechless. Then said the 
    king to the servants, bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast 
    him into outer darkness, there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth." A 
    competency of knowledge, with an appearance of seriousness of a holy life, 
    will entitle persons to this privilege before the church, who can judge only 
    by the outward appearance; but he is a true Christian who is admitted to 
    communion with God in that ordinance: Canticles 5:1, "I am come into my 
    garden, my sister, my spouse, I have gathered my myrrh with my spice, I have 
    eaten my honeycomb with my honey. Eat, O friends, drink, yes, drink 
    abundantly, O beloved." In this matter, the inside Christian goes beyond the 
    outside one. The outside Christian gets the token from men, the inside 
    Christian has also the Lord's token. The one only eats the bread of the 
    Lord, the other, with it, eats that bread which is the Lord: John 6:57, "He 
    who eats me, he shall live by me;" he feeds by faith on a crucified Christ, 
    unites with him, as partaking of his Spirit, of all the benefits of his 
    purchase, to his spiritual nourishment, and growth in grace. The one is held 
    in the outer court, the other is admitted into the inner, and is there 
    feasted in greater or lesser measures. The lusts of the former are 
    strengthened by the abuse of that ordinance, those of the latter are 
    weakened by the holy use of it.—I observe,</p>
<p align="justify">II. That he is not a true Christian, whose outward man 
    only is cleansed from the gross pollutions of the world, but he whose inward 
    man is also cleansed. Saving grace penetrates to the inside, and stays not 
    in the outside only: Psalm 24:3–4, "Who shall ascend into the hill of the 
    Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place? He who has clean hands, and a 
    pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn 
    deceitfully." A person may be clean from gross pollutions of the outward 
    man, and yet be but an outward Christian; no swearer, liar, Sabbath-breaker, 
    fornicator, &amp;c., and yet no Christian, Luke 14:1. Negative holiness and 
    outside religion, though the want of it will damn the profane, 1 Corinthians 
    6:9, 10, yet the having it will not keep the outside Christian from ruin. A 
    blameless life in the world, though good in itself, yet comes not the length 
    of true Christianity. There are several things beside saving grace, that may 
    in some measure cleanse the conversation from gross pollutions.—Among 
    others, there is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Good education, and good company, as in the case of 
    Joash under the tutorage of Jehoiada. This may chain men's lusts, though it 
    cannot change their nature; their heart is of an apish nature, apt to follow 
    example. Though readily the worst example is the most taking, yet good 
    example has a mighty influence, especially when persons are brought up with 
    it from their childhood.—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">2. A good natural temper and disposition. Many a person 
    is more indebted to his natural temper, than to the tenderness of his 
    conscience, for his cleanness from gross pollutions. It is evident, that 
    several persons who have no real religion, nay, nor even the form of it, may 
    be sober, as it would be a pain and a torment to them to go to the 
    extravagant courses in which others indulge themselves. But no man is born a 
    true Christian, as he is with his natural temper; religion in reality is a 
    supernatural temper: 2 Peter 1:4, "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great 
    and precious promises, that by these you may be partakers of the divine 
    nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through 
    lust."—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">3. Their being kept out of the way of temptation. It is a 
    mercy to be so kept; but while people's corruptions are not tried with a 
    suitable bait, they cannot so well know what influence the commandment has 
    or has not upon them. The cleanness of the outward conversation of many is 
    owing more to those circumstances in which they were placed in the world, 
    than to any gracious disposition; as may appear from the case of some who 
    kept right as long as they were not tried, but so soon as the trial of their 
    corruptions comes they give way.—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">4. The workings of a natural conscience under the common 
    influences and convictions of the Spirit, and a rousing ministry: Mark 6:20, 
    "For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man, and a holy , and 
    observed him: and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him 
    gladly." The preaching of the word sometimes serves to embalm dead souls, 
    who are never by it quickened. It also sets the natural conscience a-working 
    to purify the outward man, while the inner is never renewed. It brings on 
    many so far, as that they are not far from the kingdom of God, who yet never 
    have power to go forward to it.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Self-love may do it, in so far as a regard to their 
    soul or body, credit or reputation, may move men to all this. Fear of 
    punishment, and hope of reward, are powerful incentives, where God's 
    authority is but little valued; nay, some reigning lust, as covetousness, 
    pride, or ambition: Matthew 6:2, "Therefore, when you do your alms, do not 
    sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues, and in 
    the streets, that they may have glory of men. Truly, I say unto you, they 
    have their reward." But what avails all this to salvation, while the hidden 
    man of the heart is sunk in pollutions before the all-seeing God, while the 
    man is as a painted sepulcher, fair without, but within full of rottenness: 
    Ezekiel 8:12, "Then said he unto me, Son of man, have you seen what the 
    ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of 
    his imagery? for they say, the Lord sees us not; the Lord has forsaken the 
    earth." It is a weak evidence to lean to outward religion. But the true 
    Christian has this cleanness of the outward conversation, and besides goes 
    farther than the outward Christian in that point, in two particulars.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The inside Christian joins internal purity to 
    external: Psalm 24:4, "He who has clean hands, and a pure heart, who has not 
    lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully." Matthew 5:8, "Blessed 
    are the poor in heart, for they shall see God." He does not sit down 
    contented with outside purity, as the other does, but his chief concern is 
    the heart, the fountain of all impurity of life. And though the world cannot 
    charge him with any gross pollutions, he finds he has work enough to do with 
    the blind mind, the rebellious will, and the carnal corrupt affections. He 
    accordingly strives to get them mortified: Galatians 5:24, "And they that 
    are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with its affections and lusts." 
    Though the world sees not, yet, since God sees the disorder of his heart, 
    that is enough to humble him, and give him new errands to Christ for his 
    blood and Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Even his external purity is from religious motives, 
    springs, and principles. Thus Joseph, Genesis 39:9, "How can I do this great 
    wickedness, and sin against God?" In this he serves God, while in it the 
    outward Christian does but serve himself. It is God's authority that sways 
    him to it; though his natural inclinations be to break out, yet the fear of 
    God in his heart does restrain him. And if he be surprised into temptations, 
    the offence and dishonor to God weighs more with him than all the shame and 
    loss in the world which he incurs.</p>
<p align="justify">From all which we may learn, that certainly they are not 
    true Christians, who are profane in their walk, whose conversation is not so 
    much as cleansed from gross pollutions, such as cursors and swearers, 
    drunkards, mockers at religion, obscene speakers, unclean persons, etc. 
    Galatians 5:19, 20, 21. These bear the devil's mark on their foreheads, 
    Isaiah 3:19; and have not so much as the rude draughts of the form of 
    godliness.—Hence,</p>
<p align="justify">Let no man value himself on the cleansing of the outward 
    man from those pollutions, for a person may go all that length, and much 
    farther, and yet be a cast-away. Religion is much deeper than this is, and 
    is more inward. What the world observes least, God looks most to. Therefore 
    study the inwards of religion, truth and purity in the inward parts.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</b></p>
<p align="justify">HAVING, in the preceding discourse, considered the two 
    first propositions which I laid down for illustrating the second doctrinal 
    point, I go on to the</p>
<p align="justify">III. That he is not the true Christian who only performs 
    the duties of external obedience, bat he who also with them joins the duties 
    of internal obedience. It is not the outward duties of obedience, but those 
    which are inward, which constitute a true Christian. A hypocrite may go the 
    whole round of outward duties, and thus have a form of godliness, so as, to 
    the View of the world, he appears nothing short of the true Christian.—Thus, 
    for instance,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A man may perform the external duties of righteousness 
    and morality towards his neighbor, and yet be no more than an outward 
    Christian. He may be just in his dealings with men: Luke 18:11, "The 
    Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you that I am not 
    as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this 
    publican." He may be liberal and abundant in mercy towards the needy, 1 
    Corinthians 13:3, and yet after all no true Christian. True Christianity 
    makes a good neighbor, makes him abhor every unjust and dishonest thing, it 
    renders him true to his word, and upright in his dealings in the world; but 
    when a man has this and no more, he has but one half, and hardly the half, 
    of what is necessary to make a true Christian.—Besides this,</p>
<p align="justify">2. A man may perform the outward duties of piety towards 
    God, yet after all be but an outside Christian. For pointing out the 
    hypocrite's attainments in this respect, I would have you consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That persons may attend public ordinances, and not 
    only so, but they may be very punctual in their attendance; they may be far 
    from loitering away Sabbaths at home, or from satisfying themselves with a 
    partial attendance, as in Isaiah 58:2, "Yet they seek me daily, and delight 
    to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the 
    ordinance of our God." They may behave themselves gravely and attentively, 
    and neither be sleepers nor gazers, far less laughers at ordinances, and yet 
    after all nothing in God's esteem: Ezekiel 33:31, "And they come unto you as 
    the people comes, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your 
    words, but they will not do them; for with their month they show much lore, 
    but their heart goes after their covetousness." They may be at much pains in 
    following ordinances from place to place: John 6:24, 26, "When the people, 
    therefore, saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also 
    took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.—Jesus answered and 
    said unto them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, you seek me, not because you 
    saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled." 
    They may talk well of what they hear, and after all be but outside 
    Christians: 1 Corinthians 13:1, "Though I speak with the tongues of men or 
    of angels, and have not charity, I am become as a sounding brass or a 
    tinkling cymbal."—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That they may be praying persons, and so carry 
    religion into their families, and into their closets: Jeremiah 12:2, "You 
    have planted, yes, they have taken root; they grow, yes, they bring forth 
    fruit; you are near in their mouth, and far from their reins." Even secret 
    prayers, where no eye but the Lord's does see, is a piece of bodily 
    exercise, not beyond the walk of a hypocrite, which an awakened conscience 
    may put a person upon at first, and other selfish principles may keep them 
    at it. They may be persons of many prayers, not like those who pray some, 
    but who indeed pray much: Hebrews 12:17, "For you know how that afterwards, 
    when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no 
    place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears."—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That they may not only do much, but they also may be 
    sufferers for religion, suffering not only to the spoiling of their goods, 
    but even unto death, and yet be naught in God's esteem; 1 Corinthians 13:3, 
    "And though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me 
    nothing." Hypocrisy is such a salamander, as can live in the fire of 
    persecution, of which there have been many instances; namely, of such whom 
    the violent wind of persecution has not been able to drive off the Lord's 
    way, but the warm sun of prosperity has done their business, to their 
    undoing.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They may join both the outward of the first and second 
    tables, and yet be but outside Christians. There are some who are very 
    upright in their dealings with men, yet have not so much as a form in regard 
    to the duties of piety. Others who do not neglect duties of piety towards 
    God, but they make no conscience of their duty to their neighbor, but where 
    they apprehend their worldly interest will drive to it, right or wrong. 
    Persons may even join both together, and yet be naught in God's esteem. "The 
    Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God I thank you that I am not 
    as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this 
    Publican; I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all I possess," Luke 
    18:12, "Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness 
    which is in the law, blameless," Philippians 3:6.—All this may be, and yet 
    not beyond the boundaries of Pharasaical righteousness: Matthew 5:20, 
    "Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and 
    Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of Heaven." The 
    reason of this is manifest, namely, that all these things being but bodily 
    exercises, are within the compass of nature, and do not require any 
    supernatural grace to the bare performance of them; if the conscience be in 
    any measure awakened, persons may thus be influenced to perform them; and 
    custom may so habituate them, that the performance may be consistent enough 
    with the reign of sin in the heart. But he only is a true Christian who 
    joins internal to external obedience: spiritual exercise to bodily exercise 
    in religion. The inside exceeds the outside Christian in various 
    particulars.—As,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The inside Christian performs the duties of 
    evangelical obedience, in subjecting his whole heart and soul to the Lord, 
    as well as the outward man. This is the spiritual service which declares a 
    man to be a true Christian: "God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must 
    worship him in spirit and in truth," John 4:23, "For we are the 
    circumcision, that worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, 
    and have no confidence in the flesh," Philippians 3:3. The bulk of the 
    hypocrite's religion lies in externals, but that of the true Christian's 
    lies in internals, in faith, love, resignation, and other parts of unseen 
    religion. Their chief labor is with the heart, to notice the risings of 
    corruptions, their bewailing the defects which the world cannot perceive, 
    and mourning over the sin of their nature, the spring of all evil: Galatians 
    5:24, "And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with its 
    affections and lusts."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The inside Christian is unreserved and universal in 
    his obedience, which the outside Christian never is. They have still some 
    lusts with which they can never part, they reign in them.—Enmity against the 
    power of godliness: 1 John 3:12, "Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, 
    and slew his brother; and wherefore slew he him? because his own works were 
    evil, and his brother's righteous."—Self-seeking: John 5:44, "How can you 
    believe, who seek honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes 
    from God only?"—Bitterness of spirit, which cannot digest the gospel 
    command, of doing good for evil: Titus 3:3, "For we also ourselves were 
    sometime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, 
    living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another."—Reigning love to 
    the pleasures of this world, and covetousness: Ezekiel 33:31, "And they come 
    unto you as the people comes, and they sit before you as my people, and they 
    hear your words, but they will not do them; for with their mouth they show 
    much love, but their heart goes after their covetousness." But the gracious 
    soul's obedience is universal; all such in so far sincerely aim at every 
    known duty, approve the holy law in every point; desiring their spirits to 
    be conformed to it, not it to be brought down to them; lamenting from the 
    heart their shortcoming in all points.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The inside Christian's obedience is son-like 
    obedience, the other is servile and slavish. The highest principle with the 
    hypocrite is fear of punishment, and hope of reward, Hosea 10:11; their 
    highest end is themselves, Hosea 10:1. Jehu professed zeal for the Lord, but 
    in effect it was but zeal for a kingdom. The inside Christian serves God as 
    a son does his father.—Prompted by love to him, next to his command: 1 
    Timothy 1:5, "Now, the end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure 
    heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned."—Leaning on him for 
    strength to perform his duty: Colossians 3:17, "And whatever you do in word 
    or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the 
    Father by him."—Aiming at his honor: 1 Corinthians 10:31, "Whether, 
    therefore, you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of 
    God."</p>
<p align="justify">From this learn, that those are inevitably exposed to 
    death, who come not the length of the outward duties of religion, of mercy 
    towards their neighbors, or of piety towards God. Lay this to heart, you 
    unrighteous, you slighters of religion, prayerless persons, etc. You come 
    not even the length of some who will fall short, and never see Heaven. O! if 
    those who do all these things be lost, what will become of you?—You that 
    even come that length, lay no stress upon it, it will be but a broken reed 
    to trust to. Duties are by no means sufficient confidences: nor in 
    themselves, without internals joined to them, can they even be evidences of 
    your safety. Examine not only what you do, but how you do it, for this last 
    is that to which God chiefly looks.—I now come to the</p>
<p align="justify">IV. And last proposition, That he is not a true 
    Christian, who has inside religion only in the letter of it, but he who also 
    has it in its spirituality. We have pursued the nominal Christian through 
    his outside religion, but we may not leave him here; for, as an hypocrite 
    may go farther than mere externals, so the text pursues him for discovery, 
    even in internals in the letter.—For explaining which, I observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That a man may carry his religion into internals, and 
    yet be but a Christian in the letter. He may do and have that in religion 
    which no eye but God sees or can see, and yet be no true Christian: Jeremiah 
    17:9, 10, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, 
    who can know it? I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give 
    every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings." 
    A person may form such a fine thread of hypocrisy, as to beguile every eye 
    but the all-seeing eye: Jeremiah 3:10, "And yet for all this, her 
    treacherous sister Judah has not turned unto me with her whole heart, but 
    insincerely, says the Lord." Do not think that all hypocrisy is gross 
    dissimulation, or yet that all a hypocrite's religion lies only in his 
    outside, and in nothing within.—For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) A natural conscience may check for heart-sins, and 
    sins that no eye sees but God's, Romans 2:15, "Which show the work of the 
    law written on their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and 
    their thoughts the mean time accusing, or else excusing, one another;" and 
    consequently must press to inward duties, according to the light. Hence 
    there may be sorrow and grief for what is hidden from all the world; since 
    the conscience perceives that God sees it, and that he will write his 
    indignation on it. This fire has burned in many an unsanctified breast, yet 
    it behooved it to have a vent, though to their own shame and loss.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) An unsanctified desire of salvation, in the way of 
    the covenant of works, may carry a man to internals in religion: Romans 
    10:3, "For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to 
    establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the 
    righteousness of God."—The covenant of works is engraved on man's heart 
    naturally, and under the influence of it a man may do his utmost to conform 
    to the letter of the law, in the inward as well as outward duties of it. 
    Observe the case of the young man in Matthew 19:16–20. It is no rare thing 
    to see men eager to purchase Heaven by their works.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Light may be strong, and kept strong by the common 
    operations of the Holy Spirit, in an unholy heart. Thus, Balaam dared not 
    entertain a thought of cursing Israel; though he would gladly have gained 
    the wages of unrighteousness, if his light would have suffered him. Our Lord 
    Christ breaks up the outer door of our understanding often while the inner 
    remains shut. This cannot miss to have some bond on the heart, as well as on 
    the outer man.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Even in the internals of religion, there is a letter 
    and a spirit; there is the body or matter of the thing, and the soul and 
    spirit of it lying in the right manner of doing it. The former is not beyond 
    the power of nature, but the latter is; and therefore a hypocrite may come 
    the length of the letter of internals of religion. He may have desires of 
    good; Proverbs 13:4, "The soul of the sluggard desires," etc., though not 
    holy desires; so in other cases.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The true Christian has inside religion, not in the 
    letter only, but in the spirituality thereof: Philippians 3:3, "We—worship 
    God in the spirit, and—have no confidence in the flesh." He does not satisfy 
    himself with the thing itself, but labors to get it, and maintain it as of 
    the right stamp, such as God will approve. Here lies sincerity, that 
    ornament of all religion, or rather the spirit and life of all, John 1:47. 
    Now, this spirituality consists in two things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) In the graciousness of the principle, 1 Timothy 1:5. 
    Their inward religion is the fruit of their new nature influenced by the 
    Lord the Spirit; it is natural, and not violent or forced out by terrors, or 
    from necessity, as screening them from the wrath of God. The new nature 
    makes it their absolute choice, in whatever circumstances they may be: 
    whereas it is the choice of others, only because they cannot otherwise act 
    safely.—It consists,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) In the holiness of their aim: their chief aim is to 
    please the Lord, Colossians 1:10. The stress of their salvation is laid on 
    the obedience of Christ, not their own, whether outward or inward; and hence 
    their aim in all their duties, is not to please themselves, but him who has 
    called them to be partakers of his glory. The hypocrite is servile in his 
    aims to please God, as he is mercenary for his own profit, so that himself, 
    and not God, is his chief end; but the sincere soul acts like a son, by 
    virtue of the spirit of adoption.—From all this we may learn,</p>
<p align="justify">That this shows they are not true Christians, whose 
    religion lies all in externals, and have no concern about their hearts, 
    Matthew 23:25. A whited sepulcher is the emblem of a hypocrite, not of a 
    true Christian. Persons also may be at much pains inwardly, who yet never 
    come the length of the spirit of religion. What, then, will become of these, 
    whose case is entirely confined to the outward man?—Let those who carry 
    religion inwardly also examine well, what are the principles and ends they 
    act from, lest their inside religion be found a spiritless, lifeless corpse 
    of religion, the mere product of their own exertions. Such may perceive 
    whether or not they have the spirit of religion, by,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Their endeavoring to approve themselves to the Lord, 
    as an all-seeing holy God, not in some things only, but in all things, 
    Colossians 1:10. Being content to know the whole Word of God as to duty, and 
    what they know not to be discovered to them, in order to their setting about 
    it, Job 34:32; Psalm 139:23, 24. They will know it by,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Their endeavoring to purge their inward, as well as 
    their outward religion, of all carnal and selfish motives, principles, and 
    ends, John 3:21. Self is an insinuating thing, and much of our spirituality 
    lies in persons endeavoring to be spiritual in what they do. So short length 
    do most come, we must be concerned to be purged from hypocrisy; it is a good 
    sign with those who are unsatisfied with their performance of duty, and are 
    lamenting that they are not spiritual in it, Romans 7:22, 23.—They will know 
    it,</p>
<p align="justify">3. By being denied to their outward, and also their 
    inward religion, Philippians 3. Though they endeavor to do all as if they 
    were to gain Heaven by doing, yet they renounce all in point of confidence 
    before the Lord, as naked and bare. This is a good sign, Matthew 5:3.</p>
<p align="justify">In pursuance of this point touching inside religion, I 
    shall offer the following observations touching the hypocrite's attainments 
    in this respect, and at the same time show wherein the true Christian goes 
    beyond him.</p>
<p align="justify">1. A person may be under heavy exercise of soul after the 
    commission of some sin, especially a gross sin, and yet be but a Christian 
    in the letter. This is manifest in the case of Judas. Though there are some 
    sins, which every unsanctified heart makes no bones of yet there are some 
    which may stick in the throat even of a person void of the grace of God; 
    nay, more, in this exercise of soul there may be,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Great restlessness and anxiety of mind, which the 
    person cannot divert, as he was accustomed to do.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Indignation at himself, for doing as he has done.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) A taking shame to himself before men, by a plain and 
    open confession of guilt, Matthew 27:3, 4. Lastly, Strong resolutions to 
    guard against that sin in all time to come. Thus, Exodus 9:27, in which 
    Pharaoh was morally serious, speaking as he thought in the time.—But here 
    there are four things wanting, which are to be found in the exercises of 
    true Christians after their falls into sin.—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Kindly humiliation of soul before the Lord. The 
    Christian in spirit sees not only an evil in sin which affrights him, but a 
    loathsomeness in it which turns his stomach at it, as being contrary to 
    God's holy nature and will: Job 42:5, 6, "I have heard of you by the hearing 
    of the ear, but now mine eye sees you: wherefore I abhor myself, and repent 
    in dust and ashes. He owns himself unworthy of God's grace, and casts 
    himself down at the Lord's feet, stopping his mouth from quarreling with 
    God, however he dispose of him, Psalm, 51:4.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The dishonor done to God, and the grieving his 
    Spirit, is what does most touch the heart of the true Christian: Psalm 51:4, 
    "Against you, you only have I sinned, and done this evil in your sight; that 
    you might be justified when you speak, and be clear when you judge." The 
    consideration of God's glorious majesty, his loving-kindness and gracious 
    benefits towards the person, furnish a quiver of arrows to pierce his heart, 
    and he calls himself beast and fool for thus requiting the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) No peace will that person have, but that which God 
    himself speaks, and what flows from the application of the Redeemer's blood, 
    Romans 1:5. Others may be for peace at any rate, build up their peace on 
    their sorrows, repentance, and confession; but no peace for the true 
    Christian, until he get it under the covert of the blood of Christ, Hebrews 
    9:14.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Their exercises under their trials drive them out of 
    themselves to Christ for sanctification: Psalm 51:10, 11, "Create in me a 
    clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away 
    from your presence; and take not your holy Spirit from me;" whereas trials 
    drive others into themselves, as resolved, that if God, for Christ's sake, 
    will but pardon their sin, they will see to their own holiness of life; 
    after which, in some, they issue in faithless blind vows against such and 
    such sins, not sensible of their own weakness, and not fleeing to Christ 
    under a sense of it. But the true Christian will be equally concerned for 
    sanctification of his spirit, as justification of his person by blood, 
    knowing he equally needs both.—In like manner,</p>
<p align="justify">2. A person may have a great struggle in himself against 
    sin, and against temptation to it, and yet be but only a Christian in the 
    letter. It is a dangerous mistake to think, that every inward struggle 
    against sin is the combat between the flesh and the spirit. Herod had no 
    small struggle with himself, before he could yield to the beheading of John, 
    Matthew 14:9. Pilate also, before he could yield to the condemning of 
    Christ. Nay, a hypocrite may not only have this struggle, but may carry the 
    day against the temptation, in so much that he will not yield to it. This is 
    clear in the case of Balaam, when all Balak's entreaties and rewards could 
    not engage him to curse Israel.—There are five things wherein the true 
    Christian goes beyond the hypocrite in this respect.—As,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) His struggle arises from the new nature, with which 
    he is endowed; he has an habitual bent to holiness, and an aversion to evil: 
    Galatians 5:17, "For the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit 
    against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that you 
    cannot do the things that you would." The hypocrite's struggle does arise 
    only from a slavish fear, or at best from a civil disposition, which is 
    easily overcome, as being but a part of the old nature, and so reaches but 
    to some things.—Which brings me to observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That a true Christian's struggle is against all sin, 
    everything which is discovered by him to be sin, of whatever sort it be, 
    whether it be of those which are more gross or more subtle, those that are 
    brought to the light by some external action, or those that are in the soul 
    or spirit only: thus the psalmist: Psalm 119:128, "Therefore I esteem all 
    your precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate every false 
    way." Hence the struggle of the true Christian is against unbelief, the 
    actings and workings of self in the various shapes which it assumes, and 
    against predominant idols. But the struggle of others is confined to the 
    grosser kinds of sin, and is never taken up against all known sin, but only 
    against someone lust or other, which has often at length a respite given to, 
    or rather league concluded with it. A hypocrite gives evidence that the 
    cause of this war is not a natural antipathy, as in the true Christian, but 
    an accidental quarrel.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The Christian's struggle tends to the mortification 
    and extirpation of sin, the plucking up of it by the roots, the destroying 
    of the tree with its fruit, Galatians 5:24. It tends to no less than the 
    perfection of sanctification, and the utter abolition of sin as the cause of 
    this war. This the new nature lusts and longs after, and cannot be satisfied 
    to lay down the sword while there is a Canaanite in the land; and since it 
    is not obtained in this life, the war is continued until death make the 
    sword drop, and victory is obtained: Philippians 3:13, 14, "Brethren, I 
    count not myself to have apprehended; but this one thing I do, forgetting 
    those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which 
    are before, I press toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of 
    God in Christ Jesus." The other is not so violent, but strives only to 
    repress certain lusts which are troublesome or dishonorable.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) The Christian's struggle prevails, to the 
    constituting of the habitual course of his life, a holy course. This is the 
    chief strain in which he runs on, although mixed with many slips, John 3:9, 
    10; so that he has that noble testimony with the apostle, "that with 
    simplicity, and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace 
    of God, we have had our conversation in the world," 2 Corinthians 1:12. But 
    the other still lives a life habitually unholy.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) The Christian's struggle is between a new and 
    gracious quality in the will, and the old corrupt inclinations, its 
    neighbors there, whose reign is broken, though their molestation still 
    continue; Galatians 5:17, "For the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the 
    spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other; so 
    that you cannot do the things that you would." But the struggle of the 
    hypocrite is between his will and his partially enlightened conscience, 
    which takes up the cudgels against the corrupt will, and fights against it 
    with the fire and terror of a holy law; or, at most, between a slight 
    inclination of the will, and the reigning corrupt inclinations.—There is 
    farther to be considered,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That a person may be in great concern about his state, 
    and yet be but a Christian only in the letter. How is it possible that men 
    living under the clear light of the gospel, can but have some touches of 
    this? Felix was so troubled with it, that he trembled, Acts 24:25. Simon 
    Magus, Acts 8:24. Conversion begins here in the work of conviction; but 
    oftentimes it stops here, and goes no farther, Hosea 13:13. But I will say 
    more than this: a person may have such an exercise on his spirit about his 
    state, and it may be carried on from one step to another, in so much that, 
    in his own eyes, and the eyes of others, it may be taken for the work of 
    conversion, and yet after all he be a Christian only in the letter, and not 
    in the spirit.—Thus, for instance,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) He may have a law-work on his spirit, and yet may be 
    no true Christian. Had not Pharaoh and Felix deep conviction? and was not 
    Judas stung and pricked at the heart under the sense of his guilt? Legal 
    qualms of conscience may fill a man with terrors, sorrow, and anxiety, on 
    account of sin, who notwithstanding is never brought to Christ. The apostle 
    tells us, Galatians 4:24, that "the law genders to bondage." The covenant of 
    works brings forth children; but they are only bond-children, that is, 
    slaves, not sons, in their obedience to God. There are many pangs of 
    conscience in the world, which, though they may be taken for pangs of the 
    new birth, are nothing other than pangs of the second death. The matter lies 
    here: either the wound which the hypocrite gets, is over deep, as is the 
    case when it drives the person to utter despair, as it did Judas, so that he 
    neither closed, nor pretended to close, with Christ; or else it is not deep 
    enough, so that the work is marred, being but superficial; and he is like 
    the person who, without a foundation, built his house upon the sand, and the 
    storm, whenever it arose, swept it away, Luke 6:48. Between these two 
    extremes, in the middle way, the work is carried on for making a Christian 
    in spirit, and not in the letter only. The case of utter despair is 
    manifest; but to show that deepness of the soul's wound, which issues in 
    conversion, which is wanting in that which only issues in a person's 
    becoming a Christian in the letter, consider the nature of that wound which 
    is given in the work of grace.</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] It brings the soul to be content to part with all 
    sin, and to take Christ on any terms: Hosea 14:2, "Take with you words, and 
    turn to the Lord; say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us 
    graciously; so will we render the calves of our lips." Acts 9:6, "Lord, what 
    will you have me to do?" said Paul, trembling and astonished. The man is 
    content to expose the right-eye sin, that the Lord may pluck it out, and the 
    right hand, that it may be cut off. But the hypocrite, with all his 
    soul-exercise, is never brought this length. There is still someone bias of 
    the heart or other he is never content to have corrected. There is always 
    some idol of jealousy to be spared, some particular or other in Christ's 
    terms of salvation to which he cannot submit, Mark 10:21.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] The wound goes to the root of sin in the soul, 
    namely, the sin of our nature; Jeremiah 4:3, 4, "For thus says the Lord to 
    the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not 
    among thorns. Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins 
    of your hearts, you men of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem." He who is 
    only humbled for the sins of a wicked life, and some particular lusts in the 
    heart, which is the utmost of the hypocrite's attainment, in him the 
    serpent's heel may be bruised, but not his head. The sin of our nature is 
    the great reigning sin, and in the work of grace the Lord strikes at that 
    particularly, and makes the soul feel the intolerable weight of it: Romans 
    7:24, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this 
    death?" But as long as heart-corruption is untouched, as the man recovers 
    his peace, his sin will recover its strength.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The wound brings the soul to a sense of its absolute 
    need of Christ, and his whole salvation, for justification and also for 
    sanctification. This is the issue of kindly soul-exercise, namely, that thus 
    a person becomes poor in spirit, which the exercise of the hypocrite never 
    brings him to: Matthew 5:3, "Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is 
    the kingdom of Heaven." Right soul-exercise carries a man out of himself to 
    Christ for righteousness, roots up his confidence in himself, in his best 
    duties and dispositions, etc., breaks the marriage between him and the law, 
    that he may be married to Christ, without anything whatever to recommend 
    him: Galatians 2:19, 20, "For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I 
    might live unto God. I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live, yet 
    not I, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I 
    live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." 
    He also depends on Christ for sanctification, being persuaded of his utter 
    inability to do any good: Romans 7:18, "For I know that in me (that is, in 
    my flesh) dwells no good thing." And under the sense of this, the soul lies 
    down at the Lord's feet, as in Jeremiah 31:18, "You have chastised me, and I 
    was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke; turn you me, and I 
    shall be turned, for you are the Lord my God."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A person may have a common illumination in the 
    knowledge of Christ, and yet be but a Christian only in the letter: Hebrews 
    6:4, "For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have 
    tasted of the heavenly gift, &amp;c., if they fall away, to renew them again to 
    repentance." They may have such knowledge of Christ in his natures, person 
    and offices, as may enable them even to teach others, and edify them in the 
    knowledge of Christ, and yet be no true Christians themselves. Such were 
    Judas, Demas, and thousands of others in other ages of the Church. Great 
    gifts may be without grace; and there may be much heat, where there is no 
    sanctified warmth.—But there is a saying illumination, communicated to all 
    true converts, of which others never partake: John 4:10, "Jesus answered and 
    said unto her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, 
    Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you 
    living water." And it has these three characters.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Saving illumination discovers to the soul such a 
    suitableness in the mystery of Christ to the divine perfections and the 
    sinner's case, that the soul heartily falls in with, and acquiesces in the 
    glorious device of salvation by infinite wisdom: 1 Corinthians 1:24, "But 
    unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, 
    and the wisdom of God." They see that there is nothing wanting in it, which 
    is necessary to promote God's honor, or to answer their own miserable case, 
    but that it has a perfect suitableness to both; so that their awakened 
    consciences may find complete rest there; and hence they lay themselves 
    wholly for rest upon it, while the consciences of others, being awakened, 
    and their minds being still blinded, they never go to him only for rest, but 
    at best mix their own righteousness with his, and dare not trust to his 
    righteousness alone.—Saving illumination,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Discovers such a transcendent glory and excellence 
    in him, as that the soul is made content and determined to part with all for 
    him: Philippians 3:8, "Yes, doubtless, and I count all things but loss, for 
    the excellence of the knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord, for whom I have 
    suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win 
    Christ." It is a sad, but common question in the hearts, though, it may be, 
    not in the mouths, of unrenewed sinners, Song 5:9, "What is your beloved 
    more than another beloved, O you fairest among women? what is your beloved 
    more than another beloved, that you do so charge us?" Certain it is, that 
    the most refined hypocrite has always something that to him is dearer than 
    Christ, and which has more of his heart than He has. But the soul 
    enlightened with the light of life, beholds that in him which darkens all 
    created excellence, as the rising sun makes the stars hide their heads; so 
    that they will part with all lawful, as well as unlawful enjoyments, to win 
    him, Luke 14:26.</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] Saving illumination discovers such a fullness in 
    him, that the heart takes up its everlasting rest in him: Psalm 73:25, "Whom 
    have I in Heaven but you, and there is none upon earth that I desire besides 
    you." The returning prodigal sees bread enough and to spare in his father's 
    house; and the true convert sees a rest to his heart, as well as for his 
    conscience, in Christ, so that he is brought to be content with him alone, 
    as seeing him to be all in all. But this the hypocrite never comes to; the 
    divided heart must have Christ, and also some lust or other, or else no 
    contentment.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) A person may give a consent to the covenant, and in 
    some sort close with the Lord in his covenant, while, after all, he may be 
    only a Christian in the letter; and thus the work of conversion may seem to 
    be completed, as it would really be if they were sincere in so doing. A 
    hypocrite may expressly and solemnly covenant with God, by word or by writ, 
    and thus engage to be the Lord's. This is evident from the practice of the 
    Israelites: Exodus 14:8, "And all the people answered and said, All that the 
    Lord has spoken, we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto 
    the Lord."—Here we may observe, how full they are in their consent and 
    engagement, "All that the Lord has spoken, we will do." See also Exodus 
    20:19. But mark the Lord's own verdict on this covenanting; Deut 5:29, "O 
    that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep my 
    commandments always, that it might be well with them, and their children 
    forever!" Not only may all this be classed among the externals of religion, 
    but I shall add, for illustration, that persons may be morally serious in 
    their consent to the covenant, that is, thinking and resolving in the time 
    to do as they say. Moral seriousness is opposed to gross dissimulation, 
    which there was no place for here, Deuteronomy 5:24. Yet it may be where 
    there is no sincerity, Psalm 78:37. Of the same people it is said, "For 
    their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his 
    covenant." Hypocrites, in this case, are like those who, out of mere 
    simplicity, and ignorance of the worth of a thing, offer to buy it; but if 
    they really knew what it could not be sold under, they would never once bid 
    for it.—They may also consent to the covenant out of a real sense of their 
    sin and misery, and a conviction of their need of a Mediator, as in Exodus 
    20:19, "And they said unto Moses, Speak you with us, and we will hear; but 
    let not God speak with us, lest we die." There was the mountain on fire, for 
    a tribunal; the voice of a trumpet, summoning the criminals; terrible 
    thunders, to pronounce the sentence of death against them. This filled them 
    with horror and fear of death, and showed them the need of a Mediator. But 
    there are three things in which the Christian in spirit goes beyond the 
    Christian in the letter, in this point,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] He engages freely and heartily to the Lord in his 
    whole covenant. The hypocrite is but dragged and forced into it, when the 
    matter is seriously considered. They are not a willing people: Psalm. 78:34, 
    36, 37, "When he slew them, then they sought him; and they returned and 
    inquired early after God. Nevertheless they did flatter him with their 
    mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. For their heart was not 
    right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant." I doubt not 
    but a hypocrite may be very hearty in his consent to receive the comforts of 
    the covenant: Matthew 13:20, 21, "But he who received the seed into stony 
    places, the same is he who hears the word, and anon with joy receives it. 
    Yet he has not root in himself, but endures for a while." But if he consider 
    the duties of the covenant, there he sticks, and can come no other way to 
    the whole covenant, but as he is dragged: Romans 8:7, "Because the carnal 
    mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither 
    indeed can be."</p>
<p align="justify">When the Spirit enters into a person's heart, he takes 
    such hold of it, that the person is overcome by grace into willingness. Thus 
    it is said, Jeremiah 31:3, "Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love; 
    therefore, with loving-kindness have I drawn you." Then the person pours out 
    his heart like water: Psalm 62:8, "Pour out your heart before him: God is a 
    refuge for us." Terror may begin the work, but love crowns it: Hosea 2:14, 
    "Therefore, behold I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and 
    speak comfortably unto her."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) While the person's heart consents to the covenant 
    with the Lord, it is divorced from sin; but the hypocrite consents to the 
    covenant with a heart glued to his lusts: Psalm 45:10, "Hearken, O daughter, 
    and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your own people and your 
    father's house." It is an ill-made second marriage, where there is neither 
    death nor divorce from the first husband; and this is the cause of apostasy, 
    men going back to their lusts, because they never freely parted with them. 
    What makes a man and his lusts one, is, the greedy hold the heart takes of 
    them; the heart cleaves to them: Jeremiah 8:5, "Why, then, is the people of 
    Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, 
    they refuse to return." But the bond is loosed by divine grace, and their 
    liking is turned to loathing; though sin cleaves to them, they cleave not to 
    it: Romans 7:21, 22, "I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is 
    present with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man." In 
    which case, it is not only put out of the life, but out of the heart.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) In covenanting with God, the person resigns himself 
    absolutely to the Lord, the hypocrite never without reserves. The sincere 
    soul absolutely gives up itself,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) To the yoke of his commandments, Psalm 119:128, 
    "Therefore, I esteem all your commandments, concerning all things to be 
    right, and I hate every false way." But there is someone duty or other the 
    hypocrite's heart cannot digest, as in Mark 10:21.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The soul gives up itself to the providential will of 
    God, Luke 14:26. He is content to bear his cross, as well as to wear his 
    crown; but there is always something in the cross to which the hypocrite 
    cannot submit.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) And lastly, A person may be in the exercise of 
    religious duties, may be much enlarged and affected, and yet only a 
    Christian in the letter, Hebrews 6:4. Many get a taste of gospel-benefits, 
    who never digest them, this taste arising only from common operations of the 
    Spirit on an unrenewed heart; and a person may, at a time, get another 
    heart, who never gets a new heart. Thus it was with Saul, 1 Samuel 10:9.—As 
    to this, I would observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In the general, that a hypocrite may have a mighty 
    enlargement in duties, and be much affected in them. That there may be a 
    great stir and motion among the affections, while the stony heart does yet 
    remain, is plain from the case of the stony-ground hearers, Matthew 13:20, 
    and the many instances of joys and sorrows raised in unrenewed hearts by the 
    word. Many lay a great deal of weight on this, that they are not always 
    alike in duties: Sometimes they are bound up, sometimes enlarged; sometimes 
    they drive heavily in them, sometimes they have a great deal of comfort and 
    pleasure in them. But, do not such swallow down this as an evidence of the 
    grace of God without examination?—To understand this, consider, that there 
    is an enlargement in the exercise of a gift, as well as in the exercise of a 
    grace; and the one may be mistaken for the other, 2 Corinthians 2:13–15. 
    Thus also God both enlarged and straitened king Saul in gifts: And as the 
    gifts of others, well exercised in holy things, may greatly delight a man, 
    as in Ezekiel 33:32, "And Io, you are unto them as a very lovely song of one 
    that has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument;" so much more 
    may the exercise of one's own gift with ease and readiness, delight the 
    person's self.—Consider also, that the power of a deluded fancy may produce 
    this, as in the stony ground hearers, Matthew 13:20. As a man may have a 
    great deal of pleasure in a dream, or in a misconception, so a deceived 
    heart may make a person feed very sweetly upon ashes, and never suspect that 
    there is a lie in his right hand, Isaiah 44:20. Do we not read of a fire of 
    men's own kindling, which, though it may mightily comfort them for a time, 
    yet ends in sorrow and darkness, Isaiah 1:11.—Consider, in a word, that 
    there are common influences of the Spirit which are not sanctifying, which 
    may produce a mighty commotion among the affections, Hebrews 6:4, 5, 6. Even 
    signal providences will have this effect on unrenewed hearts, whether they 
    he in mercy or in judgment: Psalm 78:34. When he slew them, then they sought 
    him; and they returned and inquired early after God." These things come like 
    a summer-shower, which wets the surface of the earth, and makes every 
    channel run for a while, but is quickly again dried up.—Now, the difference 
    between the Christian in the spirit in his gracious enlargement in duties, 
    and the Christian in the letter in his delusive enlargements in duty, may be 
    seen in these two particulars—</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Gracious enlargements tend always to the killing and 
    mortifying of self, that grand competitor with Christ: 1 Chronicles 29:14, 
    "But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so 
    willingly after this sort? for all things come of you, and of your own have 
    we given you." The hypocrite's enlargements feed and nourish it, swelling 
    the heart with pride and self-conceit: Isaiah 58:3, "Wherefore have we 
    fasted, say they, and you see not? Wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and 
    you take no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast, you find pleasure, 
    and exact all your labors." The more a person is graciously enlarged in 
    duties, the more his sinfulness, weakness, wants, and nothingness appear, 
    notwithstanding all his meltings, mournings, humiliations, etc. But the 
    hypocrite, the more he is enlarged, appears to himself the more worthy that 
    Christ should do great things for him; and he becomes the less self-denied.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Gracious enlargements are sanctifying; they promote 
    holiness in heart and life: Zechariah 12:10, "And I will pour upon the house 
    of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and 
    supplications; and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they 
    shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in 
    bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born." They 
    are a burning, as well as a shining light, and make persons more tender in 
    all moral duties to God and man. If one has been taken into the temple of 
    God in duties, it will appear about him in the substantials of morality. He 
    will fear sin more, and be more exercised to keep a conscience void of 
    offence towards God and towards men. But delusive enlargements have not this 
    effect. On the contrary, they readily leave people more proud, peevish, and 
    selfish, often making them such sons of Belial, that a person cannot speak 
    to them; and never strike at inward beloved lusts to mortify them.</p>
<p align="justify">2. But to be more particular,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) A hypocrite may be mach affected with sorrow for sin 
    in his duties. All mourners are not true mourners, Zechariah 7:3. One may 
    hear the word, or pour out a prayer with wet cheeks, and yet have a whole 
    heart, a heart far from being broken for sin. Esau was in a flood of tears, 
    seeking the blessing. Many times, where water goes out in their case, wind 
    enters in. It is not always humbling grace that produces tears. Some are of 
    soft dispositions, and easily wrought upon by a melancholy object, without 
    any efficacy of grace, like the daughters of Jerusalem, Luke 23:27, and 
    downwards. Some, of most rugged dispositions, because their affections are 
    vehement in any case, may be thus touched and affected, and yet there be 
    nothing more than the product of nature. Thus, when David showed him mercy, 
    even Saul lifted up his voice, and wept, 1 Samuel 24:16. But the difference 
    between the Christian and the hypocrite lies here,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That the chief ground of the true Christian's sorrow 
    for sin is, the offence and dishonor done to a holy gracious God, as a 
    sincere child is moved with his father's displeasure and dishonor: Psalm 
    51:4, "Against you, you only, have I sinned, and done this evil in your 
    sight: that you might be justified when you speak, and be clear when you 
    judge." But the hypocrite's chief ground is selfish, because of the evils to 
    which he has thereby exposed himself, whether in time or eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The hypocrite's sorrow is soon over; it is but a 
    flash, and away: and he goes back again, if not to the same sins, yet to 
    others no less offensive to God. His sorrow never goes the length to loose 
    the bonds of wickedness; Isaiah 58:5, 6, "Is it such a fast that I have 
    chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a 
    bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? will you call this a 
    fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the fast that I have 
    chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to 
    let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?" It is not so with 
    the godly: Lamentations 3:49, 50, "My eye trickles down, and ceases not, 
    without any intermission: until the Lord look down, and behold from Heaven." 
    Their sorrow for sin is habitual, because the body of sin still remains, and 
    this sorrow influences them to war against all sin.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A hypocrite may have a kind of love to God and 
    Christ, and a desire after grace and good things. Hence Paul prays for grace 
    to "them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity," Ephesians 6:24. The 
    Christian in the letter may say, "Lord, evermore give us this bread," John 
    6:34, and join the foolish virgins in their desire to partake of the oil of 
    the wise. But the difference between the Christian and the hypocrite here 
    lies—</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] That a hypocrite may love God as his benefactor, as 
    one who does him good every day, and from whose hands he looks for good in 
    time coming, either for time or for eternity, Malachi 3:1. This is to love 
    God for one's self. But the true Christian loves him, not only because of 
    his benefits, but because of his lovely nature, his perfect holiness, truth, 
    hatred of sin, etc. This is to love God for himself: Psalm 30:4, "Sing unto 
    the Lord, O you saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his 
    holiness." And this the unholy heart can never do, Romans 8:7, "Because the 
    carnal mind is enmity against God." Now, they that love God thus, they love 
    his image, wherever it appears, and particularly in the holy law even where 
    it strikes against that sin which most easily besets them: Romans 7:22, "For 
    I delight in the law of God after the inward man."—The difference lies,</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] That they may desire grace, for its necessity in 
    order to save them, but not for its intrinsic beauty and likeness to the 
    Lord: Matthew 5:7, "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after 
    righteousness, for they shall be filled." It is the chief thing the true 
    Christian desires, grace to be holy, as well as grace to be justified and 
    pardoned: Psalm 27:4, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I 
    seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my 
    life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple."—The 
    difference lies,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, That a hypocrite may have much joy and delight in 
    the duties of religion; so had the stony ground hearers, Matthew 
    13:20—Isaiah 58:2, "Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as 
    a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinances of their 
    God; they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in 
    approaching to God." There may be delusive raptures of joy, as well as 
    unsound floods of sorrow. I showed very lately the difference between 
    genuine joy and these delusive raptures. True joy rises orderly, after a 
    preceding rending effect on the heart, etc; delusive joy more quickly, &amp;c.—I 
    now come,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To make some short improvement.—I have endeavored to 
    lay before you the differences between the hypocrite and the sincere 
    Christian; and from the whole, I think you may carry away these lessons.—We 
    may hence see,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That it is no easy thing to be a Christian. A parcel 
    of external performances do not make a Christian, nay nor even internal 
    things also, without the genuine spirit of duties, performances, and 
    attainments: that the great thing which makes the difference is, not so much 
    what is done, as how it is done, the principles, ends, manner, etc. of doing 
    it.—We may learn,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That a man may go a very great length in religion, and 
    notwithstanding be naught in God's esteem. A person may look so like a true 
    Christian, that he may deceive both saints and sinners like him who is said 
    to have made an image with such motion, that others thought it had life. 
    Nay, I know not but he may deceive the devil himself: Jeremiah 17:9, "The 
    heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know 
    it?" like him who is said to have painted grapes so lively, that the birds 
    came and picked at them. He may deceive himself like the Laodiceans, and go 
    to death with the delusion, like the foolish virgins.—We may learn,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That however far the hypocrite goes, the true 
    Christian goes beyond him; and therefore we must not, we ought not, to 
    satisfy ourselves as to the point of sincerity, unless there be something in 
    us which is not to be found in hypocrites. And therefore I exhort you to put 
    yourselves to the trial. Try yourselves whether you be in Christ or not, 
    whether you be sincere Christians or not.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) True religion is very rare at all times: Matthew 
    7:14, "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leads unto life, and 
    few there be that find it." The miserable decay and untenderness among all 
    sorts of persons, show it to be especially rare at this time, in which we 
    may say, "Help, Lord, for the godly man ceases; for the faithful fail from 
    among the children of men," Psalm 12:1.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That we are like to see trying times, in which the 
    Lord will set his furnace in Zion. God has appeared often seasonably and 
    wonderfully for our deliverance; but the generation is not bettered, but 
    rather growing worse and worse in all points. This is a forerunner of a 
    fearful stroke. Now, Sirs, a show of religion may do in a time of ease and 
    peace, but when that trial comes, it will be hard to bear up without the 
    reality.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That death and judgment will try us all. We may put 
    off the trial as we will for a time, there is however no shifting of it 
    altogether. God will not be mocked.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, That it will be a terrible disappointment to be 
    awakened out of dreams of Heaven, by falling into Hell. It will be no time 
    to seek oil, when the Bridegroom is come, and has shut the door. We have in 
    view an ordinance that calls to self-examination: 1 Corinthians 11:28, "But 
    let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of 
    that cup." Therefore bestir yourselves, and consider your state. Study the 
    spirituality of religion, that you may thus approve yourselves to the 
    heart-searching God. Amen.</p>
