        <p align="justify">Thomas Boston, 1676–1732</p>
        <p align="justify">February 9, 1718</p>
        <p align="justify">
          <br />
          Numbers 32:23 "Be sure your sins will find you out!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THIS verse contains a fair warning which Moses gives to the
          Reubenites, in case they should dare to be false in the business in
          hand. This warning has two parts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. A protestation, in which he solemnly declares, that they should be
          guilty before God, in case they acted falsely, and should desert their
          brethren in the wars of Canaan. He tells them God is their party, and
          so doing they would not only wrong their brethren, which they might
          think was all, but they would dishonor God and make him their enemy.
          Behold, you have sinned against the Lord. As if he had said, Remember
          you will affront God by it, and bring guilt upon your consciences
          before the Lord. We may here observe that in all sinful practices, God
          is the great object with whom we have to do as the offended party.
          Thus when David had defiled Bathsheba, and murdered Uriah, and thus
          awfully injured them both, yet in confessing his guilt he says,
          "Against you, you only have I sinned and done this evil in your
          sight." Iniquity does not only spread its offence on earth, but it
          strikes against Heaven too, and that chiefly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In the warning there is a certification, in which he assures them
          that God and they should reckon for it in case they acted falsely.
          Here the end of that sinful practice is represented, Your sin has
          found you out. This implies that they would as it were hide themselves
          from their sin, when they had committed it, they would make many
          shifts to soothe themselves and cover the matter. They would take the
          sinful sweet of it, and when they had done this, they would stave off
          the blame, shame, and punishment of it. But in vain. He assures them
          it shall dog them at the heels, until it overtake and find them out.
          He gives them proper notification that this would be the end of it. Be
          sure your sin will find you out. Know you your sin: it shall find you
          out. Think on it beforehand, that it will get up with you at length.
          This is the nature of sin, will not hide by any means always, under
          any cover but one, the righteousness of a Redeemer. Let sinners bury
          it if they can, let them dig deep as Hell to hide it, it will have a
          resurrection, it will appear sooner or later as a terrible Spirit to
          them. And be sure your sin will find you out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine—One time or other sin will find out the sinner.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In prosecuting this doctrine I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Show how sinners shift this meeting, that their sins may not find
          them out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. In what respects sin shall find out the sinner.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Whence it is that sin certainly will find out the sinner. I am
          then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To show how sinners shift this meeting, that their sins may not
          find them out. Sinners are in their hearts utterly averse to be found
          out by their sins, and they have many shifts for that vain purpose.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. They will excuse and justify their sin as if there were no evil in
          them. They will cast some fair cloak over foul actions, that their sin
          may pass for a lawful thing. Thus Saul and his army, "took of the
          spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been
          utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord God in Gilgal." This was
          their pretense to cover their covetousness. This in many cases is done
          in the world; persons defending their sinful practices and will not be
          convinced of the evil of them. And even in other cases, persons may
          attain to such a degree of blindness, that they get their consciences
          soothed in atrocious crimes, as if there were little or no evil in
          them. "God gives them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things
          which are not convenient."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They will carry the matter so quickly as that it shall be hidden
          from the eyes of the world, while in the meantime God's watchful eye
          is still upon them, though they do not regard it. "And Ephraim said,
          yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labors
          they shall find none iniquity in me, that were sin." Many make such
          use of sacred places and darkness, for their wicked purposes, as will
          banish them out of God's secret place, and bring them into eternal
          darkness, if a miracle of grace pluck not the brands out of the
          burning, and their sin in time find them out, Job 24:15, 16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. They will deny it when charged upon them, and so cover one sin with
          another. "They wipe their mouth and say we have done no wickedness." O
          what pains do many take to ruin their own souls. Credit before the
          world is bought at prodigious rates of soul, and consciences, lies,
          and perjury. It is no wonder the consciences of some be dead and
          seared as with a hot iron, when they so often speak in opposition to
          them, to cover their sins.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, They will keep out of the way, where their sin is most likely
          to find them out. They live strangers to themselves, dare not examine
          themselves impartially; they avoid communing with their own hearts and
          consciences as with their greatest enemy. And there is no doubt that
          this makes many to apostatize and give up with all duties of religion,
          especially secret duties, for they have no confidence in God, and
          their hearts condemn them. We now proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To show in what respects sin shall find out the sinner. An
          offended God appoints the meeting, and will see it kept, so as the
          sinner shall not always shift, but his sin shall give him a dreadful
          after-meeting. And that often in time, always in eternity. The sin of
          Cain, of Saul, of Judas, soon found them out. And what many have hoped
          to cover, has been to their confusion discovered before the world. But
          however long the meeting may be put off, it will never be put off
          beyond death, there is a day coming will declare the secrets of
          sinners; for in that day God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus
          Christ. And God makes the sins of some to find them out in time, that
          it may appear there is a God to judge on earth, and he allows others
          to go on, that it may appear there is an after reckoning.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Now God makes sin find out the sinner,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. By discovering and bringing to light their works of darkness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          "For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hidden
          that shall not be known." They have too strong a party, that have a
          watchful eye of providence to wrestle against in hiding their sin. God
          can employ a bird of the air to carry the voice, yes, can make the
          sinner as he did Judas put out himself, and turn his own accuser.
          Joseph's brethren got their sin covered for several years, and when
          they thought they were out of hazard of meeting, it, it appears to
          them in Egypt like a terrible Spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          By laying the shame of it upon their faces before the world, as he has
          done with many who thought themselves secure enough from it, "Fill
          their faces, says the Psalmist, with shame, that they might seek your
          name, O Lord." God has so united sin and shame together, that shame
          shall certainly follow sin, in time or in eternity. Many are a shame
          to the profession of Christianity, but God will at length turn it back
          on themselves. They think much to bear their shame now in time, but
          how much more confounding will it be, to have their shame proclaimed
          before the world of angels and men at the great day, after which
          impenitent sinners shall never lift up their head. Thus "they shall
          awake to shame and everlasting contempt."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. By presenting sin in its native colors to their awakened
          consciences. This the Lord did with Cain and Judas. Satan and the
          wicked heart dress up sin in such a manner as it appears lovely to the
          sinner. But the day will come, when God will tear off the false
          ornaments, the paint and the varnish from it, and make it appear the
          most horrible spectacle that ever the sinner saw. The thirty pieces of
          silver made a horrid treachery to appear small to Judas; but when his
          conscience awakened on him, it was guilt that sunk him, he was not
          able to stand under it. So also Cain was made to say that his
          punishment was greater than he was able to bear.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, By giving them the due reward of his works. "Woe unto the
          wicked! It shall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be
          given him." The time of our life is a sowing time. Sin is a seed, that
          though it may be long hidden under ground, yet will bring a doleful
          harvest at length. "For he who sows to the flesh, shall of the flesh
          reap corruption." The brim of the cup of sin may be sweet, but bitter
          will the dregs be, which the sinner shall surely be made to drink. The
          hand of vengeance may be long in striking, but it will strike at
          length. And however easily the sinner may run into arrears, it will
          bring a fearful reckoning.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And God will make the punishment one way or another to answer the sin,
          so as the sinner shall find that his sin has found him out God has
          many ways of writing people's sin in their punishment, that they shall
          be obliged to own that God remembers their sin against them, and
          sometimes as Adoni-bezek they are unable to say, as I have done, so
          God has requited me. The Sodomites burned in lust, and they were
          burned with fire and brimstone. Let us now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Show whence it is that sin certainly will find out the sinner.
          How can it be otherwise, if we consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That none can sin without witnesses, who will surely at length
          discover the sin. Let sinners choose the most secret place for their
          works of darkness, they have always two witnesses present with them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Conscience within their own breast, is as a thousand witnesses, whose
          testimony one cannot get denied. Their conscience also bears witness,
          and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one
          another. Conscience may be a very silent witness for a time, but
          though it be silent it is not quite idle. It writes down the sinner's
          wickedness and keeps it on record, which record will be read, when the
          sinner with his guilt is set before the Judge here or hereafter, when
          the books are opened and the black book of conscience among others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The other witness is the omniscient God, whose eye is always upon the
          sinner. "Where shall I go from your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from
          your presence?" Who can hide his thoughts from him that searches the
          heart? and to what place can the sinner go, where God is not before
          him? Darkness and light are alike to him. And how can the crime escape
          discovery, where the Judge and Lawgiver himself is witness. Little do
          sinners think of this, because God does not strike them down in an
          instant. But this witness will speak to their terror and confusion at
          length.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. God has said it. "For God shall bring every work into judgment,
          with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. If
          you do well, shall you not be accepted? And if you do not well, sin
          lies at the door." It is then his will, that sin shall find out the
          sinner, and who can hope to hide what God will have brought to light.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Use 1. Of information. This lets us see,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That an evil conscience is a sad companion, and guilt lying within
          the breast unrepented of, will break out sadly at length, to the
          sinner's confusion. It made Cain a burden to himself, Genesis 4:13. A
          good conscience is the sweetest support, and gives the greatest case
          in the world. But no rack like to that of an ill conscience,
          completely awakened. Many a secret blow it gives the sinner, that the
          world knows not of.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. God is a just God, and will not be mocked, nor can he be blinded.
          "Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows that
          shall he also reap." Let men run on in sin as long as they will, God
          will call them to an account at last, and they shall see that God did
          not overlook their sins, though he did not presently strike. He has a
          concern for his honor and his holy law, which sinners trample under
          foot, and he will fill their faces with shame that do so, and
          vindicate his glory at their cost.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. There is a watchful eye of providence over the world that never
          closes, but takes notice of all men's actions at all times and in
          every place. And he brings secret things to light, at the time in
          which it may bring most glory to himself, and most confusion to the
          impenitent sinner. God loves to take hopeless cases in hand, and when
          all probable means fail, then to stretch forth his own arm and work,
          that it may be seen that it is his own work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Use 2. Of warning. I would hence warn all,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. To take heed when you think you stand, lest you fall. The way of
          sin is down the hill, it is easy to go downward, but there may be
          broken bones before you get up again.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Please not yourselves in that you get your sins covered, and hidden
          from the eyes of men. For though you may prosper a while in that
          course, yet your feet may slip at last. And if you do not find
          yourselves sometimes caught in the snare, your sin will find you out,
          it will fare with you as it never did with any before you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Indulge not yourselves in secret sins, for the day will come, that
          what is done in secret, shall be proclaimed on the house tops. And
          hide your shame as long as you will, it will one day cover you in
          mercy or in wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Let us all labor to find out our sins, lest they find us out.
          We must meet them. Better seek them out that we may carry them to the
          sea of the Redeemer's blood, than to stay until they find us out,
          which may plunge us into seas of wrath. Amen.
        </p>
        <p align="justify"> </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I have spoken to the two first general heads. I shall now proceed,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. To inquire more particularly than we have yet done, into the
          Lord's making sin find out the sinner. This is one of these things in
          which the providence of God does shine most illustriously; upon which
          unbiased spectators must say, "This is the finger of God, and truly
          there is a God to judge upon the earth." Consider here,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. The general kinds of sin, which the Lord makes to find out the
          sinner. As for open sins confessed by the sinner, I need not speak of
          these, the sinner meets with them every day. But,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Sins which men will not own to be sins; the Lord makes to find out
          the sinner. "These things have you done, and I kept silence; you
          thought that I was altogether such an one as yourself: but I will
          reprove you, and set them in order before your eyes." The crucifying
          of Christ, the Jews would not allow to be their sin, in their
          blindness they denied the charge. But when the Spirit of the Lord
          comes, he makes them own it. Thus Peter addressed them, "Therefore let
          all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made that same
          Jesus, whom you crucified both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
          this they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter, and to the
          rest of the apostles, men and brethren what shall we do?" In a time of
          defection and apostasy from the Lord, men stand out against
          conviction, they will not take with their sin. But afterwards when God
          arises to plead, he opens up the putrefying sores and makes men's
          folly appear to them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Secret sins to which no man is witness, the Lord makes them find
          out the sinner. "You have set our iniquities before you, our secret
          sins in the light of your countenance." The sinner pleases himself
          with this, that no eye sees him. But God makes the world hear well of
          it at length. And what is done in secret, he brings forth in the face
          of the sun. How secret was Onan's sin, but the stroke of God reached
          him for it. For the most secret sins are open to an omniscient God,
          and he will make the sinner find it so.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. The time in which the Lord makes sin to find out the sinner. Times
          and seasons are in the Lord's hand, and the time fixed by his
          providence is always the best time, and whoever considers
          circumstances will be obliged to own it. The best time for his own
          honor, and for the conviction of the sinner in mercy or in wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sometimes the sinner is found out presently, God takes the sinner
          instantly in his sin. Thus "when Jeroboam put forth his hand from the
          altar, against the man of God, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand
          which he put forth against him dried up, so that he could not pull it
          in again to him." As soon as they go off the way, the lion finds them,
          as soon as they break over the hedge the serpent bites them. This is
          necessary to keep the world within some tolerable bounds of morality,
          otherwise profanity and wickedness would overflow all banks. Sometimes
          the sinner is not found out until long after. It was about three
          months before Judah's sin found him out: "When he was told that Tamar
          his daughter-in-law had played the harlot, and was with child by
          whoredom." Nay, it may go on years, many years, and never appear all
          the time, and yet find them out at length, before they leave this
          world. A person's sin may have as much time, before it find them out,
          as in the sinner's own opinion it may be dead and rotten, and in no
          hazard of rising to disturb them. It was at least long twenty years
          before the sin of Joseph's brethren found them out. Sins of youth may
          put off the encounter until old age and death arrive.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. The place, where sin finds out the sinner. Many times there is
          much of God seen in this, and God reserves the discovery always to the
          fittest place. "For he is a rock, his work is perfect; for all his
          ways are judgment; a God of truth, and without iniquity; just and
          right is he." And he can make the sinner's own feet carry him to the
          place of this sad tryst, and heavy meeting, while he has no mind of
          any such thing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. God can make sin find out the sinner sometimes, where he can have
          least support under the awful meeting with his sin. Thus God sent
          Joseph's brethren to Egypt, a strange land, that their sin might find
          them out, Genesis 42:21. They were now far from their friends and
          relations, who might have comforted them, under any distress which
          they saw them under. But stripped of all comforters, their consciences
          have leisure to toss them to purpose. Thus the sinner leaves God for
          his sin, and God leaves the sinner alone with his sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Where they may have least help to shift their sins finding them
          out. Thus there is no word of Judah's sinful companion, Hirah the
          Adullamite, when his sin finds him out. Providence it seems parted
          them on that occasion; otherwise he who had helped Judah to cover his
          sin before, might have helped him now, to have denied and concealed
          it, notwithstanding of the speaking evidences of it. Companions in sin
          are oft times farthest to seek when their help is most needed, and
          some time or other they will all prove physicians of no value.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Where it will confound the sinner most and pierce his heart most
          keenly. When Judah's daughter-in-law "was brought forth, she sent to
          her father-in law, saying, by the man whose these are am I with child;
          and she said, discern I pray you, whose are these, the signet, and
          bracelets, and staff. And Judah acknowledged them." Here the sin was
          discovered publicly in judgment before many witnesses, in whose sight
          the shame of the foul fact was spread on his face. Thus God makes
          secret sins, which no eye has seen committed, find out the sinner
          publicly before many witnesses, and in the face of the sun.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. The means by which the Lord makes sin find out the sinner. There
          is much of God seen in this also. He never wants means to discover the
          most secret sins, which he wishes to bring to light. Sometimes this is
          done,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. By the natural product of the sin, by which the sin is made to
          discover itself. Thus the sin of Judah and Tamar was discovered by her
          being with child. The bleating of the sheep and the lowing of the oxen
          discovered Saul's sin, which showed he had not performed the
          commandment of the Lord. Thus persons may go long on in sin, but a
          watchful providence makes their feet slide in due time, and their sin
          find them out, by fixing some mark to their sin by which the world may
          know it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. By some act of indiscretion and folly in the sinner himself. As in
          the case of Judah's signet, bracelets and staff given to Tamar. O the
          stupendous conduct of providence, in the infatuating of sinners,
          taking common discretion from them, that otherwise have abundance of
          hellish craft and subtlety for the hiding of their sin. Yet their eyes
          are, by the just judgment of God, withheld from seeing, what otherwise
          might have been easily perceived. And this will gall them to the heart
          afterwards, that they should have acted so foolishly, unless their
          hearts be touched with repentance. But who can retain the prudence,
          which God intends for his own holy purposes to take from them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. By some unforeseen accident which the sinner by his own utmost
          diligence could not prevent. "Curse not the king, no, not in your
          thought; and curse not the rich in your bed-chamber: for a bird of the
          air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the
          matter." Man's capacity is but narrow, there are many things which he
          cannot foresee. When he goes out of the way of God, he may, before he
          be aware, be caught fast in such a snare, as will hold him until his
          sin find him out. "For man also knows not his time: as the fishes that
          are caught in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the
          snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls
          suddenly upon them." There is no safety out of the path of duty. When
          persons go away from God, they make themselves many enemies, for every
          person and thing are enemies to them to whom God and their own
          consciences are enemies.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, By making their consciences restless, until their own mouths
          discover their own sin and shame. Witness Judas. The Lord never wants
          means to make sin find out the sinner, as long as there is a
          conscience within the sinner's breast. Much secret wickedness has thus
          been brought to light in the world. And we have had instances of it,
          where the guilty were forced to turn their own accusers, when none was
          charging them with it; yes, and when to all appearance there was no
          true repentance for the sin. However, conscience may sometimes be
          commanded and held down, God can easily make it so turbulent within
          one's breast, that it will no longer keep the secret of their sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          V. The way and manner of sin's finding out the sinner. This many a
          time is such, as must needs make men to say, This is the finger of
          God. Providence appoints the meeting, and wonderfully brings matters
          about for the keeping of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Often sin finds the sinner unexpectedly and surprisingly when they
          are not looking for it. How surprisingly did Judah's sin, and the sin
          of Joseph's brethren find them out. It meets the sinner like a Spirit
          in a moment, when he is not looking for it; and catches him before he
          can get his sinful craft collected to stave it off.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Often does the way which sinners take to hide their sin, prove the
          way of its finding them out. "The Lord is known by the judgment which
          he executes; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands." The
          means which they use for burying it out of sight, God makes the
          occasion of its rising upon them. How often have cunning contrivances
          of mischief turned on the heads of the contrivers, God catching the
          wise in their own craft, to his own glory and their confusion.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Sin always finds out the sinner securely, that there is none
          escaping, no getting beyond it, but the sinner is hedged in on every
          side. Cain felt the greatness of his punishment, but he could not
          escape from it. God's prisoners are kept fast, and though it may be
          long before he speak to the sinner, yet he will speak home at length.
          He may be long in beginning to reckon with the sinner, but he will
          make a thorough reckoning when he does begin. He says as in the case
          of Eli, "When I begin, I will also make an end."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, God's writing the sin upon the punishment, so that the sinner
          shall be forced to say, As I have done, so God has requited me. Thus
          God makes men's sins so to find them out, that they cannot fail to see
          that he remembers such a sin against them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sometimes the punishment is the same in kind with the sin: as in the
          case of Adoni-bezek. The same punishment was inflicted upon himself,
          which he had inflicted upon threescore and ten captive kings. Thus
          many that injure others have the same injury returned into their own
          bosom, and are treated in the same way that they have treated others.
          Thus Absalom did to David as he had done to Uriah. Pharaoh slew the
          first-born of the Israelites, and therefore God slew the first-born of
          Egypt. Pharaoh would have every new born son of Israel cast into the
          river, and God drowns him and all his host in the red sea.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sometimes there is a visible likeness between the sin and the
          punishment. The Sodomites burned with lust, and God sends fire and
          brimstone on them to burn them to ashes. Nadab and Abihu offered
          strange fire, and they were consumed with fire from before the Lord.
          Jacob beguiled his father, by pretending to be Esau, and Laban him, by
          palming Leah on him for Rachel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sometimes there is a certain relationship between the sin and the
          punishment. Jeroboam's hand withering, the belly of the adulteress
          swelling, and her thigh rotting. Companions of sin turning plagues and
          causes of woe to one another. Eli's indulgence to his sons was
          punished with the death of them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Finally, Sometimes there is a direct contrariety between the sin and
          the punishment. Thus God threatened the Israelites: "Because you
          served not the Lord your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of
          heart, for the abundance of all things; therefore shall you serve your
          enemies, which the Lord shall send against you, in hunger, and in
          thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things; and he shall put
          a yoke of iron on your neck, until he have destroyed you." Adam would
          be like God, and he became like the beast that perishes. David, proud
          of the number of his people, is punished with the loss of seventy
          thousand of them. The Jews crucify Christ to preserve their nation,
          and it ruins it entirely.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 1.—There is a God. The fool says in his heart and by his practice,
          there is none. But God is known by the judgments he executes. When we
          see in ourselves or others, sin thus finding the sinner out, we should
          be confirmed in the faith of that fundamental article of all religion.
          And oppose it to those temptations to atheism, which the corrupt heart
          raises from sinners prospering so long in a sinful course.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. There is a providence. That God is not an idle spectator, but a
          careful observer of human affairs. His eye is upon us at all times, in
          the dark as in the light; and secret sins are as open to him as those
          done in the face of the sun. Nothing can be hidden from his sight, but
          everything is open and manifest unto him. He looks on as a witness,
          and as a judge, and in due time discovers his hatred of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, He is a just God, that will at length show himself terrible to
          impenitent sinners. He will call sinners in due time to an account,
          and though he spare long he will not spare always. The sinner thinks
          that because God does bear with him long, therefore he is such a one
          as himself, that there is no such evil in sin as is pretended, and
          because sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily,
          therefore the heart of the sinner is set in him to do wickedly. But
          God will speak to the confusion of sinners in mercy or in wrath. Amen.
        </p>
        <p align="justify"> </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. I shall now confirm the doctrine. Here consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That no man can sin without witnesses. This has been already
          illustrated under the third head.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Consider that God both can and will make sin find out the sinner.
          How then can the sinner escape. Many a time atrocious crimes escape
          among men, because such as would, cannot find them out, and such as
          can, will not do it. But there is neither cannot, nor will not with
          God in this case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. God can do it. For he has everything necessary to qualify him to
          find out the guilty. He is privy to the most secret wickedness. "For
          the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the
          good." See what a discovery of secret wickedness the Lord makes to the
          prophet, Ezekiel 8:8–12. God sees what is in us, about us, or done by
          us, however it be concealed. And with God the most subtle contrivances
          for concealing of sin, are no better than the silly are of poor
          children, to turn their backs and cover their own eyes to hide
          themselves. The thickest covers which can be made for sin are so thin,
          that they hinder not the broad view of the omniscient eye. Again he
          never forgets, nay, he cannot forget, because of the perfection of his
          nature, and besides he has interposed a solemn oath in the matter.
          "The Lord, says the prophet Amos, has sworn by the excellency of
          Jacob, surely I will never forget any of their works." It may be long
          before a process be raised before the Lord; when it is called it may
          get a delay, through the long suffering of the Judge. But it never
          drops out of the records. "For the iniquity of Ephraim is bound up;
          his sin is hid." The Lord never forgets unpardoned iniquity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God also has all power to break through all opposition, which the
          sinner can by are or might lay in the way of his sins finding him out.
          For he is omniscient and omnipotent. The most subtle sinner he can
          outwit. "He takes the wise in their own craftiness; and the counsel of
          the froward is carried headlong." The most cunning deviser he can
          counter work. "He disappoints the devices of the crafty, so that their
          hands cannot perform their enterprise." And the most powerful and
          stubborn sinner he can break. "He is wise in heart, and mighty in
          strength; who has hardened himself against him and prospered." No
          counsel can avail against the Lord, "and by strength shall no man
          prevail, the adversaries of the Lord shall be broken in pieces; out of
          Heaven shall he thunder upon them."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. God will do it. For he has said it, his truth is engaged for it.
          "God is not a man, that he should lie, neither the son of man, that he
          should repent; has he said it, and shall he not do it." He has
          solemnly said it under a protestation in the text. So that either
          God's truth must fail, or the sinner's sin shall find him out. "For
          there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed, and hid, that
          shall not be known." And what are can hide what God's truth is engaged
          to bring to light? God says to the sinner covering his sin, as to
          Cain, if you do evil, sin lies at the door. Like a watch-dog ready to
          take the criminal by the throat, whenever he stirs out at the door,
          and this dog though it may sleep long at the door, will rise on the
          sinner at length. He that covers his sins shall not prosper.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It lies upon God's honor to make sin find out the sinner. Sinners
          getting away with their sins, run into a mistake to the dishonor of
          God; but God for his honor's sake, will rectify the mistake, though it
          will be to the sinner's cost. "These things have you done, says he,
          and I kept silence; you thought that I was altogether such an one as
          yourself; but I will reprove you, and set them in order before you."
          Men of honor in the world are concerned in a special manner for it, so
          that he who touches it, touches the apple of their eye. And can any
          think but God is very jealous for his honor. "I am the Lord; that is
          my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to
          graven images."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The honor of God's rectoral justice, by which he governs the world, is
          concerned in this matter. Shall not the judge of all the earth do
          right? Crimes allowed to pass unpunished, reflect on the justice of
          those under whose jurisdiction they are. The whole world is under
          God's jurisdiction. And how shall it be known that the righteous Lord
          loves righteousness, if sin do not sooner or later find out the
          sinner. And hence it comes to pass, that those who are most dear to
          God, their sins find them out also. "Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and
          Israel to the robbers? Did not the Lord, he against whom we have
          sinned." This, therefore, is given as the reason of God's publicly
          punishing David, 2 Samuel 12:12, 13. Though God answers his people and
          forgives them, Yet he takes vengeance on their inventions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This belongs also to the honor of his holiness, by which he is pure
          from, and hates with a perfect hatred, all iniquity. He is glorious in
          holiness. If he should not set a mark of his indignation against sin,
          one time or other, where would be the evidence of his perfect hatred
          of it? Do not they who join in covering sin, make themselves partakers
          of the guilt? And does not then the spotless holiness of God make it
          sure that sin shall find out the sinner. The honor also of his
          omniscience and providential vigilance require it. Therefore says
          Joshua to Achan, "My son, give I pray you, glory to the Lord God of
          Israel, and make confession unto him." It is the perverse reckoning of
          sinners upon God's long suffering and forbearance, that leads them to
          say, "The Lord sees us not; the Lord has forsaken the earth." And
          therefore, either sin must find out the sinner, or God will lose the
          glory of his omniscience. The sinner in his secret wickedness, robs
          God of that glory, but in open confession he restores it, thereby
          owning that since God knows it, it is all one as if all the world knew
          it, and therefore he confesses it before the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It concerns also the honor of this message delivered by his servants
          in his name to sinners. They are commanded to tell sinners that their
          sins will find them out. They are to say, "Woe unto the wicked! it
          shall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be given
          him." And it lies on the honor of God to confirm the words of his
          servants which they spoke on the credit of his word. Thus it is said,
          "And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his
          words fall to the ground." If sinners were not sometimes found out
          even in the world, men would turn atheists, and would not believe a
          word spoken to them in the name of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. History and observation afford abundant testimony to this grand
          truth, in the events that have appeared and do appear in the world in
          all ages. Many a practical commentary has providence written on our
          text in the shame and ruin of many a man and woman; although the
          brightest piece of it is reserved to be written out at the last day,
          when thousands of blanks that are in it shall be filled up. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. As to history. What profane history, written by Christians, Jews,
          Muhammadans or pagans, wants striking instances of this nature? But I
          shall confine myself to sacred history, where we have wonderful
          instances, first, of sins finding out sinful nations and societies. We
          have heard already of sins finding out the Sodomites and the
          Egyptians. The sinning angels wanted not wisdom to have hidden their
          sin, if it could have been hid, nor strength to have staved off the
          meeting, if any such thing could have been done: but it found them
          out, and put them in chains of darkness. The old world, it seems,
          thought the long tryst was fairly baulked. They continued in their
          usual courses, "Until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew
          not until the flood came and took them all away." Thus the meeting was
          kept. The sinful Benjamites twice shifted their sins finding them out.
          Hence says the prophet Hosea, referring to the history, Judges 20.
          "They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah,
          therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins."
          Accordingly the third time almost razed their name out of the earth.
          The Jews were appointed to give their land sabbatical years, Levit.
          25:4. But through covetousness they quite gave up the practice, and
          thought it was good economy and lawful gain; but before all was done
          their sin found them out. "To fulfill the word of the Lord by the
          mouth of Jeremiah," they were kept in captivity, "Until the land had
          enjoyed her Sabbaths; for as long as she lay desolate she kept
          Sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years." Afterward the Jews
          would make their court to the Romans, by crucifying Christ, but their
          sin soon found them out to their destruction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have instances also of sins finding out particular persons. How did
          sin find out the first sinner Adam, who would be as God, and became as
          the beasts, that perish, whom no tree or bush in the garden could hide
          from his offended God. Cain's secret murder of his brother haunted him
          like a Spirit, wherever he went. David's secret sins of adultery and
          murder, were set in the light, and proclaimed to all into whose hands
          the Bible comes. Nebuchadnezzar's pride, who was driven to dwell with
          beasts, and Herod eaten up of worms. And many other such instances of
          sins finding out the sinners might be mentioned.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. As to observation. Who sees not this often accomplished on others
          in their sight, or hear of it by frequent reports brought to their
          ears. What secret wickedness is there daily breaking forth, in some
          place or other, and set in the light, that has been done in the dark,
          and perhaps has been long hid. We have this day a fresh instance of
          God's discovering a course of secret wickedness, that for several
          years has spurned all methods of bringing the matter to light.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, who may not observe this in the course of providence with
          himself. How often does God make even the thoughts of the heart to
          meet the sinner, that never was ripened into action, so that all may
          know that God searches the reins and hearts. God often makes sin find
          out the sinner, when yet he does not carry the quarrel to the streets
          and blaze it abroad in the world. But it is that the sinner may know,
          that God will judge him. God knows it, and makes the sinner know, that
          he knows and remembers it too, by some secret check, perhaps quite
          unobserved, or unobservable by others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Use 1.—Of information. This informs us,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That there will be a day, in which God will yet plead his
          controversy with these lands, however long it be put off. The sins of
          Scotland and the sins of England will find them out, and God will
          treat with them as covenant breaking nations, whom he would have
          healed but they would not. The national perjury, blood of saints,
          contempt of the gospel, and profanity, with all the pieces of
          defection and backslidings, however covered and crusted over, will no
          doubt yet find out the nations, and all ranks of persons in church and
          state. And is never more ready to find them out, than when they are
          buried out of sight and people are saying, the bitterness of death is
          past.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. When we meet with any stroke or cross dispensation, we ought to
          read it in the sin at which it points and humble ourselves, else we
          fight against God. "O Lord, are not your eyes upon the truth? You have
          stricken them, but they have not grieved: you have consumed them, but
          they have refused to receive correction; they have made their faces
          harder than a rock, they have refused to return."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It should make us say, I remember my sin this day. And I think you and
          I both have reason to say so, when we think upon the astonishing
          course of providence with us this winter, in the matter of the Sabbath
          days, which God for the most part has made heartless, half silent
          Sabbaths to us. O let us lay this matter to heart and examine how we
          have improved Sabbaths and public ordinances, since on them God has
          stamped such a mark of his anger against us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Those whose sins have found them out have no reason to murmur, but to
          be thankful that God has checked them sooner than they thought. For
          sin must find out the sinner, and the sooner the better. Better now
          than in another world. Better now than upon the brink of eternity, or
          before the tribunal of God. Yes, but ill is good on trust, will the
          impenitent sinner say. But the proverb is ill applied here. For God
          will pay home the principal, with full interest for the time it has
          lain over, when he begins to reckon with the sinner, and then the
          sinner will change his mind.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Putting off the reckoning and delaying accounts pays no debt.
          Reprieves are not pardons. The debt of sin that is not confessed in
          God's way, and carried to the blood of Christ, to be swallowed up
          there, will neither die nor drown. The sinner will to his astonishment
          hear of it sooner or later, It will surely come, it will not tarry.
          Perhaps it has already lain over many years, and perhaps it may lie
          over as long yet; but be sure it will find you out at length. Old
          sores that have not been well cured will readily break out, and old
          guilt will soon or late bring fresh pain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Sin is a bastardly thing, that at sometime no body will desire to
          father. Adam sins and hides himself. Cain murders his brother but is
          averse to own it. So just and holy, so agreeable to the rational
          nature is the law of God, that the sinner is or will be self
          condemned. Therefore it will sometimes be a confounding question,
          "What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed?
          For the end of those things is death." Alas that we should be hurrying
          into those things of which we shall be ashamed, and lay up so much
          matter of future grief, shame and remorse to ourselves. Some indeed
          glory in their shame, but that brow of brass will at length be broken,
          when sinners shall awake to shame and everlasting contempt.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Whoever then will have the sweet of sin, must lay their accounts
          with the sour of it. They that drink of the brim of that cup must
          drink of the dregs of it too. God has fixed shame, sorrow and torment
          of heart to sin, with such strong bands that none shall be able to
          break. Where sin dines, judgment will sup. Wrath follows it, as the
          shadow does the body. The stinging serpent lies on the other side of
          the hedge of God's law, which they who break over will find.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, In vain do sinners fight against their sins finding them. It
          is lost labor, it will not do, for God is their party. It is vain for
          sinners to hide themselves, and hide their own eyes from their sins,
          for see them they must. Yes, they shall see and be ashamed. Men may
          close their eyes upon their sin, but God will open them, and make the
          frightful spectacle appear to them. Conscience will not always be
          seared, nor the mind blinded. God will take off the veil and say, I
          will set your sins in order before you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is in vain to hide these sins which God calls them to discover for
          his own glory. Secret sins, so secret as they give no scandal to men,
          God calls not men to discover ordinarily. But scandalous sins by which
          the name of God is blasphemed before the world, God calls sinners to
          make open confession of them, that they may restore him the glory
          before men, that they have taken away before them. And however sinners
          may struggle against the glorifying of God this way, God will not want
          his glory of them. For he has said, "He who covers his sins shall not
          prosper: but whoever confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy."
          And that is a heavy saying, "Who has hardened himself against God and
          prospered?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Objection. But there is much secret wickedness in the world, from
          which sinners get away, without its finding them out. This is a grand
          objection against the doctrine, from which sinners are apt to
          encourage themselves: therefore I will consider it, and in answer to
          it, offer these particulars.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. There are secret rebukes and strokes which a sinner often meets
          with from the hand of God, these, though indiscernible to the world,
          are yet visible to the sinner himself. The lashes of conscience often
          go deep in accusing sinners. Many a fair face is often put upon the
          black heart of a guilty person, that blasts their sinful pleasures.
          And do they escape that are put into the hands of this tormentor? No
          hand was laid upon Cain, yet he complains that his sin was heavier
          than he was able to bear. Sins often find out the sinner, when it is
          not known to others. None knew that the sin of Joseph's brethren had
          found them out but Joseph and themselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Sin many times finds out sinners before the world, and though some
          escape yet many are taken in that snare. I need not repeat instances.
          There are some that God makes examples to others, and they that will
          not take warning by them, may themselves come also to be made examples
          to others, and from them, others will take warning. Hence says Paul to
          the Hebrews, "Let us labor therefore to enter into rest, lest any man
          fall after the same example of unbelief." Though some escape yet you
          may be taken, therefore do not you adventure, in hopes of getting away
          with your sin. While there are so many whose sin has found them out in
          the land of the living, not only in their name, but in their persons,
          it is folly to go on securely in sin, expecting never to be detected.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Sin often finds out the sinner's name, when he is dead and gone, so
          that they die like a candle going out, leaving a bad savor in the
          world behind them. The name of the wicked shall rot. Their name rots
          with their bodies. God does with some sinners that get out of the
          world without sin finding them out, as some do with such as die by
          their own hands, they hang them up after they are dead, for a terror
          to others. Their names are as their bodies were unburied, left behind
          them for a loathing to such as think on them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Sin often finds out the sinner in his relations or family after he
          is gone. God takes away the sinner and pursues the quarrel in the eyes
          of the world against them that are his. This is described in a
          striking manner, Job 20:26–29. This is also threatened in the second
          commandment. Sin not found out is one of the worst of legacies, which
          God to his own glory, takes the payment of in his own hand, to make
          all men to see that there is a God to judge upon the earth. It is a
          consuming moth, that will consume substance, and erase the remembrance
          of sinners from the earth. See what God says to Eli, for the
          wickedness of his sons and his lenity to them, 1 Samuel 2:30–36.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Sin never fails to find out the sinner in another world. There is a
          tribunal immediately after death, where the impenitent sinner will
          find that his sins are not forgotten. After death is the judgment. But
          there will be a day of judgment at the end of the world, when secret
          things will be brought to light and laid open. "In that day God shall
          judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ. Then he will bring every
          work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or
          whether it be evil. Then the dead small and great shall stand before
          God, and the books will be opened." The records of the most secret
          wickedness will be read before the world of angels and men. These
          works of darkness, which now cannot be dived into, will be laid open
          then in their most minute circumstances, before the universal
          congregation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now judge you, if any encouragement can be drawn, from some sinners
          getting away without their sin finding them out. You see that out it
          must be, and out it will be, if not in time, yet in eternity. And
          better now than hereafter, for,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Now God is on a throne of mercy, and if sin find out the sinner
          now, he may go to Christ with it, who will cover it with his blood,
          and upon the sinner's coming to him, God has promised, saying, "I will
          forgive their iniquity and remember their sin no more." If the
          criminal fall down before his judge and submit himself, he will get
          his soul for a prey. "For if we confess our sins, he is faithful and
          just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
          unrighteousness." But hereafter the white flag of peace is taken in,
          the time of trial is over, the door of mercy shut, and no more pardons
          dispensed. "Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say
          unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. When once the
          master of the house is risen up, and has shut to the door, and you
          begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord,
          open unto us: and he shall answer and say unto you, I know not whence
          you are."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The most public place in all this world, is but a secret corner in
          comparison of that assembly that shall be at the great day. "Before
          the Judge shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them
          one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats." And
          what matter what shame fall on the sinner now, so that he may lift up
          his face in that great assembly unashamed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question. But why is it that sin finds some out in time, and that
          others are put off to another world? Answer. The sins of some sinners
          find them out in time, for these reasons.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Sometimes for their own good and eternal welfare, that their souls
          may be saved in the day of the Lord. The thief who was brought to the
          cross on the discovery of his sin was saved, when many others, no
          doubt, escaped and so perished. And thus it is thought concerning
          Ahab, that the discovering of his sin was a mean to bring him to
          repentance. Whatever God may do with others, one way or other, he will
          make sin find out his elect in this world, that it shall so toss them
          as to bring them to Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. For his own glory, that the world may see there is a God that
          concerns himself in matters done in the world as the Judge of it. "The
          righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he shall wash his
          feet in the blood of the wicked. So that a man shall say, truly there
          is a reward for the righteous: truly he is a God that judges in the
          earth." These things are real evidences of God's omniscience, justice
          and holiness. So that while the sins of some find them out, he leaves
          not himself without a witness. And it becomes a bar in the way of
          prevailing atheism in the world, striking sinners with the thought,
          that there is a God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. For a terror and warning to others. "And all Israel shall hear and
          fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you."
          God makes examples of some, that others may learn wisdom by their
          folly. And therefore it says to all, "Now all these things happened
          unto them for examples; and they are written for our admonition, upon
          whom the ends of the world are come." This is the end of church
          discipline in public rebukes. "Them that sin rebuke before all, that
          others also may fear." And they are far gone in hardness, and must be
          very insensible of their own case, who are not humbled and stirred up
          to watchfulness by these means. And idle unconcerned spectators of
          these things, are very like to become a spectacle themselves to
          others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But again, sin's finding out some is delayed for a time, and they get
          away with them even in the face of death; so that their sin never
          finds them out in this world. And this,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Is in wrath to themselves, they are given over as helpless, Ephraim
          is joined to idols, let him alone. Their punishment is reserved until
          they get it altogether in full tale. "How are they brought into
          desolation as in a moment; they are utterly consumed with terrors." It
          is a fearful case when God allows accounts with a sinner to lie over,
          until he be in another world; and never brings him to a reckoning
          until there. I assure you God deals not so with any of his own. "But
          when we are judged, says Paul, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
          should not be condemned with the world." It is a sign of a very
          hopeless case, when God ceases to be a reprover to a sinner.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is to be a certain evidence and token to the world of a judgment
          to come. Were every one's sin made to find him out in this world, and
          he brought to reckon for it here, it would tempt the world to think
          there were no future judgment. But since so many processes are laid by
          undiscussed in time, it is an argument that the judgment will sit in
          eternity. And indeed, every one of those sins that sinners get away
          with, is an argument for a day of judgment. For since God is a just
          God, he must reward sinners according to their works, going on in
          their sin, and since that is not done now, it will certainly be done
          hereafter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The mischievous effects of some persons' sins are never complete
          until they be gone. And even when they are off the stage, their guilt
          may be running on to a greater and greater height in this world, for
          all which they shall be made to reckon at the great day. So the
          mischief of Haman lived when he was dead. Thus Esther, after his
          death, "Spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet,
          and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the
          Agagite, and his device which he had devised against the Jews."
          Jeroboam, long after he was dead, is called Jeroboam the son of Nebat
          who made Israel to sin. So there is no breaking off of such sins but
          by the repentance of the party. And when he does not repent, no wonder
          his sin does not find him out until it be completed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 2. Of Exhortation. And this doctrine serves to dehort from several
          sinful practices, and to exhort to several duties.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Dehortation 1. Beware of leading a careless and untender life. See
          then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise. Most men
          walk carelessly, they are as indifferent about keeping a clean
          conscience as the workman is of keeping the motes and dust off his
          clothes, who never troubles himself, as long as they do not come into
          his eyes. This is not the good old way of the saints, "who exercised
          themselves, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God and
          toward man."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Now that is a careless and untender life,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. When a man keeps not upon his spirit a fear of falling into
          temptation. "Happy is the man that fears always; but he who hardens
          his heart shall fall into mischief." Many will be sorry after they
          have fallen into the mire, but when they are out of that, alas! they
          do not look before them when they come near another, as affrighted at
          it, and they are into that one too, before they are aware. O sirs!
          when grew the world so, as one might travel through any part of it
          fearlessly, go into any company, and walk on without taking heed to
          his steps. There is not a saint in Heaven that knew it so in their
          day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. When one tamely yields up himself, to be guided by his passions,
          lusts, and affections, and is not habitually guarded by reason,
          religion, and conscience. People may call this infirmity of the will,
          but they will never make less of it than a careless untender life,
          that will find them out, and make them broken bones, if God has any
          kindness for them. "This I say then, walk in the Spirit, and you shall
          not fulfill the lust of the flesh." It was said of Christ, "What
          manner of man is this, that even the wind and the seas obey him?" But
          of how many may we say, What manner of a Christian is this? that the
          wind of passions, and the seas of temptation, ever command him and
          carry him headlong. By the smallest spark he goes up like powder, and
          by the smallest blast he is driven like a feather or chaff before the
          wind. Now beware of this.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. We have a careful enemy that watches all advantages and
          opportunities against us. "As a roaring lion, he walks about seeking
          whom he may devour." While we sleep, the devil wakes; while we stand
          still, he goes about us; while we fear nothing he takes the
          advantageous occasion to make his attack. Ah! shall not the diligence
          of our malicious enemy, rouse us to look about us and be upon our
          guard. Our souls are a prey, which he thinks well worth his pains to
          catch, and do not we reckon it worth all our pains to keep them?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Consider where you are. They that are in Heaven need not watch, nor
          fear a surprise. The gates of that city shall not be shut at all by
          day, for no enemy can approach it. But you are not there, but on
          earth, where you are never out of hazard, alone, nor in company. "You
          are among the lions' dens, and the mountains of the leopards." It is
          the haunt of wild beasts. They have their dens without us and within
          us. One man may be a snare to another, and a man may be a snare to
          himself. There is a thicket of snares and temptations through which we
          have to go. We carry a body of death with us, which is like tinder, to
          kindle the flames of Hell about our ears.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Careless walking is ungodly walking. "If," says God, "you walk
          contrary unto me, (Hebrew, at a venture) and will not hearken unto me;
          I will bring seven times more plagues upon you, according to your
          sins." No man becomes a Christian by chance, nor walks with God by
          random. The Christian life is a labor, a warfare, a rowing against the
          stream. Assure yourselves then that by careless walking, you can never
          attain to the rest, the crown, nor to the shore of Immanuel's land.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Consider your sin will find you out. Careless untender living
          often betrays sinners into some foul mires, the mud of which they can
          never wipe off while they live. How many have been set up as beacons.
          How many that have dashed themselves to pieces upon the rock of
          security, have there been set up as beacons to others. Ask David what
          betrayed him into his adultery, and he will tell you that it was his
          careless walking. And I believe there are few, if any, gross and
          scandalous outbreakings among them that profess the name of Christ,
          but they will be found to be the just judgment of God upon former
          careless walking, and what naturally flowed from it. Is it any wonder
          that he who walks in a rough uneven way, and will not look to his
          feet, should break a leg or an arm sometime or other.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Again, Careless walking never fails to make a poor case of the soul.
          Can the idle soul think to escape suffering want. There always comes a
          winter which inquires at the careless walker, What has summer been
          doing? Hence some professors have little or no experience of religion,
          but with good wishes and meanings, they go on all their days, like the
          door on the hinges they make no progress; they are ever learning, and
          never come to the knowledge of the truth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Besides, such conduct brings always some stroke at length, which shows
          that the Lord has not forgot it. It will one time or other lie heavy
          on the sinner. He gets either a merciful rousing out of that careless
          disposition, "Make me, says David in this case, to hear joy and
          gladness; that the bones which you have broken may rejoice," or it
          ruins him for altogether, as it did those of Laish, Judges 18:27.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Dehortation 2. Venture not upon nor live in secret wickedness. There
          is much of this in the world; when persons find an opportunity and
          secrecy withal, they think then is the time to break over the hedge.
          And they may do it fearlessly for there is no eye to see them, nor
          will their credit be lost by it. Thus secrecy makes thieves, cheaters,
          unclean persons, murderers, and many other kinds of sinners. But, O
          sirs, be sure your sin will find you out, however secret. Venture not
          upon such things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. Are not God and your own conscience witnesses unto you in
          the most secret place. You cannot go from his Spirit, nor flee from
          his presence. The darkness of the night or some solitary place may
          hide you from the eyes of men, but can they hide you from the eye of
          God and your own conscience? Where can you go where they are not with
          you? Perhaps a child's presence would hinder you and will you own a
          God, a conscience, and not have so much respect to them as to a child?
          Will you dare the omniscient eye? Should you not rather say with
          Joseph, "How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Many have thought themselves as secure from discovery as you, whose
          shame has been laid upon them, and they received the due reward of
          their work before the sun. And how do you know that the hellish trade
          will succeed better in your hands than in theirs? It is dangerous
          sporting with the all seeing eye. Take example by others, lest God set
          you up for an example next. And venture not upon the ice where so many
          have been drowned.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Secret wickedness seldom goes alone, but much more is often
          necessary to cover it. So that the person having once entered the
          devil's ground, finds a kind of necessity to go farther and farther in
          it. Adam having stolen the forbidden fruit, sins again to palliate it,
          by hiding himself, and indirectly laying the blame on God. David's
          adultery made way for drunkenness and murder. Lies in opposition to
          conscience are common in this case, so that one way or other
          conscience becomes like the highway, constantly trod upon, that it is
          no wonder it be quite dead for a while, until God put new life into
          it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. As long as you hide your sin and do not repent, the way is closed
          up between Heaven and you. There is a kind of excommunication from the
          presence of God passed upon you, neither will he be with you any more,
          while the accursed thing remains in your tabernacle. "If I regard
          iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me. For if our heart
          condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things." And
          hence it is some wither, their secret wickedness blasts them, that
          they pine away in their iniquity. Perhaps they think they can confess
          to God and beg pardon. But in any case while they go on in the sin,
          they can have no pardon. For thus runs the divine declaration, "Let
          the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and
          let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to
          our God, for he will abundantly pardon." And in the case of your
          wronging others, as by theft, while you are enjoying the fruits of
          your sin, you shall as soon pull the sun out of the firmament as get a
          pardon out of God's hand, for in that case restitution is a necessary
          part of repentance. So that the souls of many are in a case they
          little think. Thus Zaccheus, as a true penitent, was willing to
          restore fourfold.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Secret wickedness will damn your soul as well as open. "There shall
          be tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that does evil." And
          O where will be your profit, if you should gain the whole world and
          lose your own souls? Is there any pleasure or profit whatever that
          will make up this loss? O throw not away a precious soul for what will
          not profit. It will be no comfort when men are roaring among the whole
          congregation of devils and damned spirits, that what they did, they
          did it secretly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, If you will venture, be sure your sin will find you out, it
          will give you a meeting sometime, it may be when you are not looking
          for it. Your secret stolen waters shall overflow you at length, and
          your bread eaten in secret shall stick in your throat. And if you be
          so in love with secrecy you may get enough of it. God may give you
          your stroke in secret also, where there shall be none to help you; but
          you shall get the whole weight of your own burden as he did with Onan.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some perhaps will value all this but very little, they know other
          things, secret wickedness has prospered in their hand long, and to
          this day, there are none who can lay anything to their charge. But do
          you know the reason of that? If you did, it would be no great
          encouragement. "To me, says God, belongs vengeance and recompense;
          their foot shall slide in due time; for the day of their calamity is
          at hand, and the things that shall come upon them shall make haste."
          Run on then as long as you will, as sure as God has said it, your foot
          shall slide in due time, here or hereafter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Dehortation 3. Do not employ yourselves to defend or justify your sin,
          as if there was little or no evil in it; but rather lie open to
          conviction from the Word of God, which is the law of liberty. This is
          an evil frequent in the world, by which men shut their own eyes, and
          drag their consciences at the heels of their self-will. They will
          extol some notorious sins as great duties. Thus Saul extolled his own
          sinful conduct in the Amalekites, 1 Samuel 15. What they have done,
          not because it was lawful, must be lawful because they have done it.
          Their credit is engaged, and therefore they cannot quit it, but must
          go forward and defend an ill action because they have done it. At
          least they will palliate their guilt by every mean, and do their
          utmost to extenuate it, when they find it impossible altogether to
          defend it. Beware of this.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. This is a horrid profanation of the name of God to make a
          shelter for sin under the covert of his holy law. "These wrest the
          scriptures to their own destruction." This is to make God the patron
          of sin, and is like the wounding of a man with his own sword. Some
          have scripture ready to defend their sinful practices, and thus the
          holy word is abused to the defense of unholy practices. This is a
          course as desperate as if the sick man should mix the antidote with
          poison, which makes his recovery hopeless. This is the conduct of
          ungodly men, "Who turn the grace of our God into lasciviousness."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. This course may well aggravate your guilt, it will never lessen it.
          It may blind your own eyes, but not God's. Be not you therefore
          partakers with them. Jezebel caused a fast to be proclaimed, to
          palliate the murder of Naboth; Saul smothers the business of the
          Amalekites; but did these contrivances avail them anything before God?
          Did not Saul see himself rejected for tampering with the command of
          God, and Jezebel was eaten up by dogs. Men may turn sin into what
          colors they please in their own eyes, but they will never make it
          anything but the hue of Hell in the sight of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is a plain evidence of untenderness of heart, and will go far to
          prove a man hollow hearted before God. What less can be demanded as a
          sign of sincerity, than to be willing to know our sins, and our duty?
          "How many, says Job, are mine iniquities and sins? Make me to know my
          transgression and my sin." They that are not willing to know their
          sins, are not willing to part with them. "That which I see not, teach
          you me; if I have done iniquity, I will do so no more." They that are
          not willing to part with their sins, deal falsely with God. What can
          you make then of aversion to admit conviction, but rebelling against
          the light, a staving off of repentance and reformation with long
          weapons; a shrewd sign indeed of a hollow heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. They that take this way, lay themselves open to the fearful stroke
          of delusion, Isaiah 66:2–4. Men that go about to defend their sins,
          though it were in jest, may come to believe the thing in earnest at
          length. "And as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,
          God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are
          not convenient." For it is just in God to put out those eyes that men
          shut against the light. The more pains men take to cover and extenuate
          their sin, the heart is more hardened, the conscience more deadened,
          and at length it may come to a fearful height. "If our gospel be hid,
          it is hidden to them that are lost. In whom the God of this world has
          blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the
          glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine into
          them."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It is in vain to defend or extenuate sin, for it will come out
          and appear in its native colors. If we will not penitently draw off
          the mask which we have sinfully put upon it, God will do it and make
          it appear in its native colors. Men often do with their sins as with
          their bodily sores, they roll them up with rags. But if God come to
          cure them, he will draw off all these, uncover the running sore, and
          open it up in mercy. And if not so, they will be opened up before the
          world at the great day. For whatever men think or say of their sinful
          practices, neither their sayings nor thoughts of them, but the truth
          of the matter will be the rule of God's judgment. "We are sure that
          the judgment of God is according to truth, against them that commit
          such things."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Dehortation 4.—Sin not presumptuously with a high hand in opposition
          to reason and conscience, checks and reproofs from word and
          providence. Sins of infirmity are common to all, unavoidable through
          the weakness of the flesh, and make the best go all their days with a
          bowed down back. But some venture on sin deliberately and fearlessly,
          and willfully break over the hedge. Beware of this.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. Consider God is the party with whom you have to do. He is
          wise, you cannot outwit him; he is mighty, and you cannot out-brave
          him. He makes the earth to quake and rends the rocks in his anger; and
          takes up the isles as a very little thing. In your presumptuous sins,
          you do but dash your heads against a rock. The head will be wounded,
          but the rock stands firm. He has given a law, he will see it regarded,
          and sinners will either bow or break before him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Consider the awful fence which he has set about this law. "Cursed
          is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the
          book of the law to do them." They that travel in deserts carry fire
          with them to drive away the wild beasts from them. God has set a hedge
          of fire about his law, whoever will transgress must go through it.
          There is a net to catch the sinner, that he shall not enter the
          forbidden ground, but he shall be hard and fast in the snare. These
          are the threats of wrath, with which God's word is inlaid. You may
          make light of these for a time, but you will change your mind, and be
          forced to say, "Like as the Lord of hosts thought to do unto us,
          according to our way, so has he dealt with us."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Conscience the more it is trampled under foot, will rise at length
          the more violently and sting the more piercingly. Thus "after your
          hardness and impenitent heart, you treasures up unto yourself wrath
          against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of
          God." Men that war with their conscience may gain for a time, but the
          victory will at last fall to the other side. We may say of conscience
          as of Gad, "A troop shall overcome him, but he shall overcome at the
          last." And the more harshly it has been treated, the more terrible
          will its resentments be. Presumptuous sins do but weave the cords,
          with which the sinner will be the faster bound. Sinning against light
          makes the way for outer darkness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Your sin will find you out. And likely, a sudden unexpected
          meeting it will give you. "He who being often reproved hardens his
          neck, shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy." Look
          abroad through the world, and you will see the truth of this written
          in the sudden ruin of many presumptuous sinners, whose triumphing has
          been but for a moment; who have run on casting off all fear and in a
          moment have fallen into the ruin, out of which they could not rise
          again. How many have run their course like the wild donkey, "That
          snufs up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her
          away? All they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month
          they shall find her." So the sinners' month has come, when the foot
          has been taken from them, and their life and death has been like the
          crackling of thorns under a pot, noisy but soon laid.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Dehortation 5th, and last. Strive not against your sins finding you
          out. When the time comes that the Lord makes sin to find out the
          sinner, O what wrestling do sinners often make to avoid the meeting.
          They shut their eyes, and they will not see though God is writing
          their sin before them in legible characters. They will deny their sin
          when it is charged upon them, as Saul had the impudence to say he had
          performed the commandment of the Lord, when the bleating of the sheep,
          and the lowing of the oxen were proclaiming his sin. If they meet with
          a stroke sent from God for the very purpose to charge it home upon
          them, they will say it is but a chance, 1 Samuel 6:9. Beware of this.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. In so doing you fight against God. He by his word or
          providence deals with you to own it, and you stave it off. It is
          dangerous entering the lists with such a party. It is the proper
          office of the Spirit of God to convince of sin, and those who ward off
          convictions set themselves against the Spirit to quench the holy fire
          and so run themselves deeper and deeper into guilt.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. You fight against your own souls and wrong them. "He who sins
          against me, says the Savior, wrongs his own soul; all they that hate
          me love death." The boil that is to be cured must be lanced and opened
          up; and the guilt to be removed, must be discovered and the sinner
          made sensible of it, in the way prescribed by God. If you will not
          allow your sin to find you out, you block up the way of repentance to
          your own souls; and if you will not repent of it you must perish by
          it. Many times when the Lord is taking the way to cure the sinner, he
          wrestles against it, as if he were going to kill him. But O does not
          the loss redound to you, if you gain your point.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Strive as long as you will, your sin will find you out at
          length. If you ward off the first charge, another will come which it
          will be impossible to escape. If secret convictions and bosom checks
          will not do, you may come to get some heavy stroke, that may be more
          effectual; and if a small one do not, a greater will. And if nothing
          prevail in time, it will be so charged upon you in eternity that you
          shall stand speechless.
        </p>
        <p align="justify"> </p>
        <p align="justify">EXHORTATIONS</p>
        <p align="justify">
          Exhortation I.—Believe this and think upon it, especially when you are
          tempted to sin. Know this to be the nature of sin, and charge your
          conscience with it, when you are tempted. Sinners often take time to
          think, even on the brink of temptation, that there is hope it may
          never come to light; but will you think, it is certain, that one time
          or other, if you yield to temptation, it will find you out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. This might be a notable mean to keep you from sin. O how averse are
          people to bear the shame of sin, after they have sown it to themselves
          they cannot think to reap it. But will you think on that in time. Look
          to the shame, sorrow, and torment, that are to follow sin, before you
          fall in with it: and assure yourselves that if you take the one, you
          must take the other also.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. God has said it, and said it to us, for that very end, that it may
          move us to hold off from the way of sin. Thus it is certain, it cannot
          fail, and thus we are warned and rendered inexcusable. We cannot say,
          it was not told us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. We cannot act rationally, or as reasonable creatures, if we will
          not forecast the event of our actions, which is so plainly and
          solemnly told us. How sad is it that men should be blindly hurried
          away by their passions into sin, and sink themselves in a gulf of
          misery without ever thinking that they are entering on a way that
          leads to destruction. A prudent man foresees the evil, and hides
          himself: but the simple pass on and are punished. Passions and corrupt
          affections are dangerous guides, because they are blind and furious
          and always for venturing come what will come. But religion and reason
          must guide the man, if he will act either as a man or a Christian.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. How often are the dregs of sin bitter, quickly after the drinking
          out of the cup. No sooner is it over than the sinner calls himself a
          beast and a fool. He slides away pleasantly on the ice, but presently
          he is groaning out under broken bones. A little foresight would
          prevent this, Job 20:11–14. O were it not far better to have it to
          say, I have not done what I was tempted to do, than O that I had not
          done it. Temptation casts a mist before the eyes when it is not
          resisted, which, when the tempter has got his design, often presently
          clears up, and the soul sees itself in a mire. This was the case with
          Adam and Eve, "And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew
          that they were naked." And then what answer can one give to that
          question of conscience, "What fruit had you then in those things
          whereof you are ashamed? for the end of these things is death."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. How often do the bitter dregs cast up long after the sweet is
          forgotten and out of mind. This was emiently the case with Joseph's
          brethren. Many other sinners have mourned at the last, when their
          flesh and their bodies have been consumed. Sin is a seed that may lie
          long under ground, yet will spring up at length, and will bring forth
          grapes of gall, and bitter clusters, which the sinner must wring out
          and drink. Sins of youth may set and keep tryst heavily with the
          sinner in old age. "His bones are full of the sins of his youth, which
          shall lie down with him in the dust." The fear of this made David cry,
          "Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions." And Job
          says, "for you write bitter things against me, and make me possess the
          sins of my youth." O should not this be considered in time, and the
          conscience in the hour of temptation be awed with that, don't you know
          that it will be bitterness in the end?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It is the business of the tempter to keep this out of your
          view, as that which contributes to the marring of his projects. "For
          surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird." And if you
          intend to resist him, you must arm yourselves with this consideration
          timeously. It will be in upon you, better take it before you enter the
          snare, when it may do you good, than after you are in it, when it will
          rack your conscience.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Exhortation II. Search your own sins. Labor to prevent sins finding
          you out, by your finding out them. We should do in this case, as when
          one knows there is some hateful or venomous beast in their house; they
          search for it diligently, until they find it out, lest it should come
          upon them unawares and do them harm. No serpent nor toad is such a
          dangerous guest as sin is. Search it out then, and search until you
          find it out. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Make a serious survey of your whole life. "Let us search and try
          our ways, and turn again to the Lord." Go back the track of your whole
          life, and see where the prints of your feet are to be found out of the
          way of God. This will not be done cursorily to purpose. You would take
          a particular time for it. Men will take time to adjust and settle
          their accounts with men, why not take time to settle their accounts
          with God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Go through the several stages of your life. Neglect not to look into
          your birth and infancy. "Behold, says David, I was shaped in iniquity;
          and in sin did my mother conceive me." Behold and remember the sins of
          childhood. For childhood and youth are vanity. Sins may be committed
          in childhood, which will find out the sinner long after. Cast up the
          sins of youth, it is a time of heedlessness and rashness, in which
          often much sorrow and misery is laid up for the time to come. "Know
          you that for all these things God will bring you into judgment."
          Follies of youth may be the burden of old age, and must reckon for
          them precisely with God here or hereafter. Survey the sins of middle
          age. "Truly every man at his best state is altogether vanity." And let
          the sins of old age be narrowly examined.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Search into the several corners of your conversation. Examine your way
          in your dealing with God and men. Look how you have carried in respect
          of the duties of religion towards your Creator; of sobriety with
          respect to yourself; of righteousness with respect to your neighbor.
          Trace your way in the several relations in which you stand, how you
          have behaved as a husband, wife, parent, child, servant, master,
          subject, church-member. How have you behaved alone and in company.
          What you have done for God's honor, and the good of others in the
          world. Ask yourselves particularly, In what case is your salvation
          work? What progress have you made in the work of your day and
          generation?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Search out particularly those sins in you that have been most
          dishonoring to God, and shocking to your conscience, whether secret or
          open. For these will most readily give you a fearful meeting if you do
          not prevent them. No matter though they be of an old date, for when
          the conscience is roused, they will be fresh and lively in respect of
          the sting. All sins deserve wrath, and will bring it if not pardoned;
          but some are more heinous in the sight of God than others, which
          providence uses to write over in the particular strokes sent for them.
          Therefore as ever you would prevent this, search them out until you
          find them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Search out the several steps and outbreakings of that sin, with
          which you have been most easily beset and led astray. "Let us lay
          aside every weight and the sin that does most easily beset us." That
          is the special idol of jealousy, which provokes God to jealousy, and
          which a holy providence ordinarily makes sinners smart for in a
          remarkable manner. So that as it has been a peculiar grief to his
          Spirit, he makes it also some time or other a peculiar grief to the
          sinner's heart. Thus Eli's softness to his children, which seems to
          have been his weak side, found him out very terribly at length. God
          may pardon his own people's weaknesses, and yet may cause them
          remarkably smart for them, by taking vengeance on their inventions. So
          that in that respect horror may take hold upon them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Search into those sins which you thus discover. Let us search and
          try our ways. Open them up and look into the lurking evil that is in
          them. When the serpent is found, rip it up to see where the poison
          lies. "Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding
          shall reprove you; know therefore and see, that it is an evil thing
          and bitter, that you have forsaken the Lord your God, and that my fear
          is not in you, says the Lord God of hosts." View them in the dishonor
          which they have reflected on God, in the multitude of mischiefs which
          they have brought forth to your own souls, or to others. Notice their
          several aggravations, the light, love, privileges, and obligations,
          against which you have sinned. Draw out the libel at length against
          yourselves, that you may prevent its being presented against you in
          wrath. Present it to yourself in its native colors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, These things which you have omitted or done with a doubting or
          erring conscience, examine narrowly and strictly, for our opinion of
          sin can never alter the nature of it. The after reckoning of
          conscience is often the most true one. Thus Paul says, "But what
          things were gain for me, those I counted loss for Christ." There are
          many things in which persons have peace, in which they could have no
          peace, if they would narrowly examine them. And when they will not do
          it, God makes their sin to find them out, writing out their disguised
          sins, in such a stroke as sets them in their own colors, which this
          search might be a proper means to prevent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. If there be a way under Heaven to prevent sin's finding out
          the sinner in wrath, this is it. "For if we judge ourselves, we shall
          not be judged." It is the way among men, for one judge to enter a
          process against a transgressor of the laws and to discern against him,
          to keep him out of the hands of one that would be more severe. Take
          you the same course in your own process. Erect a tribunal within your
          own breast, place conscience on the judgment-seat, let it narrowly
          examine the cause and pass an impartial sentence, if you would be
          safe. If not, the day will come when you will find that your own
          indulgence to yourselves has ruined you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In case providence see it meet to make some stroke to overtake you,
          even for that sin or sins which you have acknowledged and lamented
          beforehand, yet you shall have more comfort in that case, and it shall
          be less than otherwise it would have been. "And David said unto
          Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said unto David,
          the Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die. Howbeit,
          because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of
          the Lord to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto you shall
          surely die." Remarkable is the difference of these two laws, Exodus
          22:1–4. "If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and shall kill it, or
          sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a
          sheep. But if the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether
          it be ox, or donkey, or sheep; he shall restore double." The reason of
          this difference, where the sin was more complete, the punishment was
          greater; where less, it was less. So that there shall ever be found an
          advantage of taking this course.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It is impossible but your sin and you must meet. And where
          there is no shifting of the meeting, sure it is the wisest course to
          yield to it in time. If a besieged city can by no means hold out, it
          is the best way to keep things from an extremity presently to yield.
          "Agree then with your adversary quickly; whiles you are in the way
          with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and
          the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.
          Truly I say unto you, you shall by no means come out thence until you
          have paid the uttermost farthing."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Exhortation 3d and last. Repent then and turn from your sins unto God.
          Give up with your sinful courses and ways. Let the consideration of
          the bitterness that will be in the end of it, move you to put an end
          to them with all speed. For escape as long as you will otherwise, be
          sure your sin will find you out at last.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Motive 1. As your sin goes on, your accounts increase, and while they
          are making one treasure, God is making another. "You treasures up to
          yourself wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the
          righteous judgment of God." None of your sins are forgotten, as long
          as they are not forgiven; neither are they forgiven while you are
          going on in them. And it is a miserable office to be increasing your
          debts to divine justice, taking no proper means to be delivered from
          the burden.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. You will be brought to a reckoning for them all. "For God will
          bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be
          good, or whether it be evil." Sin is a debt that will neither die nor
          drown, but in the sea of the Redeemer's blood. And the longer the
          reckoning be delayed, it will be the more dreadful when it comes.
          Judgment that comes slow with feet of lead, strikes with iron hands
          when it comes. Therefore break off your sinful course in time, lest
          your sin overtake you, when there will be no remedy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          As many unrepented and unforsaken sins as hang about you, so many
          snares and traps are for your ruin. And when God begins to reckon for
          one, he may reckon for all with you. When I begin, says he, I will
          also make an end. It is often with the sinner in this case as with a
          man when he breaks; all his creditors come on him one after another,
          when once one begins. And thus the ruin of some is completed, and
          heavy is the case of others made.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question. What should one do, whose sin is, or has already found him
          out?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Bless God and be thankful that he ceases not to be a reprover to
          yon. It is a fearful case where the Lord lays the reins on the
          sinner's neck, and will not bestow a check upon him. "And I will make
          your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth," said God to Ezekiel,
          that you shall be dumb and shall not be to them a reprover, for they
          are a rebellious house. It is a token for good when the Lord checks
          the sinner, and restrains him, and causes the serpent to bite him as
          soon as he goes over the hedge. The child whom the parent is most
          concerned to educate right, gets many faults shown him and frequent
          checks. Despise not your own mercy, but fall in with it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Carefully pursue any providential hint that God makes to you of
          sins and faults in your way. "A reproof enters more into a wise man,
          than a hundred stripes into a fool." Be taught by slender means, if
          you would not provoke God to teach you by more severe handling. A
          tender conscience will be taught more by a frown, than others by a
          heavy rod on their backs.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Read the sin in the punishment, and justify God in what he is
          doing, or has done against you. So did good Eli. "And he said, it is
          the Lord, let him do what seems him good." So did Hezekiah. "He said
          to Isaiah, good is the word of the Lord which you have spoken: he said
          moreover, for there shall be peace and truth in my days." The humbled
          soul will do this, when the proud unhumbled spirit will strive against
          a reproving God, and so bring on a heavier stroke.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Flee with your guilt to the Redeemer's blood. "In that day there
          shall be a fountain opened to the house of David, and to the
          inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin, and for impurity." When God
          discovers your spiritual impurity, and we find the load of guilt on
          our souls: we must go to God, confess our sin freely and fully, and
          make application to the blood of sprinkling. Then shall our souls be
          cleansed from sin, by the precious blood of his Son. The sting shall
          be taken out of the conscience, for this blood purges the conscience
          from dead works. And there shall be a raising up both in confidence in
          the Lord, and if God see it meet the stroke shall depart, however the
          quarrel shall be ended.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Forsake that sin. Give up with it and strive against it. Turn
          to the hand that smites and be not like those of whom it is said, "You
          Lord have stricken them, but they have not grieved; you have consumed
          them, but they have refused to receive correction; they have made
          their faces harder than a rock, they have refused to return." Return
          not with the dog to the vomit, otherwise you will get a sharper rebuke
          next.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question. What should one do, who is afraid in a humble manner that
          their sin find them out? That is, that the Lord's anger justly fall
          upon them for their sin. "My soul, says David, trembles for fear of
          you, and I am afraid of your judgments."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Go to the Lord Jesus, the great burden bearer, and lay all your
          guilt over upon him. Lay the hand of faith on the head of the
          sacrifice, and plead the promise of forgiving and forgetting. For says
          the Lord, "I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their
          sin no more."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Lay yourselves down at the Lord's feet, acknowledging that you
          deserve wrath, but begging for his Son's sake, he would turn it away;
          withal resolved to submit to whatever chastisement he will lay on you,
          saying, "Behold, here am I, let him do to me as seems good unto him."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Mourn over your sin and walk humbly and softly under the sense
          of it. Faith in Christ's blood and true repentance is the best
          grave-stone for guilt, that it neither rise on a soul here nor
          hereafter. Amen.
