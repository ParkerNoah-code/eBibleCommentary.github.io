          Ephesians 5:33, "Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so
          love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she respect her
          husband."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THE apostle having, in several preceding verses, laid out the duties
          of husbands and wives severally; and having enforced them with most
          powerful argument, fit at once to convince the judgment and influence
          the affections; an argument utterly unknown to the heathen moralists,
          being taken from the mysterious part of Christianity, namely, from the
          spiritual marriage and state of the mysterious case between Christ as
          the husband, and the church as his spouse; does here conclude that
          matter of the mutual duties of husband and wife, summing up the duties
          of both jointly, in the words of the text. In which we have,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. The connection in the word nevertheless, Ðëçí, I shall not trouble
          you with the variety of significations heaped on this little word,
          judging the splitting of the words of the Holy Spirit into many
          different senses, in many cases, rather to cast a veil over, than to
          clear the meaning. Only some take it here for an illative particle,
          signifying therefore, or so then. And thus the words are a conclusion
          formally drawn from all the preceding points advanced on this subject.
          As if he had said, since thus stands the case between man and wife,
          between Christ and the church, therefore it plainly follows, that
          every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself." The
          particle seems to be originally an exceptive preposition, as appears
          from Mark 12:32, "there is none other but he, or besides him." Hence,
          being used absolutely, adverbially, or conjunctively, it naturally
          falls to be an adversative particle, signifying but, or nevertheless;
          as appears from Acts 27:22, "no loss but of the ship." And it is
          confessed on all hands to be an adversative, only that adversative is
          said to signify illatively here, and Matthew 11:22–24, and some few
          other places, on this ground, that the sense requires it. Indeed, if
          the sense did absolutely require it, it behooved to be admitted. But
          that it does not, as appears from our version of the places, keeping
          the proper signification, and making very good sense. That we find a
          proposition of such a nature, that it is fit to be inferred from what
          went before, will not prove that it is a formal consequence in the
          intention of the penman; nothing being more ordinary than such
          propositions made without any such view; therefore the ground advanced
          is not sufficient for affixing that new signification to that word.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We take it then adversatively, but or nevertheless, as 1 Corinthians
          11:10, 11; so it serves to pass from the purpose last insisted upon,
          and to resume the former. The apostle having, upon occasion of
          discoursing on the relation of husband and wife, brought in the great
          gospel mystery of the mystical union between Christ and believers,
          does hereby bring them back from that consideration of faith to the
          practice of moral duties, as better fitted by the the former for the
          latter. And so he guards them against that bias of corrupt human
          nature, by which it is apt to lose its concern for the practice of
          moral duty, in idle speculation of the mysteries of Christianity;
          whereas all these mysteries are in their native tendency practical,
          tending to the sanctification of the true believer of them. Thus far
          of the connection. Let us,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Attend to the purpose of the text. This is twofold,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. One relating to husbands, binding their duty on them as such. "Let
          every one of you," etc. And here we have the subjects of this duty
          pointed out, and that two ways:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
             1. Generally, you, õìåéò. I find some translators take this word
          for a nominative put absolutely, and here place the comma; reading
          thus, "therefore as to you also," By which means the word comprehends
          both the husbands and the wives. But the distribution immediately made
          of this you, in the words ï Êáè íá, "you one by one," with the rest of
          the connection, seems to spoil this. We take it then to be meant
          immediately of the Ephesian husbands only. But since the Bible is the
          voice of God to every one to whom it comes, it is meant also
          mediately, of every husband to whom the Bible has come, or shall come,
          to the end of the world. God herein speaks to all of them generally,
          whether they be great or small, noble or ignoble. For whatever freedom
          some persons of distinction fancy themselves at in these matters, they
          will find themselves in the end to have been as fast bound by the
          divine order as the meanest.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
             2. Distributively. You in particular, or more literally, you one by
          one. The apostle thinks it not enough to speak this to them all in
          general, but addresses himself on this point, one by one. Men are apt
          to imagine themselves overlooked in a crowd, and even what is but said
          to all in general, is in effect said to none. Therefore, that none may
          think themselves passed over, he so directs his speech to every one in
          particular, as if he spoke to none but him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now these, "you, you one by one," are doubtless nominatives; but they
          have no agreeing verb here, for that which follows is of the singular
          number, and has a nominative of its own. They might either, then, be
          put absolutely or elliptically. To the last of these, the copulative
          Êáé, also, seems plainly to lead, looking back to what is said before,
          of Christ's loving his church; as if had said, but you also, one by
          one, do so. Love you also your wives. But this the apostle passes for
          a more particular and forcible phrase immediately subjoined, "Let each
          one love his own wife."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The duty itself. One's loving his own wife so, even as himself. Here
          we may consider the substance of the duty; love, the grand duty of
          Christianity. So soft, sweet, and lovely a duty, that it argues a
          mighty depravation of human nature akin to devilism, that it can so
          hardly get access, and keep its ground among men; and the excellency
          of the heavenly state, that there is nothing breathed there but love.
          We have also the determination, or specification of this love by its
          peculiar object. It is conjugal love, the love of one's own wife, ôçí
          åõáõôïõ ãõíáéêá. This is that species of love which of right is
          incommunicable, and admits of no partner. The apostle has once and
          again urged it in the context, and you have heard it already
          explained. But here he brings it in again, partly the more to
          inculcate it as a necessary duty, and especially to teach us, that as
          love is the sum, or comprehensive duty of the whole law, so conjugal
          love is the sum, or comprehensive duty of the husband to the wife.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have also the nature of this love, or qualities requisite to
          constitute it. One is to love his wife so, even as himself. These
          words I conceive not to run into one, as if he had said so as, but to
          point at two different things, namely, 1. The rule of this love, or
          explanatory cause of it. So, that is, as Christ loved the church; that
          is the Christian husband's pattern he must copy after in the love of
          his wife. The church had many faults and blemishes, yet he loved her.
          He loved her sincerely, purely and singularly; by all means seeking
          the good both of her soul and body, for which he exerted himself to
          the utmost. Even so should men love their wives, in a like manner;
          expressing that love, as much as may be, in their conduct. 2. The
          reason of this love, "even as himself." This cannot belong to the rule
          of it, as if the particle as was only a note of similitude pointing to
          the love of one's self, as a subordinate rule, to which one is to
          conform in the love of his wife; for in that sense one is to love
          every man as himself. But surely there is something here required
          peculiarly in favor of his wife; therefore it points to the reason of
          it, namely, that one is to love his wife because she is his other
          self, one flesh with him, or one body, 1 Corinthians 6:16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The manner of binding this duty on men is remarkably particular. Let
          every one åêáóôïò, love his own wife. In the mouth of two or three
          witnesses shall every word be established. The apostle first addresses
          himself in this matter to all in general; secondly, he distributes
          them one by one, as addressed; and now, thirdly, in the very same
          sentence, comes in with another word, carrying the duty to every
          husband's door, every one love his wife, even as himself. This must
          sufficiently establish both the weight of the matter, the proneness of
          human nature to shuffle its neck out of the soft yoke, and the
          apostle's earnest desire to fix it, and closely to apply it to them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Part of the purpose of the text is that relating to wives, binding
          their duty on them as such. "And the wife see that she respect her
          husband." And in this we may consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The subject of this duty pointed out. The wife, ãõíç. The word
          signifies, either simply a woman, as Matthew 5:28; or a wife, as
          Matthew 1:20; even as the other word áíçñ, here used, signifies simply
          a man or a husband. But this makes no ambiguity, in regard that it is
          in relation the one to the other, they signify husband and wife; so
          that a man's ãõíç is always a man's wife. Thus Titus 1:6, ìé ò
          ãõíáéêïò áíçñ, literally the man of one woman, is the husband of one
          wife. This is common style in the Old Testament, Genesis 16:3. Sarah
          gave Hagar to Abram her man for a woman, that is, husband-wife. By
          which phraseology, the holy language, in the very frame of it, bars
          all mixtures, but in the state of marriage; none being one's woman, in
          the language of the Holy Spirit, but his wife. Now here it is plain
          the words stand in relation the one to the other; so ãõí is the wife,
          the subject of the charge here given.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The subject is pointed out indefinitely, not that they are more ready
          than the husbands to perform their duty, or that the apostle was less
          concerned to bind it on them; but that since all relations are mutual,
          standing or falling together, this was indeed the natural way of
          expressing what remained. The wife indefinitely, as the husband also
          in the original, not her husband. But that is in effect, as if he had
          said, your wives, one by one; every one's wife in particular; for the
          reasons given in the former case. We have next,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The duty itself. She is to respect her husband. Here is something new,
          which we had not before. The apostle had called wives to submit
          themselves, and be subject to their husbands, verses 22–24. Here he
          points them to the principle that must be the spring of that their
          subjection if they would behave themselves as Christian women, that
          is, respect of their husbands, öïâ ôáé, respect. The word in general
          signifies fear, being in itself indifferent to respect or servile
          fear, 1 John 4:18. But here, without question, the fear meant is
          respect. A kind of fear joined with love, competent to inferiors
          towards superiors, and consequently to the wife, whose superior God
          has made the husband. The formal ground on which respect proceeds, is
          superiority or super-eminency; the rays of which, as it were,
          reflected on the conscience, strike respect. Hence our supreme respect
          is due to God: "Holy and reverend is his name." But forasmuch as he
          has impressed of the image of his supremacy on some, even on all
          superiors, and particularly on husbands; on whoever he has impressed
          it, it challenged a proportionable respect from us. Therefore, that
          superiority and supremacy which God has impressed in the character of
          a husband, as a lineament of his own image and supremacy, 1
          Corinthians 11:3, ought so to touch the conscience of the wife with
          awful regard to it, that she should fear to offend him, and be careful
          to honor him, and behave respectfully to him in word and deed, 1 Peter
          3:2–6.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We have lastly the manner of binding this duty on wives. It is
          remarkably singular. And the wife see that she respect her husband.
          (Greek,) and the wife that she respect her husband. In this
          phraseology, there is something either wanting or redundant. Some take
          the phrase to be pleonastic, accounting íá redundant, and to be
          neglected in a translation. But such a mere pleonism, without any
          emphasis, should, I think, be the very last refuge in the case of the
          words of the Holy Spirit, therefore I take the phrase, with others, to
          be elliptical. It is an observation of a late judicious writer, that
          ellipsis often makes the language strong and close. And I make no
          question, but such is the ellipsis here; which, though it must be
          supplied in a version, yet cannot be equaled by the supplied phrase,
          the imagining of the thing being lost. It is an ellipsis of affection,
          kindled by the subject-matter stopping, and then precipitating the
          course of the words. This is usual in the style of the Scripture, Mark
          14:49, "but (it is unavoidable) that the Scriptures must be
          fulfilled." Mark 5:23, "(I pray you), come and lay your hands on her."
          Genesis 26:7; Matthew 25:9; Romans 11:21, compare verse 20. Thus here,
          "the wife (see) that she." etc. This elliptical phraseology supposes
          the darting forth of the rays of super-eminency commanding respect.
          This is also expressed by the Syriac, in an Old Testament phrase, "let
          the wife be fearing from her husband."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But passing that mystery of faith, the mystical union, and to return
          to moral duty; I say to you all in general that are husbands, and to
          you one by one, "let every one of you love his own wife" in the manner
          Christ loved his church; and that because she is his other self; and
          let every wife be struck with respect of her husband, in respect of
          the character God has impressed on him with relation to her, moving
          her to carry towards him with all becoming regard.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE I. It is the nature of true Christianity to join a careful,
          tender regard for moral duty with the believing consideration of the
          mysteries of faith. This is a great mystery; but I speak concerning
          Christ and the church. "Nevertheless, let every one of you in
          particular so love his wife even as himself."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The truth of this doctrine appears, if we consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That the great design and end of the whole contrivance of the
          gospel mystery was the restoration of morality, lost in the world by
          Adam's fall. That is, to bring men back again to the love of God, in
          their duty to him and one another, according to the moral law, the
          eternal rule of righteousness. This might be shown by parts, that it
          was for this end Christ died. "He gave himself for us, that he might
          redeem us from all iniquity, and purify us unto himself, a peculiar
          people zealous of good works." Believers are united and married to
          Christ for this very purpose, "that they might bring forth fruit unto
          God." But let it here suffice, that the mystery of Christ is in
          general determined to be great. "Without controversy, great is the
          mystery of godliness; God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the
          spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the
          world, received up into glory."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That the faith of these mysteries is the channel, and the only
          channel of true morality acceptable in the sight of God. Whatever
          other way vain man may think to arrive at a temper of spirit and
          course of life pleasing to God, call it holiness or virtue, which they
          please, this Bible acknowledges no way of sanctification of a sinner,
          but in Christ, united to him by faith, 1 Corinthians 1:2; Acts 26:18;
          and true moral virtue another way produced, is as great an absurdity
          in the doctrine of Christianity, as fruit brought forth by a branch
          separated from the stock, John 15:5.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. This shows the vanity and self-deceiving, 1. Of those who hug
          themselves in their pretended faith of the glorious mysteries of the
          gospel; but in the meantime their faith of them, such as it is, never
          makes them a whit more holy nor tender in the practice of moral duty,
          but leaves them at liberty there. I would say to such, as James does,
          "But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead."
          Vain are such means as reach not the end, the meat that does not
          nourish, the clothes that do not warm; so vain is that faith of the
          gospel mysteries to you, that do not sanctify you, and make you
          careful of moral duty. 2. Of those who hug themselves in their
          pretended moral duties and virtues, separate from the faith of the
          glorious mysteries of the gospel, and running in a different channel,
          that being left bare, as fitted only for speculation. Such
          rationalists betray their natural blindness and ignorance of the
          mystery of Christ with the Pharisees their predecessors, rejecting the
          counsel of God as weak and ineffectual, Luke 7:30, which yet is the
          power of God and the wisdom of God, 1 Corinthians 1:24. What wisdom
          then is there in them?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE II. It is the duty of husbands to love their wives, and that
          in such a manner as Christ loved his church; looking upon them as a
          piece of themselves. This is the principal doctrine of this part of
          the text; but having been already handled on the 25th and 28th verses,
          I shall pass it over with this reflection, that no doctrine carries
          morality to that height of purity and beneficialness to mankind which
          the doctrine of Christ does. So that it is quite evident, that the
          greatest masters of reason are not the best Christians; that there is
          an understanding necessary for discerning the truths of the gospel in
          their native beauty, of which men are by nature destitute, of which
          the apostle speaks, when he says, "And we know that the Son of God is
          come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is
          true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.
          This is the true God and eternal life."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE III. Close application of the truths of the word, and coming
          over the same truths again and again, is necessary for our getting
          benefit by them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The reason of the former is, because of that aversion that is in our
          nature to spiritual truths, founded upon the tendency that is in them
          to holiness, on which account our unholy nature lies cross to them,
          because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject
          to the law of God, neither indeed can be. Hence men naturally ward
          them off, as the refractory bullock does the yoke. While they are kept
          from being closely applied, the corruption of nature is not hurt by
          them; but being closely applied, it must needs lose ground. Thus
          David's conscience remained peaceable, though impure, while Nathan
          held his parable in the general. But when he applied it to him in
          particular, saying, you are the man, he fell like a bird shot from a
          tree.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The reason of the latter is, because impressions received easily wear
          off our spirits, and need therefore to be renewed. These that hear the
          gospel only to get their judgments informed, and therefore cannot be
          entertained unless they hear some new thing, do show that they have
          little judgment of their own case; what upstiring their heart and
          affections need. "Wherefore," says Peter, "I will not be negligent to
          put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them,
          and be established in the present truth."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. This serves to direct both preachers and hearers,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. To making close application of spiritual truths. Let us who are
          ministers aim at applying our doctrines close to the case of our
          hearers; take it close home to our own particular case, that we starve
          not ourselves while we feed others. And let hearers make every sermon
          a looking-glass for themselves, by taking home the word to themselves.
          All the good which sinners get of the law, of its commandments for
          their conviction of sin and duty, or of its threatenings and denounced
          curse, for their conviction of their misery and discovering their need
          of Christ, comes by close application of its commands, threatenings,
          and curse, to them in particular. And all the good to be gotten of the
          gospel promise, is by a believing application of it to ourselves, for
          our justification, sactification, and eternal welfare. As the belief
          of the law, in general, without particular application, will never
          awaken the secure sinner; so the belief of the promise of the gospel
          in general, without particular application, will never give the
          awakened sinner rest to his soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That a seasonable and discreet inculcating of the same truths be
          not grievous to either of us, preachers or hearers. "To write the same
          things to you," says Paul, "to me, indeed, is not grievous, but for
          you it is safe."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE IV. Christian husbands prove themselves Christians indeed,
          even in the love of their wives, by their displaying the influence of
          the pattern of Christ's love on their hearts therein, and of the
          ordinance of God, making them one flesh in their consciences. Their
          hearts are influenced by the one, and their consciences by the other,
          to love their wives.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. Hence learn that religion extends to the whole of our conduct;
          that whatever we do, we are to carry it along with us, and act by the
          rules of it. In every relation we must carry as Christians.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is not enough that we love our relatives, and live peaceably
          with them, from natural principles of good humor, or in acceptableness
          to us for their personal qualities. If that is all, "what do we more
          than others? do not even the publicans so." It is necessary to prove
          us Christians that we be influenced to this by the example of Christ,
          and the ordinance and command of God having weight on our consciences.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE V. and last. Wives that would approve themselves to God in
          that relation, must carefully take notice of that superiority over
          them with which God has invested their husbands, to respect them on
          that account, and so submit themselves to them in the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          All I shall say on this head, shall be comprised in these two things—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. There is nothing unreasonable or unfitting in this, whatever you
          conceive your excellency to be. For, in effect, it is but submitting
          to God and reverencing his authority, whom I hope you allow to lodge
          it in whom he will. You claim that liberty among your own servants, to
          invest one of them with authority over the rest; and you challenge
          your authority in that servant to be regarded by the rest. This is the
          very case with respect to your husband. God has appointed him the
          superior servant. It is the ordinance of God. "I would have you know,"
          says Paul, "that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the
          woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. All inferiority in relations is a situation in which God has us on
          our trials for the other world; taking trial of us what regard we will
          pay to his authority at second hand. All superiors of divine
          appointment, being to their relatives so far in the place of God,
          Psalm 82:6. So then, since it must be with us eternally, according as
          we regard the authority of God, or regard it not, now; and in such
          inferiority the trial is taken of us, what regard we have to it. We
          may easily perceive how deep this matter draws; and for evidence that
          God does that way take trial of us for the other world, you need but
          consider that, when time is at an end, all that inferiority of one of
          us to another is gone, because the time of trial is over, and so there
          is no more use for it. "When he shall have put down all rule, and all
          authority and power." No more subjection of wives to husbands,
          children to parents, people to magistrates or ministers. The more
          need, then, while the trial lasts, to approve yourselves to God as
          respecters of his authority wherever he is pleased to lodge it.
