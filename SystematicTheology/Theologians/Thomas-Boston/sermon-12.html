    PHILIPPIANS 3:10 "That I may know Him!"</p>
<p align="justify">A MERE speculative knowledge of Christ, and of the great 
    doctrines of the gospel, however laboriously acquired and extensive it may 
    be, is of small importance in itself, and quite vain and ineffectual, if it 
    be not sanctified, and issue in experimental knowledge of Christ, and a real 
    feeling of the beauty and excellency, and efficacy of divine truth on the 
    heart. A man may have a competent, nay, a very extensive acquaintance with 
    the whole doctrines of the Christian religion, as laid down in the 
    scriptures, and of which we have an excellent statment in the shorter 
    Catechism, which I have been endeavoring to explain to you for a series of 
    years; yet if you have not the experimental knowledge of Christ, all your 
    knowledge is in vain as to the salvation of your souls. I therefore come, as 
    a conclusion of the whole, to press this experimental knowledge upon you, as 
    what alone will be available for any saving purposes.</p>
<p align="justify">In the preceding verse, the apostle speaks of the gain he 
    received in Christianity in point of justification, flowing from the soul's 
    closing with Christ, and renouncing all other; and here he speaks of that 
    gain in point of sanctification. And first, more generally, That I may know 
    him. Might not the Philippians hereupon have said, And do not you know 
    Christ, who have preached him so long? There are two ways of knowing, one by 
    hearing of a thing, another by sight and feeling: one by the relation of 
    another, another by experience, as one knows honey, and all the virtues of 
    it, by report, which he believes, another testing it himself. The apostle 
    knew Christ by faith, when he first believed in him; and here he would have 
    the spiritual feeling and experience of him, finding by experience him to be 
    what he has heard and believed him to be. He had something of this, but he 
    would still have more.</p>
<p align="justify">The doctrine arising from the text is,</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. 'The experimental knowledge of Christ is the 
    sum of practical religion,' 1 Corinthians 2:2. 'flowing from faith, to be 
    studied by all.' In handling this point I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what this experimental knowledge is.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Confirm the point.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Make application.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I am to show what this experimental knowledge of 
    Christ is. It is an inward and spiritual feeling of what we hear and believe 
    concerning Christ and his truths, whereby answerable impressions are made on 
    our souls, Psalm 34:8 like that of the Samaritans, John 4:42 when they said 
    unto the woman, 'Now, we believe, not because of your saying: for we have 
    heard ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the 
    world.' There is a savory report of Christ spread in the gospel; faith 
    believes it, and embraces him for what the word gives him out to be; and 
    then the believing soul does come and see. There is a glorious scheme of the 
    lovely perfections of Christ drawn in the Bible, and faith believes that he 
    really is what he is said to be; and then that scheme begins to be drawn 
    over again in the Christian's experience, and this is always drawing more 
    and more until he come to glory. It is just as if some eminent physician 
    should give a friend remedies for all diseases he may be liable to; and when 
    he leaves them with him, he lets him know that such a remedy is good for 
    that distemper, and another is good for such another, etc. Now, he knows 
    them all; but he falls sick, and he takes the remedy fit for his disease, 
    and it proves effectual. Now, the man knows the remedy by experience, which 
    he knew before by report only. Even so Christ is given as all in all to a 
    believer, and he makes use of Christ for his case, and that is the 
    experimental knowledge of him. I will illustrate these by some instances.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The scripture says of Christ, He is the way to the 
    Father, John 14:6. Now, the man that has tried many ways of attaining access 
    to God, and communion with him, and is denied access, and can fine no way to 
    come to God, at length comes by Jesus Christ, renouncing all things else, 
    leans only on his merit and intercession, and he finds an open door of 
    access to God, and communion with him. This flaming sword he finds removed, 
    and him who was still before a consuming fire, he finds now a warming sun to 
    his soul. Here is experimental knowledge of Christ. Hence the apostle says, 
    Romans 5:1, 2 'Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, 
    through our Lord Jesus Christ. By whom we have access by faith into this 
    grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.'</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ's blood 'purges the conscience from dead works 
    to serve the living God,' Hebrews 9:14. Now, the experimental Christian 
    knows from experience, that unremoved and unrepented-of guilt defiles the 
    conscience, leaves a sting in it, unfits him to serve the Lord, as much as a 
    man in filthy rags is unfit to stand before a king: it breeds in the heart 
    an unwillingness to come before God, and mars his confidence: he tries to 
    repent, overlooking the blood of Christ, but it will not do. He looks to an 
    absolute God, and his heart is indeed terrified, but nothing softened. At 
    length he looks to God in Christ, throws the burden of his guilt, and dips 
    his soul in the sea of Christ's blood; and then the heart melts for sin, the 
    sting is taken out of the conscience, the soul is willing to converse with 
    God, and is enabled to serve him, as a son does a father.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Christ is fully satisfying to the soul, Psalm 73:25. 
    Habakkuk 3:17, 18. We all know this by report; but the Christian 
    experimentally knows it by a spiritual sensation in the innermost parts of 
    his soul. Sometimes, when all his enjoyments have been standing entire about 
    him, he has looked with a holy contempt on them all, saying in his heart, 
    These are not my portion. His heart has been loosed from them, and he has 
    been made willing to part with them all for Christ, in whom his soul 
    rejoiced, and in whom alone he was satisfied. Sometimes, again, all outward 
    things have been going wrong with him, yet he could comfort, encourage, and 
    satisfy himself in Christ, as David did in a great strait, 1 Samuel 30:6. He 
    has gone away to his God and his Christ, and with Hannah returned with 'a 
    countenance no more sad,' 1 Samuel 1:18.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Christ helps his people to bear afflictions, and keeps 
    them from sinking under them; and he lifts up their heads when they go 
    through these waters, Isaiah 43:2. Now, the Christian meets with affliction; 
    and he takes a good lift of his own burden, for it is the thing he thinks he 
    may well bear. But his burden is too heavy for him. He wrestles with it: but 
    the more he wrestles, it grows the heavier, and he sinks the more. At length 
    he goes to Christ, saying, 'Lord, I thought to have borne this burden, but I 
    am not able; I will sink under it, if I get not help:' 'Master, save us, for 
    we perish.' And so he lays it over on the great Burden-bearer, and he is 
    helped, Psalm 28:7. Now, the man, when he thought he could do all, could do 
    nothing; and when he thinks he can do nothing, he can do all, 2 Corinthians 
    8:9, 10.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Christ is made unto us 'wisdom,' 1 Corinthians 1:30. 
    The experimental Christian finds, that when he leans to his own 
    understanding, he mistakes his way at mid-day; and all that he reaps of it, 
    is, that in the end he has himself to call 'beast,' and 'fool,' for his 
    error. But when into comes he difficulties, that he sees he knows not how to 
    extricate himself out of, and is wary, and lays out his case before the 
    Lord, and gives himself up as a blind man to be led by the Lord, he finds he 
    is conducted in the way he knew not; and the result is, to 'bless the Lord 
    who has given him counsel.'</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, Christ is made unto us 'sanctification,' 1 
    Corinthians 1:30. Now, the Christian falls secure, does not make use of 
    Christ, and then are ever he is aware, he is like Samson without his hair. 
    When he awakens, he sees his case is all gone to wrack, the course of 
    sanctifying influences is stopped, and graces are lying in the dead thraw, 
    and lusts are strong and rampant. He falls a grappling with them, but is 
    worsted still; until be come to himself, and acknowledge his utter weakness 
    to stand in this battle, and renew the actings of faith in Christ; and then 
    'out of weakness he is made strong, waxes valiant in fight, and turns to 
    flight the armies of the aliens,' Hebrews 11:34. He flings down the 
    confidence in himself, like the broken reed that has pierced his hand; and 
    though the promise lie before him, like the rod turned into a serpent, which 
    unbelief tells him he would be too bold to meddle with, he ventures and 
    takes the serpent by the tail, and it becomes the rod of God in his hand.</p>
<p align="justify">Let these suffice for examples of experimental religion.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I proceed to confirm the point: or to show that the 
    experimental knowledge of Christ is the sum of practical religion. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The scripture testimonies concerning this. To learn 
    religion in the power of it, and in all the parts of sanctification, is to 
    lean Christ. Hence the apostle says, Ephesians 4:20â€“24. 'But you have not so 
    learned Christ; if so be that you have heard him, and have been taught by 
    him, as the truth is in Jesus: that you put off, concerning the former 
    conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful 
    lusts: and be renewed in the Spirit of your mind; and that you put on the 
    new man, which after God is created, in righteousness and true holiness.' 
    There needs no more to be known, for that comprehends all, 1 Corinthians 
    2:2. 'I determined not to know anything among you,' says Paul, 'save Jesus 
    Christ, and him crucified.' It is 'eternal life,' John 17:3. It is a pledge 
    of eternal life; it is eternal life begun. Yes, Christ is the sum and 
    substance of a believer's life, Philippians 1:21. 'To me to live is Christ.'</p>
<p align="justify">2. All true religion is the creature's conformity or 
    likeness God, made by virtue of divine influences, transforming the soul 
    into the divine image. Now, there can be no conformity to God but through 
    Jesus Christ; for he is the only channel of the conveyance of the divine 
    influences, and God can have no communication with sinners but through him. 
    He alone makes us partakers of the divine nature, 2 Corinthians 4:6.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Whatever religion or holiness a man seem to have, that 
    does not come and is maintained this way, is not of the right sort. It is 
    but nature varnished over: for 'he who honors not the Son, honors not the 
    Father.'</p>
<p align="justify">The soul's closing with Christ by faith, opens the way to 
    this experimental knowledge of him; so that whoever would know Christ thus, 
    must in the first place so close with him.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Faith closing with Christ, believes he is such an 
    one as he is held out in the gospel, gives credit to the report; and it is 
    the want of this that mars this knowledge, Isaiah 53:1.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Faith closes with Christ to that very end, that the 
    soul may so know him. The soul stands in need of Christ in all that wherein 
    he is held out as useful to a sinner, and faith takes him for that.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Faith unites the soul to Christ, and so makes way 
    for this knowledge, which is the happy result of this union.</p>
<p align="justify">I come now to a word of improvement, which I shall 
    discuss in an use of exhortation. O Sirs! labor to be experimental 
    Christians, to have the inward feeling of what you hear and say you believe 
    concerning Christ. Why will you stand in the outer court all your days? Come 
    forward, and dip into the heart of religion. Come in where the world's 
    ungracious feet could never carry them. And be not satisfied with less of 
    religion, than what the beloved disciple in the name of believers says he 
    felt, 'Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus 
    Christ,' 1 John 1:3. This is a weighty and seasonable point. To enforce this 
    exhortation, I offer the following motives.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Religion is not a matter of mere speculation to 
    satisfy men's curiosity, but a matter of practice. Men's eternal state lies 
    at the stake, which can never be brought to a comfortable issue by a 
    speculative knowledge, more than a man can be cured by the knowledge of a 
    remedy, without application of it. An unexperimental professor is like a 
    foolish sick man, who entertains those about him with fine discourses of the 
    nature of medicines, but in the mean time he is dying himself for want of 
    application of them.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The sweet of religion lies in the experience of it: 
    hence the Psalmist says, 'My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and 
    fatness, Psalm 63:5. No man can have the idea of the sweetness of honey like 
    him that tastes it, nor of religion like him that feels the power of it. One 
    reads the word, and it is tasteless to him; to another it is sweeter than 
    the honey comb; why? because he feels the power of it on his spirit, Psalm 
    19:11. Religion would not be such a burden to us as it is, if we could by 
    experience carry it beyond dry sapless notions: it would be a reward to 
    itself, and so chain the heart to it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. All the profit of religion to ourselves lies in the 
    experience of it, Matthew 7:22. What avails all the religion men have in 
    their heads, while it never sinks into the heart? Knowledge without 
    experience will no more sanctify a man, than painted fire will but or the 
    bare sight of water will wash. Ah! what avails that knowledge to a man, by 
    which he is never a whit more holy, nor less: a slave to his lusts? True, it 
    may do good to others, as the profit of the carpenter's gift came to Noah, 
    while they themselves perished is the deluge. Light without heat serves only 
    to show the way to Hell, where there is scorching heat without light. Gifts 
    without grace are like a ship without ballast in a boisterous sea, that 
    cannot miss to sink. And when such an one is sinking into Hell, his gifts 
    will be like a bag of gold on a drowning man, precious in itself, but will 
    only help to sink him the faster.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The experimental Christian is the only Christian whose 
    religion will bring him to Heaven. Heaven in effect is but a perfect 
    experimental knowledge of Christ, where the saints will for ever feed upon 
    that sweetness they have heard to be in him. And there is no attaining of 
    Heaven, unless men first begin on earth to know Christ thus.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, It is absolutely necessary to qualify a man to 
    go on and hold right in an evil time. And surely, if ever there was need for 
    it, there is need now.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The experimental Christian is fitted thereby to 
    suffer for Christ, because he has the testimony within himself, that the way 
    which the world persecutes is the way of God. No arguments give such a 
    certainty of the truth of religion as experience does.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) When wickedness prospers, and piety is oppressed, 
    experimental religion keeps a man from being led away with the error of the 
    wicked, Malachi 3:16.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) When many stumbling-blocks are laid in the way, 
    especially in divisions and church-contentions, which make many wicked met 
    think there is no reality in religion at all; yet the righteous, in sad a 
    time, shall hold on his way.</p>
<p align="justify">This is a very weighty point; and to illustrate it a 
    little further. I will,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Give evidence that experimental religion is very rare.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Point out some causes of it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Show how it may be obtained.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Press you to seek after it by some considerations.</p>
<p align="justify">First, I am to give evidences that experimental religion 
    is very rare in our day.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The little relish that men have of the word either 
    preached or read. Experience makes the word savory; hence David says 'I 
    rejoice at your word, as one that finds great spoil,' Psalm 119:162. How 
    many are there to whom the word is tasteless as the white of an egg? Their 
    fancy may be tickled by the discovery of something which they knew not 
    before: but, alas! they have no inward sensation of the thing enrapt up in 
    the words of truth.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The little knowledge of the word by experience. The 
    best commentary on the ills of the heart is the word; and the best 
    commentary on the word is experience. These reflect light one upon another. 
    The experimental Christian reads his heart in the word; he gets it opened 
    and anatomized there, Hebrews 4:12, 13. It is the looking-glass wherein he 
    sees it. And he understands the word by experience, John 2:17 and 7:16. The 
    doctrine of truth is according to godliness, and godliness, in the practice 
    of it, makes truth shine the more into the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The little precise and nice walking there is among 
    professors, Ephesians 5:14. Christians should 'walk circumspectly;' and it 
    is the native effect of experimental religion, Isaiah 38:15. And the reason 
    is plain: The experimental Christian finds how a wrong step will provoke the 
    Spirit to depart, and how communion with God cannot be kept up in a loose 
    and irregular way, Psalm 66:18. He sees how small a thing exposes to the 
    dint of the threatening; and that the way of getting the promise told out to 
    him, is the way of tender walking, which counts no sin little. But, alas! 
    for that miserable latitude that prevails in the walk of the generation, who 
    take such a woeful liberty in their words and actions, as we may say with 
    the prophet, Micah 7:1, 2. 'Woe is me, for I am as when they have gathered 
    the summer-fruits, as the grape-gleanings of the vintage: there is no 
    cluster to eat: my soul desired the first-ripe fruit. The good man is 
    perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie 
    in wait for blood: they hunt every man his brother with a net.'</p>
<p align="justify">4. The little advantage religion has by the conferences 
    of professors. People may go into many companies before they get one from 
    whence they may come forth with a heart more inflamed with love to God and 
    Christ, and the practice of godliness, because they can meet with few like 
    him who said, 'Come and hear, all you that fear God, and I will declare what 
    he has done for my soul,' Psalm 66:16. Alas! there is little of Heaven in 
    the converse of Christians at this day; which says there is but little of it 
    in their hearts. We have sat down on time's things; and as for the matters 
    of another world, we have little relish of them. A philosopher bade one 
    speak, that he might see him, Colossians 3:16.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, The general security that prevails among all 
    ranks, though we never saw the day wherein it was more unseasonable. Did 
    experimental religion prevail, we would be waiting on the Lord in the way of 
    his judgments, as the church did, Isaiah 26:8, 20. God help us! Scotland's 
    stroke seems to be walking in the dark, with feet of wool, that we will 
    never hear the sound of, until we feel its iron hands. It is very like some 
    fearful surprise is abiding as. The dispensations of our day are in their 
    own nature rousing dispensations; but we are not at all awakened by them, 
    more than we were when there was not a pin in our tabernacle loosed. There 
    are different opinions and practices in these matters; but whose heads are 
    right, we think the hearts of all parties are wrong. And among all our 
    unhappy differences, we have a more unhappy agreement in a spirit of slumber 
    that has seized all together. And what shall be the end of these things?</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, I shall point out some of the causes of the 
    scarcity of experimental religion.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The Lord has a controversy with our mother, and 
    therefore has withdrawn, and it fares the worse with the children. She was 
    some time Hephzibah, and her land Beulah; but now her gold is become dross, 
    and her wine mixed with water. She has forgotten her husband, and has been 
    gadding after other lovers. She has cast herself into a loathsome disease; 
    her kindly heat and warmth is gone; anything of it that is left has struck 
    out to the outward parts, leaving a key-cold heart within. And, by all 
    appearance. she will not be cured, until blood be let of her.</p>
<p align="justify">2. People's spiritual senses are dulled with the luscious 
    sweets of a present world. Farms and merchandise take away people's 
    appetites for the marriage-supper, Matthew 22:4, 5. The devil makes birdlime 
    of the things of the world to catch professors, that they find, when they 
    would get upward, their feet stick in the mire. Many of us, I trow, when our 
    worldly incomes were less, our spiritual incomes were more. Or, if the world 
    go against people, their spirits are so embittered, that they find no 
    sweetness at all in religion.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Religion is not made people's business, but just a 
    by-hand work. Men are like the mole, whose abode is in the earth; and though 
    sometimes it come above ground, it hastens in again to it hole, to be in its 
    element. They will say their prayers indeed evening and morning; but for 
    walking with God in the interval of duties, they know nothing about it. 
    Their religion is over when duties are over. They are like a man that takes 
    physic indeed, but he just vomits it up again when he has got it, giving it 
    no time to work, Genesis 6:9. Religion's chance-customers will never grow 
    rich by it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. People's not holding hand to any attainment they make 
    in religion, like 'the slothful man, not roasting that which he took in 
    hunting,' Proverbs 12:27. They are, it may be, at some pains to earn 
    something in religion, but they put it in a bag with holes. Sometimes they 
    are in a fair way to gain experience of religion, they get some taste of it, 
    but then they do not follow on, Hosea 6:3. The spark is kindled, but they 
    let it go out; they do not feed it, and presently they have a cold coal to 
    blow again.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Formality in religion, when people content 
    themselves with outward worship, doing the work, but make it not their 
    business to worship God in the spirit; by faith in him, love, dependence, 
    fear, hope, patience, etc. It is these and the like graces that bring in the 
    experimental knowledge of Christ and religion into the soul. These are they 
    that get forward to God, even to his throne. And duties without them are 
    useless and vain, like liquor that has lost all the spirits.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, I come to show, how we may become experimental 
    Christians.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Let us labor to be Christians indeed, and lay the 
    foundation well in a serious and sincere closing with Jesus Christ. That is 
    to say, let us, under a conviction of the reality and necessity of religion, 
    give away and consecrate ourselves to the Lord Jesus Christ. Let us forsake 
    the world for him, and look on ourselves as men bound to another world, 
    under the conduct of the Captain of the Lord's hosts. And while we go 
    through it with him, let us resolve to go lightly along, and not dip, 
    Canticles 4:8. Let us forsake sin for him, and leave these husks to feed 
    upon himself, for the manna will not fall until the Egyptian provision be 
    done. And men need not think that the dainties of Heaven will be brought to 
    the table, where the soul is sitting at dust which is the serpent's meat. 
    Labor to know them no more, not to seek your satisfaction from them, and you 
    shall know Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Receive the truths of the word by faith. If you would 
    be experimental Christians, let the word dwell in you richly in all wisdom 
    and spiritual understanding. Hear it, and read it attentively, and with 
    application; meditate on it; let it be your constant companion and 
    bosom-oracle, to which you may always resort for direction, caution, and 
    encouragement. And you will soon find the commandment is a light, and that 
    by it you are warned, and that the promises have a sweet accomplishment, in 
    the way of duty, in the experience of the Christian. Labor to get the divine 
    faith of the word. O, Sirs! it is not easy to believe scripture-truths, Luke 
    24:25. Admit the conviction; look to the Lord for grace to believe, and keep 
    up the struggle with unbelief.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Be diligent observers of your own way, the way of your 
    heart and life. A man that lets his heart run at random, and does not review 
    what passes there, can never be an experimental Christian. But every serious 
    review of the heart would give you a new experimental confirmation of 
    scripture-truths. There are two great depths that the experimental Christian 
    wades much in, namely, the depths of wickedness in the heart, and the depth 
    of perfection and fullness in Christ. Be much in self-examination.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Be careful observers of providence; the providence of 
    God towards the church, and towards yourselves in particular, Psalm 107 ult. 
    Providence is a river that brings down the rich ore of experiences, which 
    are to be gathered by Christian observation. The Bible is the word that God 
    preaches to the world; and providence is the application of the doctrine. In 
    the Bible, the word is brought to our ears, and in providence it is set 
    before our eyes; though most of us are blind as moles, and see it not; but 
    the experimental Christian does see.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lay it down for a conclusion, that religion is a thing 
    that lies inwardly, and that it is quite another thing than a parcel of 
    external performances; that it is a conforming of the soul to the image of 
    Christ, by a close application to him, and a real participation of his 
    Spirit, and virtue of his blood. And therefore seek that, and seek it on 
    until you find his truth comes not into your heart in word only, but in 
    power, gradually killing sin and self, and conforming you more to his image. 
    And go not to duties as one that is only to hear or speak, but to feel or 
    taste. And when your hand is once in, that you begin to taste how gracious 
    the Lord is, hold hand to it, and you shall find his going forth prepared as 
    the morning.</p>
<p align="justify">Fourthly, I conclude with some considerations to stir you 
    up to this exercise.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Experimental religion is a sort of Heaven on earth. 
    Heaven is the eternal feeling of that goodness which is in God the chief 
    good. It is his eternal pouring out of his goodness into the souls of his 
    people, making them drink of those rivers which they heard were at his right 
    hand. Now, you may begin it here with tasting the word of life. That will 
    make great delight, as the full enjoyment makes perfect joy there.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There are none who being capable of that enjoyment on 
    earth, that get the first taste of it in Heaven. No; they all begin it here, 
    John 17:3. For God first gives men a taste of Christian experience, and then 
    they desire the full enjoyment of it, and they get it in Heaven. And this is 
    the reasonable way with the rational creature. Whoever taste not here, shall 
    not drink above.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The experimental Christian has the counterpart of the 
    Bible in his breast, though imperfect. He has things old and new to bring 
    out of his treasure, that answer to scripture doctrines and promises, as the 
    copy to the original. The experimental Christian is a walking Bible. He has 
    a body of divinity formed of experiences, which is an excellent sort of 
    learning, a thousand times preferable to all the raw unfelt notions of noisy 
    professors, that are like the sounding brass and tinkling cymbal.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The experimental Christian is fit to sail to Heaven, 
    whatever wind be blowing; for he has both sail and ballast. He has 
    experienced of the goodness and faithfulness of God, and of the sanctifying 
    power of truth; that is sail that will carry him through in all storms; and 
    he has experience of the corruption of his own nature, the deceit of his own 
    heart, and of his pitiful weakness; and that will be ballast to him. For 
    want of these in time of trial, few get through.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is very hard, without experience of religion, to 
    stand in a time when the proud despisers of God seem to be most happy: when 
    the sun shines bright on the way of wickedness and apostasy from God, and 
    nothing but clouds and darkness appear in the way of holiness, Malachi 3:15, 
    16. It is strange if those who never felt more sweetness in religion than in 
    the world, do not at such a time turn their back on it altogether: but the 
    experimental Christian will not do so: for 'the righteous shall hold on his 
    way, and he who has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger,' Job 17:9.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) When the night of error overtakes a church, and 
    errors like locusts swarm abroad, how hard is it then to stand without 
    experience! 2 Thessalonians 2:10. Where truth sinks not into the heart, but 
    floats in the head, it makes itching ears, to which novelties have easy 
    access. They to whom old truths are unsavory, lie a pray to new notions. And 
    hence it has come to pass, that many noted professors have been carried away 
    in such a time. But he who has tasted of the power of truth, will say from 
    his experience, 'The old is better,' Luke 5 ult.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) When divisions enter into a church, it is hard to 
    keep right without experimental religion. Division is a great plague from 
    the Lord, a stain on the beauty of the church, and a dreadful snare to men. 
    When church-builders are like Babel-builders, how can the work thrive? It 
    turns some quite off from all religion; while they see one going one way, 
    and another another way, they know not whom to follow, and they cast off all 
    together. Others, whose religion was never so deep as the bottom of their 
    hearts; exhaust the whole of their vigor on the controverted points, and so 
    they become dead in the vitals of godliness. So that, unless people be 
    experimental Christians, and exercised to godliness too in the time, having 
    the ballast I spoke of before, they will run into terrible excess of 
    selfishness, judging not only practices, but hearts: a very unchristian 
    employment!</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) When great men, and good men are falling, how hard 
    is it to stand, unless men have a witness to the truth from within? God, in 
    his holy providence, for the further trial of men permits the fall of men of 
    name for gifts and piety: and when these fall, readily they fall not alone, 
    but as mighty oaks break down others about them, unless they be well rooted 
    and grounded. And therefore they will never bring their religion to a good 
    account, whose religion is only to do as others do.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Lastly, When it comes to hard and sharp personal 
    persecution, especially to resisting unto blood. When extreme hardships, 
    even death itself, are laid in the balance with an unfelt religion, it is 
    hard to think how one should stand who has had no experience of the power of 
    it. Should God give us up into the hands of a bloody anti-christian enemy, 
    it would not be hard for them that have not been sealed by the Spirit, to 
    refuse the mark of the beast.</p>
<p align="justify">But I shall give more particular directions towards 
    attaining experimental religion.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Fix your eyes on the particular evils of your heart 
    and life, and ply closely the reformation of them by the Spirit. Alas! what 
    are we doing in the way of mortification of sin? Experimental religion is a 
    dying to sin, by virtue of our union with Christ. What use have we for 
    Christ, if not to 'save us from our sins?' Matthew 1:21. But the use many 
    make of Christ is to save them and their sins. They will drink, swear, lie, 
    cheat, and do unjustly still, and they will call these infirmities, or very 
    little things, that need not disturb a man; and they will lick themselves 
    whole with their believing; and on a new temptation go just back again to 
    them. Sirs, this is to make Christ the minister of sin, and to sin because 
    grace abounds. The running the round between swearing and confessing, will 
    make men fall down at length into the pit, whence they will never rise 
    again, Proverbs 29:1. If Christ cure you not of your disease, you will never 
    get life by him.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, I say, ply reformation of heart and life 
    closely. It will not be wishing that will do it; you must put your hand to 
    the work. It will cost mourning groans under the weight of sin, believing 
    looks, and vigorous endeavors against it. Is there a thing that is your weak 
    side? pray remember your soul is at stake; if it overcome you, your soul is 
    gone; and if ever you see Heaven, you must get above it, Matthew 5:29. 
    Revelation 3:21. O mind that passage, Mark 10:21. 'One thing you lack,' etc. 
    Look to your spots in the glass of the law, and quickly set about purging 
    them. You have, may be, a carnal worldly heart: fall on to get it spiritual 
    and heavenly; an ill tongue, get it bridled; or an offensive carriage, get 
    it mended.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Continue at the work, for the victory is not got but 
    by degrees. The interruptions that take place in our plying the work of 
    religion, make it still the more difficult. The miserable halts we make in 
    the exercise of godliness, do but weaken us, and give the enemy more time to 
    recruit. And they that cannot digest the making religion their business, are 
    not fit for Heaven. Heaven is an eternal triumph; how can they be capable of 
    it then that make it not their business to fight, or that are always 
    overcome, instead of being overcomers? It is a rest, therefore it 
    presupposes a labor; not so much the toil of business in the world, for the 
    most carnal have as much of that as professors, but a rest from labor 
    against sin.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Take often notice what progress you are making. 
    Consider with yourselves, Have I got any more victory over my passions, my 
    lusts, and my prevailing iniquity? Is there a cubit added to my spiritual 
    stature? Am I going backward or forward? Sirs, people that are at pains with 
    a farm, they count their profit, to see whether they be winners or losers: 
    if anything has been mismanaged to their loss, they endeavor to mend it the 
    next time; and if they find they are gainers, they are encouraged to 
    redouble their pains. But, alas! what pains men are at about religion, is 
    bestowed on it as if they cared not whether they prospered or not; and 
    therefore they have no experience.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Look after the profit of duties. We should never hear 
    a sermon, but should inquire, when we have come from it, Now, what have I 
    made of this? where did it touch me? what evil of my heart has it 
    discovered? what influence has it had on me to fit me more for my journey 
    and work? Sermons are not easy to some of you, that are far off from the 
    place of public worship: you would think it a great deal to go one mile, or 
    two, three, four, or five miles in vain, in other cases. Look after your 
    prayers, as the Psalmist did, Psalm 5:3. You would think it much if you were 
    to ask a request of your neighbor, and yet get no answer, or a refusal. O 
    why then do you not consider how your prayers are accepted by the 
    prayer-hearing God? I assure you, if you would fall upon this way, you would 
    soon find the good of it.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Converse with experimental Christians about 
    experimental religion. There is a wonderful diffidence that professors have 
    in one another at this day, Matthew 24:12. I truly believe this would be a 
    good way to cure it, if those that have any experience of religion would 
    modestly bring it forth to the edification of others. There is nothing that 
    more endears Christians one to another than this. It is an unchristian-like 
    thing in professors to despise converse about practical godliness and 
    Christian experience. And there is more of the wisdom of the serpent than 
    the harmlessness of the dove, in people's locking up in their own breasts 
    all their sense of practical godliness, when it might be brought forth to 
    the glory of God, and the good of others. I believe this way has been the 
    cause of so much jealousy, suspicion, and division among professors; and has 
    run out all Christian conference into vain jangling about the controversies 
    of the time.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Be very nice as to the point of sin and duty, Psalm 
    133:2. Sudden resolutions in matters which will allow deliberation, are 
    often to be suspected. Sometimes the matter of sin and duty is of that 
    nature, that there is no time to deliberate; all that can be done is, to 
    look to the Lord for immediate clearness, and the Christian shall have it, 
    Proverbs 4:12. 'When you run, you shall not stumble.' Compare Matthew 10:19. 
    'But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you shall speak, 
    for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak.' Sometimes 
    the Christian may have time to deliberate, and then God's ordinary way is to 
    clear men step by step, Proverbs 4:12. 'When you go your steps shall not be 
    straitened.' Say not, the way is plain at first glance in this case; for the 
    Spirit of God bids you 'ponder the path of your feet,' Proverbs 4:26. If a 
    way be such as our own heart at the very first inclines to, I say it ought 
    the rather to be narrowly examined, seeing in scripture-language the way of 
    our own heart is of no good name. And suppose the inclination of the man's 
    heart does really fall upon the right side in this case, yet this is no 
    Christian resolution, but a stumbling on the right way, which God will never 
    accept. Therefore men that would act as Christians in the point of sin and 
    duty, should lay aside prejudices, trample their inclinations under foot, 
    lay the matter before the Lord, and themselves open to conviction there, as 
    a piece of clean paper, on which God may write what he sees meet, pondering 
    all things with a holy jealousy over their own hearts, lest they be biased 
    by their own inclinations and preconceived opinions. I am sure much of God 
    is to be found in this way.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Acknowledge God more in your temporal concerns, 
    Proverbs 3:6. Are we Christians? let us depend on God for all things in this 
    life and the other. We are directed to pray about them, the promises are 
    about them, and therefore we should wait on God for them. Many a sweet 
    experience have the saints got in temporal things, when they have been 
    helped to lay them before the Lord, and leave them there without anxiety, in 
    the use of the means.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Have a precise respect to all the commands of 
    God, and be truly strict in your lives; that is, deal with men as believing 
    God's eye is upon you, and with God as if the eyes of men were upon you. 
    Never look on the authority of the multitude as sufficient to make that no 
    fault, which will not abide strict examination by the Word of God. Let the 
    command of God prevail with you; and whatever liberty you may take for ought 
    that men can say or do to you, let that be a sufficient restraint. Thus may 
    you attain experimental religion.</p>
