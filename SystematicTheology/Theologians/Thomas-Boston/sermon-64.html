          1 Timothy 6:12, "Fight the good fight of faith!"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THE Apostle having given Timothy an exhortation to several particular
          duties, here gives him an exhortation to the Christian life in
          general. Wherein we have two things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. A description of the Christian life. It is not an easy, idle,
          inactive life; but,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) A fight, a combat, a wrestling: for there are many enemies set to
          keep us out of the promised land.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) A good fight. There are many ill fights in the world. The men of
          the world have many fights and squabbles about this world, the honors,
          advantages, and pleasures of it, not worth the fighting for. But it is
          a good fight, a noble and worthy fight, wherein true valor and
          magnanimity appears.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) A fight of faith. Some understand this of the doctrine of faith,
          as that which is to be fought for. I understand it rather of the grace
          of faith, by which the fight is to be managed. This comprehends the
          former; and is more agreeable to the practical directions, verse 11,
          and the "laying hold on eternal life," which is done by the grace of
          faith. So it is a fight to be managed in the way of believing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The word of command given: "Fight the good fight of faith:"
          Agonize, like a combatant, wrestler, puting forth your utmost vigor.
          Timothy was engaged already in the fight; but still he was in the
          field of battle, and the enemy not yet off the field: therefore it is
          said to him, Fight. Paul was going off the field, and he says, "I have
          fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
          faith," 2 Timothy 4:7. Timothy was come on the field, and to him it
          was said, Fight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The doctrine natively arising from the words, is this.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. The Christian life is the good fight of faith, that must be
          fought by all that would see Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In discoursing this doctrine, we shall show,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. In what respects the Christian life is the fight of faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. In what respects it is a good fight.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Why the Christian life in the disposal of holy providence, is
          made a fight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">IV. Why a fight of faith.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          V. Touch at some particular fights of faith the Christian may have in
          his course heavenward.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. We shall show in what respects the Christian life is the fight of
          faith. I take up this in these seven things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. There are enemies of our salvation, and there must be faith in the
          soul to set against them. Where there are not two parties, there can
          be no fight. There is no fighting in Heaven, for there are no enemies
          there, Revelation 21:25. There is none of this fighting in the
          unbelieving world neither; for the enemies have all there alone, and
          there is no faith to set against them, Luke 11:21. Unbelief carries
          the man quite over to the enemy's side; it is the evil spy, that says,
          It is needless to think on the fight. This fight is only found where
          faith and its opposites meet; and that is in the Christian's heart and
          life: Canticles 6. "What will you see in the Shulamite? as it were the
          company of two armies." So the combatant is only the man that has
          given up his name to Christ, and listed with him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The enemy will not be quiet; he will make an attack on the believer
          setting heavenward. Hence is that exhortation, 1. Peter 5:8, "Be
          sober, be viligant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring
          lion, walks about seeking whom he may devour." Satan may rock his own
          children, and labor to keep all quiet: the more secure they lie, they
          are in the less hazard to break away from him. But God's children must
          not look for such treatment; their faces are away-ward from his
          kingdom; and therefore the enemy's face will be set against them, as a
          prize.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. God's people must resist: 1 Peter 5:9, "Whom [Satan] resist
          steadfast in the faith." They must set themselves to stand their
          ground against all opposition, and grapple with the difficulties in
          their way to Heaven, Luke 13:24. They must be denied to their ease,
          content to quit their soft beds of ease, and take the field for it,
          and endure hardness, 2 Tim 2:3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. They must resist by faith, 1 Peter 5:9. above-cited. Faith is the
          mouth of the soul, that must give the shout in this battle, the hands
          the men of might must find in it, the weapon they must wield in it,
          both in the offensive and defensive part of it: Ephesians 6:16, "Above
          all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to
          quench all the fiery darts of the wicked." So one must not only have
          the grace of faith, but he must have it in exercise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. They must continue in that resistance, and hold on in it: Ephesians
          6:13, "Take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to
          withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand." The
          Christian life is a fight, and that denotes a continuance. Many think
          they should have no more ado, but whenever an enemy starts up, to lay
          at him with a stroke, and strike him down; and so be easy again: and
          so they perplex themselves with doubts, fears, and jealousies of the
          love of God, because it is otherwise with them, the enemy being still
          fresh and vigorous, Isaiah 26:18. But alas! Sirs, you should consider,
          that that may be striking indeed, but not a fight, being of no
          continuance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. They must lay their account with ups and downs, getting as well as
          giving wounds in the encounter. Hence says David, Psalm 30:7, "Lord,
          by your favor you have made my mountain to stand strong: you did hide
          your face, and I was troubled." Prevailing Jacob halted in his thigh,
          after his struggle of faith with the angel. To be absolute masters
          over the enemy, would not be the fight of faith, but the triumph of
          faith, which is reserved for Heaven. ln the fight of faith, the
          Christian may be set to his knees, but must not give over: yes, though
          the enemy should lay him on his back, he must say, "Rejoice not
          against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in
          darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me," Micah 7:8, and so bend
          to his feet again.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Lastly, Faith has the chief interest in this fight. In it there
          will be use for all the graces, the doing and suffering graces: yet
          the fight has its name from faith, as that which has the chief hand in
          it. For,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, It is faith's possession that the plea is about. Life and
          salvation in Christ Jesus is held forth, offered, and exhibited in the
          gospel to the sinner; and the sinner believing in Christ, appropriates
          and takes possession of it by faith: Canticles 2:16, "My beloved is
          mine, and I am his." John 20:28, "Thomas answered and said unto him,
          My Lord and my God." 1 John 5:11, 12, "This is the record, that God
          has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son. He who has
          the Son, has life; and he who has not the Son of God, has not life."
          There is the ground of the quarrel the enemy has. If the man will quit
          his plea for life and salvation by Christ, the fight is at an end; the
          enemy has his design. but if not, the alarm is sounded, and the fight
          begins to force him from it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, It is faith that holds fast the possession which the enemy would
          force from the man. For it is the bond of union between Christ and the
          soul, and it is that which is the hold of Christ and eternal life:
          Hebrews 10:35, 38, "Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has
          great recompense of reward. Now the just shall live by faith."
          Therefore, believing, we are said to cleave to the Lord, to hold fast
          what we have, etc. The securities and rights to the heavenly
          inheritance are the promises; faith gripes them, and so keeps
          possession.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, It is faith that, of all the graces, is the main actor in this
          fight. Those worthies in Hebrews 11 exercised and had need of all the
          graces of the Spirit. There was much love, humility, meekness,
          patience, etc. in their doing and suffering so great things: but all
          is ascribed to faith. For faith is the captain of all the graces; it
          leads them out, puts an edge upon them for the fight, and makes them
          active. And therefore, in this fight, the word that is given from
          Heaven, is, "Be not afraid, only believe," Mark 5:36, "Above all,
          taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all
          the fiery darts of the wicked," Ephesians 6:16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          QUESTION. How comes it that faith has the preference among all the
          rest of the graces in this fight?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">ANSWER. On these accounts,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) It is the grace that is first on the field of battle, and all the
          rest follow it. It is the first link of the chain of the graces of the
          Spirit, that draws all the rest after it, 1 Timothy 1:5. It is the
          mother-grace, out of whose womb they all come forth; because it is the
          uniting grace that knits the soul to Christ, the fountain of fullness.
          So the way to get love, repentance, patience, etc. is to believe, thus
          it furnishes the field of battle, with fighters on Christ's side.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) It strengthens them all, according to its measure; for that is
          the rule of the dispensation of grace, "According to your faith, be it
          unto you." According as it is weak or strong, so are they: for it is
          not only the mother-grace but the nursing grace. Faith lies as it were
          nearest the fountain, and is the channel of conveyance of supply: so
          as it gets in, they get out for their nourishment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) It brings the healing they get to their wounds. Many a time the
          Christian's love is foundered in this fight, and is like to bleed to
          death, by an arrow of jealousy of God shot into their breast. Faith
          gives the combatant a sight of the glory of God in the face of Jesus;
          and so pulls out the arrow, John 2:4. Their patience is wounded, that
          it can no longer stand; faith brings the promise, Hebrews 2:3, "For
          the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall
          speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it, because it will
          surely come, it will not tarry," and it sets patience to its feet
          again. It brings the leaves of the tree of life, applies them to the
          wounds, and heals them; so the fight is renewed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) It carries on the fight, and obtains the victory: 1 Peter 5:9,
          "Whom resist, steadfast in the faith." 1 John 5:4, "This is the
          victory that overcomes the world, even our faith." It is by faith the
          enemy is put to flight, that partial victories are obtained during
          this life, and that the total victory is obtained at death, 2 Timothy
          4:7, 8. Thus by faith the martyrs swam through a sea of blood to the
          other side. And hence,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, The great design of the enemy is to weaken faith, and to wrest
          it away out of the combatants hand. It was by unbelief of the
          threatening of the first covenant, that Satan ruined the world at
          first: and now his great business is, to keep men from believing the
          promise of the second covenant. He knows full well their strength lies
          there; and take away that, they shall be as other men, that he may do
          with them what he will.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, The great design of a holy God, in that fight is the trial of
          faith. Hence says the apostle, 1 Peter 1:6, 7, "Wherein you greatly
          rejoice, though now for a season (if need be) you are in heaviness
          through manifold temptations: that the trial of your faith being much
          more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with
          fire, might be found unto praise, and honor, and glory, at the
          appearing of Jesus Christ." Faith acts in trusting an unseen God,
          believing his word, living upon the credit of the promise. Thus the
          Lord will have his people to go through the wilderness of this world,
          "walking by faith, not by sight." When they come to Heaven the trial
          of faith is over: so there is no more fight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. The second thing is, to show in what respects it is a good fight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The cause is good. Many fight to carry their ill cause by force,
          and their fightings proceed from an eager desire to satisfy their
          lusts, James 4:1, 2. But here is a good fight for a good cause,
          cleaving to the Lord over the belly of all difficulties; laying hold,
          and keeping hold, of eternal life. It is the cause of God, the cause
          of Christ, the cause of the sinner's eternal salvation, which cannot
          be but a good cause, to endeavor the maintenance of against all
          opposers.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is an honorable fight, worthy of a man of true valor and
          magnanimity, 1 Corinthians 9:25–27; Proverbs 16:32. The men of the
          world boast themselves of their strength in making their part good
          against weak worms like themselves. In the mean time they are slaves
          to the devil and their lusts, and have neither heart nor hand to
          resist them, but are captive at pleasure. But the believer in his
          fight encounters more formidable enemies: Ephesians 6:12, "We wrestle
          not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
          powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
          spiritual wickedness in high places."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. There is a good captain in this fight, the Lord Jesus Christ, under
          whose standard the believer fights, Hebrews 2:10. He went on the head
          of all the fighting company and overcame; and he calls his people to
          make their way through an army which he has already broken: Revelation
          3:21, "To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne,
          even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his
          throne." He is ever at their hand, and the cause is his; it must
          therefore needs be a good fight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. In regard of the good that is got even of the partial victories;
          the believers being helped to stand shocks, and get over them, though
          the war be not ended. Hence says the apostle, Romans 5:3, 4, 5, "We
          glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation works patience; and
          patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope makes not
          ashamed." The sharp trials of faith are hard in the time: but a review
          of bypast dangers, of the Lord's working for the soul in the time of
          the combat, gives an exquisite pleasure: so that the man comes to say,
          It is good that I was afflicted.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, In regard the final and complete victory in the end, is
          sure. Hence says the apostle, Romans 16:20, "The God of peace shall
          bruise Satan under your feet shortly." Many a battle the believer may
          lose in the course of the war; he may be shamefully foiled: but though
          the enemy prevail so far, yet the believer shall always be the
          conqueror at the end. The men of Ai got an advantage against Joshua's
          men: but it did not last; they got a complete victory at length over
          the men of Ai.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Why is the Christian life, in the disposal of holy providence,
          made a fight? No doubt the Lord could have given his people a constant
          sunshine as well on this side as the other side of death, and cleared
          the way of those armed adversaries that are ready to attack them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That the members may be conformed to their head in their passage
          through the world. The life that our Lord Jesus had in the world, was
          a fighting life all along, until he left the world, and entered into
          his glory. It is very agreeable then, that his followers should find
          it so, and so be conformed to their head in suffering as well as in
          reigning: Romans 8:17, "If so be that we suffer with him, that we may
          be also glorified together." 2 Timothy 2:12, "If we suffer, we shall
          also reign with him,"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That the nothingness, and utter unworthiness of the creature, which
          is to wear the crown of glory forever, may convincingly appear; so as
          they themselves and all others may see it is owing purely to free
          grace, not to them, Deuteronomy 8:2. We find the Lord usually laid
          those very low whom he minded to raise up on high; as in the case of
          Joseph, Moses, and David: and this to stain the pride of all glory,
          that they might see their own unworthiness, and that it was wholly of
          free grace, and owing to no merit of theirs. The Lord accordingly
          minding to bring a select company into Heaven at length, in the first
          place brings them into the wilderness. There they are stung with
          serpents, scorched with thirst, etc. whereby much corruption and
          weakness appeared in them, etc. and afterwards they are brought unto a
          wealthy place.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. For the greater confusion of the grand adversary, who, attacked him
          in person in the world, and whom he causes poor weak creatures to
          triumph over after they have maintained a fight with him, Romans
          16:20, "The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly."
          Our Lord Jesus overcame and baffled Satan's temptations in the
          wilderness. He triumphed over him on the cross, where the heat of the
          battle was: Colossians 2:15, "Having spoiled principalities and
          powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it."
          Satan renews the battle against his members on earth: and what is the
          issue? The strippling, with his sling and stone, lays Goliath on the
          green. The weak believer through faith confounds the united wit and
          force of men and devils, Luke 10:19, which tends to the greater
          confusion of the enemy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. For the greater glory of the captain of their salvation, the more
          full display of the freedom of grace, and the efficacy of his blood
          and Spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Every wound the believer gets in this fight, puts a new jewel in
          Christ's crown. For every new wound requires a new plaster from
          Christ. That is a new item for the believer in the debt-book of free
          grace, and so puts him more in free grace's debt.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Every wound the believer gives in this fight, considering his
          weakness and fecklessness, and the strength and subtlety of the enemy,
          does the same.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. For that they may have a greater variety of experiences: Romans
          5:4, "Patience works experience; and experience, hope." The exercised
          Christian is the man of most experience. There is a great variety of
          promises in the covenant, for the various cases the children of God
          may be in: and that his people may have experience of the relish of
          these promises, he brings them into the cases to which these promises
          are adapted. Who finds the sap of that promise, Isaiah 33:16, "Bread
          shall be given him, his waters shall be sure," like those that are put
          to a fight of faith for their daily bread; or of that, Deuteronomy
          32:36, "For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for
          his servants; when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none
          shut up, or left, like" those whose case is brought to an extremity in
          point of hopelessness?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, That Heaven may be the more sweet to them, when they come
          to it. It is in this respect that Heaven is called a place of comfort,
          Luke 16:25, wiping away of tears, rest from labors. None will find
          rest so sweet as the wearied man. A child of God come to his journey's
          end, after many falls and risings, after many ups and downs; set
          ashore after a dangerous voyage, will sing the song of Moses and of
          the Lamb in a higher strain, than if he had never been in danger from
          his first setting out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          IV. The fourth thing is, to show why their fight is called a fight of
          faith. The reason is, because by that means all the glory of the
          victories obtained redounds to free grace, not to the sinner himself:
          Romans 4:16, "It is of faith, that it might be by grace." The Lord is
          jealous of his own glory, and sinful man is very apt to ascribe
          something to himself; therefore faith is pitched upon; for its
          activity lies in these two.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. In carrying the sinner quite out of himself, and from off his own
          bottom. Hence believers are said to have no confidence in the flesh,
          Philip. 3:3. The unbeliever's great strength lies in summoning
          together all the power of his natural abilities, and in confidence
          thereof trying the battle. But faith makes a man to be denied to all
          his own abilities, and not to lean to himself, his light, strength,
          etc. And therefore as the fire burns keenest in the sharp frost, so
          faith acts most vigorously, when sentence of death is passed on all
          probable means, as Abraham's faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In leaning upon the Lord for all. Hence believers are also said to
          rejoice in Christ Jesus, Philip. 3:3. Faith goes out to the battle in
          the name of the Lord, holding by his promise, trusting that he will
          make it out: and so it is the mouth of the soul that sucks the sap of
          the promise, by a fiducial application of it, and trusting in it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          V. I will touch at some particular fights of faith, the Christian may
          have in his course heavenward, such as,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. In a call to some more than ordinary work or duty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">2. In desertion.</p>
        <p align="justify">3. In temptations from Satan.</p>
        <p align="justify">4. In afflictions.</p>
        <p align="justify">5. With this present evil world.</p>
        <p align="justify">6. With sin.</p>
        <p align="justify">7. With death.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, There is a fight of faith, in a call to some more than ordinary
          work or duty. Sometimes the Lord takes trial of his people by calling
          them to some extraordinary piece of duty. Thus Abraham was called out
          to this field, Genesis 22:1; Moses to bring the children of Israel out
          of Egypt, Exodus 3; and Jonah, to preach to the Ninevites.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here the believer gets his hands full, as much as he is able to
          wrestle with; yes, and sometimes as much as lays him by, his faith
          failing. Thus Jonah was so put to it in this fight, that he goes to
          fly towards Tarshish, to shift the duty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Now, what makes the difficulty here, are,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The hardness of the work in itself, as in Abraham's case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) A deep sense of our inability for it, as in the case of Moses,
          when commanded to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt, Exodus
          4:10. For sometimes it is that which the Christian seems of all things
          to be most unfit for.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) The great danger there may be in it, so that the Christian must
          run a risk in setting about it. Sometimes he must risk his reputation,
          as in Jonah's case; sometimes he must risk even his safety or life.
          Here there is a particular fight of faith to be fought. And therein
          faith is to be exerted,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. In complying with God's call in the faith of the promise of
          strength for it. Hence says the apostle, Philip. 4:13, "I can do all
          things through Christ which strengthens me." God never calls his
          people to any duty, but what they have ground to expect furniture for
          from himself in the way of believing: "No man goes a warfare on his
          own charges." God's call implies a promise of furniture: "The way of
          the Lord is strength to the upright." And God suits the back to the
          burden. It is much alike then whether it be little work and little
          strength, or g reat work and strength conform.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In following the duty, in the faith of divine protection, as far as
          he sees good. Faith trusts God with one's safety in the way of duty,
          according to th e promise, Psalm 91:11, "He shall give his angels
          charge over you, to keep you in all your ways." As long as one is
          found in the way where God bids him go, he may be sure God will set a
          hedge about him, and make all work together for his good.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, There is a fight of faith in desertion. Here the believer is
          on the dark mountains in a special manner, the Lord in the depth of
          Sovereign wisdom withdrawing from him. And in this case there may be
          several things very heavy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Darkness covering the believer's spirit, Isaiah 50:10, where! he
          goes mourning without the sun. Their former light is taken away, and
          clouds and mists arise, so they cannot know their we
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Indisposition for duty, proceeding sometimes from a listlessness to
          communion with God, Canticles 5:2, sometimes from the extremity of
          trouble, Psalm, 77:4. So that the soul is not more unfit for duty,
          than when there is most need.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. An army of doubts and fears attacking them, doubting of their love
          to God, and God's love to them, Psalm 77:7, downwards.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The terrors of God set in battle-array against them, Job. 6:4. They
          "remember God, and are troubled," Psalm 77:3, The man is carried
          captive from Zion to Sinai; the discharge is lost, and the law bends
          up a process against him. God appears an enemy, Psalm 88:15.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Now faith's part here in this fight is,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, To justify God in the dispensation, Psalm 22:3, and to submit to
          sovereignty, Job 2:9, 10, believing he does all things well. The man
          has to do with him whose will is the supreme law, and so must not
          adventure to call him to an account.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, To cleave to God in Christ by a faith of adherence; saying with
          Job, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him, Job 13:15. He must
          resolutely adhere, over the belly of discouragements.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, To believe an outgate in due time; saying with the church, Micah
          7:8, "When I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord
          shall be a light unto me." Hence is that exhortation, Isaiah 50:10,
          "Who is among you that fears the Lord, that obeys the voice of his
          servant, that walks in darkness, and has no light? let him trust in
          the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, To hold the conclusion of our interest, notwithstanding the
          arguments drawn from the divine dispensation to prove us naught. Hence
          says Job chapter 27:5, 6, "Until I die, I will not remove my integrity
          from me. My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my
          heart shall not reproach me so long as I live."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5thly, Continuing in the way of duty notwithstanding; as Job did,
          chapter 1:20, 21, who, notwithstanding all the catamites that befell
          him, blessed God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thirdly, There is a fight of faith in temptations from Satan. He is
          the declared enemy of God and mankind. Natural men he tempts to sin,
          to get them kept the surer in his gripes; the godly, that he may mar
          their communion with God, their comfort and growth, and may make their
          lives bitter, if he cannot get them back entirely to his service; both
          that he may get God dishonored by them. The temptations of Satan are
          too many to be reckoned up particularly; but I shall take notice of
          these eight things following, in which you would set yourselves to
          fight the fight of faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Temptations to sin, after some seeming or real enjoyment of God in
          ordinances or providences. Nothing is more ordinary than a subtle or
          furious attack of the devil on a person brought into a better case
          than ordinary, Canticles 5:1, 2. Thus after solemn ordinances. So
          after Christ's baptism, Matthew 4:1; and the disciples after the first
          communion. Satan is a proud, envious Spirit. The better it is with a
          soul, the more likely is the honor of God to be advanced, and their
          own salvation. And neither of these can that malicious spirit endure.
          In this case faith is to manage a fight, by,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing the Scripture warnings and instances of this: Luke
          22:31, "And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to
          have you, that he may sift you as wheat." 2 Corinthians 12:7. "And
          lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the
          revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger
          of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure." Hereby
          the soul will be set to watch before the temptation come, and so be in
          better case to resist it; and when it is come, will see that it is no
          more than what God's people have met with.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Resisting, not in confidence of vows, purposes, and resolutions,
          the present frame of the heart, or grace already received; but in
          confidence of the grace that is in Christ, and the new supplies of it:
          2 Corinthians 12:9, "My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength
          is made perfect in weakness." 2 Timothy 2:1, "You there fore, my son,
          be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus." It is confidence in
          what we have in ourselves that mars all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Temptations to the sin that one is most easily laid aside unto:
          Hebrews 12:1, "Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does
          so easily beset us." Satan will be sure to attack you on the weak
          side, where he is most likely to prevail. He knows what is the sin of
          one's constitution, age, calling, and the like, and there to set on
          where the wall is weakest. But he who minds for Heaven, must resist,
          and fight against him, and that in faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing the necessity of overcoming, even in that particular:
          Matthew 5:29, 30, "If your right eye offend you, pluck it out, and
          cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your
          members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast
          into Hell, And if your right hand offend you, cut it off, and cast it
          from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should
          perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into Hell." Men
          would do well to remember that there the one thing lacking, which
          ruins all, may lie, Mark 10:21. And if the devil can get the man kept
          under the dominion of any one lust, it will serve his purpose for that
          man's eternal ruin, though he have otherwise many good things about
          him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing, that such temptations may be overcome and got
          mastered: Luke 17:6, "If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you
          might say unto this Sycamore-tree, Be you plucked up by the root, and
          be you planted in the sea; and it should obey you." These temptations
          men do so naturally incline to comply with, that they are ready to
          think, it is in vain to offer to resist them, for it will not do,
          Jeremiah 2:25, "You said, There is no hope. No, for I have loved
          strangers, and after them will I go." This is the language of
          unbelief, which faith must contradict, if one would stand.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing, that, in the use of appointed means, he shall
          overcome, through grace and strength from the Lord: Mark 11:24, "What
          things soever you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them,
          and you shall have them." This faith makes the soul in this case like
          a giant refreshed with wine, opposing Christ's promised strength to
          its own weakness, and the force of the temptation; and so brings it
          off victorious, Isaiah 40. and 45:24.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Temptations to the grossest sins. Nobody is out of hazard of these,
          while in this world, 1 Corinthians 10:12, "Let him that thinks he
          stands, take heed lest he fall." Satan makes great hellish gain by
          these; he wastes and defiles the conscience, gets God greatly
          dishonored, and religion exposed to reproach by them. He gets the mask
          pulled off many hypocrites by them; and gets sincere Christians
          sometimes made to go halting to the grave by them, Proverbs 7:26. They
          that would see Heaven must resist, and resist in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing that they are snares for soul-ruin, according to the
          word, Proverbs 6:27, 28, "Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his
          clothes not be burnt? Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be
          burnt?" and chapter 1:17, "Surely in vain the net is spread in the
          sight of any bird." It is the work of faith to discern, by the glass
          of the word, Satan's devices, and arts of destruction; that the soul,
          seeing them so, may conceive a horror of them. Hence says the apostle,
          Romans 12:9, "Abhor that which is evil."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing that it is not the temptation, but the yielding to it,
          that will provoke God against you. I own, that such temptations are
          often sent as a punishment for other sins, as Judas' covetousness was
          punished with a temptation to betray Christ for money: and by such
          means God often shakes himself loose of hypocrites, as in Judas' case,
          and spews them out of his mouth, leaving them to yield to them,
          Revelation 3:16. And it is often the thought of serious souls, that
          temptations to sins so very gross are a sign of the Lord's hatred
          against them: yet that is a plain mistake; for what sin is there so
          gross but a child of God may be tempted to it? Asaph was tempted to
          deny a providence, Psalm 73:13. Agur saw himself in hazard of
          atheistic contempt of God, Proverbs 30:9. Job was tempted to blaspheme
          and curse God, Job 1:11, 12. to self-murder, chapter 7:15. Christ
          himself was tempted to distrust, self-murder, and worshiping of the
          devil, Matthew 4. The faith of these things will be strengthening
          under such horrid temptations.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing the word condemning and forbidding these sins, and so
          opposing Heaven's word of command and threatening unto the temptation.
          Thus our Lord resisted all his temptations in faith, Matthew 4. This
          is faith's wielding the sword of the Spirit against the tempter, which
          is fitted to awe the heart with the authority of God, and fill it with
          abhorrence of the temptation. Whenever the temptation is given, there
          should presently be some apt Scripture to oppose to it in faith; and
          as oft as the temptation is repeated, do you repeat the word in faith,
          and Satan will fly at length. So in such cases you should have such
          Scriptures as these ready, Deuteronomy 28:58, 59; Psalm 14:1; 1 John
          3:15; Ephesians 5:5, 6.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, Believing the promises suited to the case. There is no
          temptation any can be in, but there is a promise suited for it in the
          word, which is the armor faith must wield in order to overcome: 1
          Corinthians 10:13, God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
          tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also
          make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it." James 4:7,
          "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you." And in the faith of the
          promise make resistance, not doubting but it shall be accomplished in
          your case: and according to your faith of the promise in the use of
          means, so shall it be; as with Peter on the water, and the army
          against Amalek with Moses' hands lift up.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Temptations artfully suited to one's circumstances. Satan has a
          hellish are of framing his temptations upon his observation of
          people's circumstances, wherein they are most likely to take with
          them. Thus Christ being an hungered, the devil tempted him to
          distrust, Matthew 4:3. Job was tempted to blaspheme and despair under
          his afflictions. Achan was tempted to steal, a fair opportunity
          offering. Thus he has his temptations suited to the age and the young,
          the poor and the rich, the jovial and those of a sorrowful heart. He
          knows, that in such a case he rows with the stream, and is most likely
          to prevail. But resist you in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, according to the word, that Satan watches all
          opportunities against you, 1 Peter 5:8. "Be sober, be vigilant;
          because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about
          seeking whom he may devour." This will make you to watch against him,
          when the enemy has such an advantage against you that he will not let
          slip. They had not need to sleep who are within the enemy's gunshot.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing that God's eye is on you, and the Lord has you upon
          your trials in that particular, to which you are so tempted. Hence
          says Joseph, Genesis 39:9, "How can I do this great wickedness, and
          sin against God? Men's corrupt hearts are apt to think, when a fair
          occasion of sinning lies before them, that now is the time to gratify
          the lust; but happy were they could they think, now, here is a trial
          for me, and God is looking on to see how I will behave.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing that as the devil suits his temptations, so Christ
          suits his help and assistance, to the circumstances of poor sinners:
          so that resolving to resist, you may say, There are more with us than
          against us, 1 Corinthians 10:13, forfeited. Whatever way the stream
          runs for your compliance with the temptation, stretch out your
          withered hands to swim against it, in faith of your bearing upon the
          ground of God's faithfulness, Isaiah 40:28–30.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Temptations from one sin to another. Satan knows, that one sin
          makes way for another; and that to get in his finger once, is the way
          to get in his whole hand after. So Eve's lustful look to the forbidden
          fruit, made way for her taking, taking for eating, that for giving to
          her husband and his eating: and so the whole world's ruin was
          completed, Genesis 3:6. Thus it is usual for Satan to prevail with
          those that have yielded to him in one temptation, to lie for covering
          it again. And some sins natively lead to others; as in the well known
          story of the three sins one was tempted to. Thus drunkenness makes men
          an easy prey to impurity, Proverbs 23:33. And some when once the devil
          has got them to be harlots, the temptation from that, and from their
          credit, has made them murderers: some murdering their children after
          they are born, some before they are born, going about to destroy their
          conceptions; the latter as well as the former murderers, and guilty of
          innocent blood in a degree beyond Onan, Genesis 38:9, whom the Lord
          himself slew as a murderer. But you must resist, and that in faith.
          Happy they Who resist the beginnings of sin, who crush the viper in
          the bud: but when you are fallen into the snare, fight against the
          temptation to add sin to sin, or to cover one sin with another.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, that there is mercy for penitents, but none for those
          Who harden themselves in their wickedness: Proverbs 28:13, "He who
          covers his sins, shall not prosper: but whoever confesses and forsakes
          them, shall have mercy." Nay, there is not a more ready way under
          Heaven to expose sinners to the arrows of God's wrath, than to be
          hardened in wickedness, Deut 29:19, 20.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing, that the design of the temptation to one sin from
          another, is plainly the ruin of the soul, that the devil may get the
          person so deep into the mire, that he may never win out again. Thus he
          drove Judas from the betraying of Christ, into an attack against his
          own life. For thus the one sin becomes a need-nail to the other,
          shutting up the soul under the guilt of it, not to be removed but by a
          miracle of mercy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing, that all the shame, and pain, and misery that can
          follow in the world, upon one sin, is not to be laid in the balance
          with the wrath of God, that is kindled against the sinner by running
          into another sin because he has been guilty of one, Matthew 16:26.
          This all such as so do will find, either in this world, or in Hell,
          when God shall make all their sins together lie on their own heads.
          For sooner or later sin will find out the guilty, Numbers 32:23.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, Believing the promise of pardon through the Redeemer's blood,
          however atrocious and heinous the sin is: 1 John 1:7, "The blood of
          Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin." Some are led on from
          one sin to another, because they have no sense of the ill and danger
          of it to their souls: the faith of God's testimony of their sin would
          cure this, and make them cry out, Undone. Others have a secret despair
          of finding mercy, and so they proceed from, evil to worse: but the
          faith of the promise of pardon would cure that: Isaiah 1:18, "Come now
          and let us reason together, says the Lord: though your sins be as
          scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
          crimson, they shall be as wool."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5thly, Believing the promise of renewed strength even to those that
          have slighted it before, Jeremiah 3:14. They who have been foiled by
          one temptation, may get victory over another. They may have taken a
          large step on the devil's ground, who yet looking to Christ by faith,
          may stop and go no further, Psalm 65:3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Temptations suddenly and surprisingly cast in, and resolutely
          continued, 2 Corinthians 12:8. These are Satan's fiery darts,
          Ephesians 6:16. This is a furious assault of the devil, which he often
          makes use of in blasphemous or other diabolical injections into the
          minds of poor sinners; where the soul is in no better case than one,
          who descending a thatched house, no sooner gets one fire-ball
          quenched, but another is thrown in on him. If at any time this be your
          case, set to vigorous resistance, in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, that these are your affliction and trial, but no
          further your sin than you yield or consent to them. This is clear from
          the horrible Satanic suggestions made to our Savior, Matthew 4. while
          yet there was no sin in him. Satan does with these as harlots laying
          their brats at the door of honest matrons, so confounding, perplexing,
          and hurrying the poor tempted sinner, that he is apt to take the voice
          of Satan for his own voice. But unless you yield to them, and embrace
          them, Satan, and only he, shall be accountable for them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Adhering resolutely by faith to the Lord Jesus, in that hour and
          power of darkness, as your Lord and Savior did. Thus our Lord gave us
          an example, John 12:27, "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I
          say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto
          this hour." If ever that resolute adherence is necessary, it is
          necessary at such a time: Isaiah 50:10, "Who is among you that fears
          the Lord, that obeys the voice of his servant, that walks in darkness,
          and has no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon
          his God." The great end and design of the tempter by these furious
          attacks, is, to drive the poor tossed tempted creature from his hold
          of Christ: but we should be like the traveler in the windy day, that
          holds his cloak the faster the harder it blows.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing, that there is no safety in parleying with the
          tempter, but ever and anon the temptation is to be rejected with
          abhorrence. It was Eve's parley with the tempter, that laid the
          foundation of the ruin of the world by the first sin, Genesis 3.
          Setting on the Second Adam, he got his answer a refusal, with
          abhorrence of his proposal, immediately, Matthew 4. These suggestions
          are not so far to be listened to, as that one should think with
          himself whether he should comply with them or not. "The Lord rebuke
          you," is the short and safe answer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, Believingly opposing the Lord's word to them, which condemns
          and forbids the things tempted to. In those temptations our Savior met
          with, which were shocking even to the light of nature, it is
          remarkable he still opposes scripture to them, Matthew 4:7, 10. For
          that is a divine ordinance for repelling of temptation, to be
          reiterated in faith as often as Satan repeats his temptation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5thly, Believing, that there is grace in Christ Jesus sufficient for
          repelling these most violent temptations, and that it is sufficient
          for you in your case in particular, Hence says our Lord, 2 Corinthians
          12:9, "My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect
          in weakness." If Satan prevail so far as to cause the tempted to
          think, that the violence of the temptation is so great that it is not
          possible for them to stand against it; this is such a weakening of
          faith, that the breach can hardly miss to be made there, as a breaking
          forth of an high wall in an instant. And Satan cannot obtain it of the
          tempted but by turning his eyes away from Christ into himself;
          Therefore, in that hour of darkness, let the tempted keep his eye on
          the fullness of strength in Christ for him: 2. Timothy 2:1, "You
          therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6thly, Believing the promise of victory to the poor struggler with
          temptation: James 4:7, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
          The faith of the victory is necessary to animate the tempted to
          continue the struggle, and will make him in the temptation to be like
          a giant refreshed with wine, and will undoubtedly bring him off
          victorious at length. For there is the decision, "According to your
          faith, so be it unto you."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Temptations striking at the very foundations of faith and religion,
          such as against the being of God, and the divine authority of the
          scriptures, Psalm 14:1. and 73:13. These are most dangerous, but they
          are what the devil himself cannot prevail with himself to believe;
          though he gladly would, yet he cannot be an atheist, nor an infidel as
          to the scriptures, James 2:19. But he sometimes would palm these foul
          atheistic principles on poor sinners, even saints of God, who want not
          an atheistic principle in them to work upon. If at any time Satan
          attack you with such temptations, you must resist them,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, that they are the spawn of the old serpent in the
          corrupt heart, the hissing of the crooked serpent: Psalm 14:1, "The
          fool has said in his heart, There is no God." Hence it is said of the
          beast in Revelation 13:6 that "he opened his mouth in blasphemy
          against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that
          dwell in Heaven." This is the reception they should get immediately,
          faith discerning the devil's cloven foot in them at their very first
          appearance. Whether they come immediately from the devil, or from the
          corrupt heart itself moved by Satan, it is all a case in this point;
          believe them to be hellish, devilish, most abominable, and to be
          treated with the utmost abhorrence. And the sooner you give them that
          entertainment, the victory will be the more easy and speedy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Resolutely believing the foundation-principles which the
          temptation strikes against, over the belly of the Satanic objections
          mustered up against them before you, though you be not able to answer
          those objections or loose the difficulties: Hebrews 11:6, "He who
          comes to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of
          them that diligently seek him." 2 Timothy 3:16, "All scripture is
          given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for
          reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness." And hence
          is that exhortation of the apostle, Ephesians 6:16, "Above all, taking
          the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the
          fiery darts of the wicked."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is not wanting store of reasons to support the great
          foundation-principles of religion; and nothing but sophistry can be
          brought against them, which reason sufficiently enlightened may
          discover. There are convincing arguments for the being of a God, and
          the authority of the scriptures, to be used against atheists. But when
          you are assaulted with these temptations, I dare not advise you to the
          way of disputing with the tempter, but to the way of believing; not to
          the bringing reasons for these principles against him, and answering
          his hellish objections against them, but to a resolute holding of the
          conclusion over the belly of all his objections; because,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) They are first principles, and you are not obliged to dispute
          them with any, unless it were to keep an opposer from ruin, as in the
          case of atheists. But this has no place in a combat with the devil, of
          whom there is no hope.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Because the devil is a spirit with whom we are not to commune and
          enter into reasoning without a special call. Our Lord himself, though
          he could have reasoned the devil out of it, yet he took not that
          method, but just opposed to his temptations the testimony of
          scripture. And it is certainly the safest way for us, whatever we have
          to say in temptation, to say it to God, rather than to the devil.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Because the devil is a disputant too subtle for us, and in the
          way of wit and reason may quickly over-reach us. I make no question,
          but the devil is a philosopher and divine far beyond any of our
          greatest scholars: and men may expect from him most subtle turns of
          wit to elude their arguments, and to start objections which it will
          not be easy to answer. And therefore it is not safe to engage in
          dispute with him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But do you resolutely believe the principles you have received on
          divine authority, which you have no reason to quit on the devil's
          contrary testimony, though he pretend reason for it, since he is known
          to be a liar and murderer. This the apostle prescribes, Ephesians
          6:16. forfeited. And this method of holding by the conclusion
          resolutely, while the sinner is not capable to answer the objections,
          is recommended to us by the practice of the saints, Jeremiah 12:1;
          Matthew 15:25. Therefore, while Satan casts in these temptations, or
          raises them in your heart, enter your protestation against them,
          (crying out of violence and wrong), that you allow them not, you do
          believe, and will through his grace believe these foundations, and
          will not quit them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing and applying the promise of saving illumination, and
          teaching of the Spirit. It is light from the Lord himself, that must
          dispel the mists that Satan raises in the corrupt heart, wherein these
          horrible temptations do take place. Hence says our Lord to Peter,
          Matthew 16:17, "Blessed are you Simon Bar-Jonah: for flesh and blood
          has not revealed it unto you, but my Father which is in Heaven." 1
          Corinthians 2:12, "Now we have received, not the spirit of the world,
          but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are
          freely given to us of God." And this light is brought in, by faith's
          applying the promises suited to the case. Of these are many, such as
          Hebrews 8:11; John 17, and 14:21. And the tempted should lift his eyes
          unto the Lord, that he may so shine in his word, into his soul, as
          that his light may dispel the darkness, according to his promise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, Believing the scripture accounts of these things, of those
          mysteries of providence from whence Satan raises these temptations.
          Satan sometimes observes the spirits even of saints fretted and
          rankled with long and sore afflictions, their prayers not heard and
          answered, the wicked prospering, and they in great distress: and here
          he plants his cannon, to beat down from these, even the foundations of
          all religion. Thus he dealt with Asaph, Psalm 73:12, 13, 14. And he
          resists him by believing the scripture account of those mysteries of
          providence, verses 16–18. This is the way to undermine Satan's
          battery, to rase the foundations on which he builds.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          What will that malicious spirit make of the long and sore distresses
          of God's people, and the prosperity of the wicked, against the being
          or nature of God, and the certainty of his word? The sun may hide his
          head long in a stormy winter; but will any say therefore, there is no
          sun, or that the ordinances of the heavens fail and misgive? Is not
          one day with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one
          day? Does not the scripture show, that the wicked are raised on high,
          that they may fall more grievously? Is there not a judgment to come,
          and a long eternity enough to show God's good pleasure in the vessels
          of his mercy, and his wrath against the vessels of wrath, though
          neither the godly have two summers, nor the wicked two winters, in one
          year? Have not prayers lain long over, that yet have got a gracious
          answer at length? Zechariah 7:3; James 5:11.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus believing is the method of resisting in these temptations.
          Howbeit, when you are out of the shock of temptation in these matters,
          it would be of good use to fortify and confirm your faith of the
          foundation principles of religion, with all the reasons and arguments
          you can draw together for them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. Lastly, Temptations of delusion. This is a kind of temptation most
          hard to resist, Satan therein transforming himself into an angel of
          light, and pressing to sin under the notion of duty, 2 Corinthians
          11:14. It is a great trial of faith, Matthew 24:24; a great and
          fearful plague where it takes, Isaiah 66:4; 2 Thessalonians 2:11, 12,
          and has always a lamentable upshot, according to the nature thereof,
          Isaiah 1.. But you must resist in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, believing your own weakness and darkness in yourselves, together
          with the diligence of Satan the great seducer, according to the
          scripture, 2 Corinthians 3:5, "We are not sufficient of ourselves to
          think anything as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is of God. 1 Peter
          5:8, "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
          roaring lion, walking about seeking whom he may devour." It is
          self-conceit, a high opinion of our own great attainments, that most
          readily betrays men into the snare of delusion; for these are in
          little fear of Satan's wiles, and so are the more easily caught in his
          snare.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing the holy scriptures to be the only rule of faith and
          manners, and a full and perfect rule; and to improve it so: Isaiah
          8:20, "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to
          this word, it is because there is no light in them." There is an itch
          in the nature of man, to be wise above what is written; and sometimes
          Satan has made his gain thereof by visions, voices, dreams,
          impressions, and impulses. But in all such cases take head to
          yourselves, that Satan delude you not: but bring the matter to the
          word written, and thereby examine it. What is of God will abide the
          trial by that touch-stone; and the more closely it is brought to the
          word, it will appear the more clear: what is not so, will lose its
          luster there, as ill wares brought out to the light of the sun. And
          therefore those under delusion are mighty loathe to examine by the
          word: 1 John 4:1, "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the
          Spirits whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone
          out into the world. 2 Peter 1:18, 19, "And this voice which came from
          Heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. We have also
          a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take
          head, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn,
          and the day-star arise in your hearts." The holy scripture is the
          stated way of communication between Heaven and us: it is from the Holy
          Spirit, and it is not possible that he should contradict himself,
          Isaiah 59.. Therefore "though we, or an angel from Heaven, preach any
          other gospel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let
          him be accursed," Galatians 1:8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Believing the promise of guidance into all truth, John 16:13,
          "Howbeit, when he the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into
          all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall
          hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come." Psalm
          25:2, "The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach
          his way." The soul thus emptied of itself, and leaning to the Lord
          Christ for his teaching, will not want teaching in the use of means.
          Hence says the Psalmist, Psalm 28:7, "The Lord is my strength and my
          shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped." Our Lord Jesus is
          the appointed leader and guide of his people, Isaiah 55:4. He is given
          of God for a light of the people. He has set us our ways-marks in this
          as in all other cases. Divine manifestations are always sanctifying
          and humbling; delusions puff up, and leave the soul always as unholy
          as they found it. Divine manifestations have ever an immediate
          tendency to holiness; delusions have always a tendency to unholiness.
          And even when duty is pressed in delusion, it will readily be found
          either out of season, or not the duty of one's station, or to have
          some such flaw in it or other.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Fourthly, There is a fight of faith in afflictions: Hebrews 10:32,
          "Call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were
          illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions." One may as
          well think to travel without the flies annoying him in a hot summer
          day, as to go through the world without meeting with afflictions. They
          are common to good and bad. In the Lord's way one cannot miss them:
          Acts 14:22, "We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom
          of God." In the way of sin one will meet them too: Ecclesiastes 10:8,
          "He who digs a pit, shall fall into it; and whoever breaks an hedge, a
          serpent shall bite him." Sovereignty distributes them, to some more,
          to others less; but to all, some. The native effect of afflictions on
          the guilty creature, is to drive it away from God, (however they are
          oft turned to good); even as the lash of a whip natively drives away
          him that is lashed, from him that lashes. So that it is owing to
          something else that they do good to sinners. And that,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. To a word of divine appointment. Afflictions are an ordinance of
          God for good to poor sinners: Isaiah 27:9, "By this therefore shall
          the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take
          away his sin." And a divine appointment will alter the nature and
          operation of a thing. The savor of burnt flesh is very unpleasant, but
          the divine ordinance of sacrificing made it a sweet savor, Genesis
          8:21. Clay laid on one's eyes is a mean natively to make one blind:
          yet, by virtue of a divine ordinance, it cured blindness, John 9:6, 7.
          So afflictions natively, or of themselves, drive away the soul from
          God, but, by virtue of a divine ordinance, lead it to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. To a receiving of them in faith: 2 Corinthians 4:17, 18, "For our
          light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more
          exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things
          which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things
          which are seen, are temporal; but the things which are not seen, are
          eternal." See Hebrews 11:35–39. Whoever would profit by a divine
          ordinance, must receive it in faith, Hebrews 4:2. For to every divine
          ordinance there is a promise annexed to be believed: and the promise
          being believed, the ordinance has its effect. So that we see
          afflictions do good to some, to others no good, but ill: Why? It is
          faith and unbelief that make the difference.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wherefore you must fight in faith against the native tendency of
          afflictions in themselves. And if you ask, What is that tendency in
          afflictions on the guilty creature, which he must fight against? and,
          How must one fight in faith against it? I answer in the six following
          particulars. It is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. To impress the person with the apprehension that God is his enemy,
          and that he is seeking his ruin: 2 Kings 6.. Even Job himself was
          carried away with this hard thought of God, Job 33:10, 11, "Behold, he
          finds occasions against me, he counts me for his enemy. He puts my
          feet in the stocks, he marks all my paths." Guilt lying on the
          conscience, makes it full of hard thoughts of God, and terrible
          forebodings. Whenever the guilty soul hears from Heaven by affliction,
          it is ready to strike in his mind, Now this is for my sin, and God is
          proclaiming war against me to ruin me. Hence affliction is several
          times the means of awakening the secure sinner; though he can never
          come to God until he believe.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Now, you must fight against this in faith,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, that though all your afflictions are infallible signs
          of God's hatred of your sin, and his seeking the ruin of it; yet no
          affliction on you in this world can be such a sign of God's hatred of
          your persons, and his seeking your ruin, Ecclesiastes 9:1, 2. No, no;
          God's dearest children may have as heavy afflictions on their backs,
          as any other persons in the world, Psalm 73:12, 14. And no wonder,
          since God's only begotten Son had the heaviest burden of afflictions
          that ever was on the back of a man.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing, that afflictions are God's ordinance for good to the
          afflicted, even as really as is the preaching of the word to them:
          Proverbs 29:15, "The rod and reproof give wisdom." They are the
          discipline of God's house, as the word is the doctrine of it: Hebrews
          12:6, "For whom the Lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every son
          whom he receives." So the design of the rod is your good, as the
          design of physic is the health of the patient; though, in the
          meantime, one, by misguiding under it, may indeed kill himself; even
          as one, by not complying with the design of the affliction may wound
          his own soul. It is certain, that afflictions have a word of divine
          appointment for good; there is a blessing annexed to them by promise:
          but how can you share of it, if you do not believe them to be an
          ordinance of God for good?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing, that God by these means is seeking your good, as
          using towards you the very same means that he does towards the dearest
          of his children: 2 Peter 3:9, "The Lord is not slack concerning his
          promise, (as some men count slackness,) but is long-suffering to
          us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come
          to repentance." Revelation 3:19, "As many as I love, I rebuke and
          chasten: be zealous therefore and repent." Should a physician give you
          the very same remedy that he gives to his own child, sick of your
          disease; what but unreasonable jealousy should make you think he
          designs ill to you? And what but unbelief then can it be that makes
          you think, that God seeks your ruin by affliction, with which he works
          the cure of his own?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, Believing the promise annexed to that ordinance, with
          application to yourselves, that your affliction, through his grace,
          shall do you good: Isaiah 27:9, "By this therefore shall the iniquity
          of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his sin."
          Zephaniah 3:12, 13, "I will also leave in the midst of you an
          afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the
          Lord. The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies:
          neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they
          shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid." This is the
          way to partake of the efficacy of the ordinance of affliction; and it
          is the faith of it that makes the saints welcome the rod, to be
          patient under it, and to comply with the design of it, Micah 7:8, 9;
          while those that expect no good of them, get as little many times.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. To take all heart and hand from him in his approaches to God. Hence
          says the Psalm mist, Psalm 77:3, "I remembered God, and was troubled:
          I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. The guilty conscience
          takes up the affliction, and just knocks him down with it, fells him
          with it before the Lord. He is filled with consternation before an
          angry God, and his heart fails, and can look for no good at the Lord's
          hand, 1 John 3:20, 21. The affliction lies so heavy upon the poor
          sinner, that he cannot think there is any hope of God's hearing his
          prayers, or making him welcome to the throne of grace. Hence says Job
          chapter 9:16, 17, "If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would
          I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. For he breaks me
          with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause." But you must
          fight against this in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, that there are affections of compassion in God, while
          nothing but frowns appear (Psalm 130:1, 7.) in his countenance. And it
          is faith's work, to take up these affections of mercy in as afflicting
          God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">QUESTION. What way shall one perceive them?</p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. While you behold his anger in his providences, you must look
          to his word by faith, and there you will see these affections of
          mercy: Isaiah 49:14–17, "But Zion said, The Lord has forsaken me, and
          my Lord has forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that
          she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yes, they may
          forget, yet will I not forget you. Behold, I have graven you upon the
          palms of my hands, your walls are continually before me. Your children
          shall make haste; your destroyers, and they that made you waste, shall
          go forth of you." Chapter 63:9, "In all their affliction he was
          afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and
          in his pity he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them, all
          the days of old. And you may be helped hereto, by considering the
          heart of a father smiting his own child; where, in a sense, the heart
          goes not along with the hand. Thus the church prays, but in faith:
          Isaiah 63:15, 16, "Look down from Heaven, and behold from the
          habitation of your holiness and of your glory: where is your zeal and
          your strength, the sounding of your affections, and of your mercies
          towards me? are they restrained? Doubtless you are our father, though
          Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: you, O Lord,
          are our father, our redeemer, your name is from everlasting." And this
          the church does, and that on good grounds, Lamentations 3:33, "For he
          does not afflict willingly [Hebrew, from his heart] nor grieve the
          children of men."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing the testimony of God's word, as to instances of
          persons that have had God's heart towards them, while his hand has
          been lying heavy on them. Thus it was with Gideon, Judg. 6:12, 13.
          Thus it was with Job: he was most dear to God, yet he was given up
          unto the power of Satan to afflict him. And thus it was with a cloud
          of witnesses. These things are written for your learning; that you,
          through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing the promise of hearing the prayers of the afflicted,
          with application to yourselves: Psalm 50:15, "Call upon me in the day
          of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me." Oppose this
          promise in faith, to the disheartening operation of the affliction
          upon you before the Lord: take this cordial by the mouth of faith,
          when you begin to faint in your approaches to God. So shall you "lift
          up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees." Is there a secret
          whisper, that you are so afflicted that you need not pray? It is the
          surmise of unbelief. Say you, Since I am so afflicted, I am called to
          pray, James 5:13, "Is any among you afflicted? let him pray:" and
          there is a particular encouragement in my case, Psalm 102:17, "He will
          regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. To frighten the sinner away from God. Thus our first parents saw
          they were naked, and presently fled to hide themselves from the Lord.
          When the conscience is fired with guilt under affliction, its natural
          motion is to run away from God: 1 Samuel 6:20, 21, "And the men of
          Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God? and
          to whom shall he go up from us? And they sent messengers to the
          inhabitants of Kirjath jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought
          again the ark of the Lord; come you down, and fetch it up to you."
          Hence the sorrow of the world is said to work death, because the more
          deep one is drenched in it, the farther he goes from God. Satan knows
          this very well, and therefore is he so eager to have sinners
          afflicted, and to make their lives bitter with it; though he is
          sometimes outshot in his own bow, as in Job's case. But you must fight
          against this in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, that God sends on afflictions, not to frighten the
          sinner from him, but to bring the sinner to him: Hosea 4., "The wind
          has bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of
          their sacrifices," Chapter 5:1, "Hear you this, O priests, and
          hearken, you house of Israel, and give you ear, O house of the king;
          for judgment is toward you, because you have been a snare on Mizpah,
          and a net spread upon Tabor." It is indeed God's ordinary method to
          bring home runaways and backsliders: Hosea 2:6, 7, "Therefore, behold,
          I will hedge up your ways with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall
          not find her paths. And she shall follow after her lovers, but she
          shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find
          them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband,
          for then was it better with me than now." Satan's design is one thing
          in them, and God's design another: and though Satan row with the
          stream, a touch from the hand of God on the sinner's heart will carry
          his purpose.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing, that none can better their case by running away from
          the Lord: however hard their case may seem with him, they can never
          mend themselves at another hand. Hence said Samuel unto the people, 1
          Samuel 12:21, "Turn you not aside: for then should you go after vain
          things, which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain." And hence
          we find, that Peter said to Christ, John 6:68, "Lord to whom shall we
          go? you have the words of eternal life." The sinner under affliction
          is often like Hagar, "flying from the face of her mistress Sarai,
          Genesis 16:8: and that is the best course which the angel of the Lord
          directed Hagar unto, verse 9 namely, to return to her mistress, and
          submit herself under her hands. Jonah fled from the presence of the
          Lord, and shunning the journey to Nineveh, cast himself into a whale's
          belly. And those that take course in their affliction, will not speed
          better.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing your welcome unto, and certain reconciliation with an
          offended God through Christ, 2 Corinthians 5:19, 20, "God was in
          Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their
          trespasses unto them; and has committed unto us the word of
          reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God
          did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be you
          reconciled to God." God was never so angry with any of Adam's
          children, but he was ready to lay by his anger for the sake of Christ,
          apprehended by faith. The whole tenor of the gospel holds out this
          truth: and the law is suffered to lash the sinner, and afflictions are
          laid on him, to the very end that he may improve it for his
          reconciliation with God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. To bring the sinner to cast off religion, and to lay aside the
          duties of it. Hence says Christ of the stony ground hearers, Matthew
          13:21, "When tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, by
          and by they are offended." Thus we find a profane generation arguing
          the vanity of religion, and the duties of it, from their afflicted and
          low circumstances, Malachi 3:14, 15, "You have said, It is vain to
          serve God: and what profit is it, that we have kept his ordinance, and
          that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts? And now we
          call the proud happy: yes, they that work wickedness are set up; yes,
          they that tempt God are even delivered." No less a man than Asaph was
          near to have turned atheist on this very score, under a strong
          temptation, Psalm 73:12, 13, 14, "Behold," says he, "these are the
          ungodly, who, prosper in the world they increase in riches. Truly I
          have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence. For
          all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning."
          And so it has fared with many, who in their prosperity have kept up a
          form of religion, that their spirits have been quite soured as to
          religion in their adversity, and they have visibly given up with it;
          like the mixed multitude in the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Here is great need to fight the fight of faith,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing that prosperity is not tied to religion, nor yet to
          irreligion: but which of the ways soever one takes, affliction will
          meet him in the world, Ecclesiastes 9:2, "All things come alike to
          all; there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked," etc. If
          men take up religion for worldly prosperity, no wonder they be baulked
          of their expectation, and lay it aside again upon the disappointment.
          But their laying it aside will not secure them from affliction.
          Therefore men should look so to religion itself, as to be wedded to it
          for its instrinict value. But in the way of religion men may find a
          good conscience under affliction, while they find an ill conscience in
          the way of casting it off.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing that the great advantage of religion is to be reaped
          after the time of trial in this life is over. Hence says our Lord,
          Revelation 2:10, "Be you faithful unto death, and I will give you a
          crown of life." Chapter 3:21, "To him that overcomes will I grant to
          sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down
          with my Father in his throne." Now is our seed-time; and the sowing
          must be in tears, where the reaping time of joy is to follow. The
          harvest of glory in Heaven comes most full after a wet seed-time.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing that there is a notable advantage in religion for
          bearing of afflictions. Hence says the apostle, 2 Corinthians 1:12,
          "Our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in
          simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the
          grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more
          abundantly to you-wards." There are promises in the covenant, which
          applied by faith, are full of comfort to the afflicted. The Lord's
          word is full of light as to the nature, uses, and ends of them; so
          that the Bible is the best company for those in affliction. This well
          is deep and faith must draw.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, Believing that the promises with respect to affliction, both as
          to the blessed issue of them in another world, and as to support under
          them in this world, shall be made out to you. Thus Asaph in his
          affliction fastened his feet, Psalm 73:24, "You shall guide me with
          your counsel," says he, "and afterward receive me to glory." It is the
          faith of the upper Canaan, and of provision in the wilderness-world,
          that fits for the wilderness-life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. To provoke the sinner against God, to cause him to murmur against
          him, quarrel with him, and arraign and condemn in his heart, at least,
          the conduct of holy providence in the ordering of his lot: 1
          Corinthians 10:10, "Neither murmur you, as some of them also murmured,
          and were destroyed of the destroyer." Proverbs 19:3, "The foolishness
          of man perverts his way: and his heart frets against the Lord." Hard
          affliction laid on a man in whom dwells a corrupt heart, is apt to
          raise the black band of impatience, complaining, fretting, murmuring,
          and practical blashemy against God; like a stick stirring up a muddy
          pool, or an ant's nest. It made even a Job and Jeremiah to curse the
          day of their birth. Job was much overcome with his affliction, when he
          expressed himself so indecently, chapter 30:21, "You are become cruel
          to me: with your strong hand you opposest yourself against me." Fight
          against this tendency of affliction in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, that God is a righteous God, and your Sovereign Lord,
          having all power over you. There may be mysteries of providence in his
          dealing with us, which we cannot account for: but there can be no
          unjust step in his procedure with us: Deuteronomy 32:4, "He is the
          rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of
          truth, and without iniquity, just and right is he." Therefore that
          conclusion must be stuck to by faith, Jeremiah 12:1, "Righteous are
          you, O Lord, when I plead with you." We are his own by creation, and
          have forfeited our mercies by sin: let faith view him in the throne of
          sovereignty, and silence us: Matthew 20:15, "Is it not lawful for me
          to do what I will with mine own?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing, that you are debtors to mercy for that it is not
          worse with you than it is; saying, with the church, Lamentations 3:22,
          "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his
          compassions fail not." However hard any one's affliction is in this
          world, it is certain they deserve worse, and God could lay on worse.
          Hence is that acknowledgment of Ezra's, chapter 9:13, "You our God
          have punished us less than our iniquities deserve;" and that, Psalm
          90:11, "Who knows the power of your anger? even according to your
          fear, so is your wrath." This will make one to give thanks for what is
          kept off, rather than murmur for what is laid on.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing, that there is certainly need for all you meet. with:
          1 Peter 1:6, "Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season [if
          need be] you are in heaviness through manifold temptations." A holy
          wise God lays no needless afflictions on any: Lamentations 3:33, "For
          he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men." Nay he
          gives all by weight and measure, and will not put in one grain beyond
          what the case requires. What though you cannot see it? you have yet
          ground to believe it from the word, and may see it in the glass of
          God's infinite wisdom, the contrivance of which your lot is,
          Deuteronomy 32:4. So that whatever he does to you, is not only well
          done, but best done in your circumstances, Ecclesiastes 3:14.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, Believing, that, through the grace of our Lord Jesus, all you
          meet with shall work for your good: Romans 8:28, "We know," says the
          apostle, "that all things work together for good, to them that love
          God, to them who are the called according to his purpose." God can
          carry on the good of a person, by that which he is apt to think is for
          his ruin; as was the case with Jacob, when he said unto his sons,
          Genesis 42:36, "Me have you bereaved of my children: Joseph is not,
          and Simeon is not, and you will take Benjamin away: all these things
          are against me." And though the good of them may be long before it
          appear, yet where it is believed and hoped for, it will come at
          length, James 5:7. Now this and all other promises is held forth to
          you in Christ to be believed, and applied to yourselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, To cause the sinner harden himself in sorrow. So we render
          that expression of Job's, chapter 6:10, "I would harden myself in
          sorrow;" But it is not the sense of that place. Affliction had this
          bad effect on good Jacob, Genesis 37:35. who, when all his sons, and
          all his daughters, rose up to comfort him concerning the loss of his
          son Joseph, "refused to be comforted; and said, For I will go down
          into the grave unto my son, mourning." It had also this bad effect on
          Asaph, Psalm 77:2, "In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord," says
          he; "my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be
          comforted." Under affliction the heart is apt to sink; and the case
          sometimes appears so hopeless, that the afflicted looks not after
          comfort, but staves it off when offered. They bid a solemn farewell as
          it were to joy and comfort, and draw the sable curtains of sorrow
          about themselves: they have no comfortable prospect, they look for
          none, and resolve to hold there. This is dangerous. Fight against it
          in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing the promise of a comfortable outgate at length, with
          application to your own case. This hardening one's self in sorrow,
          whatever be the probabilities it is founded on, is the proper fruit of
          unbelief, and casts discredit on the promises of God, Psalm 103:9, "He
          will not always chide; neither will he keep his anger forever."
          Lamentations 3:32, "But though he cause grief, yet will he have
          compassion according to the multitude of his mercies." It is faith's
          work to believe the accomplishment of them, though one cannot see how.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing the promise of a comfortable mixture in the affliction
          while it lasts. God has given a promise of moderating the trials of
          believers: Psalm 37:24, "Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast
          down; for the Lord upholds him with his hand." Isaiah 37:8, "In
          measure when it shoots forth, you will debate with it; he stays his
          rough wind in the day of the east wind." And they have had experience
          of the outmaking thereof, 2. Corinthians 4:8, 9, "We are troubled on
          every side, yet not distressed, (says the apostle); we are perplexed,
          but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not
          destroyed." God has given a promise of strengthening believers to bear
          their trials, Deuteronomy 33:27, "The eternal God is your refuge, and
          underneath are the everlasting arms. Isaiah 40:28, 29, 30, 31, "Have
          you not known? have you not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord,
          the Creator of the ends of the earth, faints not neither is weary?
          there is no searching of his understanding. He gives power to the
          faint; and to them that have no might, he increases strength. Even the
          youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall.
          But they that wait upon the Lord, shall renew their strength: they
          shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary,
          and they shall walk and not faint." The Psalmist experienced the
          accomplishment of this promise, Psalm 138:3, "In the day when I cried,
          you answered me, (says he): and strengthened me with strength in my
          soul." God has given a promise of cordials now and then to support
          them, sweet blinks now and then to refresh them: Hosea 2:14,
          "Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
          wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her." Micah 7:8, "Rejoice not
          against me, O my enemy: when I fall, I shall arise, when I sit in
          darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing, that your patient suffering of affliction is as
          acceptable to God through Christ, as your doing for God: 2 Timothy
          2:12, "It is a faithful saying, If we suffer, we shall also reign with
          him." God has several pieces of work that he puts into the hands of
          his people: some he calls to do great things, others to suffer great
          things, Hebrews 11. Whatever it is the Lord carves out to you, ply
          that; it is what God will accept at your hand through the Mediator.
          Suffering is as really service to God, as doing is.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus we have seen the evil tendency of afflictions in themselves, and
          how we are to fight against it by faith. But there are three special
          cases wherein that force of affliction is greater than ordinary, and
          requires a strong faith to stand the shock.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. When a stroke from the hand of the Lord comes upon a man in the way
          of his duty, which he is doing in obedience to the call and command of
          God. This is apt to make a stagger, especially when it is a duty
          others have an ill eye on: for by it God seems to give sentence
          against the man and his work. When people are going on in an ill way,
          it is no wonder Heaven works against them; but when the Lord meets a
          man as an enemy in the way of duty, that is a great trial, Psalm
          71:11. It is apt to make one leave duty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Here is great need to fight in faith,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, that that is no sign that the way you are in, being
          warranted by the word, is displeasing to God. It has been the trial of
          the Lord's people, when they have been called to the plainest duty,
          and have been upon signal pieces of service to God. We are to observe
          providences, but not to make a Bible of them; but bring them to the
          word, and that will open the mysteries of providence. Jonah seemed to
          be favored by providence when he set his face to go to Tarshish, Jon.
          1:3, yet he was wrong. Jacob had God's call to return to his own
          country, and a promise of the Lord's being with him, Genesis 31:3.
          Laban looked on it with an ill eye. But what a train of troubles met
          he with in his way thither? such as his meeting with Esau, his thigh
          put out of joint in wrestling with the angel, his domestic trials,
          etc. And you may read the trials Moses met with in his going down to
          Egypt, upon God's command to redeem the Israelites, Exodus 4:24, etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing, that God has holy designs in the matter, becoming his
          own infinite wisdom, which you may afterwards come to see, if you see
          them not in the time; though in the meantime he is pleased with your
          way. Hence said our Lord to Peter, John 13:7, "What I do you know not
          now; but you shall know hereafter." Sometimes he designs to correct
          for some mismanagement in the setting about the duty, as in Moses'
          case for not circumcising his son, Exodus 4:24, 25; sometimes to hide
          pride from men's eyes, as in the apostle's case, 2 Corinthians 12:7,
          and as in the case of the children of Israel their being foiled by the
          children of Benjamin, Judg. 20:18–26. And this he does always for the
          trial of his people, their faith, regard to duty, etc. So Satan may be
          permitted to act against them for their trial; and sure he will be the
          more eager, the more important the duty is, 1 Corinthians 16:9; 1
          Thessalonians 2:18.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing, that there is no safety in one's leaving the road of
          duty, meet with what they will in it. Hence says the wise man,
          Proverbs 10:9, "He who walks uprightly, walks surely: but he who
          perverts his ways shall be known." A rebuke in the way of duty is
          sweeter than a warm sunshine in the way of sin: "Moses esteemed the
          reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, Hebrews
          11:26. There is communion with God to be had in such providences, and
          they furnish men with useful experiences for their after life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. When the affliction is extraordinary, and unusual, so that it draws
          the eyes of beholders to notice it particularly. When people's
          afflictions are no more than what is very ordinary and usual, they are
          the more easily borne; but when God seems to point out one to others,
          by some unordinary stroke, how hard is that to bear, how hard to keep
          off concluding that God has a particular hatred against us? There is
          need to fight in faith here,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, that it has been often the lot of God's children, and
          particularly of his darling children whom he loved most to meet with
          such kind of trials as would seem to have imported a particular hatred
          of them. Hence says the apostle, Hebrews 10:33, "You were made a
          gazing stock, both by reproaches and afflictions." And again, 1
          Corinthians 4:9, "I think that God has set forth us the apostles last,
          as it were appointed to death. For we are made a spectacle unto the
          world, and to angels, and to men." This was the lot of Christ himself,
          Psalm 22:6, "I am a worm, and no man," says he; "a reproach of men,
          and despised of the people." How was Job's heart pierced with that
          question, Job 5:1, "Call now, if there be any that will answer you;
          and to which of the saints will you turn? It is very rare, I suppose,
          that any of God's children have something more than ordinary about
          them to the advantage, but they get something more than ordinary to
          try them. Of all the patriarchs there was not one that had more divine
          manifestations or so many as Jacob, nor so many and great afflictions
          neither. Of all the sons of Jacob, there was none so high raised and
          useful as Joseph, and none so afflicted. Heman was a man of a more
          than ordinary reach, 1 Kings 4:31, and so of afflictions, Psalm 88:15,
          "I am afflicted" says he "and ready to die, from my youth up: while I
          suffer your terrors, I am distracted." Moses was the meekest man in
          the earth, and never mere man had more ado with it; Job was the mirror
          of patience, and none suffered more.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing the illimited power of sovereignty, which requires
          absolute resignation: Matthew 20:15, "Is it not lawful for me to do
          what I will with mine own?" It is a silencing query, Romans 9:20, "Nay
          but, O man, who are you that replies against God? shall the thing
          formed say to him that formed it, Why have you made me thus?"
          Sovereignty takes one piece of clay, and sets it on a throne; another
          of the same, and sets it on a dunghill in rags and sores; reaches to
          some the ordinary meal of affliction, but makes another's mess five
          times as much. And who will set bounds to the disposals of
          sovereignty?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing, that these different aspects of providence upon men,
          are but for a time, for the time of trial: and they will soon be at an
          end: Job 21:23–26, "One dies in his full strength, being wholly at
          ease and quiet. His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are
          moistened with marrow. And another dies in the bitterness of his soul,
          and never eats with pleasure. They shall lie down alike in the dust,
          and the worms shall cover them." It is no great matter whether one be
          the king or the fool on the stage; for in a little they get behind the
          curtains, and each one appears as really he is. Ordinary and
          unordinary afflictions will shortly have an end; and they that bear
          their own part right, happy will they be.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. When the affliction is of long continuance. Some afflictions are
          like a summer-shower, heavy in their time, but soon over, and it grows
          fair again: but the most trying are the continuing afflictions, that
          are like a stormy winter, that blows hard day after day. Many times
          deliverance is looked for, but it comes not. Any promising signs that
          appear at any time do misgive: and the storm is renewed, and grows
          ever the longer the more hopeless. Here is a sore shock to abide,
          which requires to fight in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing that this is a part of the discipline of God's house,
          whereby he exercises his own children. Hence says the prophet,
          Jeremiah 8:20, "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are
          not saved." David complains, Psalm 69:3. of his being weary of his
          crying, of his throat's being dried; of his eyes failing while he
          waited for his God. The church was so long continued in affliction,
          that she forgot prosperity, Lamentations 3:17. Many of the Lord's
          people have been kept so long under the hatches, that they have hung
          up their harps on the willows, so as to have no more use for them; and
          yet have been delivered.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing that the longest and blackest night will have a
          morning; and that though the affliction continue long, it will not
          continue always. Hence says the Psalmist, Psalm 103:9, "The Lord will
          not always chide: neither will he keep his anger forever." If the
          question be, "Watchman, what of the night? watchman, what of the
          night?" Isaiah 21:11 the answer is, verse 12, "The morning comes, and
          also the night: if you will inquire, inquire you: return, come." The
          sky that has long lowered, may clear before night: the wound may be
          looked on as incurable, that yet will be fairly healed, Jeremiah
          15:18, 20. And if it should not be removed in time, yet the faith of a
          blessed eternity may keep up the heart, when "God shall wipe away all
          tears from the eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow,
          nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former
          things are passed away," Revelation 21:4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing that God knows the fittest season for removing the
          affliction, and not we. Hence said our Lord to his brethren, in
          another case, John 7:6, "My time is not yet come: but your time is
          always ready." He keeps times and seasons in his own hand, and at the
          fit time he will remove it, Habakkuk 2:3. but not before, if it is to
          be removed in mercy. Men's hearts must abide much hewing, and God may
          have much ado with an affliction that is not soon done. The affliction
          is too soon over, that is removed before the design of it be answered,
          Psalm 10:17. None blames the gardener, that he sows not his seed,
          before the ground be fit to receive it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Believing that the more we are resigned to the Lord as to the
          time and method of deliverance, the nearer we are to it, the fairer we
          lie for it. Hence says the Psalmist, Psalm 10:17, "Lord, you have
          heard the desire of the humble: you will prepare their heart, you will
          cause your ear to hear." Man's extremity is God's opportunity,
          Deuteronomy 32:36. Witness Abraham on the mount, the disciples at sea,
          the Israelites at the Red sea. Happy should they be, who leaving the
          deliverance on the Lord, should make it their main care to answer the
          calls of providence by the affliction while it is continued.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Fifthly, There is a fight of faith with this present evil world."
          Hence says the apostle, 1 John 5:4, 5, "Whatever is born of God,
          overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world,
          even our faith. Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes
          that Jesus is the Son of God?" This present evil world is a party
          opposite to God and Christ, and on the devil's side: insomuch that he
          who lives in friendship with it, lives at enmity with God, James 4:4.
          And therefore we mast either fight against it, or be ruined by it. And
          there are these two particulars in the world, that we must fight the
          fight of faith against: 1. The things, 2. The men of the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, The things of the world are dangerous enemies to our souls,
          because of the corruption of our hearts. Hence says the apostle, 1
          John 2:15, "Love not the word, neither the things that are in the
          world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in
          him." O the fearful havoc of souls that is made thereby! By thorn many
          saints have been cast down, wounded, and many sinners have been slain
          thereby. The things of the world set out three bands against us, whom
          we must either fight and overcome by faith, or be ruined by.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">1. The white band of the world's smiles.</p>
        <p align="justify">2. The black band of the world's frowns.</p>
        <p align="justify">3. The mixed band of the world's cares.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, The things of the world set out the white band of the world's
          smiles. And they are stained with the blood of many souls: Proverbs
          1:32, "For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
          prosperity of fools shall destroy them." The smiling world does with
          other men, as the panther is said to do with other beasts. He draws
          them after him with the sweet smell of his breath, hiding his head,
          and afterwards devours them. Thus was Demas ruined. The white band
          fights against souls with two kinds of weapons.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Profits of the world. Thus it set upon poor Judas with thirty
          pieces of silver, and so knocked him down, and slew him. It set on
          moses with the treasures of Egypt, and had done so to him, had he not
          had faith to resist it, Hebrews 11:26. The Psalmist observes the snare
          in these, and therefore gives the watchword, Psalm 62:10, "Trust not
          in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches Increase, set
          not your heart upon them." And many a man, who has stood his ground
          against the black band of the world's frowns, has been overcome with
          the white, like the man in the fable with the sun and the wind.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Pleasures of the world. There are three kinds of them; "the lust of
          the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life," 1 John
          2:16. These are the silken cords, with which souls are drawn to
          destruction; with which when once men come to be bound, they are like
          iron fetters; the breaking of which, if ever they be broken at all,
          will cost a flood of tears. Hence prays the penitent Psalmist, Psalm
          51:8, "Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which you have
          broken, may rejoice." With many they end in a judicial up-giving to
          vile affections, Romans 1:26.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">These weapons are wielded two ways.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) In expectation. It is the natural desire of all men, "Who will
          show us any good?" Psalm 4:6. The world steps in and makes such an
          offer, as Satan did to Christ; who when he had "taken him into an
          exceeding high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world,
          and the glory of them, said unto him, All these things will I give
          you, if you will fall down and worship me," Matthew 4:8, 9. And when
          once the hope and expectation of its profits and pleasures is greedily
          embraced by an inordinate affection, the soul is set on fire
          therewith, and the poor creature runs to its own ruin on its own feet,
          Proverbs 7:22, 23, And so it fares with many in this case; as with the
          mouse, who, watching for the gaping oyster, thrusts in her head
          presently when the shell opens; which being immediately closed again,
          she is crushed. Hence says the apostle, 1 Timothy 6:9, "They that will
          be rich, fail into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and
          hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) In fruition or enjoyment, Luke 18:24, "And when Jesus saw that he
          was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches
          enter into the kingdom of God?" Such is the corruption of the heart in
          man, that it is ten to one if the smiling world draw sot his heart
          away from God. Men are apt to love the world inordinately, even when
          it gives them gall to drink: how hard must it be not to be overcome
          with it, when it courts men, and lays itself in their bosom!
          Deuteronomy 33:15, "But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxed
          fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he
          forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his
          salvation."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You must fight against the smiling world by faith if ever you would
          have the smiles of the Lord's countenance,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing the danger that is in the world's smiles, to your
          immortal souls. The danger is in the sours being thereby drawn to sin
          against God, and so in end to be pierced with sorrows. Agur saw this,
          and believed it; and therefore prays thus, Proverbs 30:8, 9, "Give me
          neither poverty, nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me; lest
          I be full, and deny you, and say, Who is the Lord?"—The smiling world
          is apt to betray men into pride, and a high conceit of themselves,
          forgetting God, contempt of God's laws, giving up themselves to the
          swing of their corrupt lusts and affections, &amp;c., and so to work
          the ruin of the soul, Ecclesiastes 5:13. Believe this on the testimony
          of God and so shall you we watch against it,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing the vanity, emptiness, and insufficiency, that is in
          the world, and all the smiles thereof: Psalm 119:96, "I have seen an
          end of all perfection, (says the Psalmist;) but your commandment is
          exceeding broad." Ecclesiastes 1:2, "Vanity of vanities, says the
          preacher, vanity of vanities, all is vanity." What do they avail to a
          man's real worth? what can they contribute to one's eternal happiness?
          They are uncertain, and may quickly leave us, and will certainly leave
          us at length; we must go as we came, naked, Proverbs 23:5. They are
          insufficient, they cannot give ease to the heart of man; one dead fly
          may spoil all the pot of ointment, as in Haman and Ahab's case. They
          cannot satisfy the soul; witness the disappointment which the rich man
          met with, spoke of Luke 12:16, etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing the transcendent profit and pleasure, that is to be
          had in the favor of God, the smiles of his countenance, communion and
          fellowship with him through Jesus Christ. This believe; and believe,
          that you may have it, yes, that you shall have it, seeking it through
          Christ: and you shall overcome the smiling world. Hence says the
          Psalmist, Psalm 4:6, 7, "Lord, lift you up the light of your
          countenance upon us. You have put gladness in my heart, more than in
          the time that their corn and wine increased." Being thus by faith
          lifted up in your affections to Heaven, the earth and all that is in
          it, will appear very little in your eyes, Matthew 13:45, 46; Philip.
          3:8. It is unbelief of, and blindness to the things of a better world,
          that makes the present evil world so bulky with men.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, Believing the sufficiency of his grace to carry you above them:
          2 Corinthians 12:9, "And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for
          you; for my strength is made perfect in weakness." There is strength
          in the Mediator, for men's overcoming the world: believe the promise
          with application to yourselves, and you shall be more than conquerors.
          The promise brings salvation with it; and the faith of it loosed
          Zacchaeus' heart from the world, Luke 19:8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, The things of the world set out the black band of the
          world's frowns. The world often brings up a train of crosses against
          men, to drive them away from God. Hence we read of the apostles
          "confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue
          in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the
          kingdom of God," Acts 14:22. Men must lay their accounts with their
          ilk days cross: and sometimes all goes wrong together with them; their
          sun goes down at noon-day, as in Job's case. Crosses in worldly things
          do often much mischief to the soul; they will irritate their
          corruptions, discompose them for duty to God, and lead them aside into
          manifold temptations, Proverbs 30:9.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Some have a fighting life with the world all their days: but, alas! it
          is not the fight of faith with it, but a sinful faithless fighting
          with it, that carries on the ruin of their souls. You will know this
          faithless fight with it by these two things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. All their fight is to get something of the world, not to be kept
          from the spiritual evil of the world. The world does not prosper with
          them, as it does with some others: and all their concern is to make a
          shift for throughbearing, which swallows up all other concerns with
          them. So they are such sons of earth, as that they live as if the
          curse of the serpent were lying on them, all their days to go on their
          belly, and lick the dust. The world flies from them; and yet they
          court it above all things. God crosses them in it, to bring their
          hearts off it; but over the belly of all the rebukes of providence, it
          is their great pursuit, Jeremiah 5:3, 4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Their fight they have with the world, takes away from them all
          favor of the Word of God, and of religion. A sad instance of this you
          have, Exodus 6:9, where, when Moses had spoken to the children of
          Israel all the promises commanded him of God, mentioned in the
          preceding verses, it is said, "But they hearkened not unto moses, for
          anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage." The tight of faith with the
          world makes the gospel savory to men: but this carnal fight with it
          makes it sapless and tasteless; it rankles their spirits with respect
          to religion, that many such are not far from thinking that religion is
          for the wealthier sort; but that as for them, they have another thing
          ado. And thus the frowning world ruins soul and body to them; at once
          ruins them for time and eternity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I would advise you to another sort of fighting with the frowning
          world. Fight in faith against it,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing that the ordering of your lot is in the hand of a holy
          wise God, who knows best what lot is for you, Job 1:21, whether
          prosperous or cross. The faith of this would make you embrace the
          world's frowns, and welcome crosses in the world, as well as
          prosperity, as what God sees meet for you; as did Job, chapter 1:21,
          who said, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I
          return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be
          the name of the Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing that the world's frowns, and smiles too, are but empty
          and passing shows, which will be soon buried in everlasting
          forgetfulness. As the world's smiles appear more pleasant than indeed
          they are, so its frowns appear more terrible to the carnal heart, than
          they are really: Ecclesiastes 1:2, "Vanity of vanities, says the
          preacher, vanity of vanities, all is vanity." The one and the other
          are like foam on the water, appearing big, but soon pass away. Being
          seen by the eye of sense, O how weighty are they! But look to them
          with an eye of faith, and you will see they are all but empty noise,
          which will quickly be laid, 2 Corinthians 4:17. The longest term of
          their continuance is but a few years at most. When one comes to the
          grave, the rich and poor are alike there; the black band and the white
          band are both disbanded there.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing that you have greater things to be taken up about,
          than either the world's smiles or frowns. Hence says the Psalmist,
          Psalm 4:6, 7, "Lord, lift you up the light of your countenance upon
          us. You have put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that
          their corn and their wine increased." The one cannot make you happy,
          nor the other miserable. But the favor of God and his wrath are
          matters of weight; let it be your care to obtain the one, and escape
          the other. These things are eternal, the other but temporal; O slight
          not then the substance, with your concern for the shadow: Matthew
          16:26, "For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
          and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his
          soul?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, Believing that you are in yourselves unworthy of the least
          smile of common providence. Hence says Jacob, Genesis 32:10, "I am not
          worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which
          you have showed unto your servant; for with my staff I passed over
          this Jordan, and now I am become two bands." And says the church,
          Lamentations 3:22, "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not
          consumed, because his compassions fail not." O why do crosses in the
          world go so deep with men, but because of the want of due humiliation?
          and whence is that want, but from unbelief? The humble soul fighting
          with the world will surely be victorious, because however it frowns on
          him, he takes it kindly out of the hand of the Lord, as not worthy of
          better.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5thly, Believing that your souls are in hazard by the frowning world,
          as well as the souls of others by the fawning world. Hence is that
          prayer of Agur's, Proverbs 30:8, 9, "Give me neither poverty, nor
          riches, feed me with food convenient for me.—lest I be poor, and
          steal, and take the name of my God in vain." The devil holds some fast
          in the iron chains of worldly adversity, as well as he does others in
          the golden chains of prosperity. Some ignorantly think, that because
          they are poor in the world, and their lot very hard they will surely
          be well in another world. O deceive not yourselves. As God has no
          regard to men's riches in saving them, he has as little regard to
          their poverty: but be they poor or rich, if they be not in Christ, new
          creatures, really godly, they will be ruined forever, John 3:3; Exodus
          23:3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6thly, Believing the great promise of the gospel with application to
          yourselves, Hebrews 8:10, "This is the covenant that I will make with
          the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will be to them
          a God, and they shall be to me a people, Hosea 2:19, "And I will
          betroth you unto me forever, yes, I will betroth you unto me in
          righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and in
          mercies." Your crosses in the world may well be taken by you for an
          alarm, saying, Depart, here is not your rest. God is setting fire to
          the nests you would build to yourselves among the things of the world;
          and withal holding out to you the great promise of the gospel. O
          embrace it, and trust him in it, Zephaniah 3:12. And thus shall you
          defeat the frowning world effectually. Believing God to be your God in
          Christ, you will be very easy whether the world smile or frown,
          Habakkuk 3:17.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Believing, that, through the grace of Christ Jesus, even the
          frowns of the world shall be turned to your good: Romans 8:28, "We
          know," says the apostle, "that all things work together for good, to
          them that love God, to them who are the called according to his
          purpose." How often has honey been gotten out of the carcas of the
          lion, and much good found to grow within a thorn-hedge of afflictions?
          The cross has brought forth much good fruit in them that have been
          exercised thereby: and God is kind to you indeed, if you take it so,
          in that he makes the world so strange to you, that you may the more
          seek after acquaintance with him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thirdly, The things of the world set out the mixed band of the world's
          cares. There is none will be free of attacks from these: even a crown
          is lined with cares. Yes, we must needs care; our daily bread will not
          drop down into our mouths, nor will our necessary business be managed
          without thought. But men are in danger by lawful things, and not by
          unlawful only. And the cares of the world are often ruining unto the
          soul. They are apt to put the man on a rack, to stretch out one's mind
          as on tent-pins, degenerating into a faithless anxiety, Matthew 6:25,
          Take no thought; in the Greek it is, Be not racked in your soul; to
          trouble one so as to unfit him for his duty to God, Luke 10:41; to
          swallow up all other concerns, and to render the Lord's word, the food
          of the soul, quite unprofitable, Matthew 13:22. Fight in faith against
          them,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing that the success of your affairs depends on the
          blessing of God on your endeavors, not on your anxious care about
          them; Psalm 127:1, "Except the Lord build the house, they labor in
          vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman wakes
          but in vain." The vanity and useless-ness of our anxiety may be very
          plainly read in many experiments; Matthew 6:27, "Which of you by
          taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?" In Providence's
          management of the world, how often is it seen that the race is not to
          the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the
          wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of
          skill, but time and chance happen to them all, Ecclesiastes 9:11; and
          that by strength no man shall prevail? How often does some unforeseen
          event render a hopeful and promising project vain? and, on the other
          hand, set right again what seemed to be quite marred?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing that the best way to secure what is truly necessary
          and fit for you in this world, it is to be first and mainly taken up
          about the things of another life. Hence says our Lord, Matthew 6:33,
          "Seek you first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all
          these things shall be added unto you." They that are careful how to
          please God, God will see to them that they be provided, Psalm 34:10.
          They whose main care is for the eternal welfare of their souls, may
          expect, that, in the use of means, the temporal welfare of their
          bodies shall be seen to by Heaven. This is the shortest and surest way
          to prosper, Psalm 1:3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Trusting in t the Lord with all your concerns which require your
          care, depending on him as the sovereign manager, and as a sure and
          safe manager for you. Hence is that exhortation, Psalm 37:3, "Trust in
          the Lord, and do good; so shall you dwell in the land, and truly you
          shall be fed." And you should trust in him both as to your own conduct
          and success, both for direction and prospering: Proverbs 3:5, 6,
          "Trust in the Lord with all your heart; and lean not unto your own
          understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct
          your paths." This implies three things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Laying your burden of care over on the Lord himself, believing
          that he will care for you, 1 Peter 5:7. Many an unbelieving lift we
          take of our own burden, and then we complain that we are not able to
          go under it: but Jesus Christ is appointed to be the great
          burden-bearer for poor sinners, and they are called to casttheir
          burdens on him, Psalm 55:22, and 37:5. If they will needs take their
          burdens, and keep them on their own shoulders, who can help it? But
          faith's work is to trust him with all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Believing, that he will do the best: Psalm 85:12, "The Lord shall
          give that which is good;" 34:10, "They that seek the Lord, shall not
          want any good thing." He knows himself what is best for us, we know it
          not: and we owe to him a faith so far implicit, as to believe whatever
          God does is best done; and whatever way he leads us, that it is best
          for us to follow, as did Abraham, Hebrews 11:8. It is the property of
          faith, thus to resign all to the Lord, trusting, that whatever is
          truly best for us, he will bring it about.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Staying yourself upon the word of the promise, Genesis 32:12, "I
          will surely do you good." Thus faith is to be an anchor of the soul in
          doubtful events. While anxious care leaves a person nothing to fix on,
          but causes him to waver like meteors ill the air; faith fixes on the
          promise of God, and renders the soul easy, come what will, Luke 12:29;
          1 Samuel 1:18.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, The men of the world are dangerous enemies also. There is an old
          enmity, which will not cease to work in them, Genesis 3:15. They are
          agents for the devil, factors for Hell, soldiers in pay to fight
          Satan's battles. No man will get to Heaven without a struggle with
          them; for they are opposite parties to all that really mind to be
          there. We find David very concerned to be delivered from them, Psalm
          17:13, 14, "Deliver my soul," says he, "from the wicked, which is your
          sword: from men which are your hand, O Lord, from men of the world,
          which have their portion in this life, and whose belly you fill with
          your hidden treasure." We likewise find the apostle Paul was so
          concerned, 2 Thessalonians 3:1, 2, "Finally, brethren," says he, "pray
          for us,—that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men."
          And our Lord forewarns his disciples of the world's hatred, John
          15:19, "If you were of the world," says he, "the world would love his
          own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out
          of the world, therefore the world hates you." Now, the men of the
          world manage the battle three ways, namely,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">(1.) with the tongue,</p>
        <p align="justify">(2.) with their feet,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) with their hands; and you must resist them still one way, namely,
          in faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The men of the world fight against the children of God with the
          tongue. They are the seed of the serpent; and therefore it is no
          wonder to see them spit their venom against such as go not their way.
          Hence we read of their "imagining mischiefs in their heart;" of their
          being "continually gathered together for war;" of their having
          "sharpened their tongues like a serpent:" of adder's poison being
          under their lips, Psalm 140:2, 3. Ishmael's mocking Isaac, Genesis
          21:9, is called persecution, Galatians 4:29. The trial of the
          believing Hebrews was the reproaches of ungodly men, Hebrews 10:32,
          33. See what a conspiracy was formed against Jeremiah, Jeremiah 18:18,
          "Come, said they, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah: for the
          law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor
          the word from the prophet: come, and let us smite him with the tongue,
          and let us not give heed to any of his words." See likewise what a
          secret consultation was formed against David, intimated in that prayer
          of his, Psalm 64:2, 3, "Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked;
          from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity: who whet their
          tongues like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even
          bitter words. God's people are to fight in faith in this case,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, that our God is able to blunt the edge of their
          swords, and the points of their arrows, and will do it so far as he
          sees meet. Hence is that promise, Job 5:21, "You shall be hidden from
          the scourge of the tongue." It is in the power of their hand to fling
          dirt upon the faces of God's children; but it is not in their power to
          cause it to stick, unless the Lord has said it for the greater trial
          of his people. God has the hearts of all men in his hands, and his
          people may confidently trust in him with the preserving of their
          reputation while they keep his way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing that all the dirt a mischievous world flings in the
          face of the Lord's people, the day will come that God will wipe it
          cleanly away from off them, and throw it back on the faces of them
          that cast it: Isaiah 51:8, "Hearken unto me, you that know
          righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law, fear you not the
          reproach of men, neither be you afraid of their revilings. For the
          moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them
          like wool: but my righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation
          from generation to generation." A lying tongue is but for a moment,
          and will rebound upon them that use such a hellish weapon. God has
          secured by promise the taking away of reproaches from off his people:
          Psalm 37:6, "And he shall bring forth your righteousness, as the
          light, and your judgment as the moon-day. 68:13, "Though you have lien
          among the pots, you shall be as the wings of a dove covered with
          silver, and her feathers with yellow gold." And so, in the faith of
          the promise, they may be very easy; and considering the use God may
          have for them for their good, may find soul refreshment in them. Hence
          says our Lord, Matthew 5:11, 12, "Blessed are you when men shall
          revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil
          against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for
          great is your reward in Heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets
          which were before you." And says the apostle, 2 Corinthians 12:10, "I
          take pleasure in reproaches, in persecutions, in distresses for
          Christ's sake."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The men of the world fight against the children of God with their
          feet; that is, by the example of their unholy lives. And much mischief
          they do by that means; hereby heaps are made to lie upon heaps. Hence
          says our Lord, Matthew 18:7, "Woe unto the world because of offences:
          for it must needs be that offences come: but woe to that man by whom
          the offence comes." It is hard to bear up against the course of the
          world lying in wickedness, to swim against that stream, considering
          the corruption of nature that is in the best. By the force of ill
          examples, many good men have been worsted, many that had not the root
          of the matter in them have been ruined: Matthew 24:13, "And because
          iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold." Fight against
          it in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, that the way of the world is the way to eternal ruin:
          Ephesians 2:2, "Wherein in time past you walked according to the
          course of this world, according to the prince of the power of air, the
          spirit that now works in the children of disobedience, Proverbs 13:20.
          "A companion of fools shall he destroyed." Are we not expressly told,
          that the multitude is going in the way to destruction? and that there
          be very few which are on the way to Heaven, Matthew 7. So that whoever
          mind for Heaven, must needs be nonconformists to the world, though
          thereby they become the world's wonder, like Joshua and his fellows.
          See 1 Peter 4:4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing, that, through the grace of the Lord Jesus, you shall
          be able to stand the shock of the corrupt example of the world. The
          eye of faith will discern the greater strength to be on the side of
          the wrestler against ill example. Hence said Elisha, in another case,
          to his servant, 2 Kings 6:16, "Fear not: for they that be with us, are
          more than they that be with them." And says the apostle, 1 John 4:4,
          "You are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because
          greater is he who is in you, than he who is in the world. If God be
          for us, who can be against us?" And for us he will be, if we trust him
          for our upbearing against it. He strengthens the spoiled against the
          strong: and be the force of the current never so great, they "can do
          all things through Christ which strengthens them," Philip. 4:13.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The men of the world fight against the children of God with their
          hands. There is never a wicked man in the world, but, by his natural
          make and frame, is a persecutor, Genesis 3:15. And none is fit to
          travel the road to Heaven, but they that are resolute to hold on their
          way, notwithstanding all the mischief a wicked world may do them.
          Hence says our Lord, Luke 14:26, "If any man come to me, and hate not
          his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and
          sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot he my disciple."
          Sometimes indeed God binds their hands, that they can do nothing with
          them against his people; but the mischievous persecuting nature never
          leaves the serpent's seed: and according as holy providence loosens
          the cord, so will they vent it. But resist in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, that it is little they can do, when they do their
          worst. Hence says our Lord, Luke 12:4, 5, "Be not afraid of them that
          kill the body, and after that, have no more that they can do, But I
          will forewarn you whom you shall fear; Fear him, which, after he has
          killed, has power to cast into Hell; yes I say unto you, fear him."
          The utmost reach of the most malicious and powerful persecutors, is
          but to the body, and things that concern time. And what is the body in
          comparison of the soul? time-things in comparison of those which are
          eternal? The faith of this carried up the martyrs, and armed them with
          a holy contempt of the impotent rage of their persecutors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing that they are ever under the check and control of a
          gracious God, engaged on the side of those that keep his way: Psalm
          76:10, "Surely the wrath of man shall praise you: the remainder of
          wrath shall you restrain." So that "he who walks uprightly, walks
          surely, Proverbs 10:9. How spitefully did Laban pursue Jacob, and
          Saul, David? but God put a check on them. Faith will discover in this
          case an almighty power for protection, and man to be but a worm, a
          fading thing which shall be like grass, Isaiah 51:12.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing the eternal rest, peace, and safety, that remains for
          the people of God: 2 Corinthians 4:17, 18, "Our light affliction,
          which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and
          eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are
          seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are
          seen, are temporal; but the things which are not seen, are eternal."
          It is but a short time we are to remain among the inhabitants of this
          world: the firm faith of that, with the faith of a better life, would
          make us very easy whether we have their, smiles or frowns. Our great
          concern is to fight our way to the better world, and resolutely to
          cleave to the Lord and the way of duty, over the belly both of the
          things and the men of the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Sixthly, There is a fight of faith with sin: Hebrews 12:4, "You have
          not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin." Of all things,
          there is nothing so opposite to God as sin is. The devil brought it
          into the world at first: and fearful havoc has it made therein, ever
          since its entrance; destroying the most part of Adam's children,
          wounding and doing mischief to all. And none can reach Heaven, but
          those who both fight and overcome it: and there is no successful
          fighting against it, but in faith. And that you may know what you have
          to fight against here,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. There is the Captain of this hellish band; that is the sin of our
          nature.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. There is a swarm of hellish lusts, as soldiers under the command of
          the sin of our nature.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, There is the captain of this hellish band; that is, the sin of
          our nature, called "the old man, the flesh, and sin," by the way of
          eminence, Romans 6:12. Sin is woven into our very natures: our nature
          has got a wrong set by Adam's fall. It is averse to good, and prone to
          evil; the bias of it lies quite the wrong way. This corrupt
          disposition is most active, and by its indwelling and activity fights
          against the soul. And it exerts itself against the soul especially
          these three ways.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. With its guilt, whereby it binds over the soul to the anger of God:
          the soul out of Christ to his revenging wrath, and even the believing
          soul to fatherly anger and displeasure, Galatians 3:10; Psalm 89:30,
          etc. The conscience feeling the band of sin on it is frightened and
          fired. The man sees himself, by reason of the corruption and pollution
          of his nature, an object of God's indignation, liable to the fearful
          strokes of his hand: even as a serpent, or any other poisonous
          creature, is liable to the stroke of a man's hand wherever be meets
          with it. Now, if ever you would break these bonds of guilt, fight
          against them in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing, that the Lord Jesus Christ has made a complete
          satisfaction to the justice of God, not only for actual sins, but even
          for the sin of our nature, Romans 6:6, "Knowing this, that our old man
          is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed." In
          respect of the sin of our nature we needed a Savior; and it was
          reckoned to him, to be cleared by him, as well as our actual
          transgressions. So that there is a sufficient remedy provided against
          the guilt of the sin of our nature, in Jesus Christ; so that no man
          needs to despond in that case as hopeless.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing, embracing, and trusting to the promise of remission
          of sin through the blood of Christ: Ephesians 1:7, "In him we have
          redemption through his blood; the forgiveness of sins, according to
          the riches of his grace." While the conscience is fired with guilt,
          faith must discern the promise of remission through Christ held forth
          in the gospel, like a rope to drowning men, Luke 24:47. And faith must
          embrace that promise, relying on it as the Lord's own promise; even as
          the drowning man ventures his life on the rope let down to him: and so
          shall that guilt be removed, and the conscience purged, Acts 13:38,
          39; Romans 3:24, 25. Your warrant is, Acts 13:38, "Be it known unto
          you, that through this man is preached unto the you forgiveness of
          sins."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing and applying to yourselves, and pleading the perfect
          holiness of Christ's birth and nature, as a public person, Colossians
          2:10, 11. Thus faith may triumph over the sin of one's nature, as to
          the guilt of it. While the law says, You have an unholy nature, and
          therefore must die the death: Yes, may the soul say, True, my nature
          is unholy in me; but Christ has satisfied for that guilt: and I have a
          holy nature in Christ, in him as a public person I was born holy, and
          retain the holiness of nature: and therefore I must not die, but live.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          OBJECTION But, alas! I dare not apply Christ's perfect holiness to
          myself, for I fear I have not right to it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">ANSWER. There is a twofold right.</p>
        <p align="justify">(1.) To a thing.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) In it. What right has a beggar to a penny which a man seriously
          holds out to him, saying, Have, there is a penny? He certainly has a
          right to that penny: he may lawfully take it out of that man's hand,
          and put in his pocket. Such a right every one of you has to Christ's
          righteousness, whereof this is a part. It is God's gift to you Romans
          5:17; John 6:32; held out to you to be received and applied by faith,
          Romans 1:17. If the beggar neglect or refuse it, though he had a right
          to it, he is justly deprived of it; and the man may put it in his own
          pocket again: but if he do take it, then he has a right to it; it is
          his own in possession, and cannot be taken from him again. Go then,
          and take the gift of righteousness out of Christ's hand, truly
          believing that you have a right to it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. With its motions and activity, Romans 7:5. It is an active
          principle, still tending to corrupt the soul more, fighting for the
          throne in the heart, and to cause the soul obey it, in fulfilling its
          lusts. And it must be fought against, to the breaking of its designs,
          Romans 6:12. It is a restless enemy, present at all times with a man,
          and especially active at some times, and particularly when one would
          do good: as it was with Paul, Romans 7:21. It is like a dunghill,
          still sending forth its filthy steams. And as it strives to strengthen
          itself, and to have the throne; so the Christian must fight against
          it, to bear it down, weaken, and get it mortified, Galatians 5:17 And
          you must for this cause fight in faith against it,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing that it is your most dangerous enemy: for so it is
          indeed. Never did Paul cry out to be delivered from the most bloody
          men that were set against him, as from indwelling sin. Romans 7:24, "O
          wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this
          death! It is a domestic enemy; an enemy within, more dangerous than
          all the enemies we have without, whether devils or the present evil
          world. Were it not for it, they would have a cold coal to blow at. But
          this furnishes them with notable advantages against us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing Christ to be the great ordinance of God for
          sanctification, and looking for your sanctification from him, on the
          credit of the promise held out in the gospel to you, Isaiah 45:22,
          "Look unto me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am
          God, and there is none else." Men have by nature's light been
          convinced of the necessity of sanctification; and some have thought
          one means proper to obtain it, and others another. Pagans have thought
          washings with water, sacrifices, the study of moral virtue, proper
          means for it. The Jews have added to these the observation of Moses'
          law, moral, ceremonial, and judicial. The Papists have thought a
          multitude of uninstituted ceremonies, fastings, whippings, etc. with
          the work itself in sacraments, all proper to sanctify the unholy.
          Legalists look on their own faithless endeavors after holiness, their
          watchings, etc. as proper means to obtain it. But all in vain.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But God has appointed his own Son to be the great ordinance for
          sanctification of the unholy, that the praise of our sanctification
          may be his own, as well as of our justification, 1 Corinthians 1:30,
          31. And he has lodged the fullness of the Spirit of holiness in him,
          to be partaken of in the way of believing, Acts 26:18. Look how the
          stung Israelites were cured in the wilderness by looking to the brazen
          serpent, believing that by that means they should be healed; so is an
          unholy sinner made holy, looking unto Jesus, trusting unto him for
          their sanctification, John 3:14, 15, or as the woman with the bloody
          issue. Hence the church, believing the promise of sanctification says,
          Micah 7:19, "He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us: he
          will subdue our iniquities: and you will cast all their sins into the
          depths of the sea."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Struggling against it in the faith of its having got its death's
          wounds, in the death and resurrection of Christ, as a public person,
          Rom, 6:6–9. No wonder they be still under the power of indwelling sin,
          who struggle against it without an eye to the death of Christ. But the
          soul by faith eying the death and resurrection of Christ, as the death
          of sin, will thereby be animated to act against it, like a giant
          refreshed with wine. The sins of all that are Christ's were imputed to
          him, and he by his sufferings expiated the guilt of them; and so he
          rose again free of that imputed guilt: so, in virtue of his death and
          resurrection, it loses its power over those that are his. And by faith
          of it, we become partakers of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, Believing that we shall get the victory over it through Jesus
          Christ, Romans 8:24, 25, "O wretched man that I am, (says Paul); who
          shall deliver me from the body of this death! I thank God, through
          Jesus Christ our Lord." They will fight well who are sure of the
          victory: and it is faith's work to believe the victory over sin,
          according to the promise, Romans 16:20, "The God of peace shall bruise
          Satan under your feet shortly." This was included in the first
          promise, Genesis 3:15, "The seed of the woman shall bruise the head of
          the serpent; which was proposed to our first parents to be by them
          believed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          With its sting still sticking close to the soul, Romans 7:17. It
          cleaves to us, like a stain that cannot be got fully washed off, while
          we are in this world. It is like the fretting leprosy in the walls of
          the house, not to be quite removed, until the house be pulled down.
          Notwithstanding all the struggles against it, it cannot be got to the
          door until death. Fight in faith against it,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Making no truce with it, but ever seeking its ruin, in the faith
          of Christ's excellency, and sin's hatefulness. The eye of faith fixing
          on the glory of Christ held forth in the gospel, has a transforming
          virtue. Hence says the apostle, 2 Corinthians 3:18, "We all with open
          face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into
          the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the
          Lord." And thus the heart is separated from sin, and set against it,
          while yet sin cleaves to the soul. Like the house of David and the
          house of Saul: no league between them, but the war continued until the
          house of Saul was quite sunk.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing, that the victory over it will be at length full and
          complete. Resist it in the faith of this. However it appears to be
          fixed with bands of iron and brass, yet the breaking thereof shall
          come suddenly, at an instant. As the walls of Jericho fell down on the
          seventh day, that were not moved while the Israelites compassed them
          the six days: so at death these walls will fall down, and be razed to
          the foundation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, There is a swarm of hellish lusts as soldiers under the
          command of the sin of our nature, Romans 6:12. These are the members
          of the old man, the streams flowing from the bitter fountain of the
          corruption of nature. These "war against the soul," 1 Peter 2:11. They
          seek to drive the soul from God, they push on men to satisfy them with
          forbidden fruit, and at length drown the soul in destruction and
          perdition, where they get the final victory, 1 Timothy 6:9. Against
          these also you must fight in faith, resist them, deny them, weaken,
          mortify, and crucify them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It is a difficult fight; but faith will help you out in it, as
          difficult as it is.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Their name may be legion, because they are many, Titus 3:3. All sin
          is radically in the corrupt nature of man: and there is never a
          temptation in the world, but there is in our nature some lust or other
          akin to it. Look through the world, and see all the abominations which
          any where appear there some are athiests, adulterers, etc. But the
          corrupt affections are in every body's heart naturally, Proverbs
          27:19, "As in water face answers to face; so the heart of man to man."
          But resist you, believing, that, through the grace of the Lord Jesus,
          the victory is to be got over them all, Psalm 118:12. There is neither
          strength nor multitude to be feared, where one by faith can oppose to
          both, the almighty power engaged on the side of the wrestlers against
          sin. Therefore says the apostle, 2 Timothy 2:1, "You therefore, my
          son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus." The blood of
          Christ is of infinite value, the Spirit of Christ of infinite
          efficacy, and faith must rely on these.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Their allies are all the powers of Hell; Satan, John 8:44, the
          world, Titus 2:12. All the snares and temptations that are in the
          world, are allied to some lust of the heart, which answers to them as
          tinder to fire. Bat you should resist, believing that greater is he
          who is in you, than he who is in that combat, 1 John 4:4. Oppose to
          these by faith the divine attributes, his power, wisdom, etc. the name
          of the Lord, which is a strong tower, etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Their lodging is not far off. It is the corrupt heart; thence it.
          is that they issue out against us, Mark 7:21. The heart of man is like
          a common inn, often so thronged with strangers, that there is no room
          for the entertainment of the master. But you must resist them
          notwithstanding, believing that your helper is as near you as those
          your enemies, 1 John 4:4. O it is a trying consideration to a gracious
          soul to think, that sin is woven into one's very nature, mixed with
          one's very constitution. But let faith discern the union between
          Christ and the soul; let the Christian believe that Christ dwells in
          him by his Spirit, in an indissoluble union; so may he see how to get
          clear of sin at length.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Their qualities are very bad. They are the brats of Babel, the
          offspring of Hell. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, They are greedy and insatiable lusts, Galatians 5:17. They are
          like the grave and the barren womb, that never say, It is enough.
          Where they are indulged, and yielded to, they fill the man's hands
          continually, seeking meat for them, to the provoking of God, Psalm
          78:18; James 4:3. And the more they are gratified and fed, the more
          they still crave: so that they "are like the troubled sea, when it
          cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt," Isaiah 57:20.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But you must resist them, if you mind for Heaven. You must deny their
          cravings, Titus 2:12. Make no provision for them, but starve them,
          however painful that may be, Romans 13:14, "But put you on the Lord
          Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the
          lusts thereof." This is the way to rid yourselves of their trouble:
          for men's lusts are like fire, that will die out if there be no fuel
          laid to them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Believing, that there is a fullness in Christ, enough to satisfy
          the soul, to give the heart a complete rest, that it shall need none
          of those things which nourish lusts, Matthew 13:45, 46. The one pearl
          discovered, stays the pursuit after the many. Hence faith contracts
          the desires of the soul into one, Psalm 27:4 which is the better part.
          O what is the cause men are so taken up to satisfy their lusts with
          their proper food, but the not believing of the fullness of Christ?
          Psalm 4:6, 7.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Embracing that fullness of Christ for, and instead of those
          things your hearts lust after. This is the import of selling all and
          buying the field, the one pearl; the soul taking Christ for these
          things, as in buying one takes the commodity bought instead of all he
          pays. The surest and shortest way to mortification of lusts is this
          way of believing, whereby the soul makes a happy exchange; for and
          instead of such lusts which cleave to him, embracing Christ, from him
          to draw that content and satisfaction he sought in the lust. Thus men
          deal with their hearts, as men with children, giving them one thing to
          get another from them, Romans 13:14 forfeited.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Believing, that you shall find that rest and satisfaction of
          heart in Christ, which you sought in your lusts. This is the import of
          the gospel-offer to all, Matthew 9:28, "Come unto me, all you that
          labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Isaiah 55:1,
          "Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he who has no
          money; come you, buy and eat, yes, come, buy wine and milk without
          money, and without price." And if you believe it not, you believe not
          the gospel aright: and always the less you believe it, the surer gripe
          will your heart hold of its lusts. But believe it firmly; and the more
          firmly you believe it, the more will you let go your gripes of your
          lusts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, They are hurtful lusts, 1 Timothy 6:9. And they extend their
          hurt to the tenderest part of the man, and to the not only wounding,
          but ruining of it, if the effect thereof be not stopped, destroying
          the soul. They hurt as water hurts, drowning the soul, as fire hurts,
          burning it up, Romans 1:27; as a canker hurts, eating it away, 2
          Timothy 2:17; as poison hurts, killing it, Psalm 140:3; Isaiah 59:5.
          They extend their hurt not only to the party in whose breast they are
          lodged, but to others, Ecclesiastes 9:18, "One sinner destroys much
          good" Sometimes one's lust involves many in guilt, and many in
          trouble; like a fire breaking out in a house, burning down the houses
          nearest it, and putting all into trouble and vexation. Thus Achan's
          last involved his whole family in guilt, and troubled all Israel.
          Adam's Inst ruined all the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You must therefore beware of them, and of the hurt by them. But
          deceive not yourselves, thinking you may entertain them, and not be
          hurt by them; that you can take the serpent in your bosom, and not be
          stung thereby, Proverbs 6:27, 28; Ecclesiastes 10:8. Resist the
          beginnings of your lusts, nip them in the bad. The longer they go on,
          they will be the harder to master, like a fire, or a water. If they
          have got up upon you, by all means endeavor to hinder their spreading;
          and speedily quench them, if they are spread. To do it to purpose, do
          it in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Putting yourself under the divine protection, by trusting in the
          shadow of the wings of a God in Christ. This is the work of faith.
          Hence says Boaz to Ruth, chapter 2:12, "The Lord recompense your work,
          and a full reward be given you of the Lord God of Israel, under whose
          wings you are come to trust." This has the promise of protection,
          Psalm, 91:1, etc. Faith sees the hazard the soul is in from hurtful
          lusts, and therefore disposes the soul to all due precaution, and to
          put the soul in the Lord's band for keeping, as the chickens get in
          under the wings of the hen, Psalm 31:5.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Applying the Redeemer's blood for purging away the guilt brought
          on the soul by these lusts, Romans 3:25; Hebrews 9:14. This is the
          only way to remove the hurt of them in that case. Thus the hurt of the
          guilt of them shall be cured, Mark 16:17, 18. The guilt of them casts
          the conscience into a fever; but faith applying the blood of Christ
          held out in the promise of the gospel, obtains pardon of the guilt,
          and cools the sick conscience, Isaiah 33:24. The access to this blood
          is free to all, Zechariah 13:1, "In that day there shall be a fountain
          opened to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for
          sin, and for impurity. 1 Corinthians 6:11, "And such were some of you:
          but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in
          the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Trusting to the fullness of the Spirit of sanctification in
          Christ, for breaking the power of these lusts, 1 Corinthians 1:30. We
          are not man enough for the least of these powers of Hell: therefore we
          are to trust to borrowed strength, 2 Timothy 2:1, "You therefore, my
          son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus." And going out
          against them in the name of the Lord, like David with his sling, we
          shall do valiantly: for he "strengthens the spoiled against the
          strong; so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress," Amos
          5:9. Thus many who have long been a prey to their lusts, like dead men
          lying in the grave to the worms, receiving the Spirit of life from
          Jesus Christ, have shook them off. "For," says the apostle, "the law
          of the Spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law
          of sin and death," Romans 8:2. And in them has been fulfilled in a
          spiritual sense, Isaiah 14:2, "The people shall take them, and bring
          them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the
          land of the Lord, for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them
          captives, whose captives they were, and they shall rule over their
          oppressors." And this in virtue of that, Psalm 68:18, "You have
          ascended on high, you have led captivity captive."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, They are restless lusts; "like the troubled sea, that cannot
          rest, Isaiah 57:20. They are like the midges in a summer day, ever in
          motion, working some annoyance to the soul. For temptations are thick
          in the world, and they never want something to stir them up, they are
          warring lusts, they are never at peace, they are ever in the field of
          battle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Warring among themselves, one against another, James 4:1. And the
          soul of man is what they are warring for, which shall possess it, and
          be governor of it. In this respect the poor sinner's heart is like a
          town situated in the confines of the territories of several ambitious
          princes, which is tossed and harassed among them, he fightng to have
          it, and he fighting to have it; one turning out another, etc. Thus
          pride and ambition draw the mind one way, covetousness draws him
          another way: contrary lusts at once fight in him. And there is no
          peace for the man, but by mortifying both the contending parties.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) They war against the soul, 1 Peter 2:11. All of them are enemies
          to it, and seek its ruin. Though they be contrary one to another, yet
          they conspire together for the destruction of the soul; like Herod and
          Pontius Pilate against Christ. The soul, in respect of its make and
          constitution, is most allied to Heaven, and therefore is the special
          object of their rage.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Wherefore you also, if you mind for Heaven, must lay your accounts
          with a continual warfare. You must never let down your watch, nor lay
          by your armor, but ever stand in a fighting posture, Ephesians 6:14,
          "Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth," etc. As
          there is no peace to be made between contrary lusts, so you must not
          side with any of the parties, nor be at peace with either, but
          maintain the fight against both. And fight in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [1.] Believing that this war will have a comfortable end at length,
          and you shall have a profound, perfect, lasting peace, 2 Timothy 4:7,
          8. Though the war with your lusts must be a lasting one; it is good
          news, that it will not be everlasting; but the peace obtained through
          the complete victory will be so. Take courage, O Christian, the last
          stroke will be given before long in this battle, which will be the
          decisive stroke. The day will come, when the enemies "you have seen
          today, you shall see them again no more forever, Exodus 14:13. In
          Heaven you will get eternal peace and rest, Revelation 21:5. There the
          sentinels are called from their posts, and the men of war lay by their
          swords, and put on their crowns.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [2.] Believing that your helper is ever as ready as your enemies,
          Psalm 16:8. It is a weighty consideration, that Satan walks about as a
          roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour, and our enemies within are
          restless. But faith wants not a solid relief to oppose unto this,
          looking to the promise, Psalm 121:4, "Behold, he who keeps Israel,
          shall neither slumber nor sleep, Isaiah 27:3, "I the Lord do keep it,
          I will water it every moment; lest any hurt it, I will keep it night
          and day." At whatever time the enemies attack us, we may have access
          to our help: and the faith of the promise will fetch it in as quickly
          as by a look, Isaiah 45:22, "Look unto me, and be you saved, all the
          ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [3.] Believing that his grace is ever sufficient for you, 2
          Corinthians 12:9. Though the war last long, the stock of strength
          cannot be wasted, in which you must fight; since it is an
          inexhaustible treasure in Christ Jesus, to which you can never come
          amiss, John 1:16. Indeed, if you fight in your own strength, you will
          soon find it wasted: but faith's work is to fetch in strength from
          Christ and it is sufficient for the continued warfare, Isaiah 40:31.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, They are deceitful lusts, Ephesians 4:22. We are apt to be
          beguiled by them, if we take not good heed. They deceive sinners, and
          then take them captive, Titus 3:3; and then slay them, Romans 7:11.
          They are the golden cup in Satan's hand, by which he ministers poison
          to the soul. They are deceitful: for,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) They always promise what they never perform, 2 Peter 2:19. Who is
          the man that is not disappointed in them looking for that content and
          satisfaction he never finds? How was Judas deceived that way?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) They often commend themselves to men under the mask of some
          harmless thing, or some real virtue, Colossians 2:18. Thus, like
          Satan, they transform themselves into an angel of light. So many call
          evil good, and good evil, etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) There is a hidden mischief in them, when they are most smiling.
          There is a hook always, which is covered with the bait, James 1:14,
          "Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lusts, and
          enticed." It is a metaphor taken from fishes caught by the bait, and
          drawn out of the water. But,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          You must have your eyes in your head, and not be ignorant of Satan's
          devices, Proverbs 22:3. Be not rash, but try before you trust.
          Forbidden fruit may be fair to look at, and the devil's ground may be
          very smooth; and the sinner see no hazard where death is at his elbow,
          Proverbs 14:12. Therefore fight as against a deceitful enemy,
          Ephesians 6:11. And fight in faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [1.] Believing the testimony of God concerning the heart, Jeremiah
          17:9, that it is "deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked,
          who can know it? and therefore keeping a watchful eye, a holy jealousy
          over it: Proverbs 28:14, "Happy is the man that fears always: but he
          who hardens his heart, shall fall into mischief." Faith is the soul's
          going out of itself to the Lord, and brings off the man from leaning
          to his own understanding, Proverbs 3:5, and trusting to his own heart,
          Proverbs 28:26. For these are the things that betray a man into the
          hands of deceitful lusts.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [2.] Trusting to the conduct of the Lord Jesus Christ, Proverbs 3:6.
          He is the Captain of salvation, the appointed leader of his people,
          eyes to them in the wilderness. And he will teach those who are
          willing to be taught, Psalm 25:9. And there is no way to get clear of
          the deceitful lusts, but by shutting our own eyes, and looking to the
          Lord for light to discern our way. For he is made wisdom for us, 1
          Corinthians 1:30, and by faith in him, "the way-faring men, though
          fools, shall not err in the way of holiness," Isaiah 35:8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, There is a fight with death. This is the last enemy you will
          have to grapple with: 1 Corinthians 15:26, "The last enemy that shall
          be destroyed, is death." There was never any who escaped this combat,
          but Enoch and Elijah. As for all others, the encounter with it is
          appointed of Heaven, Hebrews 9:27. And there is no freeing of any from
          this battle, Ecclesiastes 8:8. Many trouble not themselves to fight
          with temptation, or with sin, but live at peace with these their
          enemies: but, whether they will or not, they must feel the bitterness
          of death. If ever you would fight it so as to overcome, you must fight
          in faith. Here consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">1. How death may attack you; and,</p>
        <p align="justify">2. In what shapes it may do so.</p>
        <p align="justify">1st, How death may attack you. And that,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, With sorrow and heaviness, Psalm 116:3. Death is apt to let in
          a flood of sorrows upon poor sinners: so that those who have spent
          their days in mirth, find then all their mirth quite swallowed up in
          that flood; and they who have had a life of sorrows, feel then the
          flood of them swelling to the brim. And there are two sluices death
          opens to let in this flood.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The separation of the man from this world, and all things in it,
          Isaiah 38:11. It comes to carry the man off from this world; to
          separate between him and his nearest relations; to put an end to any
          portion of his under the sun, that he shall no more see the sun rise
          or set again, and have no more access to his own house, or bed, or
          board. This is apt to let in a flood of sorrow upon the man. And there
          is no way to hold out against it, but one of these two;
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, By turning it into the matter of joy: like those mentioned in Job
          3:22, "which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad when they can find the
          grave;" when the man is so wearied of the world, that his heart leaps
          for joy, when God's messenger, death, knocks at his door.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, By a Christian resignation to the will of the Lord, Luke 2:29,
          the man being ready calmly to deliver up unto the hands of God, all he
          has here.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now, if you would fight death's sorrows on this head, namely,
          separation from the world, either of these ways; you must do it in
          faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Believing, that, through the alone merits of Christ, you shall be
          admitted into a better world, set down in a better house, at a better
          table, and lie better, even in Abraham's bosom, 2 Timothy 4:7, 8.
          Nothing else will work the soul into that Christian resignation. The
          heart of man will never be truly content to give away this world's
          good things, while it has no comfortable prospect of better: and
          therefore Christian resignation at death, will be according to faith's
          view of better things in the other world, Hebrews 11:13.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Trusting the same Lord Jesus with the charge and care of those
          whom you are to leave and are concerned for, 1 Peter 5:7, "Casting all
          your care upon him, for he cares for you." With an eye to this, the
          Lord has made that promise, Jeremiah 49:11, "Leave your fatherless
          children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in
          me." Ungodly men can have no such comfort, in the abundance they have
          to leave theirs, as a godly man may have in this way of believing,
          Hebrews 11:22.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The separation of the soul from the body, Isaiah 38:13, 14. The
          soul and body are closely knit; but death comes to loose the silver
          cord that knits them together; like a whirlwind to separate them, and
          carry them far asunder. The soul has a sure prospect of a separate
          state, which it has no experience of; and the consideration thereof is
          apt to fill it with sorrow, on the account of its foreseen widowhood.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There is no making head against this, but in faith:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing the soul's union with Jesus Christ, and with God
          through him, Romans 8:38, 39. Thus the soul has full comfort against
          the separation that death makes. Though the man's spirit parts with
          his body, yet the Spirit of God still dwells in the soul. God would
          have his people believe this particularly: and for that cause he has
          appointed the sacraments, signifying and sealing their union with
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing and trusting for the blessed resurrection of the body
          at God's appointed time, Job 19:26. It stays the sorrow of friends at
          their parting, that they look to meet again in peace: and when the
          soul and body are parting, the stronger the faith of the joyful
          resurrection is, the less will the sorrow be on that head. And all
          that are Christ's have good ground for it: for our Lord has said, John
          11:25, "I am the resurrection, and the life: he who believes in me,
          though he were dead, yet shall he live."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, Death may attack you with fear and terror. Death is of all
          terrors the most terrible. Hence we read of being "brought to the king
          of terrors, Job. 18:14. And therefore the scripture expresses the
          greatest consternation by the terrors of death; as in the case of
          David, Psalm 55:4, "The terrors of death are fallen upon me." And says
          Job, chapter 24:17, "For the morning is to them even as the shadow of
          death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of
          death." Death will appal and damp the stoutest heart: it will fill
          them with fear, who have been a terror to others in the land of the
          living. But faith will bear out, where natural courage falls like a
          dyke of sand before a sweeping flood. Now, there are three sources of
          the terrors of death.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Guilt lying on the soul, 1 Corinthians 15:56, "The sting of death
          is sin." By the guilt of sin, the sinner is bound over to death; so
          that is the sting with which it pierces men. The native guilt of sin
          binds over the sinner to death in its full extent, even to revenging
          wrath: the moderated guilt of it binds over the sinner to unstung
          death. When death comes up, it takes the man prisoner as a guilty man;
          and so fills him with terror. Here must be a close fight of faith to
          stop this source of fear and terror.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Over the belly of all your doubts, fears, and felt unworthiness,
          stretching out the hand of faith, and laying it on the head of the
          great sacrifice Christ, and so transferring all your guilt on him,
          Romans 3:25, and 5:11. You must believe in, and trust on the obedience
          and death of Christ, for the removal of your guilt; believing, that,
          for the sake of a crucified Christ, all your sins shall be pardoned.
          And for the warrant of your so trusting, you must discern the pardon
          offered to you through Christ in the gospel, Acts 2:38, 39; and so,
          amidst all your doubts and fears, anchor your souls on the
          faithfulness of God in the promise. Thus you shall pull out death's
          sting, obtaining the removal of guilt by faith in his blood.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing and applying to yourselves Christ's full answering of
          the demands of the law, whereby the law is disarmed of its curse, and
          the bond of it as a covenant is loosed from off you, Galatians 2:20;
          Colossians 2:14. Death's strength lies in guilt: take away guilt off
          the soul, death is like Samson without his hair. The strength of guilt
          lies in the law as a covenant: remove the bond of the law from off the
          man, and the man's guilt is like the cords the Philistines bound
          Samson with, which became as flax burnt with fire, Judg. 16:14. Let
          faith apply to the soul Christ's obedience and death, and so his fully
          answering the demands of the law: and, then the law can have no more
          effect on you, than a subscribed bond fully paid and discharged,
          blotted and rent in pieces, can have on you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The unseen unknown world, therefore called the land of darkness,
          Job 10:21. One is apt to be seized with fear, when they are to be
          carried into a place which they do not know. Death comes to carry us
          to another world, which we never saw, nor can see until we be there,
          never to come back: and that makes it terrible. It is the world of
          spirits: the blessed spirits dwelling in the upper regions; the damned
          spirits in the lower. We are so unacquainted with the inhabitants of
          that world, that the sight of a spirit, good or bad, would be enough
          to frighten us while we are here: what wonder then that death be
          terrible, coming to carry us, where there are none but spirits? Here
          is great necessity of faith, to bear up against the fear rising from
          thence. We must then stay our hearts by faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Firmly believing the scripture accounts of the unseen world,
          Hebrews 11:1. Though we have never seen it, yet we have heard of it:
          though we never were there, yet the map of it has been laid before us
          in the Bible; and there we have it described both the upper and lower
          part of it. And in that map, drawn by inspired pens, not capable of
          erring, the lower part of that world is not more dreadful, than the
          upper part is pleasant and desirable, John 14:2; Revelation 21. The
          faith of Heaven is staying to the heart in some measure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Firmly believing the scripture account of the way to Heaven;
          that Christ is the way to it, John 14:6; and that by faith we walk in
          him to it, Colossians 2:6. If we believe not this, our hearts have
          nothing to stay themselves on, but are left at an utter uncertainty,
          in our encounter with death. Therefore labor to strengthen your faith
          of this, that it may not be yes and nay, but yes with you, 2
          Corinthians 1:19, 20; that "he who believes, shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, for your safe passage to the
          upper part of the unseen world, Psalm 73:24, and 31:5; committing your
          soul to him, rolling the weight of your through-bearing on him as the
          Captain of salvation appointed of God to bring many sons to glory.
          Take hold of him, by his word of promise, by the everlasting covenant,
          2 Samuel 23:5; and labor to gripe some particular promise for that
          end, as Isaiah 43:2, "When you pass through the waters, I will be with
          you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you: when you
          walk through the fire, you shall not be burnt; neither shall the flame
          kindle upon you." Hebrews 13:5, "I will never leave you, nor forsake
          you." Isaiah 35:9, 10, "No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast
          shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there: but the redeemed
          shall walk there. And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come
          to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall
          obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, Believing that your Lord Christ is Lord of the unseen world,
          and that the whole compass of it above and below is under his
          dominion, Revelation 1:18. It is in his hand that the disposing of
          souls to any part of that world is. Neither is he to fight with the
          prince of darkness, on that side, about any soul. That fight of his
          with Satan was in this world. When one comes there, the devil cannot
          touch him, unless given up to him as an executioner. And he has said
          it, that none that believe in him shall be damned, Mark 16:16. Believe
          it with application.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5thly, Believing, that as soon as your soul departs out of your body,
          God will receive it into his own hand, Psalm 31:5. compared with Luke
          23:46. So David believed, Psalm 23:4, "Yes, though I walk through the
          valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for you are with
          me, your rod and your staff they comfort me." It shall be conducted by
          angels into Abraham's bosom, Luke 16:22. Believe, that the same God
          who brought you out of the womb, safe into this world, when you were a
          naked helpless infant, and by his providence preserved you, will take
          the same care of you, when entering into the unseen world. This is the
          comfort of faith in death; agreeably to what the Psalmist says, Psalm
          22:9, 10, "But you are he who took me out of the womb; you did make me
          hope, when I was upon my mother's breasts. I was cast upon you from
          the womb: you are my God from my mother's belly."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, That your God will fit you both for the place and the company,
          however unfit you are for them now, Hebrews 12:23. He will do it in a
          moment, as appears from parity of reason from 1 Corinthians 15:51, 52,
          "Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall
          all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye," etc. Believe
          that he will fit you, not only for the sight or knowledge of the
          spirits there before you, but for communion with them. And you may
          confirm your faith of this, by the experience you have had
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) of his fitting you for communion with the inhabitants of this
          world, though you came into it an infant knowing nobody there, no not
          the mother that bare you; and
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) of his fitting you for communion with himself, though you were by
          nature dead in sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The judgment, Hebrews 9:27. The appearing before a tribunal is an
          awful thing. When a guilty creature is lying on a death-bed, drawing
          his last breath, and considers that in a little he is to be carried
          before his judge in another world, to be judged, and give account of
          his deeds done in the body, and to receive his sentence for eternity,
          in well or woe; no wonder fear and terror seize him. There is no
          making head against this but by faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Receiving and embracing the Lord Jesus Christ, with all his
          salvation offered to you in the gospel, John 1:12. So in Revelation
          22:17, the offer of Christ is made, after the warning given of
          Christ's coming to judgment: for this only is the way how a sinner may
          stand before him. While a sinner breathes in this world, he is in the
          way: and that is the time to agree with the adversary. Christ and all
          his salvation is offered; that is, pardon, peace, right to glory,
          sanctification etc. And it is the work of faith to receive them, held
          forth in the gospel-promise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          For this cause it is necessary to judge ourselves, and condemn
          ourselves; to call over all our past life, with the sin of our nature:
          and renouncing all confidence in ourselves, to fly to the horns of the
          altar, confiding in a crucified Christ, upon the ground of God's
          faithfulness in the promise of the gospel; John 3:16, "For God so
          loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever
          believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing, that the same Jesus who is offered, and whom you have
          embraced, in the gospel, is the judge whom you are to appear before,
          John 5:22, "For the Father judges no man; but has committed all
          judgment unto the Son." This is a fit means to abate the terror of the
          judgment-seat to a believer. For thus, by the eye of faith, the soul
          may see, that it is the very same person who is its head, husband,
          advocate, and the redeemer, who is its judge. And thus a full fountain
          of consolation is opened against the terrors of death, arising from
          the judgment.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, Believing, that you being in Christ, judgment will not proceed
          upon you according to the law of works, but according to the law of
          faith, that is, the covenant of grace, Revelation 20:12. The law of
          works adjudges every one that sins in the least to die, Genesis 2:17;
          Galatians 3:10; and according to it shall all unbelievers be judged;
          but no believer, Romans 6:14. The covenant of grace adjudges every
          soul united to Christ by faith, how many soever his sins have been, to
          live eternally, for the sake of Christ's obedience and death imputed
          to him, Romans 8:1; John 3:16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Believing, that the covert of Christ's blood is a perfect
          covert, within which not one drop of revenging wrath can fall here or
          hereafter, Isaiah 32:2; and that faith's plea will never be rejected,
          for it is established by the covenant between the Father and the Son,
          and God's faithfulness is impawned for it. Let the believer then,
          thinking on the tribunal, behold the rainbow about the throne,
          Revelation 4:3. compared with Isaiah 54:9. and be comforted against
          the terror of death from this quarter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thirdly, With despondency, Lamentations 3:18. This is the most fearful
          weapon with which death attacks a man; when it goes about to raise a
          man's hope in Christ, making his heart to sink within him as hopeless,
          filling him with a fearful expectation of eternal destruction, Job
          33:22. This may be the case of those that are strangers to Christ,
          whom death seizing after a lifetime spent in profanity and wickedness,
          their sins, especially their gross heaven-daring abominations staring
          them in the face while they are death's prisoners, are apt to fill
          them with despair of mercy, Job 18:14. It may also be the case of
          saints after a careless untender walk, Psalm 69:2, 77:7; Matthew 25:5.
          Here is need of faith in a special manner,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing with application the infinite efficacy of the blood and
          Spirit of Christ Jesus, Hebrews 7:25. The soul would behold that blood
          as the blood of the Son of God, 1 John 1:7, and therefore of infinite
          efficacy to do away the greatest guilt; as the sea, to quench a house
          on fire, as well as a candle: his Spirit is of infinite efficacy, as
          able to wipe away the deepest stains of sins, as others, 1 Corinthians
          6:11: a water-flood, sweeping away whole dunghills, as well as
          mole-hills.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing that you are still within the compass of the gospel
          offer, Isaiah 55:1; Revelation 22:17. Yes, it is directed to you in
          particular, as Jeremiah 3:1, "You have played the harlot with many
          lovers; yet return again to me, says the Lord." Isaiah 1:18, "Come now
          and let us reason together, says the Lord: though your sins be as
          scarlet, they shall as white as snow; though they be red like crimson,
          they shall be as wool." God has made no exception of sinners of any
          size, who will come in; though ordinarily a profane graceless life has
          a disagreeable end; they that live gracelessly, for the most part
          dying hardened, sometimes in sullen despondency: yet the case of the
          thief on the cross, shows a possibility of its being otherwise.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Believing, griping, and hanging by the promise of the gospel,
          over the belly of all objections. Acts 16:21. Though you are in a
          boisterous sea, where one wave comes after another to sweep you away;
          yet quit not your gripe, Hebrews 10:39; but hope against hope, as
          Abraham did; for it is pleasing to God, Psalm 147:11, and will have a
          good issue, as in the woman of Canaan.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Consider in what shapes death may attack us. There is one way of
          coming into the world, but there are many ways of going out of it.
          Which of them may be ours, we know not; and therefore it concerns us
          to be ready to encounter death, and fight the last battle
          successfully, in whatever shape death come upon us. I will take notice
          of these four.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. A violent death, by the hands of men. This the heaviest of deaths,
          when it is an ill cause; as in the case of malefactors, by the hand of
          public justice; and of men falling sacrifices to their own and others
          rage in their private godless quarrels. All I say to that, is, to
          advise you to live by faith, that you may be preserved from such a
          death, Proverbs 28:17; Matthew 26:52. But even in a good cause men may
          be brought to it, whether more solemnly by process of law, or
          summarily by the hands of bloody men. Death in that shape must be
          fought,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing that that was the kind of death which Christ died, and
          so has sanctified it to his own, that they may comfortably venture on
          it for his sake and cause. And the saints of the highest class have
          died so, dying martyrs, in numberless multitudes. Our Lord will have
          all his to lay their accounts with it, Luke 14:26, "If any man come to
          me," says he, "and hate not—his own life, he cannot be my disciple;"
          though he does not call them all to it. But many who have been called
          to it have rejoiced in it as their honor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing that great truth with application, Matthew 16:25.
          "Whoever shall save his life, shall loose it: and whoever will lose
          his life for my sake shall find it." When one's life comes in
          competition with the honor of Christ and the cause of truth, and they
          will, for saving themselves, make shipwreck of faith and a good
          conscience; they lose their souls, to save their bodies for a little
          time: whereas they to whom Christ's honor is more dear than their own
          lives, their souls shall be saved eternally, and eternal glory will
          more than make make up all their losses.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. A painful death. Death in any shape can hardly want pain; but death
          is certainly more painful to some than to others. O what piercing
          pains, gripes, and torments, do some suffer at their death! What
          struggles and wrestlings have some with death, before their souls
          leave their bodies! What measure of these pains is allotted to us we
          do not know; but every one will at length feel his own part of them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our business is to bear them Christianly and patiently; and that I we
          will never do to purpose, but by faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Cleaving to Christ in them by faith, Job 13:15, and believing,
          that through his grace they shall have a comfortable end in due time,
          2 Timothy 4:6-8. Faith's view of the eternal rest in Heaven, is the
          best cordial in the pain of death. When the soul believes, that the
          last pain is coming up, the last sob; after which sorrow and sighing
          shall forever fly away; that will make the man stand the shock of the
          sharpest pains Christianly and patiently.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing that the body of death and sin, which you have had
          many a battle with in your life, is by that means to be put to the
          door. Death came in by sin, and sin must go out by death. Every pain
          and gripe loosens a pin of the tabernacle; and according as death
          makes its progress in the believer's body, sin is the nearer to a
          removal outof his soul. And when death has perfected its work on the
          body, the soul shall then be perfected, Hebrews 12:23. A Christian
          will abide sore thrusts patiently, in the faith of this their
          thrusting out his worst enemy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, By the eye of faith discerning death unstung to you, by the
          death of Christ. Our Lord Christ has said it, and done it, Hosea
          13:14, "I will ransom you from the power of the grave: I will redeem
          them from death: O death I will be your plagues; O grave, I will be
          your destruction; repentance shall be bid from mine eyes:" and
          therefore a dying saint should comfort himself in it, and believing
          sing, as in 1 Corinthians 15:55–57, "O death, where is your sting? O
          grave where is your victory? The sting of death is sin; and the
          strength, of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which gives us the
          victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." That whereby the believer's
          dying body is pained, is not death's sting: he may therefore bear it
          the better. Death's sting stings the soul and conscience, and leaves
          the venom of the curse there, which will scorch the man eternally.
          These pains are but as a bee-sting in comparison of that.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. A longsome or lingering death. Death makes quick harvest with some,
          but with others death's work is spun out to a great length; whereby
          they have many deaths in one, are often looking for the last stroke,
          but it is long a coming. This is a great trial, and we know not but it
          may be ours. Therefore we should be prepared for it, and lay up timely
          for it. We will never manage it well, but by faith,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Believing always that it is coming; but at what hour, we know
          not. The faith of this will make us keep up our watch, Matthew 24:42.
          They may watch at first, who may let down their watch when they find
          the Bridegroom delays his coming; and so they may be surprised, as the
          foolish virgins when their lamps were out. But the faith of this will
          put us on Job's resolution, chapter 14:14, "All the days of my
          appointed time will I wait until my change come."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Believing that therein the Lord has you upon your trials, 1
          Peter 1:6, 7. He is in that case taking a trial of your faith, love,
          patience, and Christian fortitude. And if God opens to any of us a
          scene of trial of more variety and greater length than that of others,
          it is our business to behave well in the trial laid to our hand.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, By the eye of faith discerning the eternal weight of glory, on
          the other side of the trial: and if we weigh the one by the other, the
          most longsome struggle with death will appear both light and
          momentary, 2 Corinthians 4:17, 18, "For our light affliction, which is
          but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight
          of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the
          things which are not seen: for the things which are seen, are
          temporal; but the things which are not seen, are eternal."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, A sudden death. Death sometimes makes a wide step, so that
          it is upon a man before he can well perceive it coming. It is what may
          be our lot; for it is common to good and bad. Good Eli died so, as
          well as Ananias and Sapphira, who died with a lie in their mouth. And
          therefore it concerns us to be prepared for it; which we can never be
          but by believing. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Securing ourselves within the true ark, timely, by believing in
          the Lord Jesus Christ, accepting him in the offer of the gospel
          covenant, John 1:12. Then come death when and how it will, we are
          habitually ready for it: and it shall not be able to loose the
          marriage-knot cast by faith between Christ and our souls, Romans 8:38.
          etc. If in that case, it come suddenly on us, it shall but waft us
          over more speedily into Immanuel's land.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Resolutely renewing the actings of faith on Christ, at death's
          sudden approach, Isaiah 45:22. What a man has done before, he may the
          more easily do again on a signal given: and a believer may through
          grace renew his acting of faith, upon death's short warning. If death
          be sudden, the act of faith, may be as sudden, as reaching in a moment
          from earth to the highest heavens: and therefore compared to a look.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          And thus I have gone through the Christian warfare, even to the last
          battle. May the Lord thus teach our hands to war, and our fingers to
          fight.
