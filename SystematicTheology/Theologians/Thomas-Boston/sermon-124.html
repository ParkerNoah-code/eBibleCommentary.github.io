    Revelation 1:17, 18, "Fear not: I am he who lives, and was dead; and behold, 
    I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of Hell and of death."</p>
<p align="justify">TODAY is the feast of the Christian Passover. A communion 
    table is about to be covered. The great end of persons sitting down at that 
    table is, that they may suck the breasts of consolation, and drink 
    abundantly of that blood which flows from the pierced side of a crucified 
    Savior. Some feed at this table without fear. Others fear so much that they 
    cannot feed. To such poor trembling souls our text speaks good and 
    comfortable words: "Fear not," etc.</p>
<p align="justify">As the Lord showed to Daniel, a man greatly beloved, the 
    state of his church until his first coming; so to John, another beloved 
    disciple, he discloses the state of his church until his second coming. Both 
    of them were dignified with a vision of Christ, the Son of God; and on each 
    of them it had almost the same effect. In Daniel there remained no strength, 
    Daniel 10. Here we see the vision had a similar effect on John. He is 
    represented, verse 17, as a dead man. He was confounded with the glory of 
    the person whom he saw. His eyes were dazzled with the brightness, his 
    strength failed, he could act no more than if he had been dead. But our Lord 
    revives him. He lays his right hand on him, and strengthens him, that he 
    might be able to stand, hear, and receive his orders. Jesus comforts him. He 
    rebukes his fears: Fear not. There is a fear with which God is well pleased, 
    and a fear of which he does not approve. This last is excessive fear, which 
    greatly mars us in our duty, makes our hearts faint, and our hands hang 
    down, so as that we have neither heart nor hand for our work. This is 
    incident to the people of God; but Christ does not allow them in it, though 
    he is tender of them under it.</p>
<p align="justify">We have next, the grounds of consolation, to dispel this 
    fear, namely,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The Godhead of Christ. He is the first and the last. 
    The first principle of all things, from whom they had their beginning, and 
    the last end of all things: an irrefragable testimony this of the divinity 
    of Christ. And it shows us that the comfort of believers depends upon this 
    article.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The union of the Godhead and manhood in one 
    person—where Christ is held forth as God, the living God; who had life from 
    eternity of himself, and gave life to all the creatures—As man; in that it 
    is said he died. It is spoken of the same person. It was the living God that 
    died, though not the divine nature. Here we see proposed, for John's 
    comfort, the death of Christ, God-man. He was made man, and died.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) His resurrection: I am alive. He overcame death, and 
    arose the third day.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) The eternity of that life to which he was raised up: 
    he lives for evermore. To all this is prefixed a Behold! to stir up 
    believers to notice it as the grand fountain of their comfort; and it is 
    followed with an asservation, Amen, or truly, to put them out of doubt of 
    it.</p>
<p align="justify">Next, we have his Mediatorial sovereignty: He has the 
    keys of Hell and death. The keys are an ensign of government. The key of the 
    house of David is laid upon his shoulder. He opens and none can shut, he 
    shuts and none can open, Isaiah 22:22. None go to death or Hell but when he 
    sends them; and none are kept out of Hell, and taken to glory but by him.</p>
<p align="justify">From this subject we may observe the following</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. That the death and resurrection of Christ, that 
    eternal life to which he was raised, and his Mediatory sovereignty, are the 
    great grounds of the saints' consolation, and sufficient to dispel all their 
    unbelieving fears.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing upon this subject, I shall, by divine aid,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Speak a little, and but a little, to each of these 
    things, to unfold them, so as that the ground of comfort in them may appear.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Point out the consolation of the saint to be found in 
    these.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Make some practical improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">I. To speak a little to each of the things in the text, 
    to unfold them, so as that the ground of comfort in them may appear.</p>
<p align="justify">1. As to his death. On this I offer these few remarks:</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) His death supposes—his incarnation, and living as a 
    man in the world, John 1:14, "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us." 
    This has a respect to the Shechinah, or the divine presence: that was a 
    fire, encompassed with a cloud, which was above the ark in the first temple. 
    Christ's divinity was clouded with his humanity; the form of God, with the 
    form of a servant, Philippians 2:6–8, "He took upon him our nature." He was 
    a partaker of flesh and blood, Hebrews 2:14. Thus he became a substantial 
    Mediator between God and man, that so he might be a Mediator of 
    reconciliation; how he was conceived, born, and lived in the world, the 
    Evangelists fully relate.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) His death was vicarious; he died in the room and 
    stead of sinners, not indeed of all, but of his own sheep. The Socinians 
    allow that he died for our good, though not in our room; but this places the 
    death of the martyrs and of Christ on the same footing. But the scripture is 
    plain, Matthew 20:28, "He came to give his life a ransom for many." 
    Galatians 3:13, "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being 
    made a curse for us. He was made sin for us, and died, the just for the 
    unjust." There was a real imputation of the sins of the elect unto Christ, 
    and a real translation of the punishment due to us upon him, Isaiah 53:4–6, 
    "Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem 
    him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our 
    transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our 
    peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep 
    have gone astray: we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord has 
    laid on him the iniquity of us all."—This was typified by the sacrifices 
    under the law, on the head of which the offerer laid his hand, typically 
    transferring the sin upon the beast: which was really accomplished in that 
    true sacrifice of Christ, who gave himself for us, "an offering and a 
    sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor," Ephesians 5:2.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) His sufferings and death were most exquisite: "God 
    spared not his own Son." In the death of Christ there was a complication of 
    deaths; they murdered his reputation, execrating him as a blasphemer against 
    God, and a traitor against the government; placing him between two 
    malefactors, as if he had been the greatest of the three. They murdered his 
    body, and that in a most cruel manner. The wrath of God fell upon his soul, 
    the first drops of which made him cry out, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful." 
    His enemies showed no pity, but gave him vinegar to drink: he got judgment 
    without mercy from God; even the sun was darkened, that he might not have 
    the light of it, because it is pleasant to the eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) His sufferings and death were satisfactory, and that 
    fully. By his one sacrifice, he has forever perfected them that are 
    sanctified. He was Lord of his own life: he voluntarily laid it down, and 
    that upon a compact between the Father and him. Being God, the fullness of 
    the Godhead dwelling in him, the fullness of merit cannot be doubted; for so 
    his sufferings were of infinite value, to which nothing can be added. He was 
    God, and purchased the church with his own blood, Acts 20:28. There was a 
    proportion between the sins of the elect, and the sufferings of Christ. Sin 
    is an infinite evil, his sufferings were of infinite value. His deity 
    stamped an infinite value on his sufferings; and in this respect they do 
    more than equal all the possible sufferings of all creatures together; for 
    what would they all be to God dying?</p>
<p align="justify">2. As to his resurrection, and the life to which he was 
    restored. The text says, "Behold I am alive." Had he lain still in the grave 
    as dead, all the hopes of believers had died with him; but behold, we have 
    David's comfort: his soul was not left in Hell, neither did he see 
    corruption, Psalm 16:10. Here consider,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That God raised up Christ; Acts 2:24, "Him God has 
    raised up, having loosed the pains of death; because it was not possible 
    that he should be held of it." There was the weight of all the elect's sins 
    lying on him as a grave-stone. This was rolled away, and he was raised up by 
    the exceeding greatness of God's power, Ephesians 1:19. By this power, also, 
    the Father declared him to be his Son indeed, Romans 1:4; and that he was 
    fully satisfied for the debt Christ undertook to pay. Therefore, though 
    Christ himself could have rolled away the stone, yet an angel, God's 
    officer, is sent to do it, to open the prison door; thereby declaring, that 
    the Judge had no more to exact of him, that the debt was completely paid.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Where he now lives. It is in Heaven, the better 
    country, which we had forfeited by sin, but where we still would gladly be. 
    Forty days after his resurrection, he ascended into Heaven. As a public 
    person he died, and as such he ascended. There the forerunner is for us 
    entered, even Jesus, made an high priest forever, after the order of 
    Melchizedek. He is set down on the Father's throne, and is at his right 
    hand. Having offered his bloody sacrifice, he is now gone into the holiest 
    of all, and there will continue until the restitution of all things.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) For what he lives. The apostle tells us, that it is 
    to make intercession for us; and he himself says, it is to prepare a place 
    for us in his Father's house, where there are many mansions. He went there 
    to take infeftment of Heaven for us, and he lives to keep possession. He 
    lives there as the advocate of the saints, who have continual business at 
    the court of Heaven, yet have no skill to manage it; "but," says Paul, 
    "Christ is entered there to appear in the presence of God for us." This is 
    said in allusion to a custom among confederated states and princes, who have 
    their agents, who, upon all occasions, appear in the presence of the prince 
    in behalf of those they represent, and for whom they negotiate, to take up 
    any emergent differences, or manage whatever business may be put into their 
    hands. We now go on,</p>
<p align="justify">3. To the eternity of this life. The man Christ lives for 
    evermore. Amen. Says Paul, "He ever lives" and that as God-man. The saints 
    cannot outlive their advocate? nay, through eternity they shall behold his 
    glorious face. He will never lay aside our nature. He is now forever out of 
    the reach of death. He dies no more, death has no more dominion over him. 
    Joseph's brethren, when they saw their father was dead, were in a great 
    fear, lest Joseph should avenge the wrong they had done him. No such fear 
    needs the believer have. Jesus lives forever, to be the eternal bond of the 
    saints' eternal communion with God. For, seeing we can neither come to God 
    by ourselves, nor by ourselves abide in communion with him, it is necessary, 
    that as we come to God by Christ, so by him also must we abide with God 
    forever. The members must receive influences and glory from their head, to 
    whom they shall remain forever united. He lives forever, to be their 
    prophet, for the Lamb is the light of the New Jerusalem, Revelation 21:23; 
    and he will be their priest forever; he continues forever, having an 
    unchangeable priesthood, Hebrews 7:24. He will eternally represent his own 
    sacrifice as the foundation of our eternal glory: and as for his kingdom, it 
    is an everlasting kingdom, that shall not be destroyed, Daniel 7:14. Let us,</p>
<p align="justify">4. Attend to his mediatorial sovereignty. He has the keys 
    of Hell and death. He has all power over the present and future worlds. Hell 
    and death are terrible to the believer; but Christ holds the keys of both. 
    He went down to the grave, opened the door, and brought the keys away with 
    him. None go to Hell but whom he sends there, and consequently the keys of 
    Heaven are in his hand; which is here also understood. He has "all power in 
    Heaven and earth," Matthew 28:18. Of this, Joseph's exaltation in Egypt was 
    a type, Genesis 41:40. And these keys are the purchase of his blood, 
    Philippians 2:8, 9, "Because he humbled himself, and became obedient unto 
    death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also has highly exalted 
    him, and given him a name which is above every name," etc.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, these things, the death, resurrection, life, and 
    power of Jesus, may be considered three ways, in order to improve them for 
    consolation to the saints.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) As patterns and examples. It is the ordinary way of 
    distressed persons, to conclude there is no sorrow like their sorrow; and if 
    you can satisfyingly answer that ordinary question of theirs, Was there ever 
    any in my case that got safely out of it? you will do much to allay their 
    grief, and raise their hopes. Thus we find the apostle improving the 
    sufferings and glory of Christ, Hebrews 12:3, "For, consider him," says he, 
    "that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be 
    wearied, and faint in your minds." Yes, Jesus Christ himself says, 
    Revelation 3:21, "To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me on my 
    throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on his 
    throne."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) As pledges, assuring the saints of what they wish 
    for. Thus the apostle improves the resurrection of Christ, to assure 
    believers they shall not lie ever consuming in a grave, but shall be raised 
    up to glory. Christ says he is risen from the dead, the first-fruits of 
    those that slept, 1 Corinthians 15:20; and Jesus tells us, that his life is 
    a pledge of ours: "Because I live, you shall live also," John 14:19.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) As containing in them sufficient salves for all 
    their sores. Thus are these the magazine of the saints' consolation, his 
    wounds are the clefts of the rock, wherein the poor creature may safely hide 
    itself. Only bruise the spices, pour out the ointment, consider them in 
    their nature and effects, and assuredly they will send forth a pleasant 
    smell, sufficient to revive and comfort a fainting soul. We are now,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To point out the nature of that consolation which 
    saints may derive from these. For this purpose, let us take a view of the 
    fountains of their fears and distrust.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is the super-eminent glory and infinite majesty 
    of the great God. This, when seen and considered by poor worm man, whose 
    habitation is in the dust, is a great source of fear. This made John fall 
    down at his feet as dead. Who can behold the glorious majesty upon this 
    earth, and not be ready to dwindle into nothing? How do some tremble at the 
    view of their fellow-creatures exalted above them in power and dignity! But 
    O what a vast disproportion between God and the greatest monarch! This 
    challenges our fear indeed, but the saints ought not to let it degenerate 
    into slavish fear. God has veiled his throne in the heavens, he spreads his 
    cloud upon it, Job 26:9. This is the common benefit of mankind upon this 
    earth. But the saints have another ground of consolation in the text: and 
    that is the death of Christ, wherein we behold God incarnate, God made 
    flesh, God in our nature. Can you not look straight forward to divine 
    majesty, then fetch a compass, and look through the veil of the flesh of 
    Christ, and so you may see God, and not die. "Often and willingly," said 
    Luther, "would I thus look at God."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Sin is another fountain of fear; sinfulness considered 
    with the nature of God. Here the sinner first sees guilt in himself, and 
    justice in God, which two together make a very frightful spectacle. It is 
    the nature of guilt to bind over to punishment, and of justice to inflict 
    it; so that guilt is a great source of fears. But fear not, O Christian; 
    Christ was dead, and is alive for ever more; therefore the guilt that 
    exposes to hell-fire is done away. You may indeed be guilty, so as to bring 
    upon you fatherly chastisements for your amendment, but you are not liable 
    to eternal plagues. You may plead not guilty to the charges of the law as a 
    covenant of works: "For if God be for us, who can be against us?" Romans 
    8:31. Upon the cross there were two crucified, the Son of God, and the law 
    of God. But the Son of God, by his becoming dead, bruised to death the law 
    as a covenant of works, in respect of believers. He took it out of the way, 
    nailing it to his cross, Colossians 2:14. Therefore the law, our first 
    husband, being dead, our relation to it is dissolved, and we are legally 
    married to Christ, who was raised from the dead, that we should bring forth 
    fruit unto God. Justice is satisfied. No flaming sword stands any more to 
    guard the tree of life. The storm has exhausted itself upon Christ; fear 
    not, but come forward. He died in our room. Justice exacted, and he 
    answered. Fear not old accounts, for God spared not his own Son. A thousand 
    may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, by the stroke of 
    justice, but it shall not come near you. Do you doubt the completeness of 
    the satisfaction? Behold Christ in Heaven, with the complete discharge in 
    his hand. He is out of prison. He brought the keys with him, and is now on 
    the throne. Everlasting righteousness is brought in, and it is put on you by 
    him. He is made of God unto you righteousness. Your own is only filthy rags; 
    but that which is imputed unto you will abide the judgment of God, and 
    endure forever. But,</p>
<p align="justify">3. The sinner sees pollution in himself, and holiness in 
    God. When they behold the spotless purity of God, and themselves as an 
    unclean thing, they are ready to say, O will God look on vile me? will these 
    pure eyes cast a favorable glance on such a dunghill-worm? Fear not, Christ 
    was dead, and is alive. He is made of God unto you sanctification. You have 
    some grace amidst a heap of corruptions. Though you see not what a luster 
    this casts within you, yet God sees it: "The king's daughter is all glorious 
    within," Psalm 45:13. But look to your outer garments, which are of wrought 
    gold, they will hide all your deformities. Though you are, in respect of 
    inherent grace, but fair as the moon, yet your imputed righteousness is 
    clear as the sun. To this some may object, "I am guilty of gross sins, and 
    that even since the Lord began to deal with me." Fear not, Christ died; and 
    if so, God died for your sins. If he was God who died, when he was pouring 
    out his blood, he knew all the sins you would be guilty of, even after your 
    conversion. He did not shed his blood in vain, and therefore in his death he 
    had even these in his view; and will not the blood of God be able to expiate 
    the grossest sins? It cleanses from all sin. Remember also he is alive 
    evermore to intercede for you: "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the 
    Father," 1 John 2:1. If his blood was sufficient for expiation, his 
    intercession cannot but be prevalent.—"But I may say, I sin evermore, and 
    that breaks my soul." Fear not, Christ lives evermore; and, if you believe 
    the apostle, it is to make intercession for you. If Christ lives evermore, 
    you shall not sin evermore: for he will not thus live alone without you; 
    where he is, there you shall be also, John 17:24. "But the sin of my nature 
    lies nearest my heart: I am just a lump of Hell, and a mass of sin. Acts of 
    sin are transient, but this is permanent, and I cannot be freed of it." Fear 
    not: Christ died, and therefore, though it may make your way to Heaven 
    difficult, yet you shall never be condemned for it. Nay, good news, O 
    believer! with the death of Christ sin got a fatal wound. Your old man was 
    crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, Romans 6:6. You 
    wonder it is so troublesome; but why do you do so? The old man is mortally 
    wounded; and can you think he will groan out his life in silence, and not 
    move a tongue against Christ? But as surely as Christ came not down from the 
    cross until he breathed out his last, so surely shall the body of death in 
    you be destroyed.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Desertions are a cause of fears. The deserted soul is 
    an affrighted soul. Say some, "Christ is withdrawn from me: my sun has gone 
    down: nothing now but darkness and confusion: I can see no evidences of the 
    Lord's love to me: I may say as Job, chapter 23:8, 9, "I go forward and 
    backward, but I cannot perceive him." But fear not, Christian; it has been, 
    and it will be, better with you. Good news to you in your low state, Christ 
    died, and in his death he was forsaken of God; and yet he now enjoys the 
    bosom of the Father, and the light of his countenance. Who would not be 
    content to follow Christ, even through the valley of the shadow of death? 
    You pray, and it seems you are not heard; so it was with Christ: "O my God," 
    said he, "you hear not," Psalm 22:2. But though your husband be far off, 
    though you cannot see him, yet he is not dead, he is alive; and if alive, he 
    will come again, for he hates putting away. Though you seem to be out of 
    sight, yet you are not out of mind; he lives evermore. Zion's account of 
    Christ under a fit of desertion, is not canonical, it is not orthodox, 
    Isaiah 49:14–16, "But Zion said, the Lord has forsaken me, and my Lord has 
    forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have 
    compassion on the son of her womb? yes, they may forget, yet will I not 
    forget you. Behold, I have graven you upon the palms of my hands, your walls 
    are continually before me."</p>
<p align="justify">To this the objection may be proposed, "But how can I 
    endure to want the joys I have sometimes had, and these blessed 
    consolations?" Answer, Trust in God, and have respect to the recompense of 
    the reward of grace. Will you disquiet yourselves because there is not a 
    second summer in one year? Bless God that helps you to the fight in any 
    measure; wait patiently for his comforts, and be constantly at your work. 
    Again, say others, "Were there no more in my case, I might keep heart; but I 
    am under dreadful apprehensions of wrath, and there are positive outgoings 
    of God's anger against my soul, as Job 6:4, "The arrows of the Almighty are 
    within me." Here, I confess, it is hard to stand, and not to fall down at 
    his feet as dead. Yet we must say, Fear not; for Christ was dead, and the 
    wrath of God was poured out into his soul, which melted his heart like wax 
    in the midst of his affections: Yet he swam through this ocean. Now, that he 
    is alive, is a pledge that you shall not drown: For, says he, "because I 
    live you shall live also."</p>
<p align="justify">It was one of the ends of Christ's death, to deliver you 
    and the like of you, Hebrews 2:15, "And deliver them who through fear of 
    death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. You are mistaken, if you 
    think the arrows are dipped in deadly poison; for Christ was dead, and is 
    alive, and the poison of these arrows entered into his soul in full measure, 
    and he drank it up; Galatians 3:13, "Christ has redeemed us from the curse 
    of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every 
    one that hangs on a tree." They will wound very sore, though there be no 
    poison, no curse in them. Your cloud has a white side, if you could discern 
    it; only believe, and you shall be established. This is the heat of the 
    battle with you. Keep hold of the death of Christ as your shield that will 
    defend you. Look not on God, but through the veil of the flesh of Jesus. Dry 
    stubble may be safe, if there be a strong crystal wall between it and the 
    fire. Does God appear as a consuming fire? Christ is the crystal wall: set 
    him between you and an angry God. The light of that fire will shine through 
    him to refresh you, but it will not burn through him. It has been often 
    tried; he is still alive, and you shall live also.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Temptations are a source of fears. Sometimes Satan 
    gets leave to dog saints at their heels. With what horrid temptations poor 
    souls may be harassed, some know by sad experience: fiery darts that they 
    tremble to think of, and that they dare not name! This fills them with fear: 
    but to such I say, Fear not. Christ died, and is alive evermore. He who thus 
    lives evermore gave a deadly wound to the tempter. When Jesus was in the 
    world, Satan set on him with the most severe temptations; but Jesus overcame 
    him, and at his death triumphed over him. He spoiled principalities and 
    powers, Colossians 2:15, "And having spoiled principalities and powers, he 
    made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it." You see, then, that 
    the enemy with whom you fight is already vanquished, and the victory of 
    Jesus over him is a sure pledge of yours. Yes, as in the first Adam we were 
    all tempted and fell, so in the second Adam we were tempted and stood; and 
    so have overcome already in our Head. We have no more to do but cry to our 
    Lord, who, from his own temptations, well knows how to support his tempted 
    people. We must give the alarm, and handle our weapons. Though the fight may 
    last a while, yet it will come to an end, and we shall be more than 
    conquerors. Jesus is in Heaven, waiting until his enemies be made his 
    footstool; and he will bruise Satan under our feet shortly.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Death is the cause of much fear. O how hard is it to 
    look on it with a stayed countenance! Death is terrible, in that it is a 
    dissolution of nature, parts soul and body; and therefore we are so apt to 
    shudder at the thoughts of it. But fear not; for Christ died. His precious 
    soul and body were parted; so he orders us to travel no path but such as he 
    has trod before us. By his death he has destroyed death; he has unstinged it 
    to the believer. Then, fear it not, it can do you no harm, "But death is 
    terrible, in that it takes us out of this world from all our enjoyments, 
    from our dearest relations and friends, and sends us into another world, 
    where we know not a foot of ground, where we never saw a face. Were a child 
    born with that judgment that men have, the first sight of this world might 
    be terrible to him; so must the unseen world be to us. But fear not: he who 
    was dead is alive; and when you are carried off, you shall be with him who 
    is infinitely better than all earthly relations. Here is your comfort. Jesus 
    has the keys of Hell and death. He is Lord supreme of that other world to 
    which you are traveling. He sends you such word as Joseph sent his father, 
    Genesis 45:9, saying, "God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down unto me, 
    tarry not." O to believe it firmly!</p>
<p align="justify">6, And Lastly, Hell is a fountain of fears. Sometimes the 
    godly are above, sometimes under the fears of Hell. It is terrible, the 
    thought of being excluded forever the presence of God! "Who can abide with 
    everlasting burnings?" When we look down to the pit, it seems hard to escape 
    it; when we look up to Heaven, our souls faint, lest we never get there. But 
    fear not: for Christ died; and if so, he suffered the torments you should 
    have suffered in Hell, as to the essentials of them. He was under the 
    punishment of loss; God forsook him, Psalm 22:1. He endured the punishment 
    of sense, even to drops of blood, and the wrath of God poured into his soul. 
    Then God will not require two payments for one debt. Christ lives, he rose, 
    and entered Heaven as a public person; and therefore, believer, you shall as 
    surely go to Heaven as if you were there already, yes, the apostle says we 
    are there already. Ephesians 2:6, "We are raised up together, and made to 
    sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus," as our Head. Jesus lives 
    for evermore; and therefore you shall be forever with the Lord. He has the 
    keys of Hell and death. Suppose your father or best friend on earth had 
    these keys, would you be afraid? But we may have more confidence in Jesus 
    than in ten thousand fathers, or even the mothers that bare us. They may 
    forsake us, and a mother may be found that will not have compassion on the 
    son of her womb; but, O believer, Jesus has said, "I will not forget you," 
    Isaiah 49:15, 16, "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not 
    have compassion on the son of her womb? yes, they may forget, yet I will not 
    forget you. Behold, I have graven you upon the palms of my hand, your walls 
    are continually before me." Though Satan be the jailor of Hell, yet he keeps 
    not the keys; they hang, believer, at the belt of your best friend.</p>
<p align="justify">III. We shall conclude with some improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">1. From this subject we may infer the comfortless state 
    of them that are out of Christ. Are the truths in the text grounds of 
    consolation to the saints? How, then, can they bear up who have no interest 
    in Christ? Nay, we might turn the black side of this white cloud upon 
    unbelievers, and tell them, that if Jesus died how can they escape? If he be 
    alive, he will avenge their contempt of him and their neglect of his 
    salvation. If he lives for evermore, then they will have an eternal enemy. 
    If he has the keys of Hell, then they cannot escape that prison; or be 
    rescued out of it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That it is the duty of Christians to improve these 
    things for their actual comfort. Christian, sit down at his table, and suck 
    the breasts of consolation. Build your comforts on these truths. Alas! our 
    comforts are often short lived, because we do not found them sure enough. I 
    will give you but a few notes concerning this.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The grieving of the Spirit cuts the throats of our 
    comforts.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Good men sometimes build their comforts on outward 
    blessings; hence, when these are gone, their comfort is gone.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) On grace within them, not on grace without them; the 
    comfort of some streams from their obedience principally, therefore it is 
    soon dried up; whereas the death and life of Christ are liable to no change, 
    as is our obedience.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Upon the coming in of words to their minds. Hence, 
    when a promise comes in, they are comforted; when a threatening, all is 
    gone. I do believe that the Spirit comforts his people by the word, and that 
    he makes words come in with an impression on the; soul; John 14:26, "He 
    shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, 
    whatever I have said." But then these words lead the soul direct to Christ, 
    and to build our comfort on him; but it is not of God to build it on the 
    bare impression of a comfortable word. The coming in of a word should guide 
    us to Christ; and though the impression, the guide go, yet we may keep our 
    hold of him.—Here we are presented with an objection, "But I fear I have 
    nothing to do with these consolations." </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Are you this day willing to take Christ? Then 
    give your consent, and he is yours, and all is yours: "Whoever will, let him 
    take of the water of life freely," Revelation 22:17. </p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. "But I fear I am not sincere, in that I am 
    actuated from fear of Hell, and hope of reward." </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. If you fear not God's wrath, so as to endeavor to 
    escape it, you are despisers of God; if you desire not salvation, so as to 
    labor for it, you are monstrous murderers of your own souls. Let your 
    self-love only be regular, and it is commendable; and then it is regular 
    when your desires of happiness are carried towards it through Christ and the 
    way of holiness; so that your soul longs for Christ as well as salvation, 
    and you desire to be holy as well as happy. It is regular, when it is 
    subordinate to the will of God; and that is, when the man justifies God, 
    though he should cast him off, and yet, come what will, is resolved to 
    cleave to the Lord and his way.</p>
<p align="justify">A word to other two sources of the saint's fears.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Weakness and spiritual inability for the duties of 
    religion. The soul taking a view of the great work it has to do, what strong 
    lusts are to be mortified, temptations resisted, duties performed; and then, 
    considering how weak and unable it is for any of these things, it is even 
    ready to sink. But fear not: Christ died, etc. Hebrews 12:12, "Wherefore, 
    lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees." Christ died, and 
    therefore strength for duty is purchased. In the first Adam, the influences 
    of the Spirit were forfeited; in the second Adam, they are bought back 
    again. The well-ordered covenant is sealed and confirmed. There is a 
    fullness in the covenant for all your wants. There are promises in it that 
    will answer all your needs. Now, the covenant is confirmed, for the testator 
    is dead. Christ lives; he arose from death, and lives evermore; therefore, 
    he who has the believer's stock of strength is alive. Adam got our first 
    stock, but he became insolvent; Christ got the next, he lives in the court 
    of Heaven as a public person and treasury of strength; "Of his fullness have 
    all we received, and grace for grace," John 1:16.</p>
<p align="justify">The believer's Surety to the Father stands good; and what 
    need they fear as long as their Cautioner holds foot? Christ is the 
    believer's cautioner for sanctification and perseverance, John 10:28, and 
    chapter 17:12, "While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your 
    name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the 
    son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled." Therefore he is 
    called "the surety of a better testament," Hebrews 7:22. Now, he will not 
    see his people in want of what is necessary for their through-bearing. He 
    lives for that end, to dispense the benefits of the covenant. He holds the 
    keys, therefore they shall not want. The Spirit is given by virtue of his 
    ascension, John 16:7, "Nevertheless, I tell you the truth, it is expedient 
    for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come 
    unto you: but if I depart, I will send him unto you." For what purpose was 
    Joseph sent to Egypt, and exalted there, but to provide for his father's 
    family, being therein a notable type of Christ? Well, then, fear not; wiles 
    help weak folk. Though you want strength, yet you have wisdom afforded you, 
    even in betaking yourselves to Christ. I may allude to that, Proverbs 
    30:24–29, "There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they 
    are exceeding wise. The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their 
    meat in the summer; the comes are but a feeble flock, yet make they their 
    houses in the rocks; the locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them 
    by bands; the spider takes hold with her hands, and is in king's palaces." 
    You have the wisdom of the ants, to provide your meat in summer; of the 
    comes, to build in the Rock Christ; of the locusts, not to set out alone; 
    and of the spiders, to be in the palace of the great King, holding by the 
    promises. 2 Corinthians 12:9, "My grace is sufficient for you; for my 
    strength is made perfect in weakness."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The danger of an evil time is another source of fear. 
    Psalm 49:5, "Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity 
    of my heels shall compass me about? Two things there look ghastly upon them.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The hazard of sinning. An evil time is a time of 
    many snares. The soul is afraid that he will never stand out, but one day 
    will fall. Fear not—Christ died, and it was an evil time, a time of many 
    snares, yet he came safe off. This he did as a public person, and so it is a 
    pledge that you shall also be carried through; see Hebrews 4:14–16. Christ 
    lives evermore, therefore you may say, as David, Psalm 18:46, 48," The Lord 
    lives, and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted. 
    He delivers me from mine enemies," etc. He lives to intercede, which was 
    Peter's security: "I have," says he, "prayed for you, that your faith fail 
    not." He is busy for his people, when they have most need.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) There is hazard of suffering, and that is frightful 
    to flesh and blood. Fear not—Christ died, and therefore the bitter dregs of 
    the cup are drunken off. He was forsaken in his sufferings, that you might 
    be supported in your sufferings.—Your sufferings will but conform you to 
    Christ your head. Christ lives, and therefore you shall be supported in 
    suffering, that the world may know that he who was dead is alive. Remarkable 
    is that word, 2 Corinthians 4:10, "Always bearing about in the body the 
    dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also might be made manifest 
    in our body." A suffering time is a special season in which Christ uses to 
    appear. We read thrice of Christ's hour, John 13:1, "Now, before the feast 
    of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come, that he should 
    depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in 
    the world, he loved them unto the end." Chapter 17:1, "These words spoke 
    Jesus,—Father, the hour is come," etc. That was an hour of darkness. John 
    2:4, "Jesus says unto her, Woman, what have I to do with you? mine hour is 
    not yet come." That was an hour wherein the wine was done, and the pots were 
    filled with water; you know what followed.</p>
<p align="justify">Here it may be objected, "But what if ordinances be taken 
    away?" </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. If they be, the God of ordinances endures 
    forever. Christ lives, "and he shall be for a sanctuary," Isaiah 8:14. And 
    says God, by Ezekiel, concerning his scattered people, "Yet will I be to 
    them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come," chapter 
    11:16. When there was no ordinary food to be got in the wilderness, it was 
    sent down from Heaven. Though our church doors should be shut, heaven's door 
    shall be open as long as Christ lives. </p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. "But I think I am very unfruitful under 
    ordinances." </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. It is the greater shame! But if this be your 
    trouble, know that Christ lives; and therefore, if there be sap in the root, 
    there is always hope of the branches. There is enough there, draw it out. 
    But as Christ first died, then arose, so the believer grows downward as well 
    as upward. If you have a heart-memory, though you want a head-memory, it is 
    well.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. "But what shall those do, when they are seized 
    with fear and discouragement, and cannot tell wherefore?" </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. The Lord may sometimes exercise his people so, to 
    show them their own weakness and nothingness. But possibly it may be the 
    majesty of God that so affects you, and the reason why it is not discerned 
    to be so, may be an intimation of the Lord's love just going before it. See 
    Daniel 10:10–12, "And behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees, 
    and upon the palms of my hands. And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly 
    beloved, understand the words that I speak unto you, and stand upright: for 
    unto you am I now sent: and when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood 
    trembling." But however it be, the only cure is believing, Psalm 27:13, "I 
    had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the 
    land of the living." The sooner you believe, the better; for in this case a 
    man is like one that is going to ride a great water that is increasing; the 
    longer he delays, the water grows still the greater.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, the way to make use of these things, so as to draw 
    comfort from them, is to believe. There is, in the first place, a firm 
    assent to the truths revealed, 1 John 5:5, "Who is he who overcomes the 
    world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?" then, an act of 
    faith, realizing these things, Hebrews 11:1, "Now, faith is the substance of 
    things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." To which may be added, 
    an act of assurance, Galatians 2:20, "I am crucified with Christ; 
    nevertheless I live; yet not I but Christ lives in me; and the life which I 
    now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, 
    and gave himself for me." If you cannot reach to all this extent, yet you 
    may reach an act of adherence. A trembling hand may draw the water of 
    consolation out of the wells of salvation. Amen.</p>
