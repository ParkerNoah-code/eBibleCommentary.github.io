    of Those Who Know the Joyful Sound</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">
<a href="https://gracegems.org/28/thomas_boston_sermons.htm">Thomas Boston</a>, 1676–1732</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    Psalm 89:15, "They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of your countenance."</p>
<p align="justify">HERE begins the account of the happiness of those that 
    know the joyful sound of the gospel. They have many special privileges, and 
    this is the leading one, "They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of your 
    countenance."</p>
<p align="justify">Here is first their motion at the joyful sound. The 
    gospel is a sound for motion and and action. They that know it not sit 
    still, no moving heaven-wards by them: but they that know it are quickened 
    by it, they are set on a march, and go forward. They will walk on, and walk 
    vigorously, as the word imports, through the several steps in the wilderness 
    journey. We have next the advantage which they may have from the joyful 
    sound for their walking. "They shall walk in the light of your countenance." 
    Light is a great help to walking on a journey. It is neither safe nor 
    comfortable to walk in the dark. They shall walk in the light of the Lord's 
    countenance, or face, which is more lightsome to those that know it, than 
    the united light of sun, moon, and stars. They shall have the sunny side of 
    the brae, of all the rest of the world. Their way shall be a Goshen for 
    light, while others sit in Egyptian darkness.</p>
<p align="justify">The Psalmist's directing his speech to God here, shows 
    his firm confidence as to the thing, and how much his own heart was set upon 
    enjoying that privilege.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE.—As men know and believe the joyful sound of the 
    gospel, so shall they walk on their way heavenward, in the light of the 
    Lord's countenance. In prosecuting this, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Consider the duty to which the joyful sound known and 
    believed, effectually excites men. They shall walk.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I shall consider the privilege which they that know 
    the joyful sound, shall thereby have, in their walk heavenwards. I am then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To consider the duty to which the joyful sound known 
    and believed, effectually excites men. They shall walk.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They shall not sit still, doing nothing to purpose for 
    God and their immortal souls, like the rest of the world, dead in trespasses 
    and sins. The sound of the gospel is the most powerful of all alarms. The 
    law may terrify a sinner; yes it may toss a dead soul, as a dead corpse is 
    tossed hither and thither in the earth by an earthquake, but can never put 
    life into it. It is not a mean appointed by God for that end. It is the 
    ministration of death and condemnation, not of life, 2 Corinthians 5:7–8. 
    But the joyful sound of the gospel, quickens the dead sinner to a spiritual 
    life. "The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear 
    shall live." And this life will exert itself in its proper actions, namely, 
    in holy obedience. So they have not known the joyful sound, who are not 
    excited to walk on the way heavenward. The unholy are without doubt 
    unbelievers.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They shall not go back to their former lusts in their 
    ignorance. Apostates were never true believers. "If any man draw back," says 
    God, "my soul shall have no pleasure in him." "But," says Paul, "we are not 
    of them that draw back to perdition, but of them that believe, to the saving 
    of the soul." It was those among the Israelites, that believed not, that 
    were for making a captain, and going back to Egypt. They looked on the 
    promise of Canaan, as a thing that would not hold, and therefore they would 
    see to themselves otherwise. Thus do many bewray their unbelief of the 
    gospel, by a greedy return to the world and their lusts after a communion, 
    looking upon the world as a thing certain, and what is in the promise as a 
    thing uncertain and distant.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They shall hold forward in their way in spite of all 
    opposition, and not give over until they get to the journey's end, whatever 
    weather blow. "The righteous also, shall hold on his way; and he who has 
    clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger." The faith of the gospel is the 
    spring of perseverance, according to that saying, "the just shall live by 
    his faith;" and unbelief is the great cause of apostasy. It is "the evil 
    heart of unbelief that leads men to depart from the living God." It was the 
    unbelief of the spies, and of those who credited them, that made their 
    carcasses full in the wilderness; while Caleb and Joshua believed the joyful 
    sound of the promise, and got safe to Canaan. Faith makes a man righteous in 
    the sight of God, and so frees him of the burden of the curse, and guilt of 
    eternal wrath. And sooner shall a prisoner laden with irons, make his way up 
    a steep hill, and not fall by the way, than an unjustified sinner setting 
    out in God's way, shall hold on. Faith listening to the joyful sound, 
    inspires the soul with new vigor. "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew 
    their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and 
    not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, They shall walk on in the sight of the Lord, as 
    he who walks in the light, walks in the sight of the sun. "Walk before me," 
    said God unto Abram, "and be you perfect." Faith believing the gospel, calls 
    the name of the Lord, speaking to the sinner, "You, God, see me;" as Hagar 
    did in another case, Genesis 16:13. They will walk before him as under his 
    eye, considering him as the witness to all their actions, and who will be 
    their judge. While unbelievers forget him, and have little or no regard to 
    his all-seeing eye, and all-hearing ear. We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To consider the privileges which they that know and 
    believe the joyful sound, shall thereby have in their walk heaven-wards; 
    "They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of your countenance."</p>
<p align="justify">1. They shall be ever in a state of favor, peace, and 
    reconciliation with God. "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God, 
    through our Lord Jesus Christ." God is no more their enemy, but they are in 
    inviolable friendship with him. The darkness of a natural state is over with 
    them, and shall never return. The true light is come, the sun of 
    righteousness is risen on them, in the joyful sound known and believed, and 
    shall never go down on them again. "For you were sometimes darkness, but now 
    are you light in the Lord; walk as children of the light."</p>
<p align="justify">2. No cloud of revenging wrath shall ever gather above 
    their heads any more, no curse of the law, no guilt of eternal wrath. Such a 
    cloud would extinguish the light of the Lord's countenance, for the time it 
    stayed, and reduce them, for the time, to the state of enmity and wrath, in 
    which they were, before they knew the joyful sound. The joyful sound of the 
    everlasting covenant, secures them forever, against all such clouds 
    returning after the rain of revenging wrath, poured out on Christ, in their 
    room and stead. "For this is as the waters of Noah unto me; says the Lord: 
    for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the 
    earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with you, nor rebuke you."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Whatever cloud may gather above their head in their 
    way heavenward, it shall never be so thick, but the light of the Lord's 
    countenance shall shine through it, Psalm 89:31–34. Though God will never 
    resume the face of a wrathful revenging judge against them, yet he may be an 
    angry Father, and they may be under clouds of fatherly anger. But in the 
    blackest of all these, there are rays of love and favor to be seen. "For 
    whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives. As 
    many," says he, "as I love, I rebuke and chasten." The sharpest arrows shot 
    against them, shall be winged with love; and their bitterest potions shall 
    be medicinal. Though the light of the Lord's countenance do not always shine 
    alike full upon them, it shall never, in their darkest hours, suffer a total 
    eclipse.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They shall be directed in their way. "I will instruct 
    you, and teach you in the way which you shall go: I will guide you with mine 
    eye." They walk through a wilderness, where often it is hard to know the 
    right way, where there are many to lead them out of the way. But the Lord 
    will be eyes to them in the wilderness. Listening to the joyful sound, they 
    shall hear a voice behind them, saying, "This is the way, walk in it; when 
    you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left." The way through 
    the world is so filled with stumbling blocks, that they who have not this 
    light, cannot escape to fall over them and perish. But they shall walk in 
    the light and be directed in their way. "For this God is our God forever and 
    ever; he will be our guide even unto death."</p>
<p align="justify">5. They shall be strengthened in their way, for this 
    light is the light of life. Solomon observes, "that in the light of the 
    king's countenance is life, and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain." 
    How much more in the light of the Lord's countenance, is there life and 
    refreshment. The joyful sound of the gospel, known and believed, brings a 
    strengthening light with it. "They that wait upon the Lord, shall renew 
    their strength, they shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run and 
    not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint." Many a time has the child 
    of God, by this means, out of weakness been made strong; and upon the 
    tasting of the sweetness of the word of promise, been made to say as 
    Jonathan, in another case, "See, I pray you, how mine eyes have been 
    enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, They shall be cheered and comforted in their way. 
    Solomon tells us, "Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for 
    the eyes to behold the sun." But no such sweetness, no such comfort in any 
    light, as in the light of the Lord's countenance lifted upon a soul. David 
    witnesses it from his experience. "There be many that say, who will show us 
    any good? Lord, lift you up the light of your countenance upon us. You have 
    put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their 
    wine increased. None can keep the way heavenward, but they will meet with 
    many things from within and from without, tending to their discouragement. 
    But God has secured their comfort in the way of believing, and the faith of 
    the gospel will carry them comfortably through under the heaviest burdens, 
    Hebrews 11.</p>
<p align="justify">Use I. Of information. Hence we may learn,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Whence it is that many communicants are nothing 
    bettered by gospel ordinances, but even go away as they come, a prey to 
    their lusts and an evil world. They sit down to the feast, but they rise not 
    up to the journey. They eat, but they are not refreshed, nor strengthened to 
    their proper work after a communion. Why? Alas! they never get into the 
    saving knowledge of the joyful sound. They are ever learning, but they never 
    come to the knowledge of the truth. They hear it, but they do not believe 
    it. They believe it not with application to themselves. Hence it has no 
    quickening, nor sanctifying influence on them. They go away morally serious, 
    to ply their duty, and to reform their life. But not having the faith of the 
    promises of the gospel, the only channel of spiritual life and strength, 
    they are like a soldier going to the battle without his weapons, who 
    presently gives back. Take heed then, brethren, "lest there be in any of you 
    an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Whence it is that many of the saints are so weak, and 
    comfortless in their way heavenward, walking so much in the dark. It is all 
    owing to the small measure of their faith of the joyful sound. Whatever be 
    the hard pieces of work put into the hand of any of the Lord's people, 
    whatever be their temptations, trials, and afflictions, there is as much in 
    the joyful sound, as if it were plentifully brought into the soul by a 
    lively faith, would make them go through all these, like a giant refreshed 
    with wine. And the Lord said, "If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, 
    you might say unto this syeamine tree, be you plucked up by the root, and be 
    you planted in the sea, and it should obey you."</p>
<p align="justify">3. That the faith of the gospel is the sovereign remedy 
    in all darkness and distresses, in which a person can be. Believing is a 
    duty that can never be out of season. This is the way to bring one out of 
    darkness into the light. "Who is among you that fears the Lord, that obeys 
    the voice of his servant, that walks in darkness, and has no light? Let him 
    trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God. The promises of the 
    gospel are full of suitable help for all diseases and distempers; and faith 
    is the mouth of the soul, whereby applying the promise to one's self, the 
    nourishment contained in it is brought into the soul. "The Lord is my 
    strength and my shield, my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore 
    my heart greatly rejoices, and with my song will I praise him." If then you 
    are in desertion, temptation, or affliction, go to the promise and embrace 
    it by faith.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Hence learn whether you have a right to the seal of 
    the gospel covenant or not. All Christ's sheep have this ear mark. They know 
    the joyful sound. "My sheep," says he, "hear my voice, and I know them, and 
    they follow me." They have discerned it as the voice of the living God. The 
    gospel is the savor of life unto them. They have been let into the kernel of 
    it, while others break their teeth upon the shell. "For our gospel," says 
    Paul, "came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy 
    Spirit. and in much assurance." It has not been always to them a dry 
    channel, a dead letter, but the ministration of the spirit of faith and 
    holiness to them. "Therefore," says the apostle Peter, "As new born babes, 
    desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby: If so be you 
    have tasted that the Lord is gracious." The Lord has drawn aside the veil, 
    and they have seen the hidden beauty of it; opened the cabinet, and 
    discovered the treasure there.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, they savor it as the suitable nourishment for 
    their souls. "They know it is not a vain thing for them, because it is their 
    life." As living creatures have their proper nourishment, so one delights in 
    what another cares not for. The new creature is nourished by the gospel, and 
    it is natural, for the saints had their life by it. "They have been born 
    again of incorruptible seed, by the Word of God which lives and abides 
    forever." So they have a peculiar savor of it, while others regard it no 
    more than the dogs do hay.</p>
<p align="justify">Once more all their hopes are in it. "It is all their 
    salvation and all their desire. They have been beaten off from hopes in the 
    law, in their own works, doings, sufferings and services: and have betaken 
    themselves to the Word of God's grace, as the only anchor of their souls. 
    And all their doings and sufferings, are to them in that point, as if they 
    had done just nothing. "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the 
    kingdom of Heaven."</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION.—The stony ground hearers received the word with 
    joy. How then shall we distinguish between that, and the true knowledge of 
    the joyful sound, the genuine savor of the gospel of God's grace?</p>
<p align="justify">1. The true convert receives the joyful sound of the 
    gospel, as the most joyful sound for him, overcoming and overpowering all 
    others, and therefore rests his heart there. "Your testimonies have I taken 
    as an heritage forever; for they are the rejoicing of my heart." It contains 
    the one thing that is to him the main thing, and instead of all other 
    things. The hypocrite may receive it as a joyful sound, but yet there is 
    still some sound more joyful to him. The bleating of sheep, and lowing of 
    oxen, is a more joyful sound to some; the sound of created comforts, is more 
    taking with the most part, than all the comforts of the gospel. Christ may 
    be sweet to a hypocrite, but the mischief is, still some hue lust or other 
    is sweeter. So like Orpah, they leave him, not without some affection to 
    him.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The convert gets his savor of the gospel, by finding 
    the extreme bitterness of sin. Like those who heard Peter and the rest of 
    the apostles, "they have been pricked in their heart, and made to say, men 
    and brethren, what shall we do? Others come more easily by theirs. Like the 
    stony ground hearers, they at once receive it with joy. Many savor the 
    sweetness of the gospel, to whom sin either never was made bitter; or if it 
    was, yet never the bitterest of all things; so their Savior of the gospel is 
    but superficial. But God makes his own feel sin more and more bitter, until 
    it become of all bitters the most bitter, even more bitter than death. And 
    then they know to purpose, the sweetness of the joyful sound.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The convert savors the whole of the joyful sound. 
    There is always someone note or other in it, that an unsound heart savors 
    not. They have not respect to all God's commandments. They that know the 
    joyful sound, savor it for sanctification, as well as for justification; for 
    the cross as well as the crown. But many are like Herod, who heard it 
    gladly, until his beloved lust was touched.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of exhortation. Believers, you that know the 
    joyful sound, bless God for what your ears do hear, and for what your eyes 
    do see. Seek for more of this blessedness. As ever you would walk on your 
    way heavenward, safely and comfortably, labor more and more to know the 
    joyful sound; and to know it so as to believe it; and to believe it, so as 
    to apply it to your own souls, according to your several exigencies. 
    Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is too precious and dear bought a sound, to be 
    neglected by poor sinners. It had never been heard in the world, had not the 
    son of God in our nature purchased it by his sufferings and death. There was 
    a dreadful sound of a deluge of wrath falling on him, which made him to 
    groan out his soul on the cross. And had not that been, this had never been. 
    We to them to whom it will be a fruitless sound.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a sound which has the matter of all joy in it, 
    to be drawn forth in the way of believing. Now the God of hope fill you with 
    all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the 
    power of the holy Spirit." It comprehends the whole covenant, with all the 
    benefits thereof, which are suited to all the necessities of a soul, for 
    time and eternity. The gospel is the offer and exhibiting of all to you, the 
    setting before you the whole covenant of promises, and declaring you welcome 
    to intermeddle, take possession of, and use them for your own behalf. They 
    will perish miserably, who perish under such a full covenant table, because 
    they will not put out their hand to take it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is a sound that will not sound always in your ears. 
    If death come on before you know it, you can never know it more. "Behold, 
    now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation." In Hell it 
    is not to be heard, therefore the light of the Lord's countenance can never 
    rise there; but they are enrapt up there, in the blackness of darkness 
    forever. The Sinai trumpet will sound forever most dreadfully through all 
    the corners of that dark vault; but not the least whisper of Zion's trumpet.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is both your duty and interest to know it. 
    There is no saving knowledge of God but by it, for by the gospel only we 
    know him in the face of Jesus. The faith of it is the way of sanctification, 
    "we are sanctified by faith which is in Christ Jesus." And it is the way of 
    solid comfort, "we are filled with joy and peace in believing." And the more 
    a person has of the faith of the gospel, he will be the more holy, and the 
    more joyful in the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore study the gospel of Christ, and cry for the 
    Spirit to cause you know it. Christ is a veiled Savior, and the gospel is a 
    veiled gospel to many. It is hidden to them that are lost. If you do not 
    believe it, it will be worse for you than if you had never heard it. Cry 
    then for the Spirit, and for God to reveal Christ in your hearts, the hope 
    and the earnest of glory. Amen.</p>
