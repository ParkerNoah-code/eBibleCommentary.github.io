    Exodus 24:11, "And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his 
    hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink."</p>
<p align="justify">HAVING, in the preceding discourse, considered the first 
    doctrine taken from these words, we go on to a short illustration of</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. That it is a wonder of grace, that sinful 
    creatures, in their solemn approaches to God, are favored with special 
    sights of, and a holy familiarity with him, and yet come off safe.</p>
<p align="justify">In speaking to this point, we shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show that it is a wonder of grace, that sinful 
    creatures are admitted to see God, and to be familiar with him.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Show that it is a wonder that in their solemn 
    approaches, and when they are thus favored, yet they come off safe.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Explain how it comes to pass, that their safety, 
    when thus favored, is secured.—And then,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Make some short improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">We are,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show that it is a wonder of grace that sinful 
    creatures are admitted to see God, and be familiar with him. We think we 
    need say little for proof of this. Only consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The infinite distance that there is between God and 
    the creature in respect of perfection. The distance between an angel and a 
    moth is but finite; but between God and us the distance is infinite. And 
    therefore, no wonder that beholding the glorious perfections of God, we 
    dwindle into nothing in our own eyes, and say with Abraham, Genesis 18:27, 
    "Behold now, we have taken upon us to speak unto the Lord, which are but 
    dust and ashes;" and cry out with Solomon, 1 Kings 8:27, "But will God 
    indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the Heaven, and Heaven of heavens, cannot 
    contain you; how much less this house that I have built?" Remember, you 
    saints that though God has laid by his enmity, he retains his sovereignty 
    over us; and therefore it is admirable condescension, that he is pleased to 
    allow us to see him, and to enjoy holy familiarity with him. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That it is the same God who is such a severe and 
    dreadful avenger of sin; Psalm 5:5, "The foolish shall not stand in your 
    sight: you hate all workers of iniquity." Habakkuk 1:13, "You are of purer 
    eyes than to behold evil, and can not look on iniquity." This same God who 
    allows his covenant-people a sight of his glory, and a holy familiarity with 
    him on the mount of ordinances, is he who thrust Adam out of 
    paradise,—drowned the old world,—rained fire and brimstone upon Sodom and 
    Gomorrah. He who gives some the cup of salvation at his table, is the same 
    who makes others of their fellow-creatures drink the wine-cup of his fury. 
    He who makes some feast in his presence, is the same from whose presence 
    others shall be punished with everlasting destruction.</p>
<p align="justify">We are,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show that it is a wonder of grace that sinful 
    creatures, in their solemn approaches to God, and when they are thus 
    favored, come off safe. This will appear if we consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The infinite holiness and spotless purity of that God 
    before whom the sinful creature appears. He is glorious in holiness, and 
    fearful in praises, Exodus 15:11. Even angelical purity is dim in his light, 
    and is a sort of impurity, when compared with the infinite holiness of God, 
    Job 15:15. Even they are chargeable with folly in his sight; potential 
    folly, (though not actual), a kind of imperfection inseparable from the 
    nature of the creature, in any state whatever; Job 4:18, "Behold, he put no 
    trust in his servants; and all his angels are charged with folly." (Hebrew, 
    He puts, charges). And therefore, even the confirmed angels cover their feet 
    with their wings, Isaiah 6:2, as if they would tell us that perfect created 
    holiness is but a dark and smoky light before uncreated holiness. Shining 
    holiness in some of the saints on earth, has a damping power with it. The 
    very sight of one that convincingly walks close with God, is enough to 
    strike a damp on the heart of a loose professor or apostate. How much more 
    may the sight of infinite holiness strike the most spiritual saints to the 
    ground! Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That the best carry a sinful nature even up into the 
    mount with them. Paul, enrapt up to the third heavens, brought a sinful 
    nature down with him again, an evidence he had carried it up, 2 Corinthians 
    12:7. Look on yourself, O saint! in your nearest approaches, and you will 
    see the humbling sight, a sinful heart, life, and lips, Isaiah 64:6; sin 
    woven into your very nature, and mixed with your flesh and blood, making a 
    vile body, Philippians 3:21; sunk into the marrow of your spirit, and 
    diffused through your whole soul. And then can you cease to say, as in 
    Lamentations 3:22, "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, 
    because his compassions fail not." Is it not a wonder of grace, that Hell, 
    so near Heaven, has not sunk with its own weight? Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That sinful creatures never miss to leave the marks of 
    their foul feet, even when they are on holy ground. Romans 7:21 "I find then 
    a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me." Peter falls 
    a-roving even on the mount, Luke 9:33. Even in the greatest light which ever 
    shone about the saints, they never wrote a line so fair, but there was a 
    blot in it. The sacrifices were carried up to the mount with the nobles, for 
    God knew they would need them even there. And if you will look back to your 
    carriage, when at a communion table, you will see such mismanagements, as 
    may make you wonder that he laid not his hand upon you. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">4. The particular jealousy which God has manifested about 
    his worship. Therefore Joshua told the people, chapter 24:19, "You cannot 
    serve the Lord: for he is a holy God: he is a jealous God: he will not 
    forgive your transgressions, nor your sins." And he himself declared, "he 
    would be sanctified in them that come near him, and before all the people he 
    will be glorified," Leviticus 10:3. And upon this he wrote a commentary, 
    with flaming evidence, in the blood of Nadab and Abihu, even two of these on 
    whom he laid not his hand at this time. A slip in the holy ground is most 
    dangerous and provoking in its own nature. To affront a king in his palace, 
    his presence-chamber, or on his throne, stirs up his anger with a peculiar 
    keenness. How dear did the men of Bethshemesh pay for a look, 1 Samuel 6:19; 
    Uzzah, for a touch, 2 Samuel 6:6, 7; Ananias and Sapphira, for a word, Acts 
    5. Now, who is able to stand before the piercing eye of his jealousy? Is it 
    not a wonder of his grace, that the fire of his indignation burns not up 
    sinful creatures in their solemn approaches to him? Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">5. That there is a solemn awfulness about the very 
    ordinances of grace, which the sinner could not bear if he were not 
    supported, Daniel 10:8, 9–19. Psalm 68:35, "O God! you are terrible out of 
    your holy places." Jacob understood this when he had one of the most 
    comfortable sights which ever mortal had: Genesis 28:17, "And he was afraid, 
    and said, How dreadful is this place! This is none other but the house of 
    God, and this is the gate of Heaven." The very throne of grace stands on 
    justice and judgment, which are its habitation, Psalm 89:14. (Hebrew, its 
    base); the covenant founded on blood, the blood of his own Son. All our 
    mercies from the throne are dyed red in the blood of a Mediator. You can not 
    have a gracious look from the throne, but through the Redeemer's wounds; nor 
    a pardon, but what is written with his blood. So that such sights are 
    sufficient to make one faint away, if they are not supported by grace. 
    Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, That the emanations of the divine glory would 
    overwhelm sinners, burst the earthen vessels, if a gracious God did not 
    graciously support them. Some have felt this, when they have been made to 
    cry to the Lord to hold his hand, for the earthen pitchers were able to hold 
    no more. We know not what spirit we are of. It is our mercy we see but 
    through a glass darkly, and not face to face now; for flesh and blood cannot 
    inherit the kingdom of God, 1 Corinthians 15:50. The flesh and blood of a 
    giant would not be able to bear that glory now. And therefore, it is 
    observed as an instance of his goodness, Job 26:9, "He holds back the face 
    of his throne, and spreads his cloud upon it."</p>
<p align="justify">We now go on,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To explain how it comes to pass that the safety of 
    God's people, when thus favored, is secured. It is so,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because they are God's covenant-people by marriage 
    with his Son. They are married to Christ, and the Son of the Father's bosom 
    is their husband. He has all freedom in his Father's house, and so it cannot 
    be a strange house to them. Where he sits, his spouse may stand safely at 
    his hand: Psalm 45:9, "Upon your right hand did stand the queen in gold of 
    Ophir." They have freedom in the house of God, in the right of their 
    Husband. He has brought them up into his chariot of the covenant; and this 
    has access to drive up into the mount, while it procures all safety to those 
    who are in it, "being paved with love," Song 3:9, 10.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because they come up under the covert of the 
    Redeemer's blood, Hebrews 12:22–24. By faith, they have the atoning 
    sacrifice , whereby God is atoned, and becomes their friend, Romans 3:25. 
    The flesh of a slain Savior is a sufficient screen from divine wrath, and 
    his red garments from the canopy under which they may safely feast while on 
    the mount. Their safety is secured,</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because God looks on them as in his own Son, and not 
    as in themselves; and so after a sort he overlooks their infirmities: 
    Numbers 23:21, "He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he seen 
    perverseness in Israel." He looked on them in Adam, their first 
    representative, and so drove them out of his presence; but now he looks upon 
    them in Christ as their head, and so brings them in again. And, O! but they 
    look fair in him, each one resembles the son of a king. In Jesus they are 
    complete, Colossians 2:10; Song 4:7, "You are all fair, my love; there is no 
    spot in you." They are safe,</p>
<p align="justify">4. Because, though they be unclean creatures, they come 
    up into the mount, to bathe in the fountain opened there, for sin and for 
    impurity, Zechariah 13:1. They come to the blood of sprinkling. A physician 
    will not drive away his patient, because his running sores drop in his 
    chamber. I will bear with this, says he, for the poor man has come to get 
    himself healed. Their safety is secured,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Because it is the end of the covenant, to bring 
    them to God. Jacob might well promise himself to see Joseph, when the wagons 
    were come from him for that very end, to bring him to him, Genesis 45:27, 
    28. The covenant looks very very low, as low as the earth, to secure the 
    believer's daily bread, Isaiah 33:16. Nay, in the affections of the earth, 
    to bring forth his dead body, moldered in ashes: "I am the God of Abraham." 
    Nay, as low as Hell: "And you have delivered my soul from the lowest Hell," 
    Psalm 86:13. And it looks very high, to bring the believer up into the midst 
    of the mount of enjoyment with God in ordinances, nay, to the top of the 
    mount, to bring them to where the Lord of glory dwells, where they shall see 
    him as he is: Isaiah 33:17, "Your eyes shall see the King in his beauty: 
    they shall behold the land that is very far off."</p>
<p align="justify">It only remains, that,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. We make some improvement of this subject.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Let us, then, never more think lightly of solemn 
    approaches to God, whether in private or in public ordinances. O! it is sad 
    to think of our rashness in venturing on holy duties, not considering that 
    in these we put ourselves in the awful presence of God: Ecclesiastes 5:1, 
    "Keep your foot when you go into the house of God, and be more ready to hear 
    than to give the sacrifice of fools." Whenever we are to go to God, we 
    should consider where we are going, put off our shoes, for the place is 
    holy. Were we thus frequently exercised, we would have more access to God in 
    our ordinary approaches.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Let this commend Christ and the covenant to us, 
    especially to those who stand off from him and his covenant. It is in the 
    Mediator the sinner may meet with God in peace; for Jesus is our peace, 
    Ephesians 2:14. It is within the bond of the covenant, he is safe from 
    avenging wrath. There is no safety without it, God will be a consuming fire 
    to all who live and die out of Christ and the covenant.</p>
<p align="justify">Hearken, you careless spectators, and be wise at length. 
    Are you resolved to have no part in Christ and the covenant, that you keep 
    so far from the place of his feet, and the seal of his covenant. Consider, 
    you also must come before God. You must die and come before the tribunal. 
    Could you secure yourselves a place to be mere onlookers, when the rest of 
    the world are dying about you; and when the world shall stand before the 
    judgment-seat, then perhaps you might be allowed to be mere spectators on 
    such an occasion as this. But it will not be so. You must take your part 
    with the rest. And what will it be to get the first sight of your Judge 
    then, with whom you might have been accepted, but would not? Consider, if it 
    be a matter of such awful solemnity to approach the throne of grace, what 
    will it be to stand before the throne of avenging justice? If it be so 
    solemn to come up into mount Zion, where communion is to be had with God in 
    Christ, what will it be to come to mount Sinai, where there is such 
    blackness, darkness, and tempest, as will confound the adversaries of the 
    Lord? Bless not yourselves that you have not gone up into the mount, for 
    monuments of justice you shall be, if you be not thus monuments of 
    grace.—Consider, what madness is it to lift up the heel against God, the 
    weight of whose hand can crash you as a moth. Would it not be your wisdom to 
    lie down among the dust of his feet, to approach him through his Son, and in 
    the way of his covenant, trembling, if so be that he may be pleased to 
    stretch out the golden scepter, and save your life? Nay, come forward yet, 
    strive to take hold of an offered Christ and covenant. Let not his terrors 
    deter you from him As the lepers at the gate of Samaria did, so reason you.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Let us praise him for this, that upon us he has not 
    laid his hand; that we have not left a name to the place, Perez, from the 
    Lord's making a breach upon us; but that we may set up a pillar here, and 
    call it Ebenezer. There has been strange fire offered to the Lord here this 
    day; wrong touches given to the ark; unworthy communicating, faithless, 
    fearless, stupid, confused, and hypocritical managements; who dare say they 
    have made no stumble on the mount? The bread and wine in the sacrament have 
    as deep relative holiness as the ark had; but had spectators and 
    communicants been taken up as hot for their profane looking to the one, as 
    the men of Bethshemesh were for their looking to the other, there had been a 
    sad sight among us before now. Glory be to our gracious God, that on us he 
    has not laid his hand.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Let us long for that day which will put an end to our 
    sinfulness, weakness, and imperfection, when we shall see him as he is, 
    without any danger of sinning or suffering, which is far better, Philippians 
    1:23. It would be a token for good that we had seen the Lord, if we were now 
    longing for that blessed day.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Let us apply ourselves to the duties which a 
    gracious God calls for at our hands.—And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Is there any among us who have been admitted to a holy 
    familiarity with God? Song 1:4. Then,—Wonder at the freeness of grace, and 
    be thankful that ever the like of you should have come so far forward; 2 
    Samuel 7:18, "Who am I, O Lord God! and what is my house, that you have 
    brought me hitherto?"—Double your watch, and walk very softly, being careful 
    to keep your nearness, Song 3:5; Isaiah 38:15.—If there be any special 
    errand to the throne for yourselves, or for the church of God, as no doubt 
    there is, strike in with this golden opportunity, and lay it before the 
    Lord, Exodus 24:8, 9.—Beware of being proud of your attainments. There is a 
    hazard here; but when you see your peacock-feathers, remember they are 
    borrowed, and look to your black feet, 2 Corinthians 12:7.—Lay your account 
    with a storm, and be on your guard. If you have got a larger meal than 
    others, it is not unlike you have more to do than they. But accept that 
    kindly, and bless God who is beforehand with you, laying in the provision 
    before he lays on the burden.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Is there any among us who have seen the God of Israel? 
    Then walk as becomes those who have beheld his glory. Blessed are your eyes, 
    for they see. But here some may say, Alas! this sight has been withheld from 
    my eyes.—In answer to such, I observe, that some saying this, no doubt speak 
    true; others belie the working of God's grace towards them. Therefore we 
    must put it to the trial; for one may get a sight of Christ, and not know 
    that it is he, John 20:14; Luke 24:16. I ask you, then, what effect on you 
    has the sight which you have got this day?—Has this day's sight humbled you 
    more, made you more vile and loathsome in your own eyes, filled you with 
    shame and blushing, and self-loathing? It is a sign you have seen the Lord, 
    Job 42:5, 6.—Has it weaned you more from the world, sunk the value of all 
    created excellency with you, made you see through the bulky vanity of the 
    world, that you are resolved you shall feed no more on these husks? Matthew 
    13:45, 46. Revelation 12:1.—Has it made the body of sin and death heavier 
    than it used to be?—May be some of you think, you have been undone at this 
    communion with an ill heart, that drew a veil between Christ and you; and 
    now you are crying, Romans 7:24, "O wretched man that I am! who shall 
    deliver me from the body of this death?" O to be quit of this burden at any 
    rate! O to be beyond a sinning condition! welcome grim death, so that it 
    would take off the burden. Truly, if it be so, it has been so thin a vail, 
    that you have got a sight of Christ through it, Isaiah 6:5; Luke 2:29, 
    30.—Has it kindled a superlative love in your own heart to this unseen Lord? 
    Do you love him more than all persons and things else? Psalm 73:25. If it be 
    so, you have seen him, Luke 24:32. Sick of love, argues a blink of the face 
    of the lovely one received. Therefore, bless God, and be thankful. It is 
    bastard humility to belie the grace of God. Walk so as the world may take 
    notice that you have seen what they never saw, and have been where their 
    ungracious feet never carried them. And show this in personal and relative 
    holiness, Acts 4:13. Commend the way of God to others. Tell them it is good 
    to be on the mount. Speak good of God's house, and give it your testimony, 
    before despisers of Christ and ordinances; especially before poor 
    discouraged sinners, those who desert ordinances, alleging God not to be 
    found in them.—Finally, quench not the Spirit, cherish his motions, and 
    follow on to know the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">3. You who have made this solemn approach, but really 
    have not seen the Lord, set you about your proper duty.—Search out, mourn 
    over the cause of this, and quickly flee to the blood of Christ for its 
    removal. You have not seen the Lord; and is there not a cause? yes, sure he 
    has a quarrel with you, and therefore has withdrawn himself. Seek it out. 
    The fault has been either in your state, that you are yet in the gall of 
    bitterness and the bond of iniquity. This is a fundamental mistake. Or it 
    has been in your frame. Either you have not been at pains to prepare, or 
    have sat down on your preparation; or some idol of jealousy has been 
    nourished—or it has been in your faithless management. Wonder you in a 
    special manner, that you have come off safe, and that upon you the Lord has 
    not laid his hand. Do not fret that you are come off with nothing; but, O 
    bless him that you are come off at all!</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Go back to the throne with all speed. Though the 
    communion-table be drawn here, it is not yet drawn to you in Heaven; Joel 
    3:21, "For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed; for the Lord 
    dwells in Zion." Follow on to know the Lord. Be not like the mixed 
    multitude, who, disappointed of the milk and honey of Canaan, would needs go 
    back to the onions and the garlic in Egypt. If you do so, his soul will 
    abhor you: Hebrews 10:38, "If any man draw back, my soul shall have no 
    pleasure in him." Say not, I will never see the Lord now: for, wherefore has 
    he spared you, but that you might have occasion to have your marred work 
    amended? And if you wait on long, wonder not, it is a mercy you have access 
    to wait on. Lay down the resolution in Lamentations 3:49, 50, "My eye 
    trickles down, and ceases not, without intermission, until the Lord look 
    down, and behold from Heaven;" and in Isaiah 8:17, "I will wait upon the 
    Lord that hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him." 
    Amen.</p>
