    Matthew 20:6, "Why do you stand here idle all day?"</p>
<p align="justify">IN the beginning of this chapter, Christ spoke a parable 
    concerning the kingdom of Heaven, the scope of which is to show, that those 
    who, by conceit of themselves and their actings for God, do place themselves 
    among the first and chief favorites of Heaven, shall be rejected of God, and 
    treated as the last; they shall receive the last of Heaven's favors; while 
    they who, through a feeling sense of unworthiness, dare not make such 
    advances, shall be brought forward from among the last, where they placed 
    themselves, and advanced to the first rank, where they shall be placed of 
    God, who gives Heaven as a gift to them that do not plead for it as a debt. 
    This is plain from the occasion and conclusion of this parable: the vineyard 
    is the church; the householder is Christ, whose vineyard it is; his going 
    out at several hours is the call of the gospel at several times, coming to 
    some sooner, to others later; the market-place is wherever the gospel comes. 
    Our text is a pithy expostulation with those that are standing there idle, 
    even at the eleventh hour, within an hour of sun-set; according to that, 
    "Are there not twelve hours in the day?" They are idle, in so far as they 
    are not taken up about their work for eternity. Our text, you see, is a 
    close application; the nature of this day's work requires it; and I hope you 
    will not think we misapply it, if we apply it to you. Every word in it has 
    its particular weight.—The following inquiries are suggested from it.</p>
<p align="justify">I. Why are you "idle?" What reason can you give for your 
    being idle?</p>
<p align="justify">II. Why are "you" idle, more than some others?</p>
<p align="justify">III. Why do you "stand"  idle?</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Why "here" idle?</p>
<p align="justify">V. Why idle in the "day?"</p>
<p align="justify">VI. Why idle "all the day?"</p>
<p align="justify">We shall attend to these inquiries in their order.</p>
<p align="justify">I. Why are you "idle?" If you deny the charge, there are 
    two things at least, which must be yielded to by most, if not all of us.</p>
<p align="justify">1. You have been very busy doing nothing; but it is 
    better, they say, to be idle than doing nothing. What is it that most of us 
    are busy about, but nothing? Proverbs 23:5, "Will you set your eyes upon 
    that which is not, for riches certainly make themselves wings, they fly away 
    as an eagle towards Heaven;" that which is nothing for our souls, nothing 
    for a blessed eternity. Indeed man is a laborious creature; the life of the 
    greatest sluggard is a continued succession of actions; the soul of man is 
    like a watch that goes as fast when it goes wrong, as when it goes right. 
    But, alas! laborious idleness and solemn trifling in the vanities of this 
    world, is but a pitiful way of spending a man's life, which is but a short 
    time of trial, in order to an unalterable state.</p>
<p align="justify">2. You have been very busy doing worse than nothing; like 
    these, 2 Thessalonians 3:11, "For we hear that there are some which walk 
    among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busy bodies." Alas! most 
    of our lives are ill parted between two; one is spent in weaving the 
    spider's web, the other in hatching the cockatrice eggs, Isaiah 59:5; either 
    spent in nothing, or worse than nothing; either sitting still or making more 
    progress hell-ward: either letting the separation wall stand as before, or 
    building it higher and stronger. But there is one thing that cannot be 
    yielded, at least to the most part of this generation; that is, that they 
    are busy in their great work. No, no; idleness in this respect is the 
    epidemic disease of the day, under which both professors and profane are 
    pining away. For your conviction in this, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. What else means the lean souls among us? Solomon tells 
    us, Proverbs 19:15, "An idle soul shall suffer hunger," and Proverbs 13:4, 
    "The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing; but the soul of the 
    diligent shall he made fat." We may take up that lamentation, Isaiah 24:16, 
    "But I said My leanness, my leanness." Alas! for the many rickety children 
    of the church this day, with their big heads, and lean slender bodies, who 
    are puffed up with their knowledge, but are yet to learn the elements of 
    practical godliness and experimental religion.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. The little desire there is among us after the heavenly 
    rest: Job tells us, chapter 7:2, "A servant earnestly desires the shadow, 
    and an hireling looks for the reward of his work;" so if we were not idle, 
    we would be more desirous of that rest that remains for the people of God. 
    But I fear, if I would speak agreeable to their consciences, they would say, 
    that the Turks' paradise would fit their desires better than the heavenly 
    rest. It was the language of a profane. Cardinal, I would quit my part of 
    paradise for present enjoyment; so no doubt many would quit their part of 
    Heaven on lower terms, for they only desire Heaven, because they love not to 
    go to Hell. They care not for the heavenly rest, because they trouble not 
    themselves with the work meet for heaven.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">3. The little appetite after our spiritual food. The 
    laboring man's work makes him find his stomach, and the Christian labor 
    would make men prize the table covered to them in ordinances. The ordinances 
    are greatly slighted this day, it is lamentable to think how little they are 
    regarded. It is only in the Lord's hand to cure it, by filling folk's hands 
    with heart-work about their soul's case. It is this that would readily make 
    them eager of help.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, What else means the rank poverty, and rotten 
    rags, which is all the portion of many souls? Revelation 3:17, "And know 
    not, that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked." 
    How many are there, who are the genuine offspring of the serpent! on their 
    belly do they go, and dust is their meat; they feed on nothing but the husks 
    of created comforts, with which the devil feeds his herds; as for communion 
    with God, and sense of his love, they know no more of them than if they had 
    immortal souls for no other end than to keep their bodies from rotting. They 
    go up and down in the rage of their profanity, and lusts, like so many 
    ghosts in their grave-clothes, busy in nothing but dead works.</p>
<p align="justify">I inquire, then, why are you idle?</p>
<p align="justify">1. Is it because you have nothing to do? Truly, you have 
    very much.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) You have your salvation-work upon your hand: 
    Philippians 2:12, "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling." Many 
    have never begun that work yet; many that have seemed to have began, are at 
    a stand with it now. You were born children of wrath, under the curse of the 
    first covenant; what are you doing to get free from the wrath to come? There 
    is a harden of guilt lying on you, what are you doing to get it off? Divers 
    living lasts hanging about you, what are you doing to mortify them? Is there 
    any time to be idle, while that work is not wrought out? Salvation-work is 
    weighty work, for damnation-work is very terrible; you have that to undo 
    that you have been doing. You have been weaving your life into one web of 
    sin, and you have it to open out again into self-examination, repentance, 
    and bitter mourning.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) You have your generation-work to attend upon: Acts 
    13:36, "For David, after he had served his own generation, by the will of 
    God fell asleep." God made you, and sustains you: some of you in higher, 
    others in lower stations; what have you done for God, what service to your 
    generation? The sun, moon, and stars are useful in their several places; 
    plants, yes, and beasts, are all useful. For what use are you in the world? 
    for Him who set you there, and to those he has set you among? Assure 
    yourself, God will call you to answer that question. I fear most of us have 
    that work to begin yet.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Do you think you will get sleeping to Heaven, and that 
    your short-winded wishes for mercy will secure you from the wrath of God? 
    Proverbs 13:4, "The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing." No; you 
    most "so run that you may obtain." Take the kingdom by force; strive, 
    wrestle, else you are ruined; deceive not yourselves, as if you would just 
    make a slip of it, out of Delilah's lap into Abraham's bosom. You will find 
    it a leap out of that bed of sloth into a bed of fire and brimstone, where 
    you will lie down in eternal sorrow, if you do not seasonably bound to your 
    feet, and put hand to your great work.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Do you think the devil is as idle about your souls as 
    you are? No; though you cannot creep out of your bed of sloth, the devil is 
    going about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour; though you will 
    be at no tolerable pains to secure your salvation, he will spare no pains to 
    secure your damnation. Sleep you, or wake you, Satan is at your right hand; 
    and if you be not rowing against the stream, he will carry you down the 
    stream, until he have you in the ocean of God's wrath, where you will never 
    see the shore.—The second inquiry is,</p>
<p align="justify">II. Why are "you" idle, while others are gone to work in 
    the Lord's vineyard? Why do you sit still, while others are fleeing from the 
    wrath to come? Why are you sleeping, while others are wrestling with God as 
    for their bare life? Why are you dressing, eating, and drinking, while 
    others, moved with fear, are preparing an ark against the day of wrath in 
    these lands, and in the world.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Is it because the work in the vineyard is too coarse 
    for your fine fingers? John 7:48," Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees 
    believed on him? but this people that knows not the law is accursed." It is 
    lamentable to think how religion is almost grown out of fashion among the 
    fashionable people of this degenerate age; and shocking to see with what 
    contempt some look on seriousness about soul matters, resolving that these 
    silly people as they call them, shall for them enjoy their folly alone. 
    Certainly these men would never have taken their name from one crucified 
    between two thieves, if it had not been the religion of their country. But 
    these that are wise in heart think differently, and glory in the cross of 
    Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Is it because you have another thing to do? Many in 
    our day are of Pharaoh's opinion indeed, that religion is only for them that 
    have no other thing ado. You are idle; but for them they have their families 
    and farms, &amp;c., to look after. But, man, have you not an immortal soul to 
    look after, as well as others? They said of Herod, It is better to be his 
    swine than his son. I am sure, many a man's soul may say to him, Well is 
    your beasts, in comparison of me; for one thought that is spent on my case, 
    there is ten on theirs.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Are not you by nature under the wrath and curse of 
    God, as well as others? Yes; Ephesians 2:3, "And were by nature the children 
    of wrath, even as others:" and therefore let me say to you as the penitent 
    thief to his fellow, Luke 23:40, "Do you not fear God, seeing you are in the 
    same condemnation?" Better go to Heaven with a few, through all the labors 
    of the Christian life, than to slide away to Hell, at your own ease, with 
    the multitude; better weep now, than weep eternally, for it will be no 
    comfort to go to Hell with company.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Will you be content to see the laborers set with 
    Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and yourselves, with the fellow-loiterers, shut 
    out? you must either set to their work now, or you will see your doom at 
    length, digest it as you will.—I now inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">III. Why stand you "idle?" Have you put on a whore's 
    forehead, and refuse to be ashamed? It would set you better to hide your 
    head, as ashamed in that you take up room in the world to no good purpose, 
    living in a shameful neglect of your own souls, and the great end of your 
    creation, which was not to sleep away a lifetime on the earth, nor to stand 
    like a barren tree in God's vineyard, drawing away the sap from others, but 
    to glorify God by acting to and for him.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Why then stand you idle in the sight of men? Have you 
    a mind to tell the world, that go to God's vineyard who will, you have no 
    mind to stir? embrace God and his service who will, you will have nothing to 
    do with him, nor it neither? Are you afraid you want witnesses to stand 
    against you before the tribunal of God, to testify how little you valued the 
    working the works of God? The groans of those that warned you to your work, 
    that were grieved at your licentious lives, will witness against you; nay, 
    the stones and timber will cry out of the walls within which you live 
    against you, and witness how little God was in all your thoughts, how little 
    you ever wrestled with God about your soul's case, and how the prayer, when 
    you made it, has died in your mouths.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Why stand you idle in the sight of the all-seeing God, 
    who set you down in this world to work your great work? There are many that 
    seem to be diligent workers, but God knows them to be mere idlers; what they 
    work is before men, but their vineyard in the inclosure of their breasts is 
    all overgrown with weeds, and they are at no pains to pluck them up. Have 
    you bid a defiance to the great Master, whose eyes are upon you in secret, 
    as well as in public, that sees your heart, as well as your outward 
    conversation? Be sure, he will call you to account.—The inquiry, next, is,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Why stand you "here" idle, even in the market-place, 
    where the great Master has been often calling whom he found here, and you 
    among others, to go and work in his vineyard? and you had not been standing 
    here idle, if you had been willing to work.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Why stand you here idle, in a land of gospel light? 
    Isaiah 26:10, "In the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will 
    not behold the majesty of the Lord?" If you will serve the devil and your 
    lusts, why do you not go to the dark places of the earth, and work your 
    works of darkness there? but why must they be brought forth in the face of 
    the sun? why here, in this covenanted land, a land under the sacred bond of 
    solemn covenant to the work of holiness, and the means of holiness; a bond 
    which neither the breaking nor burning of them could loose; and they had 
    never met with that treatment, had not men been as great enemies to piety as 
    to Presbytery. But I dare say, there is no land where men must buy their 
    ease at so dear a rate as in Scotland.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Why here, where the Lord is in a special manner 
    calling you to work, setting up his standard, and is about to cover a table 
    for his laborers? will you be idle spectators, while Christ is to be 
    sacramentally crucified before your eyes? will you be idle here, where the 
    Lord is in a special manner calling you to search and try yourselves? If you 
    will stand here idle, it will be a new item, in great letters, in the 
    accounts of the despisers of Christ, and slighters of the power of godliness 
    in Yarrow.—I may once more inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">V. Why stand you idle in the "day?" The day brings with 
    it a call to work, though indeed it is the time when the wild beasts enter 
    into their dens, and lie at their ease, Psalm 102:22, 23. But better to be a 
    beast, than to be like a beast; they that sleep, sleep in the night; but 
    what shall we say of them that cannot be got awakened, even in the day?</p>
<p align="justify">1. Then why are you idle, when you have a day to work in? 
    No wonder our forefathers were idle, when they were enrapt up in the 
    midnight darkness of Paganism and Popery; but though it was night with them, 
    it is day with us; the sun of the gospel is arisen above our horizon, it has 
    been long up, and will you be idle in the day? God has not only set up the 
    candle of conscience within you, but has made the sun of the gospel to arise 
    and shine without you, to call you to work, and to let you see to work: 
    Titus 2:11, 12, "For the grace of God, that brings salvation, has appeared 
    to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we 
    should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world." Such a 
    day idled away will make a dreadful night!</p>
<p align="justify">2. Why are you idle, when you have but a day to work in? 
    John 9:4, "The night comes when no man can work." It is today, if you will 
    hear his voice. The time of your life, and the season of grace, is but a 
    day, and that day will soon be over; there is no working in the grave, 
    Ecclesiastes 9:10. The candle burnt to snuff cannot be lighted again, and 
    time once gone can never be recalled; God will not turn night to day, to let 
    the sluggard see to work, who turned his day to night. Now, when you have 
    but a day, will you idle it away? You will, it may be, count it rather by 
    years yet to come; but sure I am, the Spirit of God never learned you that 
    way of counting: James 4:14, "Whereas you know not what shall be on the 
    morrow; for what is your life? it is even a vapor, that appears for a little 
    time, and then vanishes away." Psalm 39:5, "Behold, you have made my days as 
    an hand-breadth, and mine age is as nothing before thee."—I shall only 
    inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">VI. Why are you idle "all the day?" Will no less than all 
    the day serve? May not the time past suffice? Is it not high time now at 
    length to awake? Is it not the eleventh hour with many of you? and the 
    youngest here knows not but they may be in the last hour of their day. And 
    are you not afraid your glass run out before your work be done? Sure it 
    looks very like the very last hour of this church and nation's day: we have 
    had a long day, but now we may say, Jeremiah 6:4, "Woe unto us, for the day 
    goes away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out." We are 
    threatened with a dreadful eclipse of gospel-light, and a dark night, and we 
    may well conclude as to many of us, that our eyes will never see the 
    breaking of the day again.</p>
<p align="justify">As the practical improvement of this subject, I Shall 
    only call on you to ponder seriously in your mind, the important inquiries 
    addressed to you;—to pose your consciences closely with them as in the sight 
    of God,—to profit by the instructive lessons afforded from them;—and, in 
    short, that you study a being diligent in business, fervent in spirit, 
    always serving the Lord.</p>
