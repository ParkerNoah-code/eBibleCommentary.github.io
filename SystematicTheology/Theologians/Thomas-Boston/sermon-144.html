    Admission into Sinner's Hearts<br/>

<p align="justify">Ettrick, June 24, 1716</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Psalm 24:9 "Lift up your heads, O gates; even lift them 
    up, O everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in."</p>
<p align="justify">THIS psalm is judged to have been composed when David 
    brought up the ark from the house of Obed Edom to mount Zion, 2 Samuel 4 
    chapter to be sung on that occasion, and others like it, particularly on the 
    bringing of the ark into the temple, which was afterwards to be built, to 
    which the Psalmist seems here, by the spirit of prophecy, to have a special 
    reference.</p>
<p align="justify">The ark was a type of Christ, and so this psalm concerns 
    him. The sum of it is, that though all the world be the Lord's, yet the 
    church is his in a peculiar manner; for there, and in his people, he dwells 
    and all ought to receive him. It was sung by the Jews ordinarily on the 
    first day of the week, which is now the Christian Sabbath, and the matter of 
    it is very agreeable to the Sabbath, being the day in which Christ solemnly 
    demands admission into the hearts of the hearers of the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">In the words there are two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Entrance solemnly demanded, Lift up your heads, O you 
    gates. Where consider, to whom the demand is directed. Some read the words, 
    Lift up your gates, O princes or heads. Accordingly, some understand it of 
    Christ's ascension into Heaven, taking the gates for those of Heaven, the 
    princes for the angels. Others, namely, some Papists, understand it of 
    Christ's descending into Hell, taking the gates for those of Hell, the 
    princes for the devils. But as there is no ground for this reading, the 
    interpretation as built upon it falls to the ground.</p>
<p align="justify">The demand is figuratively directed to the gates, a thing 
    very natural in a joyful solemnity, especially in a song. But the Ark, 
    Tabernacle, and Temple being all typical, this doubtless, has a compound 
    sense, literal and mystical.</p>
<p align="justify">Literally, by the gates are meant, the gates of the 
    temple, which though it was not built in David's time, yet it was designed 
    to be built, on the place to which the ark was now brought, namely in the 
    mount. Everlasting doors they are called, because the temple was a fixed 
    dwelling for the ark, whereas the tabernacle was removed from place to 
    place.</p>
<p align="justify">Mystically, the temple was a type of Heaven, and if on 
    this account these words be applied to Christ's ascension, (so several of 
    the Fathers understand them) I will not contend. But it was also a type of 
    the church, and the ark's dwelling in the temple was the symbol of the 
    divine presence among the Jews. And so by the gates are meant the hearts of 
    sinners to whom the gospel comes, according to that, Revelation 3:20, 
    'Behold I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open 
    the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." 
    These are the everlasting doors, both because of the immortality of the 
    soul, and because when Christ once comes into them he never departs. This 
    was aimed at in that call at the entrance of the ark, for there is not a 
    word here of the ark, but of the King of glory. Namely, that, as they 
    received the ark into the temple, so they should open their hearts to 
    receive Christ into their souls.</p>
<p align="justify">The thing demanded is, "that the gates lift up their 
    heads, also that the everlasting doors be lifted up." From top to bottom 
    they must be thrown wide open that there may be a spacious entrance. This 
    for the greater solemnity, in the bringing of the ark. It indicates a most 
    hearty willingness in embracing of Christ and receiving him into the soul. 
    It is expressed two ways. The first seems to belong to saints who are to be 
    active in it. Lift up your heads, O you gates! Do it of your own accord, 
    willingly, for our Lord will not force his entrance. But in the day of his 
    power he can make the iron gates fly open. Accordingly the second seems to 
    belong to sinners, who are passively to be lifted up. For sinners cannot 
    open their own hearts, but a power goes along with the command.</p>
<p align="justify">The demand is made literally by the priests, who bare the 
    ark into the temple; mystically, by the ministers of the gospel, who are 
    sent to demand access for their Master into the hearts of sinners; or 
    whatever instrument our Lord uses to prepare his way.</p>
<p align="justify">The demand is doubled. To show Christ's willingness and 
    earnestness to get admission. It also intimates the aversion of sinners to 
    admit him, and the vast importance and consequence of the matter.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The person for whom admission is demanded. It is for 
    the King of glory. He is a King, even King Jesus, typified by the ark. It is 
    a solemn entry such as a king makes in state into a city. He comes in, not 
    only a guest to abide with sinners, but as a King to rule all. He is not 
    only a King, but "the King of glory. Which none of the princes of this world 
    knew, for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of 
    glory." He is a glorious King in himself, and the purchaser of eternal glory 
    for his people. The first is here chiefly meant.</p>
<p align="justify">Assurance is given that he will enter if admitted. The 
    gates shall not be opened for nothing. He will not stand without, unless he 
    be kept out. He is represented as a victorious King making a triumphant 
    entry.</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine 1. Where the ark of gospel ordinances comes, 
    Christ himself comes to the door of the hearts of sinners for admission. The 
    ark's coming to the temple is the King of glory's coming to the hearts of 
    sinners. Now there is no more an ark, but gospel ordinances have succeeded 
    it and have the same use. And this is the call to go along with them to the 
    end of the word.</p>
<p align="justify">In speaking from this doctrine, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Inquire what is the ark of gospel ordinances.</p>
<p align="justify">II. How Christ comes along with this ark to the doors of 
    the hearts of sinners.</p>
<p align="justify">I. We are to inquire what is the ark of gospel 
    ordinances. The ark was the most holy of all the Old Testament ordinances. 
    It was the chief thing in the most holy place, where God was in a special 
    manner present, sitting between the cherubim. From this place he gave 
    answers, and on that account the most holy place was called the oracle. The 
    place for the ark, was the oracle of the house, the most holy place, even 
    under the wings of the cherubim. From this we may gather that there are two 
    things which may come under the name of the gospel ark.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The word read and preached. The holy scriptures are 
    the oracle of God. From them we have a clearer discovery of the mind of God, 
    than what was given from the Jewish ark. And the gospel, as purely preached, 
    after the reformation from popery, is called the appearing of the ark of his 
    testament. "For the temple of God was opened in Heaven, and there was seen 
    in his temple the ark of the testament."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The holy sacrament, baptism and the Lord's supper. 
    These are really sacred symbols of the divine presence as truly as ever the 
    ark was. Some divines say, the ark was called Jehovah, Numbers 16:35. But 
    that is certainly too much. It is God himself whose name alone is Jehovah. 
    The greatest honor put upon it in the scripture seems to be in these words 
    of Joshua, "Behold, said he, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the 
    earth passes over before you into Jordan." But as to the sacrament of the 
    supper, it is nothing short whatever it be more. This, said our Lord, "is my 
    body broken for you. And this cup is the new testament in my blood."</p>
<p align="justify">Consider, that wherever the ark came, the places were 
    made holy. The places, said Solomon, are holy, whereunto the ark of the Lord 
    has come. And what are the means of bringing holiness into any place of the 
    unholy world, but the word and sacraments. These bring light into the dark 
    places of the earth, and set up a kingdom for Christ, where the devil had 
    ruled all before. The ark was the special dwelling place of God upon earth. 
    He dwelt between the cherubim, which overshadowed the ark, and it was that 
    by which he communicated himself to his people. And these ordinances are the 
    places of his special presence, from which he conveys his counsels, 
    comforts, and graces, to his people. His people's experience confirms this. 
    "The king is held in the galleries." We are now,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To inquire how Christ comes along with this ark, to 
    the doors of the hearts of sinners.</p>
<p align="justify">1. In the word, Christ comes in the offer of himself to 
    sinners. Wherever the gospel is preached, Christ is offered to sinners with 
    all his saving benefits. "Behold, says he, I stand at the door and knock, if 
    any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in and sup with him and 
    he with me." A market of free grace is opened and whoever will, is invited 
    to buy without money and without price. There are some places where the 
    market is not yet opened. Christ is not yet in their offer. There are other 
    places where the market is over, and the despisers of the gospel in these 
    are now gone to their place. But yet with us the market is still open, and 
    Christ comes to the door of our hearts for admission.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In the sacraments Christ is exhibited. There is not a 
    simple offer of him, as one may have of meat, which he sees not, as in the 
    word. But in them he is held forth to us, as meat set down upon a table 
    before a man, to eat, and welcome. "Take, eat, this is my body broken for 
    you." And does he not come near us then? He was sacrificed on the cross, and 
    in the supper the sacrifice is presented to the guests to feed upon 
    spiritually.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Both in word and in sacraments he demands admission. 
    He comes not to look at the door, but stands and knocks for admission, as 
    one that would have access. He would be admitted even into the place where 
    the strong man keeps house alone. He would be admitted farther where he has 
    had some access before. Saying, "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my 
    undefiled." For as we must always be coming to Christ, so always opening, 
    and opening, wider and wider, until he possess not only the whole man, but 
    possess him wholly without any rivals.</p>
<p align="justify">And thus you may see the truth of this point manifested. 
    The ministers of the gospel coming with the Lord's message to sinners, drive 
    not an empty chariot. For says Jesus to them, "Lo, I am with you always, 
    even unto the end of the world." He speaks by them, and so the great 
    business of salvation is transacted between Christ and sinners.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Use for information</p>
<p align="justify">Is it so, that where the ark of the gospel ordinances 
    comes, Christ comes to the door of sinners' hearts for admission? Then,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Seeing we have the ark of gospel ordinances among us, 
    be it known unto you, that Christ himself is come to the doors of your 
    hearts for admission. Many do not consider, nor believe that Christ is 
    knocking at the door of their hearts for admission, and therefore they do 
    not bestir themselves to receive him. But believe it, it is no fancy, but 
    the most certain reality, and therefore I say to you and to each of you: "To 
    you is the word of this salvation sent." Will you consider for the reality 
    of it, that there is no salvation without receiving Christ into our hearts. 
    "Which is Christ in you the hope of glory." He must dwell in all those now, 
    who shall dwell with him forever. "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by 
    faith." Where there is no union with Christ, there can be no communion with 
    him. And where there is no communion with him, there can be no holiness, no 
    grace, no peace, no pardon, no happiness.</p>
<p align="justify">As we cannot receive him unless he offer himself unto us, 
    so for what end are ordinances, if Christ come not to us in them, offering 
    himself to us. The way in which Christ dwells in the hearts of his people, 
    is by his spirit and by faith. Now the ordinances are the channels in which 
    the conveyance of his Spirit is made. "This only would I learn of you, 
    received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of 
    faith?" The ordinances also are the means of begetting and of increasing 
    faith. So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God." If 
    then they be the means of uniting us to Christ, he really comes in them for 
    entrance into our souls.</p>
<p align="justify">But farther, it is so real, that men will be really saved 
    by embracing Christ coming in to them by the ordinances, and really damned 
    for slighting him, coming to them in these. Jesus said to his disciples, "Go 
    into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature, he who believes 
    and is baptized shall be saved; but he who believes not shall be damned." He 
    who cannot see Christ in gospel ordinances, to close with him, will never 
    see him to his comfort in another world. Who are they that will be owned by 
    him at the last day? "Those that have made a covenant with him by sacrifice. 
    For it has pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that 
    believe." And who are they that will be disowned by him at the last day? 
    those who are without hope for another world. "But if our gospel be hid, it 
    is hidden to them that are lost; in whom the God of this world has blinded 
    the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of 
    Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The word and sacraments coming to a place, will highly 
    aggravate the condemnation of those that do not receive Christ into their 
    hearts. For where they come, there he is, whether he be received or not. 
    "And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men 
    loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil." Many a 
    time the ordinances seem to be in vain, and preaching in vain, but they are 
    not so. Be their success what it will, God's work is still going on for his 
    honor at the long run. "For as the rain comes down and the snow from Heaven, 
    and returns not thither, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and 
    bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater; so shall my 
    word be that goes forth out of my mouth; it shall not return to me void; but 
    it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing 
    whereto I sent it."</p>
<p align="justify">The ordinances will always be doing good to some. "O you 
    that are named the house of Jacob, is the Spirit of the Lord straitened? are 
    these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walks uprightly?" And 
    as many as are ordained to eternal life shall believe. Where Christ lights a 
    candle we may suppose there are some lost pieces to be found. Where Christ 
    covers a table, there will readily always be some of his children to feed.</p>
<p align="justify">As for others, neither will they be in vain. Where the 
    ark comes, the call is given, Lift up your heads, O you gates, and those 
    that keep their hearts still shut against Christ, are hereby rendered 
    inexcusable, and their condemnation aggravated. Their sin will be the 
    greater, "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but 
    now they have no cloak for their sin." The more frequent, and the more 
    solemn offers that are made to sinners, the greater is their contempt which 
    they pour upon the Son of God. And every sermon and every communion will add 
    to their account; so that I doubt not but many of us, if they hold on as 
    they are doing in slighting Christ and his ordinances, the day will come, in 
    which they will wish from their hearts, that they had never lived where 
    sermons and communions were to be heard and seen. And reflections on these 
    will cut them to the heart forever more.</p>
<p align="justify">Their condemnation and punishment will be greater. "But I 
    say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the 
    day of judgment than for you." In solemn appearances of the ark of God among 
    his people great things have been done in the experience of some. But that 
    makes a heavy reckoning to those who have no part nor lot in that matter; 
    that keep their hearts shut against Christ, while others are opening to him. 
    Of all vengeance that which follows a despised gospel is the most dreadful. 
    The fire that breaks out from the altar burns the most vehemently.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Use second, of Exhortation</p>
<p align="justify">Seeing you have the word preached and expect the 
    sacrament to be administered, remember that these are the gospel ark, by 
    which Christ comes to the hearts of sinners demanding admission.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Do not idolize the ark, but look beyond it to Jesus 
    Christ, to whom the ark directs you. This was the sin of the Israelites when 
    they brought the ark into the camp, in order that it might defend them from 
    their enemies. 1 Samuel 4:3. They thought that though they did not reform, 
    and repent, yet if they had the ark all would be well. But they were 
    deceived. Their unrepented of sins made them fall, and the ark could not 
    hold them up. So many please themselves in taking Christ's livery, though 
    they still remain Satan's slaves; in sitting down at the Lord's table though 
    strangers to communion with him; in getting a token from men and mixing 
    themselves with the saints, though they have no token, from the Master of 
    the feast. And so they cry, the temple of the Lord the temple of the Lord 
    are these! But O what will this avail them? The Lord "will say to them, I 
    tell you, I know not whence you are; depart from me, all you workers of 
    iniquity."</p>
<p align="justify">Look you then beyond the ark. Come into the inner court. 
    Be not satisfied with less than opening your hearts to receive the Lord of 
    the ark. Look beyond the sign to the thing signified, and pursue that. Break 
    through the shell, that you may come to the kernel. Otherwise you neither 
    answer the voice of Christ, nor the voice of your own necessities.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Do not undervalue the ark, but highly prize it. That 
    was Michal's sin. 2 Samuel 6:14. And it is the sin of many among us this 
    day, who will have nothing to do with the ark themselves, and if it be in 
    their power will be heavy to others that meddle with it. They pour contempt 
    upon the memorial of Christ's death, and one communion after another passes, 
    but they will not meddle with it, as if they were not concerned. But if they 
    can discern a fault in the conduct of a communicant, they will do it. They 
    will despise them on account of it, and the ordinance for them? But O! prize 
    the ark of the gospel ordinances. It is the most precious thing in the lower 
    world; and I dare say a gracious soul would rather part with the sun out of 
    the firmament, than the ark of gospel ordinances, word and sacraments. For 
    the tables of the law were laid up in the ark. In these ordinances is to be 
    seen by the Christian the most joyful sight out of Heaven. The broad law 
    fully answered in all its demands by Jesus Christ, "who is the end of the 
    law for righteousness to every one that believes." The fiery law with all 
    its curse and vengeance originally due to him, laid by and covered up, under 
    the veil of the flesh of Christ crucified.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, from the mercy seat on the ark, God spoke to the 
    people. And in these ordinances God breathes love, peace, and good-will to 
    poor sinners through a crucified Savior. "Glory to God in the highest, on 
    earth peace, and good-will towards men." He who believingly sees the body 
    and blood of Christ exhibited in the sacrament, must thereupon say with joy, 
    "Having, therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the 
    blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us 
    through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; and having an high priest over 
    the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of 
    faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies 
    washed with pure water." There the believer hears the joyful invitation from 
    a crucified Savior, "Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away; for to 
    the winter is past, the rain is over and gone."</p>
<p align="justify">The pot of manna also was in the ark. And in gospel 
    ordinances the believer eats angels' food; for Christ, the true manna, the 
    bread from Heaven, is there, saying, "I am the living bread which came down 
    from Heaven. If any man shall eat of this bread he shall live forever; and 
    the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of 
    the world." Christ the maker of the feast, is the matter of it too, and 
    feasts his people on himself and all his benefits. And O how desirable must 
    this entertainment be in the wilderness of this world, while the believer 
    tastes of Christ's sweetness, and the sweetness of everything in him; the 
    sweetness of his death that removes the curse, and his resurrection that 
    fills with the hope of glory.</p>
<p align="justify">Great and glorious things were done by the ark. When the 
    ark was placed beside Dagon, Dagon fell to the ground. When Christ is 
    enjoyed in gospel ordinances, strong lusts and idols are made to fall. The 
    death of Christ viewed by faith in the sacrament, is the best remedy for 
    subduing strong corruptions. By compassing Jericho the walls fell. O how 
    often have walls of separation between Christ and a believer fallen down at 
    ordinances, and they that were far off have been brought near by the blood 
    of Christ. Jordan was divided by the ark and they went through to Canaan. 
    And indeed the enjoyment of Christ in ordinances, will take the sting out of 
    death and present to the man a safe passage to Immanuel's land.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Beware of profane looking into the ark, but approach 
    with all holy reverence. Fifty thousand, threescore and ten men of 
    Bethshemesh were slain by the Lord for this sin, 1 Samuel 6:19. How many 
    such on-lookers are there in the case of the gospel ark, who look to the 
    sacred symbols as common things, and despise the holy mystery of Christ 
    represented by them. External judgments were more common under the law, but 
    spiritual judgments are more common now. Silent blows on the soul and 
    conscience that make no noise now abound. But labor you to see a majesty in 
    the ordinances, and serve God therein with reverence and godly fear.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Beware of rash meddling with the ark. Remember that 
    for this sin Uzzah was struck dead by God, 2 Samuel 6:6, 7. O the hazard of 
    rash approaching to the table of the Lord. "For he that eats and drinks 
    unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord's 
    body." Therefore make it a business of solemn seriousness to examine 
    yourselves, as to your right to it, your state and your frame. For it is a 
    feast for friends, not for enemies; for the living, not the dead, for these 
    that are awake, not such as are asleep.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Prepare for the entertaining of the ark, and the Lord 
    of the ark. Do as David did. "I will not, said he, give sleep to mine eyes, 
    or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for the Lord, an 
    habitation for the mighty God of Jacob." Labor to prepare for the solemn 
    ordinance before you. Let it be much in your mind, that you may be in a 
    proper frame for it. Lay salvation to heart. Renew your covenant and put 
    away strange gods. Search and purge out the old leaven. Satan uses to be 
    very busy at such a time, and therefore you should watch and be sober.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Throw the doors of your hearts wide open to 
    receive the Lord of the ark. Let all things be dismissed that have kept 
    Christ at the door, and heartily embrace him in the gospel offer.</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine 2. The doors of the hearts of sinners ought to 
    be thrown wide open to Christ the King of glory, demanding admission by the 
    gospel. Here I shall</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show what is supposed in the gospel call here given.</p>
<p align="justify">II. What it is to open the doors of the heart to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Offer some reasons why sinners should open to him. I 
    am</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show what is supposed in the gospel call here 
    given. It supposes,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That the hearts of sinners are naturally shut on the 
    King of glory. Whoever be shut in, Christ is shut out. "For behold, says he, 
    I stand at the door and knock:" God made man with an heart open towards 
    Heaven, into which his Spirit might have ready access. But man receiving 
    God's enemy, they together shut the door, and shut out the great Master. And 
    in this case Christ finds every man's heart when he comes before it in the 
    gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That man naturally keeps his heart shut against 
    Christ. As long as the sinner is left to himself he will never relent. "I 
    hearkened and heard but they spoke not aright: no man repented him of his 
    wickedness, saying what have I done? Every one turned to his course, as the 
    horse rushes into the battle." He will not open the door, and go and seek 
    the King of glory. He will not sit at the door and espy Christ afar off, as 
    Abraham did the angels, and run to meet him and invite him to come in. Alas! 
    It is much if he will give him admission, when he comes to the door and 
    demands once and again.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Christ comes by the gospel and demands open doors for 
    himself. He could by a word have set the house on fire, as soon as it was 
    shut on him, and might have justly done it. But he graciously condescends to 
    demand entrance, so the proposals of peace begin on his side. He sends 
    messengers to put sinners in mind to return to their duty. And O that you 
    could be persuaded that Christ is demanding admission into every heart among 
    us.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Christ is willing to come into every heart. Why does 
    he demand open doors, but because he is willing to enter. Though the house 
    be not worthy of his presence, though he has received many indignities from 
    it and in it, yet he is willing to grace it with his royal presence. He 
    makes no exceptions in the offer, and none are excluded from his favor, but 
    those who by refusing his gracious offer exclude themselves. "For if any 
    man, says he, hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in and sup with 
    him and he with me."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, That Christ will not come in but with the 
    sinner's consent. He will not break up the door. He will be King of the 
    hearts of his subjects, and rule in their affections, or not at all. They 
    must open to him, he will not force himself in upon them. He makes them 
    willing in the day of his power, but will not enter against their will. We 
    proceed now,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show what it is to open the doors of the heart to 
    Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">This is the great duty for which the text calls, and what 
    we are called to on this occasion. There is a two-fold opening.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Initial opening. That is when those that never opened 
    to Christ before, do open to him in their conversion, and their first 
    believing and coming into the covenant. Then Christ makes his first solemn 
    entry into the soul. And thus sinners, natural men, are called to open.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Progressive opening. So saints open to him. To them 
    Christ says, "Open to me my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; for my 
    head is filled with dew, and my locks with drops of the night." This is an 
    opening more and more to the King of glory. Sometimes though the soul be 
    open to Christ in respect of one's state, yet it is closed in respect of the 
    frame. Though there be grace yet it is either not in exercise at all, or 
    weak and languishing. Yes, grace at best while here is but imperfect. Though 
    Christ has room in the heart, yet he has not all the room, and therefore 
    there must be a progressive opening, until we come to the place, where 
    Christ shall not only have the whole man, but the whole of every part of the 
    man without competition.</p>
<p align="justify">The text seems to aim at both, and so to take in both 
    saints and sinners. The work of conversion is imperfect in respect of 
    degrees, and so must be carried on to perfection. And indeed the lines of 
    God's image drawn at first on a soul, are sometimes like a new written 
    sentence, which rashly touched by anything, is so defaced, that though the 
    letters be not quite blotted out, yet it must be run over anew with the pen. 
    "Except you be converted and become as little children, you shall not enter 
    into the kingdom of Heaven." There must be new conviction, humiliation, 
    believing and covenanting.</p>
<p align="justify">There is a twofold door to be opened to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">1. You must open the outer door of the understanding. 
    Open the eyes of the mind blinded by the deceitfulness of sin. "To open 
    their eyes, and turn them from darkness unto light." Have we not, like 
    Samson, fallen into the hands of the Philistines, who have put out our two 
    eyes and sport themselves with our miseries? Are not the eyes of many 
    closed, so as they see neither their danger, nor the means of deliverance, 
    neither their disease, nor the remedy.</p>
<p align="justify">You must open your eyes to see your sinfulness, to take a 
    right view of your sins. "For I was alive without the law once; but when the 
    commandment came, sin revived and I died." Without this view there will be 
    no access for the King of glory into our hearts. "Because you say, I am 
    rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that 
    you are wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. I counsel 
    you to buy of me, gold tried in the fire that you may be rich; and white 
    clothing that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness do 
    not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see." See your 
    heart, what it is, a cage of unclean birds, a sepulcher full of rottenness, 
    a receptacle of filthy lusts, a piece of cursed ground, fruitful of briers 
    and thorns. "For, from within, out of the heart, proceed evil thoughts, 
    adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, 
    lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. The heart is 
    deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, who can know it." See 
    your life what it is, a mass of disorder and confusion, unfruitful, 
    unprofitable, dishonoring to God, grieving to his Spirit, leading to utter 
    darkness.</p>
<p align="justify">See the evil of your sins. "Your own wickedness shall 
    correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you; know therefore, and 
    see, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that you have forsaken the Lord 
    your God, and that my fear is not in you, says the Lord of hosts." See how 
    contrary sin is to the holy nature of God. "You Lord are of purer eyes than 
    to behold evil, and can not look upon iniquity." It is contrary to his holy 
    law. "Whoever commits sin transgresses also the law; for sin is the 
    transgression of the law." See how sin dishonors all his attributes, 
    omniscience, omnipresence, justice, truth, holiness, and the rest. How 
    provoking to the eyes of his jealousy. See also the loathsomeness of your 
    sins. Pull off the mask which Satan has put upon sin and view it in its own 
    ugly colors; how the beauty of your souls is thereby marred, the image of 
    God defaced, the image of Satan set up in its stead. How it unfits you for 
    communion with God, as one in his vomit is unfit to approach the presence of 
    a prince. Then shall you remember your own evil ways, and your doings that 
    were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your 
    iniquities, and for your abominations. Behold I am vile; what shall I answer 
    you! I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.</p>
<p align="justify">See to the heinousness of your sins. What light, love, 
    mercies of many kinds you have sinned against. What reproofs and warnings 
    you have disregarded.—What vows, purposes and resolutions to amend you have 
    broken. "I will arise, said the prodigal, and go to my father and will say 
    to him, I have sinned against Heaven and before you."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, See the multitude of your sins. "Who can 
    understand his errors." They are more than the hairs on your heads. The 
    longer you have lived, the more is your debt increased. The law requires all 
    perfection at all times; but you could never do one thing, which weighed in 
    balance of the law would not have been found light. Whatever you have done, 
    with so many sins you are chargeable; thoughts, words, actions; yes, more, 
    inasmuch as there have been many sins in one action. Omissions too, who can 
    reckon them up?</p>
<p align="justify">Again, Open your eyes to see your misery by sin. What 
    miseries has it brought upon you and to what it has made you liable. Has it 
    not separated between God and you, kindled the Lord's anger against you, 
    displayed by temporal and spiritual plagues upon you. Has it not marred your 
    communion with God, and prevented the communications of gracious influences, 
    and left you a withered soul? Who can express the misery of a person out of 
    Christ. Poor soul! you are a condemned man. "He who believes not the Son 
    shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him." Being under the 
    fearful sentence of a broken law, every moment ready to drop into the pit, 
    having nothing but the thread of your brittle life between you and 
    everlasting burnings.</p>
<p align="justify">See also your utter inability to help yourselves, by 
    yourselves. "O Israel, you have destroyed yourself: but in me is your help." 
    Such a sight the prodigal got, "I perish, said he, with hunger." Look to 
    your crimson guilt, and you will see it to be of a deeper dye than that 
    tears of blood can wash it out. Look to the power of your lusts, and see 
    your slender arms utterly unable to break them; yourself as unable to 
    grapple with them, as a little child with a giant, or a weak man with the 
    leviathan that will count his darts as straw, and his spear as flax.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Open your eyes to see a Savior in the glory of 
    his mediatory office. "Look, says he, unto me, and be you saved, all the 
    ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else." You have long been 
    saying, "what is your beloved more than another beloved?" You have shut your 
    eyes that they could not behold his glory. "For he shall grow up before him 
    as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground; he has no form nor 
    loveliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should 
    desire him." But open the outer door, and see the King of glory, that being 
    ravished with the sight, you may open the inner door also and make him 
    welcome to the innermost recesses of your heart. See him, in the glory of 
    his suitableness to your case. If you are blind, he has salve to anoint your 
    eyes, that you may see; if you are naked, he has white clothing to clothe 
    and adorn you; if you are poor, he has gold tried in the fire that will 
    enrich you forever. "He is made of God unto us wisdom, and righteousness, 
    and sanctification, and redemption." If you be a poor foolish creature he is 
    wisdom. If you be hungry his flesh is meat indeed. There is a fullness of 
    merit in him and of the Spirit. Whatever be your want, there is a suitable 
    supply in him. If there be a curse on you, he knows the way of removing the 
    curse, and he has a blessing to bestow. View him also in the glory of his 
    ability to save. "He is the Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in 
    battle." Though your sin and misery were heavier than the sand of the sea, a 
    dead weight of guilt hanging at your soul like mountains of brass, yet hear 
    the Father's testimony concerning him, "I have laid help, says he, upon one 
    that is mighty." He is God as well as man, and therefore though the 
    controversy be between God and you, he is fit to be Day's-man, to lay his 
    hands upon both. The virtue of his blood is infinite, because it is the 
    blood of the Son of God, and it cleanses from all sin. So the virtue of his 
    Spirit, because he is a divine person.</p>
<p align="justify">See the glory of his willingness to save. His whole word 
    is full of demonstrations of this. "Ho, every one that thirsts come you to 
    the waters, and he who has no money; come you, buy and eat; yes, come, buy 
    wine and milk without money and without price." Yes, he has written his 
    willingness to save in characters of his blood, having laid down his life to 
    save sinners, and made even them welcome to the benefit who imbrued their 
    hands in his blood. Even to them, it was said, "Repent and be baptized every 
    one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you 
    shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." Does he not stand stretching out 
    his hands, crying, Behold me, behold me.</p>
<p align="justify">2. You must open the inner door of the will. Be willing 
    and obedient to the call of the gospel. "Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, 
    and take away the foreskins of your hearts, you men of Judah and inhabitants 
    of Jerusalem." There is an iron sinew in our neck, that must be renewed, 
    that we may bow to him, to whom every knee shall bow at length. Whatever 
    light has entered into the mind, Christ has no possession of the soul until 
    the heart and affections become pliable to him. This inner door Satan keeps 
    fast as well as the other, until a day of power cause them to open, Psalm 
    110:3. So the sinner may say to Christ laying siege to his heart, as the 
    Jebusites said to David in another case, "Except you take away the blind and 
    the lame, you shall not come in hither:" the blind mind, and the crooked 
    will. But exhortations and gospel calls are the means, which he blesses for 
    that end; therefore we call upon you to open this door also. Open the door 
    then, in a hearty acquiescence in the grand device of salvation through 
    Jesus Christ, "who is the power of God and the wisdom of God." This is God's 
    contrivance for bringing many sons to glory. Let your own hearts say amen to 
    it, so as to venture your souls upon that foundation, upon which God has 
    laid the weight of his glory. Be well pleased with the King of glory. Do not 
    any more find fault with him, with whom the Father is well pleased. Listen 
    no more to the surmises of unbelief against him: for it is ever finding some 
    fault with the mystery of Christ. And blessed is he, whoever shall not be 
    offended in him.</p>
<p align="justify">You must open also in a hearty willingness, to part with 
    all your old guests to make room for him. There is not an empty heart among 
    all the children of men. If Christ be not there, there are others in his 
    stead. But be they who they may, Christ says, if you love me, let these go 
    their way.</p>
<p align="justify">Away then with your carnal wisdom, that room may be made 
    for Christ's guidance of you by his word and Spirit. "Trust in the Lord with 
    all your heart, and lean not to your own understanding. In all your ways 
    acknowledge him and he shall direct your paths." Shut up the eyes of 
    self-wisdom, that you may walk in his light. Following that false light has 
    led you into many a snare in the wilderness of the world. The following of 
    it has made the ship of the soul dash on many a rock in this troublesome 
    sea.</p>
<p align="justify">Away also, with all your false and self-confidences 
    before the Lord, that room may be made for the blood of Christ, the only 
    procuring cause of peace, pardon, and salvation. "Yes, doubtless, and I 
    count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ 
    Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count 
    them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine 
    own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith 
    of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith." Depend no more upon 
    mere mercy before the Lord, nor to your good hearts, blameless lives, your 
    duties, or anything that is yours. But as the young man, leave all these and 
    flee from them naked, Mark 14:51, 52. Pretend to nothing to recommend you to 
    God, or Jesus Christ, nothing in or about yourselves.</p>
<p align="justify">Away with your lusts and idols, that the King of glory 
    may reign freely in your hearts. "Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I 
    have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more. That which I see not, 
    teach you me; if I have done iniquity, I will do so no more." Whatever room 
    you reserve for lusts or idols you refuse to him. If you be not willing to 
    part with them all, you are not willing to receive Christ. If there be a 
    Delilah left that must be spared, a right eye, which you cannot endure the 
    pain of plucking out, you do in effect judge yourselves unworthy of eternal 
    life.</p>
<p align="justify">Again you must open in a hearty willingness to receive 
    Christ as the gospel offers him. Take up the offer of the gospel rightly, 
    and let your souls be ready to fall in with it. Come over all your 
    objections to the marriage covenant, as contained in the offer. All things 
    are ready on his part, be you so also. "All things, says he, are ready, come 
    you to the marriage." Will you be content at length to take him for your 
    prophet, and only oracle and director; for your priest to bear the whole 
    weight of your salvation on his merits; for your King and absolute Lord; to 
    take his will for your law, to obey it without disputing.</p>
<p align="justify">You must open also in a cordial actual consent of the 
    soul to Christ. "To as many as received him, to them he gave power to become 
    the sons of God, even to them that believed on his name." Now stretch out 
    your hand to God in Christ in the everlasting covenant. You that never 
    before could be brought to be espoused to the Son of God, now throw open the 
    doors that the King of glory may come in. You that have formerly given but a 
    hypocritical consent of hand, but not of heart, give now a cordial consent. 
    Take him for your Lord, head and husband, for a covering of the eyes, for 
    all in all. And you that have honestly consented before, renew it with more 
    cordiality, as those that have seen how good the Lord is.</p>
<p align="justify">You must open in a cordial resignation of yourselves to 
    the Lord, giving up yourselves to him wholly, and that forever. "One shall 
    say, I am the Lord's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; 
    and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself 
    by the name of Israel." Long has the Lord been calling to us, saying, my 
    son, give me your heart. O then give your own selves unto the Lord. You have 
    endured a long siege, O then yield yourselves. "Now, be you not 
    stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the Lord and 
    enter his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever; and serve the Lord 
    your God." The devil, the world and the flesh are his competitors in this 
    matter, to the one, or to the other you must belong. But shall any be 
    reckoned preferable to the King of glory. You must open in a cordial love to 
    him. O stir up in your souls a flaming love to the King of glory. That was a 
    blessed opening when the disciples exclaimed, "Did not our heart burn within 
    us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the 
    scriptures?" Love him for his benefits to the children of men, for the 
    peace, pardon, grace and glory, which he has purchased by his blood, and 
    bestows upon his people. Love him, for himself, his glorious perfections, 
    his holiness, love, grace. Love him for what he has done for sinners in 
    obeying the law and for what he has suffered by enduring the penalty. Look 
    at him striking hands with the Father from eternity for an elect world, and 
    love him. Look to him in his birth, his life, his death, in the garden, on 
    the cross, and love him.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, Open in your fervent desire after communion with 
    him. "With my soul have I desired you in the night; yes, with my spirit 
    within me will I seek you early." This is the native effect of opening of 
    the heart to him in love. "Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon 
    your arm; for love is strong as death." An opened heart will have holy 
    breathings after the Lord. "O that I knew where I might find him, then I 
    would go even to his seat." If you have tasted that the Lord is gracious, 
    long for more of the communications of his grace. If not, yet if you have 
    heard and believed, it may excite your ardent desire.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus we must open to Christ. And not only so, but we must 
    open the door wide. The heads of the gates must be lifted up to make a large 
    wide entry. You may take up this in these things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There must be room made to take in all that our Lord 
    brings along with him. We must not choose and refuse in this according to 
    the disposition of our own hearts; like those who would take something of 
    his, but have not room for taking in all. Open the door then so as to take 
    in his broad law with him. If you have exceptions against any of his 
    commandments, if there be any particular with which you have no will to 
    comply, you receive him not. "Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have 
    respect to all your commandments." You must open so as to take in his cross 
    with him. "If any man will come after me, said Jesus, let him deny himself 
    and take up his cross, and follow me." If you be not content to take Christ 
    with his cross, to follow him at all hazards wherever he goes, you cannot 
    receive him. Many have room for Christ's salvation from Hell and wrath, but 
    they never open so as to receive him with his law and his cross.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There must be room made that our Lord may enter in 
    what way seems best in his own eyes. We must not limit him, for he is the 
    holy one of Israel. In respect of time we must set no hours to him, but wait 
    on, until the Lord look down from Heaven; nor must we limit him in respect 
    of the manner of his coming, but whether he come in the high way of 
    consolation, or the low way of further humiliation, we must welcome him. Nor 
    in respect of the measure of enjoyments, we must be thankful for the least 
    crumb.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We must be always endeavoring to have the entrance 
    enlarged. To get more sense of sin, farther insight into the Mediator's 
    glory: more willingness to part with sin, more love, faith, desire, and the 
    like. For the mystery of iniquity in us, the mystery of the Mediator's 
    glory, are depths into which we may penetrate farther and farther. And 
    whatever graces are kindled in the heart may be blown up to burn more 
    keenly.</p>
<p align="justify">4. We must receive him honorably, as the King of glory 
    making his triumphant entrance into our souls. A high esteem of Christ in 
    his superlative excellency is necessary in order to the receiving of him.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, We must receive him joyfully, as citizens casting 
    open their gates to receive their king with joyful acclamations, when making 
    a triumphant entrance. Let us proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To give a few reasons of the point.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Because, The house is his own. He is the righteous 
    Lord and owner, and how unreasonable is it, that the house should be open to 
    strangers and shut upon the Master. The visible church is Christ's house, 
    and his entertainment there is in the hearts of the members of it. "I 
    brought him, says the spouse, into my mother's house, and into the chambers 
    of her that conceived me." He has a right to it, by the Father's gift, who 
    has made him heir of all things, and by redeeming the house by his own 
    blood, when it was mortgaged. Is it not then highly reasonable to receive 
    him?</p>
<p align="justify">2. The Father that gave him the house, requires you to 
    open it to him. "This said he, is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, 
    hear you him." He comes not without his Father's commission to take 
    possession. He served his Father in the great work of man's redemption, and 
    having been obedient to the death, the doors of Heaven were opened to 
    receive him triumphantly, and the doors on earth charged to open to him, for 
    the reward of his obedience.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It was solemnly made over to him in your baptism. 
    There are none of us but are baptized Christians, by which we were engaged 
    to be the Lord's. Thus his name is upon us, as our proprietor by consent. 
    And if we refuse to open to him, we do in effect declare, that we will not 
    stand to the bargain made for us in our infancy. And truly this is the 
    language of the practice of many.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The Improvement</p>
<p align="justify">Use 1. Of reproof to those that will not open to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Those that do not so much as open the outer door to 
    him. The gross ignorance of many, in the midst of gospel light, holds Christ 
    at the door. They live in darkness and will not use means to obtain light. 
    The door was never yet opened by conviction of their sin and misery; but 
    they have still lived in darkness and deep security. You are slighters of 
    the Savior. "It is a people of no understanding; therefore he who made them 
    will not have mercy on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor. 
    Jesus will be revealed in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know 
    not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Those who though the outer door has been opened, yet 
    keep the inner door shut fast. How many are there, who do not want competent 
    knowledge, and have had light conveyed into their minds by piercing 
    conviction; yet alas! they still stand out against the Lord. They see what 
    they should do, but their hearts will not comply with it. Their lusts keep 
    such fast hold of their hearts, that all their convictions are baffled. They 
    rebel against the light, keep Christ at the door, and follow their lusts, 
    with a witness against them in their own breasts. The more light, the 
    heavier will their doom be. "And this is the condemnation, that light is 
    come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their 
    deeds were evil."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Those that will neither open themselves, nor suffer 
    others to do it, so far as they can hinder. There are many who are agents 
    for the devil, who themselves stand aloof from holy things, and discourage 
    others who are beginning to seek after them; and do what they can one way or 
    another to keep others from the covenant and true seriousness. "But woe unto 
    you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; for you shut up the kingdom of 
    Heaven against men; for you neither go in yourselves, neither suffer you 
    them that are entering to go in."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Those who pretend to open to Christ, but never open 
    wide enough, so as the King of glory may come in. There is always some 
    secret reserve in their closing with Christ, which spoils all. The door is 
    not opened so as to receive Christ in all his offices. Hence instead of 
    opening to him, he is in effect shut out, because they are not pleased with 
    the covenant, as the Lord has made it; their heart is divided.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Sleeping saints, continuing in their security 
    notwithstanding his knocking. To them he says, "Open to me, my sister, my 
    love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, and my locks 
    with drops of the night." They reply, I have put off my coat, how shall I 
    put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them? Such maltreatment 
    our Lord often meets with even in the house of his friends, which must be so 
    much the worse as those who give it are of a character distinguished from 
    the rest of the world. "But it was you, a man, mine equal, my guide and mine 
    acquaintance. We took sweet counsel together, and walked to the house of God 
    in company."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Use second of Exhortation</p>
<p align="justify">Cast the doors of your hearts open, and wide open, to the 
    King of Glory. Behold he comes in the preaching of the gospel and in the 
    holy sacrament demanding admission into your hearts. Hold him no longer at 
    the door, "but lift up your heads, O you gates; even lift them up, you 
    everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in."</p>
<p align="justify">To enforce this exhortation, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Point out some things which keep sinners from opening 
    to Christ. And O! that they may speedily be removed.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They know not who demands admission. They know not the 
    King of glory, and therefore they treat him rudely. Which none of the 
    princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have 
    crucified the Lord of glory. Before one open a door, the question is, who is 
    there? Accordingly the question is proposed, who is this King of glory? Many 
    will not be at any pains to inquire about him; they do not concern 
    themselves with any that come to the door of their hearts that hear another 
    than the hellish chapter Many propose the question, but like Pilate, they 
    stay not for an answer. So they know him not, they have no desire to know 
    him. If they knew him and their own need of him, they would invite him to 
    come in. Ignorance and unacquaintedness with Christ are a strong bar to keep 
    him out.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They cannot come to the door, the house is so filled 
    with stuff. The woeful world blocks up the way to the door, Luke 14:16–20. 
    This and the other worldly advantage calls them to look to it, that they may 
    lose nothing. The pleasures of the world like syren songs arrest them. The 
    cares of the world like a thicket entangle them; they cannot get forward. 
    This weary earth interposes between them and the sun of righteousness; so 
    his beams cannot reach them. The clay-idol bewitches them, so as they have 
    neither heart nor hand to open the door.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Their hands are so full within and they have so many 
    crying about them that they cannot come to the door. They have so many 
    hungry lusts to feed, still crying give, give, that either they cannot hear 
    Christ knocking, or if they do, their lusts so hang about them, that they 
    hold them fast. "They have loved strangers and after them they will go." 
    Love to their lusts leaves them no room for their Lord. They love their 
    disease, they value not the Physician. And so while they feed their lusts, 
    they starve their souls.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They are afraid the house will be spoiled so they dare 
    not open the door. It was an old engine of Hell against the gospel. They 
    cried, these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also. 
    Sinners entertain Christ's message as Nabal did David's, 1 Samuel 25:11. 
    Shall I give up with the ways of sin, which are so profitable and pleasant? 
    Shall I be bound up to the strictness of a holy life, that I shall have no 
    more liberty to do as I please? Therefore to keep what they have, they will 
    not open to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The strong man keeps the house, and will not suffer 
    them to go to the door. "They are in the snare of the devil, and taken 
    captive by him at his will." While Christ speaks at the one ear, Satan 
    speaks at the other; and he uses every possible mean to keep them from 
    opening to Christ. Sometimes he will tell them it is too soon, and sometimes 
    that it is too late to do it. If they begin to entertain thoughts of 
    opening, he will exert himself and vex them with temptations, so as not 
    having a spirit of resolution for Christ, they are obliged to give it over.</p>
<p align="justify">6. They think he is already received. As one is sometimes 
    kept at the door upon this mistake, so Christ is shut out of the hearts of 
    many by reason of delusion and self conceit. "They think themselves rich and 
    increased with goods and in need of nothing." They are beyond opening to 
    Christ, for they think that they have opened already. A dangerous case, 
    which should put all of us to an impartial trial of ourselves, and to be 
    doing in opening to Christ, as if nothing had ever yet been done.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, They are in bed and they cannot rise, Song 5:3. A 
    soft sleep in the bed of sloth, keeps Christ long at the door with many. 
    They have lost the taste and relish of spiritual things; they have fallen 
    out of use of wrestling with God. They have put their hands in their bosom, 
    and it grieves them to bring them to their mouth.</p>
<p align="justify">II. I shall bring forward some motives to urge you to 
    open. May they be effectual.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider who keeps the house, while Christ is kept at 
    the door, "While a strong man armed keeps his palace, his goods are in 
    peace." Who is this but Satan, God's enemy, and the usurper of his throne. 
    And as is the master, so is the furniture of the house. It is replenished 
    from Hell with divers lusts, each of them as Egyptian taskmasters filling 
    the sinners' hands with works of darkness, and never saying it is enough. 
    And such will be the reward, shame and everlasting sorrow. That heart that 
    should be a temple for God the Savior, is a workhouse for Satan. Satan is 
    "the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Consider who it is that asks admission. A King, even 
    the King of glory. Let the dignity of the person command your reverence and 
    readiness to open; who would shut his door on a crowned head? Behold the 
    crowned King of Zion demanding entrance into your souls. If you ask, who is 
    this King of glory? He is the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in 
    battle. Therefore resistance is in vain. It will but ruin the person who 
    makes it. For he is a mighty King against whom there is no rising up. Behold 
    the end his enemies will make. "These mine enemies, which would not that I 
    should reign over them, bring hither and slay them before me." For he will 
    be the last on the field, and will see all his enemies turn their backs, 
    with the devil that deceived them, and led them on to oppose him.</p>
<p align="justify">He is the Lord mighty in battle, therefore you need not 
    say, you cannot open. Give him but your consent, do but cordially bid him 
    welcome, and he will see to the work himself. "But when a stronger than the 
    strong man shall come upon him, he takes from him all his armor wherein he 
    trusts, and divides his spoils." He can make the iron gates open of their 
    own accord. A touch of his hand upon the lock will make it give way. Your 
    strongest lusts he can soon subdue and make them as weak as water, if you be 
    but willing.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Consider how unworthy the house is of him. When 
    Solomon had built a glorious temple for him, he said in holy admiration: 
    "But will God indeed dwell on the earth. Behold the Heaven, and Heaven of 
    heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?" How 
    much more may we say so of our hearts, that naturally are a cage of unclean 
    birds, a habitation of devils. O wonderful, that ever he should grant to 
    knock at these doors, and to dwell in such a lodging. Dreadfully heinous 
    then must be the sin of refusing him access.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Consider that yet he will come in, if you will open to 
    him. Neither the majesty of the King of glory, nor the baseness of the place 
    which the sinner has to lodge him in, will keep them asunder, but only 
    sinners refusing him access. He who has the upper house of Heaven for his 
    throne, will take the humble heart for his lower house. "For thus says the 
    high and lofty one, that inhabits eternity, whose name is holy, I dwell in 
    the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble 
    spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the 
    contrite ones." And if he come in, he will bring a troop of blessings with 
    him, pardon, peace, grace and a title to glory. "He will give grace and 
    glory, and will withhold no good thing from them that walk uprightly."</p>
<p align="justify">5. This offer stood the King of glory dear. There is no 
    such knocking at the door of the heart of fallen angels; because "Jesus took 
    not on him the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham." 
    And neither would you have had this offer, unless the Son of God had taken 
    upon him man's nature, and satisfied justice, so that now with the good will 
    of justice, mercy may be extended to the rebels. He purchased his kingdom 
    with his blood, and now he is demanding access to it. For this is the voice 
    of the King of glory returning from the battle which he has fought for 
    sinners; calling them to open the gates to let in the conqueror 
    triumphantly. May we not then say, "How shall we escape if we neglect so 
    great salvation."</p>
<p align="justify">6. Remember the day will come, that you, to whom he now 
    calls to open to him, will call to him to open to you. He has the keys of 
    Hell and death: And whom he sends there, none can keep back, and whom he 
    keeps back, none can set forward. For he opens and none can shut, and he 
    shuts and none can open. He carries the keys of heaven's gates, and gives 
    answers to those that knock at the door. And how can you expect that he will 
    admit you into Heaven, if you will not now receive him into your hearts. 
    "Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek 
    to enter in, and shall not be able. When once the master of the house is 
    risen up, and has shut to the door, and you begin to stand without, and to 
    knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and 
    say unto you, I know not whence you are."</p>
<p align="justify">7. You have a very solemn call at this time. Christ is 
    opening his heart to you now by his word, to bid you welcome; next day we 
    have the prospect of his opening it to you in the sacrament. This is a 
    special time, in which the ark of gospel ordinances comes to your gates. 
    Beware of slighting the King of glory in such a solemnity. It is the 
    solemnity of his espousals and his coronation too, the time in which some 
    will in a special manner be espoused to him and put the crown on his head. 
    "Go forth, O you daughters of Zion, and behold King Solomon with the crown 
    with which his mother crowned him, in the day of his espousals, and in the 
    day of the gladness of his heart." But a time of blessing to some proves a 
    time of a withering curse to others. "For I say unto you, that none of those 
    men which were bidden shall taste of my supper."</p>
<p align="justify">8. Consider the offer will not last always. Our Lord 
    stands and knocks, Revelation 3:20. He does not sit down at the door but 
    stands, which is a way going posture. He has nothing to do, but turn his 
    back and be gone. And indeed patience when still abused, turns to fury at 
    length. You have had many knocks, if you sit this, the next may knock your 
    souls out of your bodies, and where are you then.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, There is no other way to be saved, but by opening 
    to Christ. Thus it shall be well with you, but otherwise you sin against the 
    remedy of Christ to your eternal ruin.</p>
<p align="justify">Say not it is too soon. Ah! Is it too soon to have the 
    soul plucked as a brand out of the burning? Is there not a danger of 
    delaying? The longer you be in coming unto Christ, the harder work will it 
    be. Nay, who knows but the Lord may cease knocking at your heart, and that 
    by delaying you may outlive your day of grace. There were several with us 
    last sacrament, who are now gone.</p>
<p align="justify">Say not it is too long to be done now. No, you shall yet 
    be welcome, if you be willing. There is no case so far gone as to be 
    hopeless, that is put into Christ's hand. "Jesus said, Take you away the 
    stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, says unto him, Lord, by this 
    time he stinks; for he had been dead four days. Jesus said unto her, said I 
    not unto you, that if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?" 
    The stone that has lain long before the builder, and has been often rejected 
    while others about it were taken up, may come at length to get a place in 
    the building. For yet there is room. Our Lord often comes back, and washes 
    them that were formerly overlooked. "For I will cleanse, says he, their 
    blood, that I have not cleansed; for the Lord dwells in Zion."</p>
<p align="justify">But Oh! will ever the Lord come into such a heart as 
    mine? Answer, our Lord makes no exceptions. "If any man, says he, will open 
    the door, I will come in to him." This may encourage you. Our Lord never 
    finds any heart good, but makes it good. He comes in as a Physician, and 
    therefore your sickness will not drive him away. The more desperate the 
    disease is, the greater is the glory of his grace. Christ can make a 
    stepping stone of your sinfulness and misery, by which to ascend to his 
    throne.</p>
<p align="justify">Let me conclude with giving some advices to those that 
    would open to, and receive him at his table.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Search the house. Set about the duty of 
    self-examination. "But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that 
    bread and drink of that cup." Examine yourselves as to your state, frame, 
    graces, sins, wants, resolutions and the like.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Labor to purge the house of the idols of jealousy. 
    "Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are 
    unleavened. For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us." Renew your 
    repentance. See what have been the great hindrances between Christ and you, 
    and take them out of the way.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Be sure to keep in the fire, the holy fire of grace. 
    Quench not the Spirit. Cherish every good motion. And if you have got 
    anything strive to keep it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Put the key of your hearts in the Lord's hand. Commit 
    your unruly spirits to him, in the way of believing, lest Satan catch the 
    key and the King be shut out.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Have on your best clothes, the wedding garment of 
    Christ's righteousness applied by faith. Put off also the old man which is 
    corrupt, and put on the new man, with all the ornaments of the hidden man of 
    the heart.</p>
<p align="justify">6. See you be at home. Let not your hearts be a seeking, 
    wandering through the ends of the earth. But be deeply concerned about your 
    own case.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, See you be not in your beds, when he comes to 
    the door, "And you say I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on? I have 
    washed my feet, how shall I defile them?" But shake off security. Let your 
    loins be girt and your lamp burning, that you may be ready to open to him 
    when he comes. Amen.</p>
