        <p align="justify">
          Hebrews 11:28, "Through faith he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling
          of blood, lest he who destroyed the first-born, should touch them."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          SOLOMON tells us, Proverbs 22:3, "A prudent man foresees the evil, and
          hides himself: but the simple pass on and are punished." We may be
          sure there is a sad and trying time abiding the world. God will have
          his day when the world has got theirs. Of this there is no great
          ground to doubt, that there is a sad and trying time abiding these
          nations. At the last occasion of this nature we had, the Lord seemed
          to be giving the word to out up the cumber-ground fig-tree of the
          Church of Scotland; yet, beyond hope, he has let it alone another
          year. But let us take heed; there may be more depending on the effects
          of the digging and dunging this year than we are aware of. It has got
          deep, very deep snegs already, and the axe is still lying at the root.
          And therefore I think we have the duty of this day, this
          communion-day, in the text; and that is, that we make it a hiding day
          under the covert of blood, for time and for eternity; as Moses did in
          the like case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          God had long sat still, and his enemies had been provoking him; now he
          was risen up, and was begun to reckon with them; and, after several
          lesser strokes, the warning is given, that the root-stroke was at
          hand. What does Moses, with other believing Israelites, in this trying
          time?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. He goes to his duty, in a sealing ordinance, and makes a covenant
          with God by sacrifice; he "kept the Passover," etc. He saw that he and
          his Israelites deserved the stroke, as well as the Egyptians; that God
          would have a sacrifice off both their hands; that the destroying angel
          should either find blood on their houses, or shed blood in them. Then
          says Moses, Let the Egyptians do as they will, the Lamb shall be our
          sacrifice this night; we will sprinkle the blood on our houses. So he
          "kept the Passover," (Gr. made); not that he gave a being to it,
          instituting it at the command of God, though that was true; but it is
          an Old Testament expression, 2 Chronicles 35:1, well rendered, "he
          kept," that is, celebrated this holy ordinance, whereof we have an
          account, Exodus 12. The passover was a Lamb slain and eaten by the
          Israelites, a sacrament of the old covenant of grace. The apostle
          speaks of "the sprinkling of blood," as a distinct thing; for though
          it was the blood of the paschal lamb, yet it was not used in the after
          Passovers, after they left Egypt. The lamb represented Christ; and
          "the sprinkling of the blood," the believing application of his.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. He managed this duty rightly. He had need; for there was much
          depending on it. He did it believingly "through faith." I may not
          stand on the detail of the actings of Moses' faith in this matter.
          Only I will give an instance of it both these ways, verse 1, "Now
          faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
          seen." The object of faith is twofold.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Things that have a being, but fall not under our sense. So Moses'
          faith was to him "the evidence of things not seen;" that is, the
          spiritual instrument whereby he discerned and applied that in the
          ordinance which his eye could not see. He saw Christ in it, and the
          grand contrivance of salvation: and by the same mean he applied him.
          What else could give ease to a guilty sinner whose eyes were opened?
          And therefore, notwithstanding of Pharaoh's rage against him, and that
          they were all to march the next day, and that there was to be such a
          dreadful stir in Egypt that night, he keeps his temper and goes about
          his duty.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Things that have no being but in the promise. So his faith was to
          him "the substance of things hoped for;" that is, the spiritual
          instrument whereby he assured himself, that the deliverance which was
          not yet done should certainly be performed; and so the future
          deliverance was to him thereby as present. And our faith must act both
          these ways, if we manage this sacrament aright.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. He had a particular view in his managing of it; "lest he who
          destroyed the first-born, should touch them." He saw there was a
          bloody time at hand, that God was to make the most dreadful time in
          that land that ever they saw with their eyes. The destroying angel was
          to pass through the land of Egypt that night, to smite all the
          first-born, both man and beast. He was afraid of the least touch of
          that angel armed with vengeance, knowing it would crush him as a moth.
          Therefore he takes the blessed opportunity which the Lord had put into
          his hand, to secure himself and his people; flying in under the covert
          of blood, to be hidden in the day of the Lord. He does not gather his
          people together to stand to their own defense; that would not do: they
          must go into their houses, and lie at the feet of mercy. To close the
          windows, bar the doors, etc. will not do it; but the blood of the lamb
          on the door-posts will. Therefore he "sprinkles that blood" for that
          very end.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. The believing management of the sacrament of Christ's body
          and blood, is the best security for a sinner against the day of wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In handling of this doctrine, I shall show,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. What is that believing management of the sacrament of Christ's body
          and blood, which is the best security for a sinner against the day of
          wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. What security this will be against the day of wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. Confirm the doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">IV. Lastly, Make application.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. First, I shall show, what is that believing management of the
          sacrament of Christ's body and blood, which is the best security for a
          sinner against the day of wrath, We will be helped to a view of this,
          by considering the ordinance pointed at in the text.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, The Christian and communicant that would manage this ordinance so
          as he may be secured against the day of wrath, must have his bunch of
          hyssop ready; that is, he must have faith, by which alone that blood
          can be sprinkled on the soul. An unbeliever can never believingly
          manage this or any other ordinance; for there can be no acting without
          a principle. Faith is the hand that must receive the atonement, that
          transfers the guilt on the head of our great sacrifice, the feet
          whereby we flee into the city of refuge, and the hand that draws the
          cover from wrath over our heads, and signs the covenant of peace
          between us and an angry God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, He must believe his own desert of wrath, that he himself
          deserves to fall among them that fall. Blood on the door-posts of the
          Israelites proclaimed them guilty, as well as blood on the houses of
          the Egyptians did them. He must sit down at this table under a sense
          of sin, and desert of wrath; acknowledging that he deserves rather to
          be led to the altar for a sacrifice for vengeance to feed on, than to
          sit down at the table to feed on this costly sacrifice. If you be this
          day to be marked with the sign of salvation, you will be sensible you
          have hung the sign of destruction before your own doors; and while
          others, in the view of wrath on the land, are dealing all the causes
          of wrath about them, you will smite on your breasts, saying, with the
          publican, (Luke 18:13), "God be merciful to me a sinner;" a self, a
          land, a church destroyer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, He must, with an eye of faith, discern the sacrifice, and the
          virtue of it, seeing that in the ordinance which a carnal eye cannot
          discern; as Exodus 12:26, 27, "And it shall come to pass, when your
          children shall say unto you, What mean you by this service? that you
          shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, who passed over
          the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the
          Egyptians, and delivered our houses." The apostle tells us, how the
          spiritually blind bring wrath on themselves, instead of securing
          themselves against wrath, 1 Corinthians 11:29, "For he who eats and
          drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, not
          discerning the Lord's body." And here faith will say two things—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Faith will look in through the ordinance, and seeing Christ in it,
          will say, "There is a hiding-place from wrath," John 1:29, "Behold the
          Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world." Ephesians 2:14,
          "For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the
          middle wall of partition between us." The believer will see the grand
          device of salvation in a crucified Redeemer: he will say, There is the
          Lamb that was slain to turn away the destroying angel; the "Lamb of
          God," that is, the Lamb which God himself has provided, as he did the
          ram in the thicket; JEHOVAH-JIREH, (I. e. "God will provide"), said
          Abraham's faith long ago, Genesis 22:14.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Faith will look more narrowly yet, even through the hiding-place
          itself; and where the fearful unbeliever sees many faults, the
          believer will see none, but say, "He is able to save them to the
          uttermost, that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make
          intercession for them," Hebrews 7:25. There is a bottom on which I may
          venture for time and eternity; there is a sufficient shelter, blow the
          storm from what airth it will. There will be safety there when the
          Lord in anger will rain snares on a generation of his wrath; it will
          be safe there when the waters of Jordan swell to the brim. In a word,
          he will believe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) That Christ is the appointed refuge against wrath; and,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) That he is a safe refuge, and that there is no other.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, He must dip his bunch of hyssop in the basin where the blood of
          the Lamb is. Christ is our paschal Lamb, 1 Corinthians 5:7; the
          covenant is the basin wherein the blood of the Lamb is poured, Hebrews
          13:20: and the cup the New Testament. The believing communicant will
          lay hold on the covenant made by sacrifice, that he may be safe in the
          day of wrath, Psalm 50:3–5. God offers himself to the sinner in the
          covenant; now must the man say, "I am the Lord's. The marriage of the
          Lamb is come," the Bridegroom has given his consent already, and he
          exhibits himself in the sacrament: and the soul by faith presents
          itself, and they join hands and hearts at once. The Judge of the earth
          appears in the quality of a Bridegroom; and so they take him and are
          safe.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5thly, He must sprinkle this blood, make an effusion of it; apply it
          by faith, and receive the atonement. He must not stand afar, and say,
          I dare not meddle with that blood, though others may; I dare not lay
          my foul fingers on it. He must not sit down at the table, and only
          bathe himself in tears; not daring to bathe himself in the blood of a
          Redeemer. Call that what you will, God will call it unbelief with a
          witness; and you will rise even as clean as you would come out of
          mire, notwithstanding you would pretend to throw yourselves into it
          for washing. Therefore you must touch, take, and apply that holy
          thing: say, This blood is for me, my peace, my pardon, my
          sanctification, etc., and on it I venture my all for time and
          eternity. Heaven and earth are my witnesses also, that I embrace the
          offer, and that it is mine, and that I must be found under the covert
          of it in the day of wrath, Galatians 2:20, "Who loved me, and gave
          himself for me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6thly, He must sprinkle it on the lintel and side-posts, only not on
          the threshold. Look with an eye of faith on it as precious blood; and
          sprinkle it over your whole man, above you, on every side; only not
          under your feet. Despise it not; consider that awful word, Hebrews
          10:29, "Of how much sorer punishment shall he be thought worthy, who
          has trodden under foot the Son of God, and bath counted the blood of
          the covenant with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has
          done despite unto the Spirit of grace?" It is the blood of God; the
          price and ransom of precious souls, the foundation of all the precious
          promises. But wrath from Heaven hangs over your head, and over the
          land: sprinkle it above you, over your heads; take that blood for your
          sconce, shelter, and defense. Satan will attack you on every side, and
          may be his hounds will be let loose on you; therefore sprinkle it on
          every side; and by all means on your weak side. You have weak heads,
          and weak sides; this blood is for all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7thly, He must not sprinkle it only on the back of the door, but on
          the outside, the lintel and side-posts, that the angel may see it. The
          Lord is coming to call the land to a sad account, and to examine every
          one. On with your mark this day, on your foreheads. Antichrist's
          followers may take his either on their foreheads or their right hands,
          to serve a turn: but not so Christ's, Revelation 14:1, "And I looked,
          and lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Zion, and with him an hundred forty
          and four thousand, having his Father's name written on their
          foreheads." Your precious faith within must shine forth in an open
          profession, 2 Corinthians 4:13, "We also believe, and therefore
          speak." You must not think to quit your profession, come what will
          come; but list yourselves this day among Christ's witnesses in the
          world, in Scotland, willing to seal your testimony with blood:
          Revelation 12:11, "And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and
          by the word of their testimony: and they loved not their lives unto
          the death."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The substance of Christ's testimony; and that is holiness. The
          world with one voice is telling a lie of God, That he is a God that
          delights in wickedness; that folk may be happy with him in Heaven, and
          come there, some say, in the way of profanity, or morality, or
          formality. You must give your testimony against this; and for
          holiness; That God is holy, and that there is no coming nor likeness
          to him, but in holiness; and this by a strict and holy walk, over the
          belly of the example of the world and your own lusts. This was the
          substance of the saints' testimony from the time of the righteous
          Abel, Genesis 4:7, to this day, Revelation 3:4; and 14:4. This is the
          substance of our covenants, national and solemn league; and will be
          the substance of the testimony of the Lord's people to the end of
          time.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The necessary appendages of the testimony; and these are twofold.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The revealed truths of God made known to you. You must bear
          witness to these, whoever run them down: the truths of doctrine,
          Proverbs 23:23, "Buy the truth, and sell it not." Mark 8:38, "Whoever
          shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful
          generation, of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes
          in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels." This land is under
          the bond of a covenant to the maintenance of the truth of doctrine:
          and until the Lord raise up the spirits of his people to renew the
          covenant together, you must seal the covenant for that effect at the
          Lord's table. If you quit the truth of doctrine known to you, you quit
          the substance of the testimony; for it is "the doctrine which is
          according to godliness," 1 Timothy 6:3. It is the channel in which the
          sanctification of sinners, the great end of divine revelation, does
          run, Galatians 3:2, "This only would I learn of you, Received you the
          Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The instituted ordinances of God which you have received. You
          must bear witness to these, though our beautiful house should be laid
          in rubbish, and men's ordinances and institutions set up in their room
          by law. We are under a covenant for the "pure ordinances," and against
          "men's ordinances." And you must bear testimony to these divine
          ordinances: for so far as you quit them, you quit the substance of the
          testimony; for they are the means appointed of God for the
          sanctification of an unholy world. When we come to Heaven, we will
          strive with no body for Presbytery against Prelacy, for the simplicity
          of gospel-worship against idolatry and superstition; for then the end,
          holiness, is obtained, and we have no more need of the means. But we
          are not there yet: and therefore we must contend for these ordinances
          of God; we must not lay by our staff, before we arrive at our
          journey's end: we must use, and contend for the means, until we have
          obtained the end. Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, may be
          pleasanter rivers than Jordan; but dipping in them will not cure us of
          our leprosy; for they want one thing Jordan has, a word of divine
          appointment. Prelacy and ceremonies make a greater figure in the eye
          than purity and simplicity: but they are not means of holiness; God
          never made them, and men cannot make them so. Accordingly we have
          found them cursed trees of men's planting, under whose shade piety
          went always to wreck, and profanity grew.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8thly, He must feed on the body and blood of Christ. Faith must taste,
          and feed, and relish the sweetness of Christ, and of every part of
          Christ; unite the soul with him, and so draw virtue, sap, and strength
          from him, to stand before the Lord; the tempter and an evil world
          without, and lusts within. And I am sure, if faith be in exercise, it
          will take up a crucified Christ, as fit for this, as the eating of a
          lamb was to strengthen for work or travel. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. You must take and feed on a whole Christ; Christ in all his
          offices. As your prophet. A day of wrath is a dark day, wherein many
          mistake their way, stumble into by-paths, and fall into error. But,
          says the believing communicant, I renounce my own wisdom and wit; and
          take this Christ to be my guide; and he has promised to guide me even
          unto death. A day of wrath is a day of sad challenges, of revenging
          strokes of justice; but here is my priest, I shelter under his
          righteousness. Such a day is a day of fearful attacks from the devil,
          the world, and the flesh; but I take him to be my king, and rely on
          his promises.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. You must eat with the bitter herbs of repentance and sorrow for
          sin. If faith be stirring in your heart, it will make a hole in your
          heart, though like a rock otherwise, Zechariah 12:10, "And I will pour
          upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the
          Spirit of grace and of supplications, and they shall look upon me whom
          they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his
          only son; and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in
          bitterness for his first-born." You will sorrow for your own sins, and
          the sins of the land, that bring on wrath; for the dishonor done to
          Christ by yourself and all ranks, Ezekiel 9:4, "And the Lord said unto
          him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem,
          and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry
          for all the abomination that be done in the midst thereof." Habakkuk
          3:16, "When I heard, my belly trembled: my lips quivered at the voice:
          rottenness in my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in
          the day of trouble."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. You must eat in a departing posture; turning your backs on the
          world and your lusts, and setting your face steadfastly to Immanuel's
          land. You must this day go to that table, joining yourselves to the
          Lord, resolute to "save yourselves from this untoward generation,"
          Acts 2:40; that if Christ mind to leave the land, you will not stay
          behind, but go with him, and follow him wherever he goes. If you can
          but have him present with you in the furnace of affliction, in exile,
          prison, or blood, you are content. For this end you must take hold of
          him never to part.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. The second thing proposed, was, to show what security this will be
          against the day of wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Thus you will be secured from eternal wrath. When the great day
          of wrath comes, and all the enemies of God are before him in one body
          on the left hand, you will be on the right. You will stand with Christ
          on the field, until you see with him the backs of all his enemies,
          while they are driven with horrible roarings into the bottomless pit.
          And when they are closed up there under the load of everlasting wrath,
          you shall get your "crowns on your heads, and palms in your hands,"
          and help to make Heaven ring eternally with your hallelujahs.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, In a day of wrath upon the land; though the storm blow never so
          hard, you shall have a manifold security. Though you must not promise
          yourselves security from trouble, yet,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. You shall be kept from mixing with the generation under God's
          wrath. You are to set up the partition-wall this day between you and
          them; do it firmly, and assuredly in the heat of the wrath it shall
          stand. Build you the partition-wall, and God will build the
          protection-wall, Psalm 12:7, "You shall keep them, O Lord, you shall
          preserve them from this generation forever." There are two generations
          in the world, the righteous and the wicked; those who fear God, and
          those who fear him not; but they are separate parties, opposite to one
          another: and they shall never mix. I confess, the two parties at this
          day are too near one another in the Church of Scotland. They are like
          the toes of Nebuchadnezzar's image, part of clay, and part of iron;
          yet "iron is not mixed with clay," Daniel 2:41, 43, etc. And when God
          kindles his fire, it will make men of like natures run together, and
          make the separation greater; and the one generation may be less bulky,
          but nothing less worth; and the other generation more bulky, but less
          worth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. "It may be, you shall be hidden in the day of the Lord's anger,"
          Zephaniah 2:3. May be God may hide you in Heaven before then, as he
          has been doing with many eminent ministers and Christians of late,
          "taking them away from the evil to come." Or he can hide you under
          Heaven, for "the earth is the Lord's:" and though men allow you not a
          hole to hide your head in, he can give you a broad place, whether they
          will or not. Though it be a very open place, he can draw a curtain
          over you, where the sharpest-sighted enemy shall not see through. He
          has an invisible lock and key on every place, where the most resolute
          and quick-sighted searchers may not be able to open the door, and see
          who is therein.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. You shall not be straitened for provision, though it be a scarce
          time, Psalm 142:6, "I cried unto you, O Lord, I said, you are my
          refuge, and my portion in the land of the living." Though it may be
          hard to get a sermon without, you shall have two preachers within.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The bosom-preacher will be with you, that has his pulpit in the
          breast; that is a good conscience, one of the sweetest preachers that
          ever opened a mouth, that fills all his hearers with joy, 2
          Corinthians 1:12, "Our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our
          conscience," etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The heart-preacher, that has his pulpit in the heavens; that is,
          Christ himself by his Holy Spirit, who is always a successful
          preacher, whose hearers are ever taught to profit: Psalm 32:8, "I will
          instruct you, and teach you in the way which you shall go: I will
          guide you with mine eye." He will be to you as a "little sanctuary."
          And these will carry you through until you come to your journey's end.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Though the weight of common calamity should bruise you, yes, and
          crush you," there shall no evil touch you," Job 5:19.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) No evil that is an only evil; mercy shall always be predominant
          in your cup.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The evil shall be taken out of the evils that come on you. So
          that (verse 22), "at destruction and famine you shall laugh: neither
          shall you be afraid of the beasts of the earth." You shall say as
          Paul, 1 Corinthians 15:55, "O death where is your sting? O grave where
          is your victory?" "There shall be no more curse." God shoots poisoned
          arrows at his enemies, but none of these at his friends. The serpent
          shall be unstinged. May be you will think, before all be done, you
          feel a sting; but assure yourself it will be but a bee-sting, that
          goes only skin-deep, Matthew 10:28, "And fear not them which kill the
          body, but are not able to kill the soul," etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) The evils that may come on you, shall be turned to good, Romans
          8:28, "And we know, that all things work together for good to them
          that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."
          Every stone thrown at you, shall turn a precious stone; and the most
          cross wind shall drive you to your harbor.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. The third thing proposed, was, to confirm the doctrine. And here
          only two things may be noticed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, He who thus manages this ordinance, unites with Christ, the
          peace-maker; Christ is his; his security is in him, for Christ is in
          him, Galatians 4:19, he cannot die. His blood is sprinkled on his
          people, and that marks them for the Lord. The Father has given all
          into his hand; and now though he be a lion to others, he is a lamb to
          them; and so he will not hurt them himself: a Lamb, a male of the
          first year, in his prime; not a bone broken, in his fall strength,
          though sacrificed for them; therefore he is able to defend them, and
          will not let his enemies hurt them; slain and roasted with fire,
          therefore justice has no more to crave of them: without blemish, and
          therefore can cover all theirs.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, He gets all this sealed under the broad seal of Heaven in this
          ordinance. Herein the covenant of peace between God and sinners is
          sealed in both hands; and all these, and much more, are promises and
          articles of the covenant. And what greater security can you imagine in
          this world?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">IV. Fourthly, I proceed to the application.</p>
        <p align="justify">USE I. For information.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, The slighters of this ordinance, especially at such a time, are
          great fools, and despisers of their own mercy. Some remain in their
          gross ignorance, and have no such esteem of it, as to set them on to
          great knowledge. Some live in their profanity; and having no mind to
          be abridged of their sinful liberty, have slighted all these, and, it
          seems, will slight them to the last. Some, if the least demur be made
          about their admission, if but spoke to about amending what is a
          reproach to the gospel in their conversation, presently cast it off,
          and inquire no more about it. And some that formerly have sat down at
          that table, cast at that and other ordinances altogether. Well, sirs,
          I must tell you, you are slighters of your own mercy; and the slight
          redounds to Christ himself, whose ordinance it is, and will lie heavy
          on your souls if ever your eyes be opened. The day of wrath will
          either rouse and bow, or break your careless, proud, and presumptuous
          spirits. Those things may serve to blind your consciences now, that
          will fall off like fig-leaf covers, when God comes to call you to an
          account for your opportunities of grace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, The mismanagers of this ordinance are great fools, who sit down
          at the Lord's table, but communicate not believingly. They do the
          outward work, but it is not in faith; they bring no faith, no sense,
          no discerning, etc; and so instead of securing themselves against the
          day of wrath, do mark themselves out for wrath. Ah! miserable work,
          for men to turn the food of their souls into poison; so to manage the
          treaty of peace with God, that they part greater enemies than before!
          The sin of mock-covenanting, and unworthy communicating, will be a
          dreadful item in the day of wrath here and hereafter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">USE II. Of exhortation.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, You that are not communicants, you are in hazard of the day of
          wrath as well as others, though you sit not at the table. Will you by
          faith embrace the sacrifice exhibited there; receive and sprinkle the
          blood, the covenant sealed there.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Communicants, manage this work so as you may be secured against
          the day of wrath. All of you, flee into Christ Jesus as the city of
          refuge; and make sure work, and lay down your measures for time and
          for eternity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 1. Consider that there will certainly be a great day of wrath
          upon the world. "Our God will come." The day is coming when the dead
          shall be raised, and all shall be brought before the tribunal. Eternal
          wrath will then sweep away all that shall be found out of Christ at
          that day. Where will you then appear, O slighters and despisers of
          Christ?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOT. 2. We have all imaginable grounds to look for a day of wrath
          against this church and these lands. The plague is begun already as to
          this poor church; her beauty is defaced; we have all left God, and he
          has left us in great measure: we have broken off from God, and are
          broken among ourselves. There is much of the carved work of Zion
          broken down already: and we have all ground to expect a root-stroke to
          the whole of the covenanted work of reformation. Matters are brought
          to that pass, that our lands can hardly miss to be a field of blood.
          The sins of the late times are like the iniquity of Baal-peor, which
          kindled the anger of the Lord against the congregation of Israel, and
          brought on a plague among them; and the iniquity of these times has
          not been suitably mourned over to this day. A spirit of apostasy and
          declining is on the growing hand among all ranks; the cry of our sins
          is gone up to Heaven: and, notwithstanding all the alarming
          dispensations of the day, there is a visible hardness and stupidity on
          the generation, and the spirit of prayer is restrained, that we cannot
          see how we can escape. Prepare then to meet your God; and how will you
          do it but in Christ?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I would only say two things.—</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Seeing the glorious gospel-light has so shined among us, and that
          contempt of it and of religion does so appear in the sight of the sun,
          and a profane spirit does so much rage, it is very like God will have
          a particular eye for evil on the profane despisers of religion among
          us.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Seeing there is some ground to think that we shall yet have
          glorious days, it is like God will shovel out of the way many, that
          their eyes shall never see it; and that it will make a sad scattering
          among formal professors, strangers to the life of godliness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOT. 3. Consider Christ is now offering himself and the covenant of
          peace to us. It is time to he going when the Lord is risen up, and is
          drawing out his armies against us; to tremble when the lion roars.
          Come then, lest you "mourn at the last, and say, How have I hated
          instruction, and my heart despised reproof? and have not obeyed the
          voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed
          me?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I close with two or three words of advice to those that resolve so to
          manage this sacrament, as that they may be secured against the day of
          wrath.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Let not the thoughts of wrath prevail to darken your view of the
          love of Christ in the gospel and in this ordinance. Particularly
          assure yourselves if you be willing to be the Lord's, and take him for
          your God, the white side of the cloud is to you; and that though God
          were to destroy the whole land from off the face of the earth, if
          there were but one soul who would take shelter in the covenant of
          peace, he should be welcome.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) As you give yourselves to the Lord, so give your families too.
          Take all yours that way, and lay them over on him, and leave them with
          him for the evil day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Let it be your main concern to get strength to be carried cleanly
          through; that you be not led away with the sins and snares of the evil
          time, and so fall from your steadfastness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) lastly, Be not peremptory and particular as to what other wise
          may be your portion of common calamity; but leave that on the Lord.
          Only in this be particular, that the sting of the curse must be taken
          away, and therefore that you must put yourselves in the bottom of the
          everlasting covenant, and give yourselves to Christ as the great
          Steersman through the sea of this world, leaving that to him what
          weather you shall meet with in your voyage to Immanuel's land.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thus I have delivered my message to you from the Lord, as that which I
          judged is God's mind and call to you at this day. I desire to venture
          myself for time and eternity on this bottom; and it is my request to
          you, that you will take this method this day for your security against
          the day of wrath. And if I should never have another occasion of this
          nature to speak unto you, I would leave it with you, That this, and
          this only, is the way to be secured against the day of wrath.
