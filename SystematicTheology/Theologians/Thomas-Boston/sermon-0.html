    Section I. MAN'S LIFE IS VANITY</p>
</font></b>
<p align="justify">"For I know that you will bring me to <b>death</b>, and 

    to the house appointed for all living." Job 30:23.</p>
<p align="justify">I come now to discourse of man's eternal state, into 

    which he enters by death. Of this entrance, Job takes a solemn serious view, 

    in the words of the text, which contain a general truth, and a particular 

    application of it. The general truth is supposed; namely, that all men must, 

    by death, remove out of this world; they must die. But where must they go? 

    They must go to the house appointed for all living; to the grave, that 

    darksome, gloomy, solitary house, in the land of forgetfulness. Wherever the 

    body is laid up until the resurrection, there, as to a dwelling-house, death 

    brings us home. While we are in the body, we are but in a lodging-house, in 

    an inn, on our way homeward. When we come to our grave, we come to our home, 

    our <i>long home</i>, Eccl. 12:5. </p>
<p align="justify">All living must be inhabitants of this house, good and 

    bad, old and young. Man's life is a stream, running into death's devouring 

    deeps. Those who now live in palaces, must leave them, and go home to this 

    house; and those who have not where to lay their heads, shall thus have a 

    house at length. It is appointed for all, by Him whose counsel shall stand. 

    This appointment cannot be shifted; it is a law which mortals cannot 

    transgress. Job's application of this general truth to himself, is expressed 

    in these words: "For I know that you will bring me to death, and to the 

    house appointed for all living." He knew, that he must meet with death; that 

    his soul and body must part; that God, who had set the time, would certainly 

    see it kept. Sometimes Job was inviting death to come to him, and carry him 

    home to its house; yes, he was in the hazard of running to it before the 

    time– Job 7:15, "My soul chooses strangling, and death rather than my life." 

    But here he considers God would bring him to it; yes, bring him back to it, 

    as the word imports. Whereby he seems to intimate, that we have no life in 

    this world, but as runaways from death, which stretches out its cold arms, 

    to receive us from the womb– but though we do then narrowly escape its 

    clutches, we cannot escape long; we shall be brought back again to it. Job 

    knew this, he had laid it down as a certainly, and was looking for it.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I.</p></b> <b>ALL MUST DIE</b>. </font>Although this doctrine 

    is confirmed by the experience of all former generations, ever since Abel 

    entered into the house appointed for all living, and though the living know 

    that they shall die, yet it is needful to discourse of the certainty of 

    death, that it may be impressed on the mind, and duly considered.
<p align="justify">Therefore consider, </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">1.</p></b> <b>There is an unalterable statute of death</b>, 

    under which all men are concluded. "It is appointed unto men once to die," 

    Heb. 9:27. It is laid up for them, as parents lay up for their children– 

    they may look for it, and cannot miss it; seeing God has designed and 

    reserved it for them. There is no peradventure in it; "we must die," II Sam. 

    14:14. Though some men will not <i>hear</i> of death, yet every man must <i>

    see</i> death, Psalm 89:48. Death is a champion all must grapple with– we 

    must enter the lists with it, and it will have the mastery, Eccl. 8:8, 

    "There is no man that has power over the spirit, to retain the spirit; 

    neither has he power in the day of death." Those indeed who are found alive 

    at Christ's coming, shall all be changed, I Cor. 15:51. But that change will 

    be equivalent to death, will answer the purposes of it. All other people 

    must go the common road, the way of all flesh.
<b>
<p align="justify">2. Let us consult daily observation</p></b>. Every man "sees 

    that wise men die, likewise the fool and brutish person," Psalm 49:10. There 

    is room enough on this earth for us, notwithstanding the multitudes that 

    were upon it before us. They are gone, to make room for us; as we must 

    depart, to make room for others. It is long since death began to transport 

    men into another world, and vast multitudes are gone there already– yet the 

    work is going on still; death is carrying off new inhabitants daily, to the 

    house appointed for all living. Who has ever heard the grave say, It is 

    enough! Long has it been getting, but still it asks. This world is like a 

    great fair or market, where some are coming in, others going out; while the 

    assembly that is in it is confusion, and the most part know not why they are 

    come together; or, like a town situated on the road to a great city, through 

    which some travelers have passed, some are passing, while others are only 

    coming in, Eccl. 1:4, "One generation passes away, and another generation 

    comes– but the earth abides forever." 
<p align="justify">Death is an inexorable, irresistible messenger, who 

    cannot be diverted from executing his orders by the force of the mighty, the 

    bribes of the rich, or the entreaties of the poor. It does not reverence the 

    hoary head, nor pity the harmless babe. The bold and daring cannot outbrave 

    it; nor can the faint-hearted obtain a discharge in this war. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">3. The human body consists of perishing materials</p></b>, 

    Gen. 3:19, "<b>Dust</b> you are, and unto dust you shall return." The 

    strongest are but brittle earthen vessels, easily broken in shivers. The 

    soul is but basely housed, while in this mortal body, which is not a house 

    of <i>stone</i>, but a house of <i>clay</i>, the mud walls cannot but molder 

    away; especially seeing the foundation is not on a rock, but in the dust; 

    they are crushed before the moth, though this insect be so tender that the 

    gentle touch of a finger will destroy it, Job 4:19. 
<p align="justify">These materials are like gunpowder; a very small spark 

    lighting on them will set them on fire, and blow up the house– the seed of a 

    raison, or a hair in milk, having choked men, and laid the house of clay in 

    the dust. If we consider the frame and structure of our bodies, how 

    fearfully and wonderfully we are made; and on how regular and exact a motion 

    of the fluids, and balance of humors, our life depends; and that <i>death 

    has as many doors to enter in by, as the body has pores</i>; and if we 

    compare the soul and body together, we may justly reckon, that there is 

    somewhat more astonishing in our <i>life</i>, than in our <i>death</i>; and 

    that it is <i>more strange to see dust walking up and down on the dust, than 

    lying down in it. </i></p>

<p align="justify">Though the lamp of our life may not be violently blown 

    out, yet the flame must go out at length for lack of oil. What are those 

    distempers and diseases which we are liable to, but death's harbingers, that 

    come to prepare his way? They meet us, as soon as we set our foot on earth, 

    to tell us at our entry, that<i> we do but come into the world to go out 

    again. </i>Nevertheless, some are snatched away in a moment, without being 

    warned by sickness or disease. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">4. We have sinful souls, and therefore have dying bodies–</p></b> 

    death follows sin, as the shadow follows the body. The wicked must die, by 

    virtue of the threatening of the covenant of works, Gen. 2:17, "In the day 

    that you eat thereof, you shall surely die." And the godly must die too, 

    that as death entered by sin, sin may go out by death. Christ has taken away 

    the sting of death, as to them; though he has not as yet removed death 

    itself. Therefore, though it fastens on them, as the viper did on Paul's 

    hand, it shall do them no harm– but because the leprosy of sin is in the 

    walls of the house, it must be broken down, and all the materials thereof 

    carried forth. 
<b>
<p align="justify">5. Man's life</p></b> in this world, according to the 

    Scripture account of it,<b> is but a few degrees removed from death.</b> The 

    Scripture represents it as a vain and empty thing, short in its continuance, 

    and swift in its passing away.
<p align="justify">First, Man's life is a vain and empty thing– while it is, 

    it vanishes away; and lo! it is not. Job 7:6, "My days are vanity." If we 

    suspect afflicted <i>Job</i> of partiality in this matter, hear the wise and 

    prosperous <i>Solomon's</i> character of the days of his life, Eccl. 7:15, 

    "All things have I seen in the days of my vanity," that is, my vain days. <i>

    Moses</i>, who was a very active man, compares our days to a sleep, Psalm 

    90:5, "They are as a sleep," which is not noticed until it is ended. The 

    resemblance is just– few men have right apprehensions of life, until death 

    awaken them; then we begin to know that we were living. "We spend our years 

    as a tale that is told," ver. 9. When an idle tale is telling it may affect 

    a little; but when it is ended, it is remembered no more– and so is a man 

    forgotten, when the <i>fable of his life</i> is ended. It is as a dream, or 

    vision of the night, in which there is nothing solid; when one awakes, all 

    vanishes; Job 20:8, "He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found; 

    yes, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night." It is but a vain 

    show or image; Psalm 39:6, "Surely every man walks in a vain show." Man, in 

    this world, is but as it were a walking statue– his life is but an <i>image 

    of life</i>, there is so much of death in it.</p>
<p align="justify">If we look on our life, in the several periods of it, we 

    shall find it <i>a heap of vanities</i>. "<b>Childhood</b> and youth are 

    vanity," Eccl. 11:10. We come into the world the most helpless of all 

    animals– young birds and beasts can do something for themselves, but infant 

    man is altogether unable to help himself. Our childhood is spent in pitiful 

    trifling pleasures, which become the scorn of our after thoughts. <b>Youth</b> 

    is a flower that soon withers, a blossom that quickly falls off; it is a 

    space of time in which we are rash, foolish, and inconsiderate, pleasing 

    ourselves with a variety of vanities, and swimming as it were through a 

    flood of them. </p>
<p align="justify">But before we are aware it is past; and we are, in <b>

    middle age</b>, encompassed with a thick cloud of cares, through which we 

    must grope; and finding ourselves beset with prickling thorns of 

    difficulties, through them we must force our way, to accomplish the projects 

    and contrivances of our riper thoughts. The more we solace ourselves in any 

    earthly enjoyment we attain to, the more bitterness do we find in parting 

    with it. </p>
<p align="justify">Then comes <b>old age</b>, attended with its own train of 

    infirmities, labor, and sorrow, Psalm 90:10, and sets us down next door to 

    the grave. In a word, "All flesh is like grass," Isa. 40:6. Every stage or 

    period in life, is vanity. "Man at his best state," his middle age, when the 

    heat of youth is spent, and the sorrows of old age have not yet overtaken 

    him, "is altogether vanity," Psalm 39:5. Death carries off some in the bud 

    of childhood, others in the blossom of youth, and others when they are come 

    to their fruit; few are left standing, until, like ripe corn, they forsake 

    the ground– all die one time or other.<br/>

 </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">II. Man's life is a SHORT thing</p></b>.</font> It is not 

    only a vanity, but <i>a short-lived vanity</i>. Consider, 
<b>
<p align="justify">1. How the life of man is reckoned in the Scriptures. </p></b>

    It was indeed sometimes reckoned by hundreds of <b>years</b>– but no man 

    ever arrived at a thousand, which yet bears no proportion to eternity. Now 

    hundreds are brought down to scores; threescore and ten, or fourscore, is 

    its utmost length, Psalm 90:10. But few men arrive at that length of life. 

    Death does but rarely wait, until men be bowing down, by reason of age, to 

    meet the grave. Yet, as if years were too big a word for such a small thing 

    as the life of man on earth, we find it counted by <b>months</b>, Job 14:5. 

    "The number of his <i>months</i> are with you." Our course, like that of the 

    moon, is run in a little time– we are always waxing or waning, until we 

    disappear. 
<p align="justify">But frequently it is reckoned by <b>days</b>; and these 

    but few, Job 14:1, "Man, that is born of a woman, is of few <i>days</i>." 

    No, it is but one day, in Scripture account; and that a hireling's day, who 

    will precisely observe when his day ends, and give over his work, ver. 6, 

    "Until he shall accomplish as an hireling his day." </p>
<p align="justify">Yes, the Scripture brings it down to the shortest space 

    of time, and calls it a <b>moment</b>, II Cor. 4:17, "Our light affliction," 

    though it last all our life long, "is but for a <i>moment</i>." Elsewhere it 

    is brought down yet to a lower pitch, farther than which one cannot carry 

    it, Psalm 39:5, "My age is as <b>nothing</b> before you." Agreeably to this, 

    Solomon tells us, Eccl. 3:2, "There is a time to be <i>born</i>, and a time 

    to <i>die</i>"; but makes no mention of a time to <i>live</i>, as if our 

    life were but a skip from the womb to the grave.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">2. Consider the various SIMILITUDES by which the 

    Scripture represents the shortness of man's life.</p></b> Hear Hezekiah, Isa. 

    38:12, "My age is departed, and is removed from me as a <i>shepherd's tent</i>; 

    I am cut off like a <i>weaver's shuttle</i>." The shepherd's tent is soon 

    removed; for the flocks must not feed long in one place; such is a man's 

    life on this earth, quickly gone. It is a web which he is incessantly 

    working; he is not idle so much as for one moment– in a short time it is 

    wrought, and then it is cut off. Every breathing is a thread in this web; 

    when the last breath is drawn, the web is woven out; he expires, and then it 

    is cut off, he breathes no more. 
<p align="justify">Man is like <i>grass</i>, and like a <i>flower</i>, Isa. 

    40:6. "All flesh," even the strongest and most healthy flesh, "is <i>grass</i>, 

    and all the goodness thereof is as the flower of the field." The grass is 

    flourishing in the morning; but, being cut down by the mowers, in the 

    evening it is withered– so man sometimes is walking up and down at ease in 

    the morning, and in the evening is lying a corpse, being struck down by a 

    sudden blow, with one or other of death's weapons. </p>
<p align="justify">The <i>flower</i>, at best, is but a weak and tender 

    thing, of short continuance wherever it grows– but observe, man is not 

    compared to the flower of the garden; but to the flower of the field, which 

    the foot of every beast may tread down at any time. Thus is our life liable 

    to a thousand accidents every day, any of which may cut us off. But though 

    we should escape all these, yet at length this grass withers, this flower 

    fades by itself. It is carried off "as the <i>cloud</i> is consumed, and 

    vanishes away," Job 7:9. It looks big as the morning cloud, which promises 

    great things, and raises the expectation of the husbandman; but the sun 

    rises, and the cloud is scattered; <i>death comes, and man vanishes!</i></p>

<p align="justify">The apostle James proposes the question, "What is your 

    life?" chapter 4:14. Hear his answer, "It is even a <i>vapor</i>, that 

    appears for a little time, and then vanishes away." It is frail, uncertain, 

    and does not last. It is as <i>smoke</i>, which goes out of the chimney, as 

    if it would darken the face of the heavens; but quickly it is scattered, and 

    appears no more– thus goes man's life, and "where is he?" It is <i>wind</i>, 

    Job 7:7, "O remember that my life is wind." It is but a passing blast, a 

    short puff, "a wind that passes away, and comes not again," Psalm 78:39. Our

    <i>breath</i> is in our nostrils, as if it were always upon the wing to 

    depart; ever passing and repassing, like a traveler, until it goes away, not 

    to return until the heavens be no more.<br/>

 </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">III. Man's life is a SWIFT thing</p></b></font>; not only a 

    passing, but <i>a flying vanity</i>. Have you not observed how swiftly a 

    shadow runs along the ground, in a cloudy and a windy day, suddenly 

    darkening the places beautified before with the beams of the sun, but is 

    suddenly disappearing? Such is the life of man on the earth, for "he flees 

    as a shadow, and continues not," Job 14:2. A weaver's shuttle is very swift 

    in its motion; in a moment it is thrown from one side of the web to the 

    other; yet "our days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle," chap. 7:6. <i>How 

    quickly is man tossed through time, into eternity!</i> See how Job describes 

    the swiftness of the time of life, chap. 9:25-26. "Now my days are swifter 

    than a runner; they flee away, they see no good. They are passed away as the 

    swift ships; as the eagle that hastens to the prey." He compares his days 

    with a <i>runner</i>, who runs speedily to carry tidings, and will make no 

    stop. But though the runner were like Ahimaaz, who overrun Cushi, our days 

    would be swifter than he; for they flee away, like a man fleeing for his 

    life before the pursuing enemy; he runs with his utmost vigor, yet our days 

    run as fast as he. 
<p align="justify">But this is not all; even he who is fleeing for his life, 

    cannot run always– he must needs sometimes stand still, lie down, or turn in 

    somewhere, as Sisera did into Jael's tent, to refresh himself– <i>but our 

    time never halts! </i>Therefore it is compared to <i>ships</i>, that can 

    sail night and day without intermission, until they reach their port; and to 

    swift ships, ships of desire, in which men quickly arrive at their desired 

    haven; or ships of pleasure, that sail more swiftly than ships of burden. 

    Yet the wind failing, the ship's course is checked– but <i>our time always 

    runs with a rapid course! </i>Therefore it is compared to the <i>eagle</i> 

    flying; not with his ordinary flight, for that is not sufficient to 

    represent the swiftness of our days; but when he flies upon his prey, which 

    is with an extraordinary swiftness. And thus, even thus, our days flee away.<br/>

 </p>
<p align="justify">Having thus discoursed of death, let us

    <font color="#ff0000"><b>APPLY</b></font> the subject in discerning the 

    vanity of the world; in bearing up, with Christian contentment and patience 

    under all troubles and difficulties in it; in mortifying our lusts; in 

    cleaving unto the Lord with full purpose of heart, at all hazards, and in 

    preparing for death's approach.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">I. </p></b></font>Let us hence, as in a looking-glass,<font color="#0000ff">
<b>Behold the vanity of the world</b></font>, and of all those things in it, 

    which men so much value and esteem; and therefore set their hearts upon. The 

    rich and the poor are equally intent upon gaining this world; they bow the 

    knee to it; yet it is but a <i>clay god</i>– they court the bulky vanity, 

    and run eagerly to catch this shadow. The rich man is hugged to death in its 

    embraces; and the poor man wearies himself in the fruitless pursuit. What 

    wonder if the world's smiles overcome us, when we pursue it so eagerly, even 

    while it frowns upon us!
<p align="justify">But look into the grave! O man! consider and be wise; 

    listen to the doctrine of death; and learn, </p>
<p align="justify">1. that, "hold as hard as you can, you shall be forced to 

    let go your hold of the world at length." Though you load yourself with the 

    fruits of this earth; yet all shall fall off when you come to creep into 

    your hole, the house, under ground, appointed for all living. When death 

    comes, you must bid an eternal farewell to your enjoyments in this world– 

    you must leave your goods to another; Luke 12:20, "And whose shall those 

    things be which you have provided?" </p>
<p align="justify">2. Your portion of these things shall be very little 

    before long. If you lie down on the grass, and stretch yourself at full 

    length, and observe the print of your body when you rise, you may see how 

    much of this earth will fall to your share at last. It may be you shall get 

    a coffin, and a winding-sheet; but you are not sure of that; many who have 

    had abundance of wealth, yet have not had so much when they took up their 

    new house in the land of silence. But however that be, more you cannot 

    expect. </p>
<p align="justify">It was a sobering lesson, which Saladin, when dying, gave 

    to his soldiers. He called for his standard bearer, and ordered him to take 

    his shroud upon a pole, and go out to the camp with it, and declare that of 

    all his conquests, victories, and triumphs, he had nothing now left him, but 

    that piece of linen to wrap his body in for burial. </p>
<p align="justify">3. "This world is a false friend," who leaves a man in 

    time of greatest need, and flees from him when he has most to do. When you 

    are lying on a deathbed, all your friends and relatives cannot rescue you; 

    all your substance cannot ransom you, nor procure you a reprieve for one 

    day; no, not for one hour! Yes, the more you possess of this world's goods, 

    your sorrow at death is likely to be the greater; for though one may live 

    more commodiously in a palace than in a cottage, yet he may die more easily 

    in the cottage, where he has very little to make him fond of life.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">II.</p></b></font> It may serve as <font color="#0000ff"><b>a 

    storehouse for Christian contentment and patience under worldly losses and 

    crosses.</b></font> A close application of the doctrine of death is an 

    excellent remedy against fretting, and gives some ease to a troubled heart. 

    When Job had sustained very great losses, he sat down contented, with this 

    meditation, Job 1:21, "Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall 

    I return there; the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the 

    name of the Lord." When Providence brings a mortality or disease among your 

    cattle, how ready are you to fret and complain! but the serious 

    consideration of your own death, to which you have a notable help from such 

    providential occurrences, may be of use to silence your complaints, and 

    quiet your spirits. Look to "the house appointed for all living," and learn,

    
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">1. That you must suffer a more severe tragedy than the 

    loss of worldly goods.</p></b></font> Do not cry out because of an illness in 

    the leg or arm– for before long there will be a long home thrust at the 

    heart. You may lose your dearest relations– the wife may lose her husband, 

    and the husband his wife; the parents may lose their dear children and the 

    children their parents; but if any of these trials happen to you, remember 

    you must lose your own life at last; and "Why does a living man complain?" 

    Lam. 3:39. It is always profitable to consider, under affliction, that our 

    case might have been worse than it is. Whatever is consumed, or taken from 

    us, "It is of the Lord's mercies that we ourselves are not consumed," ver. 

    22. 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. It is but for a short space of time that we are in 

    this world.</p></b></font> It is but a little that our necessities require in so 

    short a space of time; when death comes, we shall stand in need of none of 

    these things. Why should men rack their heads with cares how to provide for 

    tomorrow; while they know not if they shall then need anything? Though a 

    man's provision for his journey be nearly spent, he is not disquieted, if he 

    thinks he is near home. Are you working by candle light, and is there <i>

    little</i> of your candle left? It may be there is as little sand in your 

    glass; and if so, you have little use for it. 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3.</p></b> <b>You have matters of great weight that challenge 

    your care.</b></font><b> </b>Death is at the door, beware that you lose not 

    your souls. If blood breaks out at one part of the body, they often open a 

    vein in another part of it, to turn the stream of the blood, and to stop it. 

    Thus the Spirit of God sometimes cures men of sorrow for earthly things, by 

    opening the heart-vein to bleed for sin. Did we pursue heavenly things more 

    vigorously when our affairs in this life prosper not, we should thereby gain 

    a double advantage– our worldly sorrow would be diverted, and our best 

    treasure increased.

<p align="justify">4.</p></b> <b>Crosses of this nature will not last long.</b></font> 

    The world's smiles and frowns will quickly be buried together in everlasting 

    forgetfulness. Its <i>smiles</i> go away like foam on the water; and its <i>

    frowns</i> are as a passing ache in a man's side. Time flies away with swift 

    wings, and carries our earthly comforts, and crosses too, along with it– 

    neither of them will accompany us into "the house appointed for all living." 

    "For in death the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. 

    Even prisoners are at ease in death, with no guards to curse them. Rich and 

    poor are there alike, and the slave is free from his master." Job 3:17-19.
<p align="justify">Cast a look into eternity, and you will see affliction 

    here in this world, is but for a moment. The truth is, our time is so very 

    short, that it will not allow either our joys or griefs to come to 

    perfection. Therefore, let them "that weep be as though they wept not; and 

    those who rejoice as though they rejoiced not," etc., I Cor. 7:29-31. </p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">5.</p></b> <b>Death will put all men on the same level.</b></font><b>
</b>The king and the beggar must dwell in one house, when they come to their 

    journey's end; though their entertainment by the way may be very different. 

    "The small and the great are there," Job 3:19. We are all in this world as 

    on a stage; it is no great matter, whether a man acts the part of a prince 

    or a peasant, for when they have acted their parts, they must both get 

    behind the curtain, and appear no more.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">6.</p></b> <b>If you are not in Christ</b></font>, whatever 

    your afflictions now be, "troubles a thousand times worse, are abiding you 

    in another world." <i>Death will turn your crosses into pure unmixed curses!</i> 

    and then, how gladly would you return to your former afflicted state, and 

    purchase it at any rate, were there any possibility of such a return. 
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">7. If you are in Christ</p></b></font>, you may well bear 

    your cross.<i> Death will put an end to all your troubles. </i>If <i>a man 

    on a journey</i> is not well accommodated, where he lodges only for a night, 

    he will not trouble himself much about the matter; because he is not to stay 

    there, it is not his home. <i>You are on the road to eternity!</i> let it 

    not distress you that you meet with some hardships in the 'inn of this 

    world'. Fret not, because it is not so well with you as with some others. 

    One man travels with a cane in his hand; his fellow traveler, perhaps, has 

    but a common staff or stick– either of them will serve the turn. It is no 

    great matter which of them be yours; both will be laid aside when you come 

    to your journey's end.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">III. It may serve for a bridle, to curb all manner of 

    lusts</p></b></font>, particularly those conversant about the body. A serious 

    visit made to cold death, and that solitary mansion, the grave, might be of 

    good use to repress them.
<p align="justify">(1.) It may be of use to cause men to cease from their 

    INORDINATE CARE FOR THE BODY; which is to many the bane of their souls. 

    Often do these questions, "What shall we eat? what shall we drink? and with 

    what shall we be clothed?" leave no room for another of more importance, 

    namely, "With what shall I come before the Lord?" The <i>soul</i> is put on 

    the shelf, to answer these base questions in favor of the <i>body</i>; while 

    its own eternal interests are neglected. But ah! why are men so busy to 

    repair <i>the ruinous cottage</i>; leaving <i>the inhabitant</i> to bleed to 

    death of his wounds, unheeded, unregarded? Why so much care for the body, to 

    the neglect of the concerns of the immortal soul? O do not be so anxious for 

    what can only serve your bodies; since, before long, the clods of cold earth 

    will serve for back and belly too!</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It may abate your pride on account of BODILY 

    ENDOWMENTS, which vain man is apt to glory in. Value not yourselves on the 

    blossom of <b>youth</b>; for while you are in your blooming years, you are

    <i>but ripening for a grave</i>; death gives the fatal stroke, without 

    asking any body's age. Do not boast in your <b>strength</b>, it will quickly 

    be gone– <i>the time will soon be, when you shall not be able to turn 

    yourselves on a bed; </i>and you must be carried by your grieving friends to 

    your long home. And what signifies your <b>healthful</b> constitution? Death 

    does not always enter in soonest where it begins soonest to knock at the 

    door; but makes as great dispatch with some in a few hours, as with others 

    in many years.</p>
<p align="justify">Do not value yourselves on your <b>beauty</b>, which 

    "shall consume in the grave," Psalm 49:14. Remember the change which death 

    makes on the fairest face, Job 14:20– "You always overpower them, and then 

    they pass from the scene. You disfigure them in death and send them away." 

    Death makes the greatest beauty so loathsome, that it must be buried out of 

    sight. Could a mirror be used in "the house appointed for all living," it 

    would be a terror to those who now look oftener into their mirrors than into 

    their Bibles. And what though the body be gorgeously arrayed? The finest <i>

    clothes</i> are but badges of our sin and shame; and in a little time will 

    be exchanged for a shroud, when the body will become a feast to the worms!</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) It may be A CHECK UPON SENSUALITY AND FLESHLY LUSTS. 

    1 Peter 2:11, "I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly 

    lusts, which war against the soul." It is hard to cause wet wood to take 

    fire; and when the fire does take hold of it, it is soon extinguished. 

    Sensuality makes men most unfit for divine communications, and is an 

    effectual means to quench the Spirit. <i>Intemperance in eating and drinking</i> 

    carries on the ruin of soul and body at once; and hastens death, while it 

    makes the man most unfit for it. Therefore, "Be careful, or your hearts will 

    be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and 

    that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap." Luke 21:34</p>
<p align="justify">But O how often is the soul struck through with a dart, 

    in gratifying the senses! At these doors destruction enters in. Therefore 

    Job "made a covenant with his eyes," chap. 31:1. "The mouth of a strange 

    woman is a deep pit– he that is abhorred of the Lord, shall fall therein," 

    Prov. 22:14. "Let him that stands, take heed lest he fall," I Cor. 10:12. 

    Beware of lustful pleasure; study modesty in your apparel, words, and 

    actions. The ravens of the valley of death will at length pick out the 

    lustful eye– the obscene filthy tongue will at length be quiet, in the land 

    of silence; and grim death, embracing the body in its cold arms, will 

    effectually allay the heat of all fleshly lusts!</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) In a word, it may CHECK OUR EARTHLY-MINDEDNESS; and 

    at once knock down "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the 

    pride of life." Ah! if we must die why are we <i>so fond of</i> <i>temporal 

    things</i>; so anxious to get them, so eager in the embraces of them, so 

    mightily bothered with the loss of them? </p>
<p align="justify">Let me, upon a view of "the house appointed for all 

    living," address the worldling in the words of Solomon. Prov. 23:5, "Will 

    you set your eyes upon that which is not?" For riches certainly make 

    themselves wings, "they flee away as an eagle towards heaven." Riches, and 

    all worldly things are but 'a lovely nothing'; they are that which is not. 

    They are not what they seem to be– they are but gilded vanities, that 

    deceive the eye. </p>
<p align="justify">Comparatively, they are not; there is infinitely more of 

    nothingness and non-being, than of being, or reality, in the best of them.

    <i>What is the world and all that is in it,</i> but a fashion, or fair show, 

    such as men make on the stage– a passing show? I Cor. 7:31. Royal pomp is 

    but gaudy show, or appearance, in God's account, Acts 25:23. The best name 

    they get, is good things– but observe it, they are only the <i>wicked</i> 

    man's good things, Luke 16:25, "You in your lifetime received your good 

    things," says Abraham, in the parable, to the rich man in hell. Well may the 

    men of the world call these things their goods; for there is no other good 

    in them, about them, nor attending them.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, will you set your eyes upon empty shadows and 

    fancies? Will you cause your eyes to fly on them, as the word is? Shall 

    men's hearts fly out at their eyes upon them, as a ravenous bird on its 

    prey? If they do, let them know, that at length these shall flee as fast 

    away from them, as their eyes flew upon them– like a flock of fair-feathered 

    birds, that settle on a fool's ground; which, when he runs to catch them as 

    his own, do immediately take wing, fly away, and sitting down on his 

    neighbor's ground, elude his expectation, Luke 12:20, "<i>You fool</i>, this 

    night your soul shall be required of you; then whose shall these things be?"

    </p>
<p align="justify">Though <i>you</i> do not make wings to them, as many do; 

    they themselves make wings, and fly away; not as a tame house-bird, which 

    may be caught again; but as an eagle, which quickly flies out of sight, and 

    cannot be recalled. Forbear then to seek these things. O mortal! there is no 

    good reason to be given why you should set your eyes upon them. This world 

    is a great <i>inn</i>, on the road to eternity, to which you are traveling. 

    You are attended by those things, as servants belonging to the inn where you 

    lodge– they wait upon you while you are there; and when you go away, they 

    will convoy you to the door. But <i>they are not yours</i>, they will not go 

    away with you; but return to wait on other strangers, as they did on you.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It may serve as a spring of CHRISTIAN RESOLUTION, to 

    cleave to Christ, adhere to his truths, and continue in his ways; whatever 

    we may suffer for so doing. It would much allay 'the fear of man, that 

    brings a snare'. "Who are you, that you should be afraid of a man that shall 

    die?" Isa. 51:12. Look on persecutors as pieces of brittle clay, that shall 

    be dashed in pieces, for then shall you despise them as foes, that are 

    mortal; whose terror to others in the land of the living, shall quickly die 

    with themselves. </p>
<p align="justify">The serious consideration of the shortness of our time, 

    and the certainty of death, will teach us, that all the advantage which we 

    can make by our seeking the world, is not worth the while; it is not worth 

    going out of our way to get it– and what we refuse to forgo for Christ's 

    sake, may be quickly taken from us by death. But we can never lose it so 

    honorably, as for the cause of Christ, and his gospel; for what glory is it, 

    that you give up what you have in the world, when God takes it away from you 

    by death, whether you will or not? </p>
<p align="justify">This consideration may teach us to undervalue life 

    itself, and choose to forgo it, rather than to sin. The worst that men can 

    do, is to take away that life, which we cannot long keep, though all the 

    world should conspire to help us to retain the spirit. If we refuse to offer 

    it up to God when he calls for it in defense of his honor, he can take it 

    from us another way; as it fared with him, who could not burn as a martyr 

    for Christ, but was afterwards burned by an accidental fire in his house.</p>
<p align="justify">5. It may serve for a spur to INCITE US TO PREPARE FOR 

    DEATH. Consider, </p>
<p align="justify">(1.) YOUR ETERNAL STATE WILL BE ACCORDING TO THE STATE IN 

    WHICH YOU DIE– death will open the doors of heaven or hell to you. As the 

    tree falls, so it shall lie through eternity. If the infant be dead born, 

    the whole world cannot raise it to life again– and if one die out of Christ, 

    in an unregenerate state, there is no more hope for him, forever. </p>
<p align="justify">(2.) SERIOUSLY CONSIDER WHAT IT IS TO GO INTO THE ETERNAL 

    WORLD; a world of spirits, with which we are very little acquainted. How 

    frightful is converse with spirits to poor mortals in this life! and how 

    dreadful is the case, when men are hurried away into another world, not 

    knowing but that devils may be their companions forever! Let us then give 

    all diligence to make and advance our acquaintance with the Lord of that 

    world. </p>
<p align="justify">(3.) IT IS BUT A SHORT TIME YOU HAVE TO PREPARE FOR 

    DEATH– therefore now or never, seeing the time assigned for preparation will 

    soon be over. Eccl. 9:10, "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your 

    might– for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the 

    grave, where you go." <i>How can we be idle, having so great a work to do, 

    and so little time to do it in?</i> But if the time is short, the work of 

    preparation for death, though hard work, will not last long. The shadows of 

    the evening make the laborer work cheerfully; knowing the time to be at 

    hand, when he will be called in from his labor. </p>
<p align="justify">(4.) MUCH OF OUR SHORT TIME IS OVER ALREADY; and the 

    youngest of us all cannot assure himself, that there is as much of his time 

    to come, as is past. <i>Our life in the world is but a short preface to long 

    eternity; and much of the tale is told</i>. Oh! shall we not double our 

    diligence, when so much of our time is spent, and so little of our great 

    work is done? </p>
<p align="justify">(5.) THE <b>PRESENT</b> TIME IS FLYING AWAY– and we 

    cannot bring back time <b>past</b>, it has taken an eternal farewell of us– 

    there is no kindling the fire again that is burned to ashes. The time <b>to 

    come</b> is not ours– and we have no assurance of a share in it when it 

    comes.<i> </i>We have nothing we can call ours, but the present moment; and 

    that is flying away. How soon our time may be at an end, we know not. Die we 

    must– but who can tell us when? If death kept one set time for all, we were 

    in no hazard of a surprise– but daily observation shows us, that there is no 

    such thing. The flying shadow of our life allows no time for loitering. The 

    rivers run speedily into the sea, from where they came; but not so speedily 

    as man to dust, from where he came. The stream of time is the swiftest 

    current, and quickly runs out to eternity!</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) If once death carries us off, THERE IS NO COMING 

    BACK to mend our matters, Job 14:14, "If a man dies, shall he live again?" 

    Dying is a thing we cannot get a trial of; it is what we can only do once, 

    Heb. 9:27, "It is appointed unto men <i>once</i> to die." And that which can 

    be but once done, and yet is of so much importance that our all depends on 

    our doing it right, we have need to use the utmost diligence that we may do 

    it well. Therefore prepare for death.</p>
<p align="justify">If you who are unregenerate ask me, what you shall do to 

    prepare for death, that you may die safely; I answer, I have told you 

    already what must be done. Your nature and state must be changed– you must 

    be united to Jesus Christ by faith. Until this is done, you are not capable 

    of other directions, which belongs to a person's dying comfortably.</p>
