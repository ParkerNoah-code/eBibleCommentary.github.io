<p align="justify">Two Sermons Preached on July 15 and 16, 1727.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    Luke 18:1 "And he spoke a parable unto them, to this end, that men ought 
    always to pray, and not to faint."</p>
<p align="justify">THE time of this life is the time of trial; only in the 
    life to come is full ease to be expected. Now is the warfare, and partial 
    victories: the complete victory comes not until death. If we must have our 
    portion of goods in hand presently, and cannot wait, we will soon be through 
    it, and have nothing when we need most. If we mind for Heaven then, we must 
    be resolute, set a stiff heart to a stay brae, and hold forward whatever 
    storms blow in our face, as we see in the words of the text. Wherein we 
    have,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The Lord's insisting to teach his disciples, "And he 
    spoke a parable unto them," etc. That the relative them refers to his 
    disciples, appears by the continued connection of these words with the 
    discourse from chapter 17:22. And he changes in it his manner of teaching, 
    making a practical improvement, in a parable, of what he had before taught 
    them in plain style. "Now he spoke also a parable unto them," to impress the 
    lesson the more lively, both on their minds, memories, and affections."</p>
<p align="justify">2. The new lesson he taught them, "That men ought always 
    to pray, and not to faint;" that there would be a necessity of their praying 
    always, and not fainting. The discourse whence it is inferred, among other 
    things, bears,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That their comforts should be less than they were 
    then, verse 22, "And he said unto the disciples, The days will come when you 
    shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see 
    it."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Their temptations more, verse 23, "And they shall 
    say to you, See here, or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them."</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That the world would be long in deep security, and 
    they long in deep distress, so that they might be in hazard of giving it 
    over; see verses 26–33.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) That the Lord would come to them at length, and make 
    all right: but when or where, they are not to know.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, to direct them how to carry in such a difficult 
    situation, he speaks the following parable; the scope and sum of which comes 
    to this, "That men ought always to pray, and not to faint." So he tells 
    them,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The course they must hold, blow the wind as it will: 
    they must "always pray;" not that they must be always on their knees, but 
    they must keep a habitual course of praying.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) What they must beware of; they must "not faint." The 
    word signifies a succumbing or yielding under the pressure of evils or 
    hardships, as one sinking under a burden, or giving over by reason of the 
    badness of the way, Ephesians 3:13, and is well rendered fainting; for the 
    apostle explains it by being loosened, Galatians 6:9, because in fainting or 
    swooning the nerves are loosened, relaxed, or unbent, and so activity is 
    gone. So whatever hardships are met with, we must not be so outwearied with 
    them as to give over.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The necessity of this; men ought or must needs 
    always pray, and not faint. If we give over, we are gone; if we faint, and 
    break off our course, all is lost.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. Our Lord Jesus Christ has kindly intimated to 
    all that have business at the court of Heaven the necessity of so managing 
    themselves that they still hang on there, and not faint, whatever 
    entertainment they meet with during the dependence of their process.</p>
<p align="justify">In this doctrine there are three heads to be considered.</p>
<p align="justify">I. Our Lord's kind intimation of this way of his Father's 
    court.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The way of the court of Heaven, in trysting 
    petitioners with some hardships during the dependence of their process.</p>
<p align="justify">III. The duty of the petitioners, to hang on and not 
    faint whatever they meet with.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. The first thing to be considered, is, our Lord's kind 
    intimation of this way of his Father's court. And here we would show, 1. The 
    import of Christ's making this intimation to petitioners there; and, 2. The 
    weight and moment of this intimation.</p>
<p align="justify">First, I shall show the import of Christ's making this 
    intimation to petitioners at his Father's court.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The darkness that is naturally on the minds of poor 
    sinners, with respect to Heaven's management about them. We may say, as 
    Jeremiah 5:4, "Surely these are poor, they are foolish: for they know not 
    the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of their God." The obscurest shepherd 
    from the remotest corner, would know more of the king's court, if he had 
    business there, than the wisest mortals naturally know of the way of the 
    court of Heaven. Dark clouds are about the sovereign manager to us: "His way 
    is in the sea, and his path in the great waters, and his footsteps are not 
    known." Even Job, that had been a long hanger-on about the court of Heaven, 
    knew little of the way of it, and behooved to have a new lesson of it, Job 
    38:1, 2, "Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Who is 
    this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?"</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ's good-will to the sinner's business going 
    right there: Exodus 28:29, "And Aaron shall bear the names of the children 
    of Israel in the breast-plate of judgment, upon his heart, when he goes in 
    unto the holy place, for a memorial before the Lord continually." He shows 
    it by his concern for their right managing it: he knows they are 
    unacquainted with the manner of the court of Heaven, and so are in hazard of 
    marring their own business; and therefore he is concerned to set them on the 
    road to get a good answer. The poor soul that is sometimes at the brink of 
    groaning and giving it over, is moved to start back from that precipice, and 
    groan and look up again. Whence is that, but from Christ's secret making of 
    this intimation to them by his Spirit? Romans 8:26, "Likewise the Spirit 
    also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we 
    ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which 
    cannot be uttered."</p>
<p align="justify">3. That our Lord sees sinners are in hazard of fainting 
    from the entertainment they may meet with during the dependence of their 
    process, Hebrews 12:3. He knows their frame, the hastiness of their spirits, 
    John 7:6, how apt they are to take delays for denials, and be discouraged 
    with what is designed only for their trial. Therefore he opens and forewarns 
    them of the manner of the court, Isaiah 28:16, "He who believes shall not 
    make haste."</p>
<p align="justify">4. That they that shall hang on, and not faint, shall 
    certainly come speed at length. Luke 18:6, 7, 8, "And the Lord said, Hear 
    what the unjust judge says. And shall not God avenge his own elect, which 
    cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that 
    he will avenge them speedily." It is not possible that the soul, continuing 
    resolute to go to no other door, but hanging on at his door, to make its 
    grave there, if it be not let in, can be shut out always, John 6:37, "Him 
    that comes to me, I will in no wise cast out." Willful faith, that will be 
    forward in face of "killing" and "slaying," Job 13:15, will get all its will 
    at length, Matthew 15:28, "Then Jesus answered, and said unto her, O woman, 
    great is your faith: be it unto you even as you will."</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, The weight and moment of this intimation. This 
    will appear, if it is considered in a fourfold light.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Jesus Christ, who makes it, has experienced it in his 
    own case. The man Christ, the head of the church, had the most important 
    business at the court of Heaven that ever came before it; namely, for 
    through-bearing in a work on which his Father's glory, and the salvation of 
    an elect world depended. And he was often in prayer: he spent a whole night 
    in it, Luke 6:12. But see his experience of this manner of the court, Psalm 
    22:1, 2, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? why are you so far from 
    helping me, and from the words of my roaring? O my God, I cry in the 
    day-time, but you hear not; and in the night-season, and am not silent." And 
    69:1–3. "Save me, O God, for the waters are come in unto my soul. I sink in 
    deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the 
    floods overflow me. I am weary of my crying, my throat is dried; mine eyes 
    fail while I wait for my God." Now, if this was the manner with the great 
    Petitioner, how can we expect it should fare otherwise with us? Nay, God, in 
    his dealing with Christ the Head, set down a pattern to be followed 
    thereafter in his dealing with the members, Romans 8:29, "For whom he did 
    foreknow, he also did predestine to be conformed to the image of his Son, 
    that he might be the first-born among many brethren." Compare verse 28, "And 
    we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to 
    them who are the called according to his purpose.</p>
<p align="justify">2. He is the great Prophet of Heaven, whose office it is 
    to reveal the manner of the court to poor sinners. He is fitted for it, as 
    being on all the secrets of it, which the most favorite angel cannot dive 
    into, John 1:18. Therefore we may be very sure this is the manner of the 
    court; and that those who will manage their business at it otherwise will be 
    sure to mar it.</p>
<p align="justify">3. He is the only Intercessor there, the Father's 
    Secretary, the Solicitor for poor sinners there. There is never a petition 
    received at the throne of grace, but what is presented by him; nor 
    graciously granted there, but through his intercession, Revelation 8:3, 4; 
    nor an answer graciously returned, or an order issued out for the sinner's 
    relief, but it comes through his hand, John 5:22, "For the Father judges no 
    man; but has committed all judgment unto the Son." Who then can doubt of the 
    necessity by him intimated? and who must not see the kind aspect that the 
    intercessor's hinting this to the petitioners has on their business?</p>
<p align="justify">4. He is himself the hearer of prayer. The angels are 
    called to worship him, Hebrews 1:6. Stephen, in his most serious moments, 
    when he was nearest Heaven, prays to him, Acts 7:59; a plain evidence that 
    he is true God, the Father's equal, the Supreme, the most high God: for it 
    is written, Deuteronomy 10:20, "You shall fear the Lord your God; him shall 
    you serve, and to him shall you cleave, and swear by his name." Compare 
    Matthew 4:10, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you 
    serve." Psalm 83:18, "That men may know, that you whose name alone is 
    Jehovah, are the most high over all the earth." And the Scripture condemns 
    serving those that are not by nature gods, Galatians 4:8. Therefore Christ 
    is God by nature, true God, necessarily existent, independent, God of 
    himself, though not a Son of himself: but the divine essence being eternally 
    and necessarily communicated from the Father to the Son, the Father's 
    communicating it, and the Son's receiving it, are equally glorious. Since 
    then he is the hearer of prayer that makes this intimation, it is equivalent 
    to a promise that prayers so managed shall certainly come speed at length; 
    as appears from Isaiah 45:19, "I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek you 
    me in vain."</p>
<p align="justify">II. The Second thing to be considered, is, The way of the 
    court of Heaven, in trysting petitioners with some hardships, during the 
    dependence of their process. Here I shall give you, 1. A swatch of that way; 
    and, 2. Some reasons of that way, whereby to account for it in a 
    suitableness to the divine perfections.</p>
<p align="justify">First, A swatch of that way in a few particulars. Though 
    the Lord sometimes gives his people very quick dispatch, (Is. 65:24, "And it 
    shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer, and while they are 
    yet speaking, I will hear"); yet it is very usual to try them another way.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Oft-times there is deep silence from the throne, 
    Matthew 15:23; and that even when the petitioner is crying with the greatest 
    earnestness, and crying incessantly, Psalm 22:1, 2, and is at the point of 
    being overwhelmed for want of help, Psalm 143:7; yet no voice to be 
    perceived, no motion appearing towards the petitioner's relief.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Oft-times they get a very angry-like answer. The woman 
    of Canaan got a couple of them, one on the back of another, Matthew 15:24, 
    26, "But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the 
    house of Israel.—It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it 
    to dogs." It is very ordinary for Heaven's petitioners to hear some Sinai 
    thunders when they are on Mount Zion; to come in a low and heavy case to the 
    throne, and to go away laid lower then they came. So going with their 
    petitions to the throne of grace, they are teazed there to purpose, and many 
    a foul ply of their heart and life is opened out to them, and they come back 
    with a breast full of convictions, Judges 10:10–14.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Many a time, at the sight of the King on the throne, 
    they falter, and their speech fails, that they cannot get words to tell what 
    they would be at, Psalm 77:3, 4. Hence many broken sentences in their 
    petitions, which yet are understood well enough in Heaven, the blanks being 
    filled up with groans, Psalm 6:3; Romans 8:26, 27.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Disappointed expectations are a piece of very ordinary 
    entertainment there, Jeremiah 8:15, "We looked for peace, but no good came: 
    and for a time of health, and behold trouble." Hope may be raised, and yet 
    be deferred, until it make a sick heart. These disappointments may meet the 
    petitioner over and over again; Canticles 3:1, 2, "By night on my bed I 
    sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not. I will 
    rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will 
    seek him whom my soul loves: I sought him but I found him not." If you ask 
    how long the course of them may last? I know of no term fixed for them but 
    one, and that one is enough for faith, Psalm 9:18, "For the needy shall not 
    always be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish forever." 
    And if you go to another door than the Lord's, the course of your 
    disappointments will have no end.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Many a time, looking for an answer, providence drives 
    a course apparently just contrary to the granting of their petition; so is 
    fulfilled that Psalm 65:5, "By terrible things in righteousness will you 
    answer us, O God of our salvation." And it may be so stunning, as to require 
    much faith not to take that for the final answer, as if God had said, speak 
    no more to me of that matter: and yet the wheel of providence may be but 
    fetching a compass to come to the point desired. Thus the sunk spirits of 
    the Israelites were raised in hope, Exodus 4:31, "And the people believed: 
    and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel, and 
    that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and 
    worshiped." But the very first thing that comes after that, chapter 5, is, 
    that they are in a worse condition than ever, their bondage is more 
    intolerable; which made Moses' faith stagger; verses 22, 23, "And Moses 
    returned unto the Lord, and said, Lord, wherefore have you so evil entreated 
    this people? why is it that you have sent me? for since I came to Pharaoh to 
    speak in your name, he has done evil to this people; neither have you 
    delivered the people at all.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, Oft-times the Lord, instead of easing the 
    petitioner, lays new burdens on him, Jeremiah 8:15, "We looked for peace, 
    but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble." Instead of 
    curing the old wound, there are new ones given. So that sometimes the waters 
    come in on every side, and compass the poor soul: and yet the Lord, though 
    he see it fit to give the sinner such a gift, may have no mind he should 
    drown for all that; Psalm 116:3, "The sorrows of death compassed me, and the 
    pains of Hell got hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow." Verse 6, "The 
    Lord preserves the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me:" and 88:17, 
    "They came round about me daily like water, they compassed me about 
    together." So it was in Job's case.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Whoever of you would manage your business 
    successfully at the court of Heaven, on this occasion, put on resoluteness 
    to hang on about the Lord's hand, and not to faint, until you get it to a 
    happy issue. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Lay the great business of salvation close to heart, 
    let it be your main business; the securing of your saving interest in 
    Christ, now when you have this solemn occasion of both the word of the 
    covenant, and the seal of the covenant together; not knowing if ever you may 
    have such a favorable occasion again. Time goes away, death is hastening on, 
    it is dangerous to delay. If you be indifferent in the business, you will 
    never hang on.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Lay it down for a conclusion, you must have Christ, 
    or you perish. Pinching need makes men importunate: if you feel not that, 
    you will soon weary, and never bring the matter to a good issue, John 6:67, 
    68, "Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will you also go away? Then Simon 
    Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words of eternal 
    life." The sinner will hang on at Christ's door when he sees all others shut 
    against him.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Embrace Christ in the great promise of the gospel, 
    believing the promise; taking a dead gripe of it, never to part. It is held 
    out to you, and every one of you, Hebrews 4:1, "Let us therefore fear, lest 
    a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to 
    come short of it." It is the report from Heaven to be believed, Isaiah 53:1. 
    Without faith there is no eviting of fainting, Psalm 27:13, "I had fainted, 
    unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the 
    living.</p>
<p align="justify">4thly, Take an eternal farewell of the vain world, and 
    deceitful lusts,; resvolving, that, come what will, you will hang by Christ 
    in the promise, if you should die there; saying with Job, chapter 13:15, 
    "Though he slay me yet will I trust in him." None come aright to Christ but 
    they that come resolutely.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Be not hasty, but resolve to wait in expectation, 
    setting no time to the Lord's comforting you, Isaiah 28:16,—"He who 
    believes, shall not make haste." Micah. 7:9, "I will bear the indignation of 
    the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and 
    execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall 
    behold his righteousness." If all your life long should pass uncomforted, 
    peace and comfort in the end is well worth waiting on.</p>
<p align="justify">Use 2. Be not surprised, nor offended at the way of God, 
    though in your addresses to the throne you meet with apparent harsh 
    entertainment. They have seemed to themselves to be boasted away, who taking 
    the buffet, have got the bit too by waiting on, like the woman of Canaan, 
    Matthew 15:21–28. The importunity of faith, that is, a continued trust in 
    the promise, and an incessant use of the means, will prevail.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, I shall give you some reasons of that way, 
    whereby to account for it in a suitableness to the divine perfections.</p>
<p align="justify">1. This way is taken with petitioners in the court of 
    Heaven; for thereby God is glorified, and his attributes more illustrated 
    than otherwise they would be. In this view of it, Paul welcomes it in his 
    own case, though it was hard to sense, 2 Corinthians 12:9, "And he said unto 
    me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in 
    weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that 
    the power of Christ may rest upon me." God treating his people thus, 
    displays his wisdom, in guiding the broken vessel safely through many rocks 
    and shelves to land without splitting; that afterwards they are made to say, 
    None else but he could have done it, Isaiah 9:6, "His name shall be called 
    Wonderful, Counselor;" his power, in supporting them under a pressure that 
    otherwise they would sink under, 2 Corinthians 1:8, 9, "For we would not, 
    brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we 
    were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even 
    of life: but we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not 
    trust in ourselves, but in God which raises the dead;" his grace, mercy, and 
    goodness, in seasonable interposings thereof when their foot is ready to 
    slip, Psalm 94:18, "When I said, My foot slips: your mercy, O Lord, held me 
    up." 2 Corinthians 12:9, forfeited.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Hereby the state of petitioners is tried, and a plain 
    difference constituted between hypocrites and the sincere, Matthew 24:13, 
    "He who shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved." God's 
    petitioners in the gross are like Gideon's army, Judges 7 far more than are 
    to be trusted. So God brings them down to these waters of trial; and there 
    is a heap of them that must have a fill presently, or they faint, cannot go 
    forward; so they are set on, like the men that bowed down on their knees to 
    drink, Job 27:10, "Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always 
    call upon God?" Others are disposed to endure hardness, without fainting, 
    like the men that lapped; and they are kept as meet to have their petitions 
    granted at length, Luke 18:7, "And shall not God avenge his own elect, which 
    cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Hereby the graces of believing petitioners are tried, 
    both as to the reality and strength of them; particularly their faith and 
    patience, 1 Peter 1:6, 7. "Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a 
    season (if need be) you are in heaviness through manifold temptations. That 
    the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes, 
    though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise, and honor, and 
    glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ. James 1:12, "Blessed is the man 
    that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of 
    life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him." Our Lord takes 
    great pleasure in the faith and patience of his people, and therefore he 
    puts them sorely to it in these points, like the woman of Canaan, Matthew 15 
    that they may have occasion to exert themselves vigorously. Sometimes they 
    meet with such a shock that they are foundered in them: anon there is a 
    secret breathing, and they get to their feet again, and act more vigorously 
    than before, like a giant refreshed with wine, Jonah 2:4, "Then I said, I am 
    cast out of your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple." 
    Hereby they have a double benefit; they see the reality of their faith and 
    patience better than in a calm, and the strength of them more than they 
    could have expected, and withal that they are other things than efforts of 
    natural abilities, no more to be their product, than roses of the desert: 
    Romans 5:3, 4, 5, "And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, 
    knowing that tribulation works patience; and patience, experience; and 
    experience, hope: and hope makes not ashamed, because the love of God is 
    shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Hereby believers are humbled, and taught that they 
    hold of free grace. The exalting of grace is the great design of the whole 
    contrivance of the gospel. Therefore faith is made the turning point in it, 
    the hinge of it as to us; Romans 4:16, "Therefore it is of faith, that it 
    might be by grace: to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed. 
    Therefore this method is used in the dispensation of Heaven's favors 
    according to it, Deuteronomy 8:2, "And you shall remember all the way which 
    the Lord your God led you, these forty years in the wilderness, to humble 
    you, and to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would 
    keep his commandments, or not." They that buy with their money must be 
    served presently; but beggars must be content to wait on. There are powerful 
    remains of a legal spirit in the best, in requiring supply for their needs, 
    with little sense of their unworthyness; and in a disposition to fret, if 
    they be not quickly answered. It takes much hewing to bring down these; to 
    empty the man of himself, and to let him see that God is no debtor to him 
    for anything, great or small.</p>
<p align="justify">5. This way is taken for honor of the word, Psalm 138:2, 
    "You have magnified your word above all your name." There are many letters 
    of God's name, but this Bible is the capital letter of it: and there is not 
    one dispensation of providence, that magnifies the Bible more than this. It 
    is even the thing that bears the head above, and keeps the heart from 
    fainting, in this case, Romans 15:4, "For whatever things were written 
    aforetime, were written for our learning; that we, through patience and 
    comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope." This treatment at the court of 
    Heaven sends the petitioner to the records, which gladden his heart, finding 
    that it has been the ancient way of the court; and in a desert way it is no 
    small comfort to the traveler, to find a track, and the print of someone's 
    feet before him. It makes him mark narrowly, and greedily catch at a word; 
    and to discover a treasure, where many a time, when he went over it before, 
    he saw nothing.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, It is taken to make them long to be home. 
    God's children are in this world, young heirs that are abroad out of their 
    Father's country: they send their letters, and draw their bills on their 
    Father: and while they are speedily answered, at every turn, they live at 
    ease in the strange country, and are not solicitous to be home: but their 
    Father cures them of that, letting them at length write over and over again, 
    without an answer; and ceasing to answer their bills: and then they long to 
    be home.</p>
<p align="justify">III. The third thing to be considered, is, The duty of 
    the petitioners to hang on, and not to faint, whatever they meet with. We 
    may view it in these things following.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They must never lift their process from the court of 
    Heaven, John 6:67, 68,—"Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words of 
    eternal life." It was Saul's ruin, that when God answered him not, when he 
    went to a witch; and the unbelieving Israelites when they heard of the 
    giants of Canaan, that they would be back to Egypt again, Numbers 14:4; and 
    it is the ruin of many, when they find not the sweet in religion that they 
    expected, to go back to the world and their lusts, that will answer them, 
    they think, sooner. But whatever be your sore, you should protest that it 
    shall run for you, until the Lord put forth his own healing hand, and that 
    you will not go to another for a cure, Lamentations 3:49, 50, "My eye 
    trickles down, and ceases not, without any intermission: until the Lord look 
    down, and behold from Heaven."</p>
<p align="justify">2. They must never give over praying, but "pray always." 
    They that will pray about the time of a communion, and afterwards leave it 
    off by degrees, will lose all their pains, and prove themselves to be 
    hypocrites, Job 27:10, "Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he 
    always call upon God?" And Satan sometimes plies distressed souls to give up 
    with it, as what they may see they will do no good with, for that God will 
    not hear them. But that is a deceit of Hell which you must never yield to; 
    no not though God should continue to answer you not a word; nay not though 
    your attempting to pray, should seem to serve for nothing but to set 
    a-raging against you; for it is God's command, that "men pray always." There 
    is less ill in mismanaging prayer than in giving it over altogether; for 
    that is tamely to yield yourselves to Satan's will. And though you may be in 
    such confusion, as to take the devil's whispers within you for your own 
    voice, God will carefully distinguish the two, and not lay that to your 
    charge wherein you are pure sufferers. And continuing to pray, you are in 
    the way of duty, wherein you may expect God will hear and pity at length.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They must insist on their tabled petitions, while 
    their need remains, whatever entertainment they seem to meet with, as the 
    woman of Canaan did, Matthew 15. If you insist not, you will be construed to 
    have fallen from it: but importunity will speed at long-run, Luke 11:8, "I 
    say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his 
    friend: yet, because of his importunity, he will rise, and give him as many 
    as he needs. And indeed, need continuing to pinch, and the petitioner giving 
    over his crying for supply, is fainting with a witness.</p>
<p align="justify">Case. But may it not be that the Lord may say Speak no 
    more to me of this matter? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. It is true, it may be so, as the Lord did to 
    Moses, Deuteronomy 3:26, "But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, and 
    would not hear me: and the Lord said unto me, Let it suffice you, speak no 
    more unto me of this matter. But in that case I conceive,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The Lord shows his people they do not need that 
    thing; let it suffice you, or you have much, or enough. And to quiet Moses 
    in this case, he gave him a sight of the land from Pisgah, verse 27.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The help of the Spirit as to praying in that 
    particular is withdrawn. There is an embargo laid on them in that point, 
    "Speak no more unto me of this matter."</p>
<p align="justify">4. They must carry all their incident needs in new 
    petitions, to the same throne of grace, where the former petition may have 
    been long lying, and still unanswered; and so pursue all together. The 
    latter must not drive out the former, nor the former keep back the latter. 
    It is one of the ways how the Lord keeps his people hanging about his hand 
    without fainting, by sending them several loads above their burden; which 
    loads he takes off soon at their request; and so makes them go under their 
    burden the more easily. These short incident processes, that get a speedy 
    answer, confirm their faith and hope in waiting on for the answer of the 
    main. I believe it will be found, that the Lord's children, who have had the 
    most tedious process before the throne, have not wanted experience of very 
    quick dispatches in the time, Isaiah 65:24, "And it shall come to pass, that 
    before they call, I will answer, and while they are yet speaking, I will 
    hear."</p>
<p align="justify">5. They must continue in the faith of the promise, never 
    quit the gripe of it; but trust and believe that it shall certainly be 
    accomplished, though the wheels of providence should seem to drive out over 
    it and in over it, Romans 4:19, 20, "And Abraham being not weak in faith, he 
    considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years 
    old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb. He staggered not at the 
    promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to 
    God." Providence is not our Bible; the works of God may be very various, but 
    the word of promise is always the same, it is never moved. You have a very 
    poetical passage, Psalm 18:7, and downwards. I think it proceeds upon this 
    view, that though all the confusions of the universe cannot move the 
    promise; yet if hills, earth, fire, waters, heavens, were all standing 
    before it to hinder its accomplishment, it would move them all out of their 
    places, and make its way through them.</p>
<p align="justify">6. They must keep up hope of the thing promised over the 
    belly of all improbabilities, 2 Peter 1:13, "Wherefore gird up the loins of 
    your mind, be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is to be 
    brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ." Faith opening the door 
    of the promise, hope sees the blessed answer to the petition lying at the 
    King's hand, however long it may be before it be transmitted. That is very 
    pleasing to God, Psalm 147:11, "The Lord takes pleasure in those that hope 
    in his mercy."</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly, If at any time they begin to faint, they must 
    wrestle against it, that they go not quite away, Hebrews 10:35, "Cast not 
    away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward." If 
    faith and hope fail, so will patience: but you must set yourselves to 
    believe over the belly of sense, and hope against hope.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. Christians, communicants, and whoever of you would 
    have your business go right in Heaven, go from this place resolute to hang 
    on about the Lord's hand, and not to faint, whatever you have met with, or 
    shall meet with from that airth. Have a horror of fainting, giving over, or 
    going back to another door. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. If you faint and give over, your suit is lost, you 
    have given up with it. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, If your suit be the main thing, the eternal 
    well-being of your soul, which is what we all pretend to; then your soul is 
    lost, Hebrews 10:38, "If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure 
    in him." Be resolute in religion, as ever you would not be eternally lost; 
    for none will get to Heaven but those that have a brow for a bargain, to 
    yoke with difficulties in the way, and go through them. It is a concerning 
    word, Revelation 21:8, "But the fearful, and unbelieving,—shall have their 
    part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second 
    death." I think it has a view to the fearful and unbelieving disposition 
    that kept the Israelites out of Canaan, Numbers 13:33, and 14.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, If it be a temporal mercy, you may get it, but the 
    substance will be out of it, at least until you repent of your fainting, 
    Psalm 116:15, "He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their 
    soul."</p>
<p align="justify">2. If you hold on and faint not, be your on-waiting ever 
    so long, it shall not be in vain. Matthew 24:13, "He who shall endure unto 
    the end, the same shall be saved." Galatians 6:9, "Let us not be weary in 
    well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not." God will 
    never put those away empty from him, that hang on, and will not go without 
    the blessing.</p>
<p align="justify">3. He is well worth the waiting on.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Though he is infinitely above us, he has waited long 
    on us.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The longer you are called to wait for a mercy, you 
    will readily find it the more valuable when it comes. The promise uses to go 
    longest with the biggest mercy; witness the promise of Christ, while many 
    lesser promises brought forth.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) His time will be found the due time, Galatians 6:9; 
    the best chosen time for the mercy's coming; witness the time of Isaac's 
    birth.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) You shall be sure of some blessed offallings, while 
    you wait on, Psalm 27:14, "Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he 
    shall strengthen your heart: wait, I say, on the Lord." and 138:3, "In the 
    day when I cried, you answerered me; and strengthened me with strength in my 
    soul." You shall be sure of some pledge of a good answer, Jeremiah 52:31, 
    32.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, They have waited long, that have lost all, by 
    not having patience to wait a little longer, Exodus 32; 1 Samuel 13:8, 10. 
    Therefore "let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and 
    entire, wanting nothing," James 1:4; "for in due season you shall reap, if 
    you faint not," Galatians 6:9.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Part 2</b></font></p>
<p align="justify">LUKE 18:8 "I tell you that he will avenge them speedily."</p>
<p align="justify">AT a recent occasion I spoke to the scope of this parable 
    from verse 1. The parable itself we have verses 2–5, the doctrine of it, 
    verses 6, 7. In the text we have the doctrine of it repeated, amplified, and 
    confirmed.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The doctrine of the parable is here repeated, "He will 
    avenge them." Our Lord had already laid it before his disciples, verse 7, in 
    very strong terms: for it is a point upon the belief of which very much 
    depends; particularly his people's "praying always, and not fainting:" God 
    will certainly hear them at length; therefore they must hang on about his 
    hand crying, and not faint.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Consider the parties for whom this benefit is 
    secured; them. It refers to verse 7; and so the parties are, they that "cry 
    unto God night and day; and what that is, appears from the scope: it is even 
    to "pray always, and not to faint;" which I have already explained. So they 
    who having laid petitions for supply of their needs before the Lord, do hang 
    on and insist without fainting and giving over, are assured of a happy issue 
    of their process, however tedious it may be. This is good news to 
    petitioners at the court of Heaven, though their answer may have been so 
    long delayed, that it seems as if they would never be heard: this may make 
    them renew their suit, and pursue as a giant refreshed with wine.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. But it is expressly restricted to the elect; 
    therefore, though I hang on never so long, I am, may be, none of God's 
    elect, and therefore can have no encouragement from it. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. The scope of the parable looks to men 
    indefinitely, verse 1, "That men ought always to pray, and not to faint;" 
    and the term elect is no restriction of the criers that are to be heard, as 
    if there were some that cry day and night unto God, that are elect ones; and 
    others that cry night and day unto him that are not elect ones. No; but the 
    crying of the elect day and night in the sense of the text, is proposed as 
    an evidence of eternal election: it is inferred from their so crying, that 
    they are elect ones, and therefore shall surely be heard. The unjust judge 
    heard a woman he had no regard for, because she came continually to him: how 
    much more will a just God hear those that are coming continually to him, 
    since they are surely his chosen ones, else they would certainly give it 
    over, and go to another door?</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The benefit secured for them, "He will avenge 
    them;" that is, agreeable to the general scope, he will hear them at length 
    to their full satisfaction; their process shall have a happy issue. But it 
    is expressed by "avenging them," to intimate,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) That all the grievances that God's children labor 
    under, and which send them crying to God for relief, arise from their 
    adversaries, temporal or spiritual, without them or within them.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) That they are not able to rid themselves of their 
    adversaries, but must grapple with their burden until another hand take it 
    off.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That God will not only deliver them, but show them 
    just vengeance on the springs of their grievances.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The doctrine of the parable amplified, "I tell you 
    that he will avenge them speedily." Though they think they are put to wait 
    long, yet matters being weighed in an even balance, they shall have a quick 
    return of their prayers.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The confirmation of the whole, "I tell you," Our Lord 
    Christ gives his word for it.</p>
<p align="justify">The doctrine from the first verse was, that our Lord 
    Jesus Christ has kindly intimated to all that have business at the court of 
    Heaven, the necessity of so managing themselves, that they still hang on 
    there, and not faint, whatever entertainment they meet with during the 
    dependence of their process. And, in pursuance of the same scope, from the 
    8th verse compared with the first, I observe the following</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. To move them that have business at the court of 
    Heaven, still to hang on there, and not to faint, whatever hardships they 
    meet with during the dependence of their process, our Lord Jesus has 
    expressly intimated that such petitioners shall certainly be heard to their 
    heart's content, and that speedily, in reality, however tedious their 
    process may seem to them for the time. Briefly, Jesus Christ has given his 
    word for it, that such petitioners at the court of Heaven, as will hang on 
    and not faint, shall certainly be heard to their heart's content, and that 
    speedily.</p>
<p align="justify">In handling this doctrine, I shall show,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What is that treatment petitioners meet with at the 
    court of Heaven, under which they will be in hazard of fainting.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Why petitioners are in hazard of fainting from such 
    treatment at the court of Heaven.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Wherefore the Lord gives such treatment to any of 
    his petitioners.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. What is the import of this intimation made for this 
    end.</p>
<p align="justify">V. The certainty of such petitioners being heard at 
    length.</p>
<p align="justify">VI. How they shall be heard to their heart's content.</p>
<p align="justify">VII. How it shall be speedily, notwithstanding the long 
    delay.</p>
<p align="justify">VIII. Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. First, I shall show what is that treatment petitioners 
    may meet with at the court of Heaven, under which they will be in hazard of 
    fainting. I mentioned several particulars at another occasion; I offer now 
    only three things in general.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The weight and pressure of their heavy case itself, 
    whatever it is, may be long continued, notwithstanding all their addresses 
    for help, Jeremiah 8:20, "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we 
    are not saved." They may come again and again to the throne of grace, with 
    their burden on their back, and as often carry it away with them. And that 
    is faintsome work. A short trial, though it be sharp, is but "running with 
    the footmen;" but a long continued one is "contending with horses," apt to 
    run one out of breath, Psalm 6:3, "My soul also sore vexed: but you, O Lord, 
    how long?</p>
<p align="justify">2. There may be no appearance of relief, Psalm 74:9, "We 
    see not our signs, there is no more any prophet, neither is there among us 
    any that knows how long." A glimpse of an appearance of relief, though yet 
    afar off, would be like a cordial to the weary attendants, howbeit their 
    night may have been long and dark, and yet no sign of day-break to be 
    discerned. The petitioners are apt to faint, who though they often listen, 
    can hear no voice; though they look oft to the throne, can discern no moving 
    toward their relief, Psalm 119:123, "My eyes fail for your salvation, and 
    for the word of your righteousness."</p>
<p align="justify">3. They may get incident weights laid on them, as a load 
    above their burden, Psalm 69:26, "They persecute him whom you have smitten, 
    and they talk to the grief of those whom you have wounded." These are like 
    drops poured into a full cup, ready to cause it run over; like smart touches 
    on a broken leg, inclining one readily to faint.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The second thing to be spoke to, is, why petitioners 
    are in hazard of fainting from such treatment at the court of Heaven. Four 
    things concur to it.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Natural weakness, Isaiah 40:6, "All flesh is grass, 
    and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field. On this very 
    view the Lord "pities his children," Psalm 103:13, 14. We have weak backs, 
    easily bowed down under a heavy burden, Psalm 38:6; weak hearts, Soon 
    damped, where God shows himself our party; weak heads, and are soon brought 
    to our wits end; weak hands, that can do little for ourselves at a pinch; 
    and weak knees, ready to bow, and let us go to the ground, after long 
    hanging on.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Conscience of guilt, Psalm 38:5, 6, "My wounds stink, 
    and are corrupt; because of my foolishness. I am troubled, I am bowed down 
    greatly; I go mourning all the day long." Guilt is a mother of fears, and 
    fears cause fainting. The sinner goes to God with his pinching case, he is 
    not answered: presently there is a quarrel apprehended, the man knows he is 
    a criminal, and the guilty conscience whispers in his ear, "There is no 
    hope."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Unacquaintedness with the methods of sovereignty, 
    Psalm 77:19, "Your way is in the sea, and your path in the great waters, and 
    your footsteps are not known." The mysteries of the management of providence 
    have perplexed saints of the first magnitude, as Asaph, Jeremiah, etc. We 
    are apt to measure God's ways by our own, which occasions much fainting in 
    trials: whereas they differ as far as Heaven and earth, Isaiah 55:8, 9.</p>
<p align="justify">4. A strong bias to unbelief and walking by sense, quite 
    contrary to our duty and interest, 2 Corinthians 5:7. We are apt to be 
    impressed more with what we see and feel in providence, than what we hear 
    from the word. And whereas we should expound providence by the promise, the 
    word being our rule, and so get the cordial virtue of it; we expound the 
    promise by providence, and so put ourselves in hazard of fainting: Luke 
    24:20, 21, 25, 26, "The chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be 
    condemned to death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that it had been 
    he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, today is the 
    third day since these things were done. Then he said unto them, O fools, and 
    slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Ought not Christ 
    to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</p>
<p align="justify">III. The third thing to be considered is, wherefore the 
    Lord gives such treatment to any of his petitioners.</p>
<p align="justify">First, Negatively.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is not for mere will and pleasure. Satan will be 
    ready to suggest this, and pose the party with such questions as these, for 
    what use is all this delay? what glory comes to God by it? what profit comes 
    to you by it? Good folk may listen overmuch to it. But it is a lie, that it 
    is for mere will and pleasure, Lamentations 3:33, "For he does not afflict 
    willingly, nor grieve the children of men."</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is not because he has no pity on you, nor concern 
    for you under your burden; though Zion, by the suggestion of Satan, may 
    entertain that jealousy of her God, which he flatly refuses, Isaiah 49:14, 
    15, "But Zion said, The Lord has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me. 
    Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on 
    the son of her womb? yes, they may forget, yet will I not forget you." 
    Whatever the Lord's way be with you, it is an eternal scripture truth, "God 
    is love," 1 John 4:16, "gracious and full of compassion," Psalm 111:4. And 
    it is apparent even in this case, in that it is not worse with you, 
    Lamentations 3:22, and that you are always getting new supports under your 
    burden, verse 23.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is not to signify to you that you should give it 
    over, and trouble him no more with your petition; as the hasty unbelieving 
    heart is ready to take it, and to give over duty because there is no 
    sensible appearance of success, Jeremiah 20:9. "I said I will not make 
    mention of him nor speak any more in his name." He has signified his will to 
    be the quite contrary, 1 Thessalonians 5:17. "Pray without ceasing;" and our 
    Lord spoke this parable to prevent that misconstruction.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, It is not because he is resolved not to hear 
    you at any rate, cry as long as you will. Satan will interpret it that way 
    to you, and there is too much listening to it, Habakkuk 1:2. "O Lord, how 
    long shall I cry and you will not hear! even cry out unto you of of 
    violence, and you will not save!" He has promised the contrary Psalm 50:15, 
    "Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall 
    glorify me." Our Lord assures you of the contrary in the text.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, But positively, in general,</p>
<p align="justify">It is for holy, wise, becoming ends; it is necessary for 
    his glory and your case. Believe that on the credit of the word, Deuteronomy 
    32:4, "He is the rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a 
    God of truth, and without iniquity, just and right is he." There is not one 
    random step in his whole way, Lamentations 3:33. There is a necessity for 
    what he does.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. I cannot see how my case requires it, or what 
    glory God can have by it. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. You are no competent judge of what your case 
    requires, and therefore you should leave that to the Lord, Psalm 47:4, "He 
    shall choose our inheritance for us;" Jeremiah 10:23, "O Lord, I know that 
    the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walks to direct his 
    steps." If you are sick, you leave it to your physician how to order your 
    case: if your affairs are perplexed, and you have a plea at law, you leave 
    it to your lawyer: and when you have a process at the court of Heaven, will 
    you not leave it to your God?</p>
<p align="justify">You are as little competent judges of what glory God can 
    have by such and such a management. God can raise glory to himself, where 
    you can see nothing but dishonor to him: and he will have it, Romans 11:36, 
    "For—to him are all things." Believe that, and leave the way of raising it 
    to himself. The seed of glory to God in Job's trial, neither he nor his 
    friends generally saw for a long time: yet it sprung up fair at length, and 
    flourishes to this day.</p>
<p align="justify">But particularly,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is for the honor of the man Christ. It contributes 
    to it,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, In that thereby the petitioners are conformed to his 
    image, in the suffering part thereof. He met with that treatment at the 
    throne, Psalm 22:1, 2, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? why are 
    you so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? O my God, I 
    cry in the day-time, but you hear not; and in the night-season, and am not 
    silent." And for a reward of his bearing it, it is appointed it should be 
    the way of the court ever after. And therefore none of God's children shall 
    miss to share of it, in greater or lesser measure, soon or late, Romans 
    8:29, "For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestine to be conformed to 
    the image of his Son.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Thereby he gets the more employment as the great 
    Intercessor, and is more earnestly applied to than otherwise he would be. 
    Longsome pleas give the advocates much ado; and longsome processes at the 
    court of Heaven bring much business to the Mediator, and so much honor.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, It affords him the most signal occasion of 
    displaying his power in combating with and baffling the old serpent, next to 
    that he had on the cross, 2 Corinthians 12:9, "And he said unto me, My grace 
    is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most 
    gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of 
    Christ may rest upon me." Here Satan and a weak creature is yoked, Heaven 
    standing by and looking on. The poor creature has a burden on his back, he 
    cries, Lord take it off, and cries again, but no answer: Satan takes the 
    advantage, works against him to make him faint; but the combat is 
    maintained, and Satan is baffled, through secret support conveyed to the 
    sinner from Jesus.</p>
<p align="justify">2. To show who are meet to be heard, and who not? who 
    have a due value for the mercy petitioned for, and the God in whose hand it 
    is? Israel wandered in the wilderness until all the despisers of the 
    pleasant land, and unbelievers of the word, dropped off: and Caleb and 
    Joshua, who followed the Lord fully, were brought in. The fainting 
    petitioners either despise the mercy, by dropping it; or God himself, by 
    carrying their process to another.</p>
<p align="justify">3. To magnify the promise. Satan, in man's state of 
    innocence, bent his main force against the threatening, to shake man's faith 
    of it. Now he bends his main force against the promise, to make poor sinners 
    quit their grips of it. In such a case there is a solemn struggle about it; 
    faith holds, and the devil draws. The believer sees he is gone if he quit 
    it; it is his all; and therefore, though the floods overflow, he strives to 
    keep the gripe.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, To keep up the mercy, until that time come, 
    that, all things considered, will be the absolutely best time for bestowing 
    it, John 11:14, 15. "Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. I 
    am glad for your sakes, that I was not there (to the intent you may 
    believe); nevertheless, let us go unto him."</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Know then, that trifling and careless management 
    will not do at the court of Heaven. Deep earnest you must be in, resolved 
    not to take a nay-say. Be sincere, prepare, and vigorously press your suits.</p>
<p align="justify">2. This may encourage sinners to come to Christ, and to 
    put their case in his hand, and hang on. Particularly back-sliders, and 
    whoever are fore-boding no good to themselves from him, may be encouraged by 
    this doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. The fourth thing to be spoke to is, What is the 
    import of this intimation made for this end? It imports,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That sinners are ready to take delays at the court of 
    Heaven for denials. Satan and their own and unbelieving hearts tell them 
    they are so. And therefore, in opposition to this, and to prevent the 
    mistake, our Lord expressly gives his word that it is not so.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That importunity and resolute hanging on, and repeated 
    addresses for the supply of the same need, are very welcome and acceptable 
    to Christ and his Father. There is no fear of excess here; the oftener you 
    come, the more resolute you are in your hanging on, the more welcome. The 
    intercessor will not weary of your putting your petitions in his hands, nor 
    his Father of taking them out of his.</p>
<p align="justify">3. That the faith of being heard at length, is necessary 
    to keep one hanging on without fainting, Psalm 27:13. "I had fainted, unless 
    I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living." 
    Petitioners indifferent whether they be heard or not, may continue their 
    customary prayers without the faith of being heard: but if men be in deep 
    earnest with their petitions, they will never escape fainting without faith, 
    Romans 4:18, 19, 20.</p>
<p align="justify">4. That the hearing to be got at length at the court of 
    Heaven, is well worth the waiting on, be it ever so long. It will more than 
    counterbalance all the fatigue of the process, that is kept longest in 
    dependence. And the faith of this should be kept up, to keep the petitioner 
    from fainting.</p>
<p align="justify">V. The fifth thing in the method is, The certainty of 
    such petitioners being heard at length. Here it is necessary to repeat what 
    was said of the duty of hanging on and not fainting, that we may see who 
    they are that are such petitioners. Now, that such petitoners will be heard, 
    is beyond perhaps, however long they get to wait on, if you consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. They are doubtless God's own children, elect 
    believers, whatever they think of themselves, Luke 17:7. "And shall not God 
    avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long 
    with them?" If they were not so, they could never take such a treatment at 
    God's hand, and yet still hang on about it, John 8:35. "The servant abides 
    not in the house forever: but the Son abides ever." And will not God hear 
    the cries of his own children at length? certainly he will. The begun 
    resemblance to their elder brother must be complete, 2 Timothy 2:11, 12. "It 
    is a faithful saying, For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with 
    him: if we suffer, we shall also reign with him, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The nature, name, and promise of God, join to insure 
    it. He is good and gracious in his nature, Exodus 34:6–9. He has affections 
    of mercy more tender than a mother to her sucking child, Isaiah 49:15. He is 
    the hearer of prayer, Psalm 65:2 and will he not answer that part of his 
    name? will he not hear his own children, and hear them after they have cried 
    long, and still continue crying? He has bound himself by promise, Psalm 
    50:15. "Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you 
    shall glorify me:" and 102:17. "He will regard the prayer of the destitute, 
    and not despise their prayer." And will he not perform this his promise?</p>
<p align="justify">3. Such prayers are the product of his own Spirit in 
    them, and therefore he cannot miss to be heard, James 5:16. "The effectual 
    fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much." You say, you have cried so 
    long, and no answer; and therefore your petitions appear to be the product 
    of nature, not of the Spirit of God. But I say, according to the word, you 
    have cried so long and no answer, and yet continue crying, and have not 
    fainted, and given over, but stick by it resolutely; therefore your 
    petitioning is not the product of nature, but of the Spirit. For nature's 
    praying is a pool that will dry up in a long drought; but the Spirit of 
    prayer is the lasting spring, John 4:14. If you are strengthened to hang on, 
    and not faint, it is a token heaven's hand is at your upholding; as was the 
    case with David, Psalm 138:3, "In the day when I cried, you answerered me; 
    and strengthened me with strength in my soul."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Our Lord Jesus has given his word on it, and so has 
    impawned his honor they shall be heard, "I tell you that he will avenge them 
    speedily." Now, he is the Intercessor at the court of Heaven, and his 
    intercession is never baulked there: so the honor of the Mediator, and his 
    people's being heard, are in one bottom to sink or swim together; and he is 
    able to secure his own honor: and does not that make sure work of your being 
    heard? I proceed to show,</p>
<p align="justify">VI. Sixthly, How they shall be heard to their heart's 
    content.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They shall at length see that their prayers have been 
    accepted. I do not say they shall at length be accepted, but they shall see 
    they have been so. Many cannot think those prayers are accepted, that do not 
    come soon back with an answer. But that is a mistake; for the petitions of 
    those that hang on and faint not, proceeding from that disposition, are 
    accepted instantly, though many years should run before the answer come 
    back, 1 John 5:14, "And this is the confidence that we have in him, that if 
    we ask anything according to his will, he hears us." God does with his 
    wrestling children's petitions, as a father with letters sometimes from his 
    son in a far country, he reads them with pleasure and affection always as 
    they come to his hand, and lays them bypast to be all answered at the most 
    convenient time: Matthew 15:28, "Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O 
    woman, great is your faith: be it unto you even as you will."</p>
<p align="justify">2. They shall get an answer of their petitions to their 
    heart's satisfaction, Matthew 15:28, forfeited. Psalm 9:18, "The needy shall 
    not always be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish 
    forever." God will tell out to them according to the promise in answer to 
    their prayers; so that they shall change their wrestling note, and say, "I 
    love the Lord because he has heard my voice, and my supplications, Psalm 
    116:1, and look on what they have met with as bearing the signature of the 
    hand of a prayer-hearing God. Their burden shall be taken off, and they 
    shall have their petitions in kind, or equivalent to their heart's content, 
    2 Corinthians 12:9, "And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for you: 
    for my strength is made perfect in weakness."</p>
<p align="justify">3. They shall be fully satisfied as to the long delay, 
    and the whole steps of the procedure, however perplexing they were before 
    Revelation 15:3, "And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and 
    the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God 
    Almighty; just and true are your ways, you King of saints." Standing on the 
    shore, and looking back to what they have passed through, they will be made 
    to say, He has done all things well; and they will see that there could have 
    none of it been wanting.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They shall get it with increase according to the time 
    they waited on, and the hardships they sustained during the dependence of 
    the process. The fruit of the promise, the longer it is a-ripening, the more 
    bulky it is. Abraham and Sarah waited for the promised child until they were 
    coming into extreme old age, the very next step to death, Genesis 18:11; but 
    they got with it an addition of the renewing of their ages, Genesis 21:7; 
    and 25:1.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Their spiritual enemies that flew thick and 
    strong about them in the time of the darkness, shall be scattered at the 
    appearance of this light, 1 Samuel 2:5, "They that were full, have hired out 
    themselves for bread; and they that were hungry, ceased: so that the barren 
    has born seven; and she that has many children, is waxed feeble." Formidable 
    was Pharaoh's host while the Israelites had the Red Sea before them: but 
    when they were through the sea, they saw the Egyptians dead upon the shore, 
    Exodus 14:30. Such a heart-sight shall they that hang on and faint not get 
    of Satan and all his black bands. I proceed to show,</p>
<p align="justify">VII. Seventhly, How it shall be speedily, notwithstanding 
    the long delay.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It shall be speedily in respect of the weight and 
    value of it when it comes: so that the believer looking on the return of his 
    petition, with an eye of faith perceiving the worth of it, may wonder it is 
    come upon so short on-waiting. This view of it the apostle takes, 2 
    Corinthians 4:17, "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, 
    works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." And so says 
    Zophar, Job 11:16, "You shall forget your misery, and remember it as waters 
    that pass away."</p>
<p align="justify">2. It shall come in the most seasonable nick of time it 
    can come in, Galatians 6:9 when it may come to the best advantage for the 
    honor of God and their good: and that which comes in the best season, comes 
    speedily. To everything there is a season; so fools' haste is no speed. 
    Times and seasons are in the Lord's hand, and all his works are best-timed, 
    Deuteronomy 32:4 and will abide the strictest examination, Ecclesiastes 
    3:14.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It shall come as soon as they are prepared for it, 
    Psalm 10:17. "You will prepare their heart;" and if it should come sooner, 
    it would be over soon. And it may take long time to prepare for it; there 
    may be many a lesson to learn, much working on their will may be necessary, 
    before they be prepared for it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It shall not tarry one moment beyond the due and 
    appointed time, Habakkuk 2:3, "Though it tarry, wait for it, because it will 
    surely come, it will not tarry;" it will not linger, postpone, or put off 
    beyond that due time. Whatever way the wheel of providence be driving, it is 
    a wheel within a wheel, and so needs spend no time in turning about.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, It will be surprising, as a glaring light to 
    one brought out of a dungeon, though he was expecting it. No doubt the 
    church was expecting the end of their captivity in Babylon toward the end of 
    the seventy years: yet such was the change, it was surprising, they "were 
    like men that dreamed," Psalm 126:1.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Let all know that it is not in vain to seek the 
    Lord. God's trust is better than the world's hand-payment. Though waiting on 
    at the court of Heaven may be longsome, yet it is a sure way to get our 
    wants supplied.</p>
<p align="justify">2. All you that have now set your faces heavenward, 
    professing your resolution to forsake sin and the world, and to hang on 
    about the Lord's hand for all; do not look back, turn not away from him, 
    Hebrews 10:38, "If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. 
    Remember it is "he who endures to the end shall be saved."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Think it not strange if you meet with treatment at the 
    hand of the Lord, whereby you may be in hazard of fainting. He loves to try 
    his followers. But be resolute to hang on about his hand, come what will, 
    and you will be sure to speed at length.</p>
<p align="justify">4. You that are going away mourning from this communion 
    because of a hiding God, and a hungry meal you have got; do not despond; but 
    inquire into the causes, mourn over them, and renew your addresses to the 
    throne vigorously; and what you missed in public, you may get in secret.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, You that are under any pressure, who have been 
    long tossed with tempests and not comforted, nor have any appearance of 
    comfort showing itself; comfort yourselves with the words of the text, 
    believing it; while you can have no comfort from the appearance of 
    providence; and be resolute in hanging on, and faint not. And you have 
    Christ's word for it, your case shall have a happy issue, though never so 
    desperate like.</p>
<p align="justify">And whoever would be kept from fainting, and animated to 
    hang on about the Lord's hand, believe, that hanging on you shall certainly 
    be heard at length to your heart's content. For so has our Lord said, "I 
    tell you that he will avenge them speedily."</p>
