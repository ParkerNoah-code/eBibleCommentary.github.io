    2 Corinthians 11:2 "For I have espoused you to one husband, that I may 
    present you as a chaste virgin to Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">IT was a matter of great importance we were about last 
    Sabbath, espousing poor sinners to the Son of God. But the bride is apt to 
    forget, until she be brought home, and therefore we would put you in mind of 
    it.</p>
<p align="justify">In this verse, the apostle shows how he stood affected to 
    them. "He was jealous over them with a godly jealousy." The cause of this 
    jealousy was the danger in which they were, notwithstanding the great length 
    he had brought them. Their danger is specified, verse 3. The length he had 
    brought them is in the text, in which we have his success, "he had espoused 
    them to one husband," and the design of it, "that he might present them as a 
    chaste virgin to Christ." These words I explained, and insisted on the first 
    clause of the verse, at another occasion of this nature.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. Sometimes ministers get the treaty of 
    marriage between their Master and their people brought such a length, that 
    they can say they have got the espousals made, and that with a design that 
    they may get the bride, as a chaste virgin, to present to the bridegroom, 
    when the great marriage day shall come.</p>
<p align="justify">In treating this subject, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Explain a little, this match between Christ and his 
    people.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall view it in these six degrees:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The first degree of it was the design and purpose of 
    that match, in the heart of God, from all eternity. It is no new thing. It 
    is older than Heaven and earth. God has had an eternity to think upon it, 
    and never saw reason to alter his purpose. Concerning this, we may notice 
    three things. 1. God seeing all mankind in a lost state, was pleased from 
    eternity to have mercy upon, and to love those freely, who in time are 
    brought to Christ. "According as he has chosen us in him, before the 
    foundation of the world. God who is rich in mercy, for the great love with 
    which he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together 
    with Christ." He loved them, when there was nothing appearing in them 
    lovely. Man considered as innocent, was loved, but he soon ceased to be the 
    object of that love, law-love. But God took man at his worst, and loved him 
    then with a love of good-will, which set his mercy on work. "The Lord has 
    appeared of old unto me, saying, Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting 
    love; therefore, with loving-kindness have I drawn you." 2. Those whom he 
    loved, he designed to everlasting life, made choice of them to be his sons, 
    heirs of the heavenly inheritance. He selected them out of the midst of 
    shipwrecked mankind, fully purposing to bring them to Immanuel's land. 3. 
    Those whom he thus chose, he gave them to Christ, to be his spouse in time, 
    to be redeemed and saved by him. "Your they were," says Jesus, "and you gave 
    them me." Christ accepted of them, upon the terms fixed by the Father, "Lo, 
    I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do your 
    will, O my God: yes, your law is within my heart." He needed them not, he 
    was to buy them dear, yet he consents, and therefore they are called his 
    people, Psalm 110:3.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The removal of the lawful impediments of this match 
    between the Son of God and sinners. When this purpose was proclaimed in 
    Heaven, there appeared to object against the match, the justice, law, and 
    truth of God. Justice says, the Mediator is God, and there can be no match 
    between God and guilty man, until I be satisfied. The law says, they are 
    mine, and I will not part with them, until death part us. Truth says, God 
    himself made this marriage between them and the law, and therefore they 
    cannot be married to another, unless first death dissolve the marriage. But 
    the designed bridegroom will not let the marriage go back, and therefore he 
    removes these impediments, by his obedience to the law, and by his death in 
    our nature, and in our stead, which he did and suffered as a public person, 
    even as Adam sinned, Galatians 2:20. By this means justice is satisfied, and 
    so content the match go on. "For," says God, "this is my beloved Son, in 
    whom I am well pleased." The sinner dies to the law in Christ, and the law 
    dies to the sinner. "Wherefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the 
    law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to 
    him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God." 
    And so the parties being thus dead, the truth of God has nothing to object 
    against the purpose of this new marriage.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The contract is written, drawn, and ready for the 
    subscribing. "He has made with me," says David, "an everlasting covenant, 
    ordered in all things and sure." Ordered, or prepared. And there are two 
    things in the contract, 1. Christ's consent to match with poor sinners, to 
    give himself to the captive daughter of Zion for a husband, notwithstanding 
    she be ill-favored and unworthy; Revelation 22:17. There is next the dowry 
    promised to the bride, and that is all things with him: "He who spared not 
    his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also 
    freely give us all things," even all the blessings of the everlasting 
    covenant, grace and glory, Psalm 84:11. A large maintenance, and a good 
    house; John 14:3. Yes, the contract is subscribed by the bridegroom and his 
    Father. "This shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of 
    Israel, after those days, says the Lord, I will put my law in their inward 
    parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall 
    be my people." The contract is also sealed. "This cup," says the bridegroom, 
    "is the New Testament in my blood." All this before famous witnesses, "For 
    there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the 
    Holy Spirit; and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness 
    in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three agree in 
    one." The whole is registered in this Bible.</p>
<p align="justify">But is not this strange work, to write, and sign, and 
    seal the contract, before the bride's consent be obtained, yes, before she 
    be courted? ANSWER. The reason of this is, it is one of the articles, that 
    the bridegroom shall gain the bride's consent. "All that the Father gives 
    me, shall come to me, and him that comes to me, I will in no wise cast out." 
    Again, The bride has nothing, for which to contract, and he looks for as 
    little with her. She has nothing in her, nor upon her, and can bring nothing 
    with her, but debt, wants, poverty, and misery, and he is willing to take 
    her as she is; Ezekiel 16:1–14.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The courting of the bride, in order to gain her 
    consent. And this courtship is managed in two places. First, Christ comes 
    into her mother's house, to the public ordinances, and there he, by his 
    ambassadors, courts her consent. In the public ordinances there is a good 
    report given of Christ, his willingness is declared, sinners are invited, 
    exhorted to give away themselves to him; there is a moral force 
    used upon them by arguments, "compelling them to come in, that his house may 
    be filled." Secondly, Christ comes into the chambers of their heart, and 
    then there is a heart conference between Christ and the soul, without which 
    the former cannot prevail, and here do pass these five things. 1. The Lord 
    discovers to the soul its lost and undone condition; that like the prodigal, 
    Luke 15 it is perishing with hunger. 2. The Lord tells the soul that its 
    other lovers will ruin it. Sin will damn the soul, the law will never be 
    satisfied with all that the soul can do. 3. The Lord tells them that ho is 
    willing. 4. He discovers himself in his beauty. Lastly, He reveals, 
    stretches out his arm, and lays hold on the sinner in the day of power. "The 
    soul is apprehended of Christ Jesus." And then follows,</p>
<p align="justify">5. The espousals. The soul being overcome, gives its 
    consent to take Christ for a husband, renouncing all others. The soul makes 
    choice of Christ. With the whole soul, the soul makes choice of a whole 
    Christ. Their great desire is, "to be found in him, not having on their own 
    righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of 
    Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. They esteem him 
    altogether lovely in his person and in his offices. They can want none of 
    him. Again, they make choice of him all, for all, and instead of all, 
    saying, "whom have I in Heaven but you, and there is none on earth that I 
    desire, besides you." According to the law of marriage they cleave unto him, 
    forgetting also their own people, and their father's house. Their choice of 
    him is forever, in all times and cases, even beyond the limits of time, 
    taking him to be the strength of their heart, and their portion for ever. 
    The soul gives itself away to Christ. Servants give work for wages, and 
    masters give wages for work. Suitors give tokens and pledges to draw on 
    love; but husbands and wives give themselves to one another, and this is a 
    blessed day. "Go forth, O you daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon, 
    with the crown with which his mother crowned him in the day of his 
    espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart."</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The consummation of the marriage between Christ 
    and the soul. The espousals are in this life, at our believing, the marriage 
    is consummated in glory. Then shall be heard the shout, "Let us be glad and 
    rejoice, and give honor to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and 
    his wife has made herself ready." Now the espoused bride shall be presented 
    to Christ, as the bride to the bridegroom, in the marriage day by her 
    friends. Hence Christ is represented as coming at the last day, as a 
    bridegroom to the marriage, with his espoused wife. Matthew 25:1–5. Then 
    shall the mystery be finished, and the copestone be laid upon the great 
    design of God in the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">Now there is a time between the esposals and marriage:</p>
<p align="justify">1. This time is for the trial of the bride. "And I said 
    unto her you shall abide for me many days, you shall not play the harlot, 
    and you shall not be for another man, so will I also be for you." In the 
    meantime, the old lovers will come back again, and endeavor to recover her 
    affections which they have lost, and often do they so succeed, that they get 
    hold again of some who were never sincere in their espousals, but others 
    remain firm.</p>
<p align="justify">2. This interval is, that the bride may make herself 
    ready. As the espoused virgin takes up her time providing for the marriage, 
    so the soul by making progress in sanctification, dying more and more unto 
    their lusts, is prepared for the consummation of the marriage in Heaven. I 
    proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show what hand ministers have in this match.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They are proxies for the bridegroom, sent as Abraham's 
    servant, to seek a wife for their master's son; because he is a king, yes, 
    the prince of the kings of the earth. They are ambassadors, and that of 
    peace; 2 Corinthians 5:18–20. Their work is to commend their Lord, and to 
    gain the bride's consent.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They are witnesses, though not to the formal consent, 
    yet to that which imports a consent. They see how their message is 
    entertained, though indeed they may be so far deceived, as to take a feigned 
    for a sincere consent.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They are the attendants of the bride, to adorn her for 
    her husband. It is by the word, that the espoused soul is made clean, and 
    fitted for Christ, as the Greek word in our text signifies.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The text tells us of another part of their work, 
    namely, their presenting her to the bridegroom at the last day. This may 
    import their joyful account of their ministry to their master at his coming, 
    when they shall be able to say, Here am I, and the children whom you have 
    given me. "For," says Paul, "what is our hope, or joy, or crown of 
    rejoicing? are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his 
    coming; For you are our glory and joy." Let us now,</p>
<p align="justify">III. Inquire why the Lord employs men in this great and 
    honorable work.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is in condescension to our infirmities. If God had 
    employed angels, how would we have been able to have looked upon them. 
    Manoah and his wife, fell on their faces to the ground, when they saw the 
    conduct of the angel that appeared to them, Judges 13. Ever since sin 
    entered the world, commerce with spirits is dreadful to men; but here, men 
    of like passions with ourselves, transact this most important matter.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is very agreeable, in regard God is in Christ, and 
    the divine nature united with the human nature, that therefore men should 
    deal with men, to bring them to the man Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">3. That God may have all the glory. Were angels employed 
    to espouse souls to Christ, it would be thought that the power was from 
    them; but the more contemptible the instruments are the more does the power 
    appear to be of God, and not of us.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. That the great design of espousing sinners 
    to Christ here, is that they continuing chaste and faithful to Christ after 
    the espousals, may at last be presented to Christ, to be married to him in 
    Heaven his Father's house. Here we shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Inquire what it is for the espoused to keep chaste.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Consider the presenting of the espoused that keep 
    chaste, to Christ. We are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To inquire what it is for He espoused to keep chaste.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They must never be called by another name than their 
    espoused husband. They must hold fast their profession, come what will, 
    Hebrews 10:23. The company standing with the Lamb on mount Zion, "have his 
    Father's name written in their foreheads, and they have not defiled 
    themselves with women: for they are virgins: these are they which follow the 
    Lamb wherever he goes: these were redeemed from among men, being the first 
    fruits unto God and to the Lamb." It must be known by our profession, to 
    whom we belong, thinking no shame to own him before the world. "For with the 
    heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made 
    unto salvation," Matthew 10:31–33.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They must never go back to their former husband, for 
    the soul that is really espoused to Christ, is divorced from idols and 
    lusts, and therefore must not go back to them. "As obedient children, not 
    fashioning themselves according to the former lusts, in your ignorance." 
    This gauding after other lovers, is breaking to the heart of Christ, Ezekiel 
    6:6; and the soul giving up itself to them again, Christ gives up with that 
    soul, saying, "Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone." So we must 
    resolve that we will not go back from Christ, but say, "quicken us, and we 
    will call upon your name."</p>
<p align="justify">The soul espoused indeed to Christ, is divorced not only 
    from lusts and idols, but also divorced from the law, and we must not go 
    back to it again. "Wherefore my brethren," says Paul, "you also are become 
    dead to the law, by the body of Christ, that you should be married to 
    another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth 
    fruit unto God." Now the soul returns to that husband first, when it acts 
    from the law in duty, that is, when they are actuated by the influence of 
    the covenant of works, being stirred up to duty, only from hope of reward, 
    and fear of punishment. The soul also returns to this husband, when it acts 
    for the law, making duties our righteousness before God, and going about to 
    procure the favor of God by them. On the contrary, the chaste soul acts from 
    Christ out of love to him, and in his strength: and for Christ, to his 
    glory. Believers are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, 
    a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has 
    called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ must always have our hearts, our love, and the 
    chief room in our affections. "If any man," says Jesus, "come to me, and 
    hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and 
    sisters; yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple." Whether they 
    be lawful, or unlawful comforts, if they have more of our hearts than 
    Christ, we are unfaithful to our espoused husband, and "lovers of pleasure 
    more than lovers of God." Never do any faithfully give themselves away to 
    Christ, but they have seen more beauty in him than in any other, and 
    therefore he will have their chief love.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They must cleave to Christ, over the belly of all the 
    world's smiles and frowns also. They must neither be bribed, nor driven from 
    him. Song 8:6, 7. Christ's spouse may lay her account with flatteries, to 
    draw her away from Christ; but as "Moses refused to be called the son of 
    Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of 
    God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, so ought all his 
    people to do." They will meet also with threatenings, and persecutions, and 
    afflictions, but all they have must be at his service, they must part with 
    their very lives to preserve their chastity, if called to it.</p>
<p align="justify">5. They must be separated from the world: not only from 
    the world in their hearts, but from the men of the world, in their 
    practices; therefore they are held forth, Revelation 14:4, as a company 
    selected out from among the rest of the world; and they are enjoined "not to 
    be conformed to this world, but to be transformed by the renewing of their 
    mind." To be like the world, neighbor and other, will not do. They must no 
    longer, as in time past, walk according to the course of this world. They 
    must cleave to the purity of the gospel, in doctrine, worship, and practice.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, They must be sincere and upright. "And in their 
    mouth was no deceit; for they are without fault before God." Chaste virgins 
    are like Nathaniel, without deceit. Hypocrisy would spoil all. Our espoused 
    husband is a searcher of hearts, and will not be put off with vain 
    pretenses. We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To consider the presenting to Christ of those that 
    keep chaste. Concerning this, I would notice these six things:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The time of it, it will be at the great day. When 
    Christ comes as Judge to others, he will come as a bridegroom to his own. 
    Matthew 25:1–12. At death they are presented to him, and received into 
    glory; but then both soul and body shall be glorified.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They, and they only, that keep chaste, shall be 
    presented to Christ, as to a bridegroom, in order to marriage. The high 
    priest, under the law, was not to marry a whore. They that shall depart from 
    Christ, shall be made to depart from him there. "For there shall in no wise 
    enter into Heaven anything that defiles, neither whatever works abomination, 
    or makes a lie; but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life." But 
    the chaste virgins shall be brought to the king, Psalm 45. And it must needs 
    be so, for it is not consistent with his honor to take others, and not 
    consistent with his faithfulness to forsake them.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The house out of which the bride shall go, even out of 
    a grave, or out of the world, this earth. Some will be found alive when the 
    bridegroom comes, they shall be changed; some in their graves, they shall be 
    raised. Out of prison they go to reign.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The bride's attendants. A glorious company shall be 
    with her, when she is to be presented to the bridegroom. Angels shall attend 
    her, they that were witnesses to her espousals, shall also be witnesses to 
    her marriage. And O what a joyful day will it be, when Christ's ministers 
    shall say, here are we, and the children you have given us.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The place where the bride shall be presented to the 
    bridegroom, "Then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together 
    with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we be 
    ever with the Lord." Christ will thus come more than half way to meet her. 
    And O what a joyful meeting will that be.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The place where the marriage shall be solemnized, 
    that is the bridegroom's father's house, even in Heaven. "Then shall they be 
    ever with the Lord." O blessed espousals to Christ, but yet there is a great 
    difference between the espousals and the marriage, as 1. The espousals are 
    made on earth, but the marriage in Heaven. They are probably espoused in the 
    temple below, but the marriage is in the temple above.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is a mixed multitude at the espousals, but not 
    so at the marriage. Many put their hands to the pen, and sign the contract, 
    who are not divorced from their other lovers; but there the door is shut, 
    and none but chaste virgins admitted.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The bridegroom appears beautiful at the espousals, but 
    far more beautiful at the marriage, for then they shall see him as he is, 
    and shall say, the half has not been told.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The bride contracts with him in a sorry state, giving 
    away herself to him, that he may make her beautiful. But at the marriage, 
    the bride shall be adorned, not only with a perfect imputed righeousness, 
    but also with a perfect inherent righteousness. The Lamb's wife shall then 
    "have made herself ready, and shall appear arrayed in fine linen, clean and 
    white." No spot, no wrinkle in the bride, but she shall be holy, and without 
    blemish.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Many a time, the bride at the espousals gives away 
    herself to Christ with sorrow in her heart, tears in her eyes, and with a 
    trembling hand signs the contract, for fear she mismanage it, or that the 
    bridegroom will not take her, but then all these things shall be gone. "They 
    shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away."</p>
<p align="justify">6. At the espousals, the bride sometimes gets some little 
    gifts to rejoice her heart; but then she shall get a fullness of joy, of 
    which she is not now capable.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, After the espousals she is in hazard. There are 
    many to attempt her chastity now, but after the marriage she shall never be 
    in hazard any more.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Remember that I have espoused you to Christ, and 
    that now you are no more your own but his. There was a solemn day of 
    espousals to Christ here, last Sabbath, and then we got you espoused to our 
    Master. Let us reflect on this a little.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Was there not an offer of Christ, made to all 
    communicants and hearers, in Simprin kirk, and Simprin byre, that day. Were 
    you not told he was willing, and it should be a bargain, if you were willing 
    also.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Was there any one in either of the places of worship, 
    that said they would not take him? Did any say we have loved idols, and will 
    go after them? Did you not sit and stand there as his people? Why did you 
    crowd in, was it to protest against Christ, we heard no such thing; Nay, did 
    not your heart say within you, even so I take him.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Did we not bring out the contract to you and read it, 
    that you might know what you were doing? Did you not hear the articles, that 
    you behooved to part with sin and the world? and yet after all there were 
    none of you said that you were against the bargain.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Did we not put the pen into the hands of many of you, 
    gave you the bread and wine, the symbols of Christ's body and blood? Christ 
    was exhibited in that sacrament. Wherefore was it, but that you might 
    subscribe the contract.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Did we not see you sign the contract, give away 
    yourselves to Christ, and take the sacrament of his body and blood upon it? 
    Witness then, O heavens! witness O earth! witness O angels! Be you 
    witnesses, O stones and wood of Simprin kirk and byre, and we ourselves are 
    witnesses, that upon the second day of February, 1707, we espoused this 
    people unto our Master Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. And now I have but one request to you. Behave in 
    such a manner, as you may be presented as a chaste virgin, to Christ the 
    bridegroom, at the great day. "Little children keep yourselves from idols." 
    Keep the chief room in your heart for Christ, and let not your garments 
    again be defiled. Consider, last Sabbath you were beginning a work for 
    eternity, why did you consent to the espousals, if you have not a mind for 
    the marriage; and surely you cannot think to go a-whoring from your espoused 
    husband, unless you mind never to be presented to him for the marriage. 
    Alas! I fear we will lose of our account, when the day comes for presenting 
    the bride. Suppose you heard Christ, at that day, say to us, What! did you 
    espouse no more to me, than these? and us to answer, Lord, we espoused many 
    more to you, but they afterwards went back to their lusts, now they are 
    amissing, and we dare not present them, because they have not kept chaste.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION. Alas! it is impossible for us to keep free of 
    sin. ANSWER. It is not every slip that will denominate you unchaste. Let it 
    be the constant bent of your souls to keep faithful to Christ. Struggle 
    against sin; and if you do, though it may prevail, yet it shall not prevent 
    your acceptance, while you flee to the blood of Christ. You may say with 
    David, "Iniquities prevail against me; as for our transgressions, you shall 
    purge them away." Remember the case of the betrothed damsel, Deuteronomy 
    22:25, 26. Amen.</p>
