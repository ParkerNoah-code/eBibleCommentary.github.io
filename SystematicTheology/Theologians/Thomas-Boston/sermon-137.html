    Matthew 28:20, "And lo, I am with you always."</p>
<p align="justify">OUR Lord Jesus Christ having, before his death, as a 
    prophet, revealed his Father's mind, and taught the doctrine of salvation, 
    confirmed the same by many miracles; and having in his death, as a priest, 
    offered up himself a sacrifice to atone for the sins of his people, and so 
    brought in an everlasting righteousness; appears here after his 
    resurrection, as a King, ordering the affairs of his own kingdom, which is 
    his church. And, 1st, He asserts his power, his supremacy, and headship, 
    verse 18, given unto him as Mediator. 2dly, He gives a commission to his 
    apostles, and in them to their successors in the work of the ministry, to 
    raise up unto him a kingdom out of the kingdoms of the earth, to proclaim 
    his laws among them, and to enjoin obedience to these laws in his name, and 
    to take men solemnly engaged thereto, verses 19 and 20. Then, in the words 
    of the text, by promise, he secures their encouragement, for the due 
    discharge of their duty, in the words under consideration: "And lo, I am 
    with you always."—In these words consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The parties to whom this encouragement does belong: 
    You, that is,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The apostles, to whom these words were immediately 
    directed:</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Ordinary ministers, succeeding to them in the 
    ordinary work of the ministry, teaching and baptizing, as is clear from the 
    words, in which Christ promises to be with them to the end of the world; 
    whereas the formal office of the apostleship was extraordinary, and soon 
    expired. Their mission was immediate; their inspection universal and 
    unconfined; they had an infallible directive power; John 16:13, "When he the 
    Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth." They had the 
    gift of miracles and tongues, and were eye-witnesses of Christ: 1 
    Corinthians 9:1, "Am I not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus Christ our 
    Lord?" So that to allow any to be their successors in the formal office of 
    the apostleship, as some Prelatists would have the bishops, is to contradict 
    the plain testimony of the scriptures, and of our senses: but the 
    authoritative dispensation of the word, and administration of the 
    sacraments, with the additional power of discipline and government, which 
    were the substance of the apostolic office, are continued, and will be in 
    the pastoral office to the end of the world; and to these is Christ's 
    presence promised, not excluding such as receive and embrace Christ's word 
    preached by them.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. How, and in what case, they may lay claim to this 
    promised presence; that is in the faithful adherence to, and discharge of 
    their work, put by their Master into their hands. This is the import of the 
    particle, and which knits the work and the encouragement together, verse 19, 
    "Go you," etc. If they shall quit their Master's work, they forfeit his 
    promised presence. If they turn servants of men, they must look to them, and 
    not to Christ, for their protection and assistance. If they receive their 
    instructions from any other than our royal Master, they must bid farewell to 
    their part in the lot of his servants. Men that take upon them to teach what 
    Christ never commanded, bringing in error in doctrine, superstition, and the 
    inventions of men in the worship of God, such have need of temporal power 
    and force with them, seeing they have no ground from the word to expect 
    Christ will be with them.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">3. The encouragement promised: "I am with you," etc. It 
    is Christ's presence that is with them in their work, and who would refuse 
    to go a journey where Christ himself will be companion in travel? if the 
    work be hard his presence is sweet. Christ lays in here a sufficiency for 
    the support of his servants against all the discouragements they may meet 
    with in his work. And there are four things to be noticed in this.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) There is but one encouragement proposed, their 
    difficulties were many. If they looked to their work, it was very hard; they 
    were sent out to grapple with the powers of darkness, to overturn the 
    devil's kingdom, to reform the world sunk in idolatry and monstrous 
    profanity, and to rescue the prey out of the mouth of the roaring lion. If 
    they looked within themselves, they might see a mass of emptiness, weakness, 
    wants, nothingness, unable of themselves to resist the least temptation. If 
    they looked abroad into the world, they might see that the venturing out 
    into it, on such a design, was a running themselves into a manifest hazard; 
    the wits of the world would treat them as a company of fools, the powers of 
    the world as a company of seditious and pestilent fellows; the multitude of 
    the world would cry, "Away with them, it is not meet that they should live 
    on the earth." But go they must; and here is one answer to all their 
    objections, "I am with you;" that is sufficient, be against you who will, "I 
    am with you," to assist, protect, and bear you through in the work, and to 
    make the word in your mouths do execution; I design to raise up, by your 
    means, a kingdom to myself, maugre all the opposition of men and devils. He 
    does not promise to send armies with them, but to go with them himself—His 
    presence,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Is proposed as a present thing, an encouragement in 
    hand: "I am with you—to the end;" not I "will be." The expression is 
    emphatic.</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] According to the prophetic style, it denotes the 
    utmost certainty his servants shall have his presence in his work to the end 
    of the world, as surely as if it were already done.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] It denotes Christ's presence with his apostles, to 
    be, by his own allowance and appointment, a pledge of his presence with 
    these that, being called, follow out the work that they began in their day: 
    "I am with you;" and let these that follow take it as a certain pledge, "I 
    will be with them too." Let the church be ever so low, there was never any 
    glorious appearance Christ made for her, but she may call it Joseph, for the 
    Lord shall add another.</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] It denotes, that Christ's servants, though they 
    should be full of eyes behind and before, yet their eyes are often dim, that 
    they even miss Christ when he is really with them, and so are dejected, 
    because they see not their own mercy: "I am with you," etc.—His presence,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Is promised to be with them without 
    interruption,—"always," all days, every day; it is an Old Testament phrase, 
    denoting the continuance of a thing without interruption; as Genesis 6:5, 
    "And that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil 
    continually." He will not leave his servants at his work at any time; they 
    may sometimes want the sense of his presence, but he is with them always, 
    every day, in lightsome days, also in dark and gloomy days, whatever be 
    their case, however hard their lot may be, their peace may be interrupted, 
    but not their Master's presence with them. While they keep at his work, he 
    will be upon their head.—His presence,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Is promised to be with them without end, until the 
    end of the world; not that he will forsake them then; no, he will then give 
    his faithful servants a place in the upper house, among them that are 
    pillars in the temple of their God: they will enter into the joy of their 
    Lord. But the work of their ministry, as it will continue to the world's 
    end, so then it will be honorably laid by, and Christ will deliver up the 
    kingdom to the Father; so that as long as the work lasts, the encouragement 
    will go along with it.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is in the words the note of attention prefixed, 
    "Lo!" Hereby Christ stirs up and directs his servants to eye his promised 
    presence as their encouragement: Say not you are left alone; see, I am with 
    you; look not to earth, or to an arm of flesh, for your support, but look 
    upwards to Heaven; let not unbelief shut your eyes, but while you have one 
    eye on your work, fix another on your Master, and then you will go on 
    cheerfully. Now, you see that Jesus Christ, the alone King and head of his 
    church, as he has appointed a ministry in his church, and carved out their 
    work for them, and peremptorily appointed them to set about it, so that he 
    has promised them his presence always to the end of the world, in the 
    faithful discharge of the work he has put into their hands; and whatever be 
    the opposition and discouragement they may meet with in it, he wills them to 
    eye his promised presence as sufficient to bear them through in the work, 
    against all discouragements whatever. This is the purpose of the words of 
    the text, which being thus explained, I shall now apply it.</p>
<p align="justify">I. Has Jesus Christ promised his presence to his servants 
    in their work? Let us, then, my fathers and brethren, cleave to our great 
    work, to which we are called of the Lord. Let us steadfastly pursue the ends 
    of our ministry, the advancing of the kingdom of Christ, and the pulling 
    down the kingdom of Satan, according to the commission we have from our Lord 
    and Master. Let us follow our work faithfully, over the belly of all 
    discouragement and opposition which we may meet with in it. Our day is a 
    dark day, and like to be darker; the Lord is angry with the generation, the 
    plague is begun, and it is to be feared there will be a miserable face on 
    the church and land before it end. A door, we see, is opened, whereby errors 
    in doctrine may crowd in, and set up their heads without control, and 
    superstitious worship and ceremonies, mere inventions of men's own hearts, 
    may be, and are introduced, to mar the beauty of this church in the 
    simplicity of gospel worship, to the dishonor of God, to whom alone it 
    belongs to appoint what way he will be worshiped: and the discipline and 
    government of his house are left to be trampled under foot of profane men, 
    for any assistance we can expect now, but from Him whose institutions they 
    are; which surely calls us to lift up our eyes unto the heavens, from whence 
    our help is promised. Our times are like to be ensnaring and very trying 
    times to all sorts. The Lord's hand is very heavy by a great sickness and 
    mortality; but the face of the generation looks as if the time were coming, 
    when men shall think those happy who get to their grave in peace. If it 
    should be so, we need not wonder at it.—Allow me to say in favor of the holy 
    providence of God,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Providence (if it be so) has not stolen a march upon 
    us; we have had fair warning, both from the word, and particular 
    dispensations, whereby we have been brought, as it were, to the brow of the 
    hill, and the Lord has brought us back, as with that, Hosea 11:8, "How shall 
    I give you up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver you, Israel?" Yet have we not 
    returned to the Lord; we have had the Lord's talents among our hands in 
    peace now these two and twenty years; can it be but God will put both 
    ministers and people to the trial, what they have made of the many 
    preachings, communions, and other means of grace they have enjoyed. I think 
    the light has shone very bright in our day; I dare not say our sacred heat 
    has been proportionable; but ordinarily the saddest strokes follow hard at 
    the heels of the clearest dispensations.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Many there are, who have the root of the matter in 
    them, who need to have it awakened with a storm; many sleeping Jonahs in our 
    ship, that are yet signing and going backward, much filthiness and blood 
    gathered on the daughters of Zion, to be purged with the spirit of judgment 
    and burning.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There are many who have taken up the name, but have 
    nothing of the reality of religion, having gathered like simmer's vermin in 
    the time of the church's peace; it is but reasonable to expect a storm for 
    the discovery of such, by the loss of whom the church may turn to less bulk, 
    but not be less worth.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The case of the generation cries for a stroke, in 
    regard of the horrid contempt of Christ and his gospel at this day. The 
    preaching of the gospel has for several years been a weary work, and very 
    fruitless; and the truth is, we have, as it were, been weary of God. Atheism 
    and horrid profanity abound, and are on the growing hand; these cry for 
    vengeance; enemies have a cup to fill up, they have filled it well formerly, 
    it is like, they have more to do to prepare them for an overthrow. So we 
    have reason to lay our accounts with hardships in our work, and that we may 
    have the walls to build in troublous times; and readily judgment begins at 
    the house of God, end where it will. But let us faithfully follow our 
    Master's interests, and work, and not faint.</p>
<p align="justify">And that we may be stirred up hereunto, let us consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Our Lord Christ will be with us in the faithful 
    discharge of his work, Go you, "and lo, I am with you." A believing sight of 
    this would steel your foreheads in the Lord's work, with courage and holy 
    resolution, Ezekiel 3:9, "As an adamant harder than flint, have I made your 
    forehead." Will Christ be with us in the discharge of his work? Then,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) We shall have furniture for our work: Isaiah 41:10, 
    "Fear you not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will 
    strengthen you; yes, I will help you; yes, I will uphold you with the right 
    hand of my righteousness." 2 Corinthians 3:5, 6, "Not that we are sufficient 
    of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of 
    God, who also has made us able ministers of the New Testament." No man goes 
    a warfare on his own charges, neither shall our Lord send his soldiers to 
    fight his battles without furniture, more especially when he is upon their 
    head himself; and if our work be more than ordinary, he will make the 
    furniture proportionable: Acts 4:13, "Now, when they saw the boldness of 
    Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, 
    they marveled, and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with 
    Jesus." May be, we have much ado to get a sermon, when we have all time for 
    study and meditation; what shall come of us then, if we be hurried? Truly, 
    if we have the call, we may look for it being given us in that hour: Matthew 
    10:19, "For it shall be given you in that same hour, what you shall speak," 
    with more heavenly oratory in it than at other times. Be it doing-work or 
    suffering-work, he allows furniture, Philippians 1:29, "For unto you it is 
    given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to 
    suffer for his sake." Isaiah 40:30, 31, "He gives power to the faint, and to 
    them that has no might, he increases strength. Even the youths shall faint 
    and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall; but they that wait upon 
    the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings as 
    eagles, they shall run and not weary, they shall walk and not faint."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) We shall have success in our work, that is, the word 
    in our mouth shall accomplish that which Christ pleases, Isaiah 55:2, "So 
    shall my word be that goes out of my mouth, it shall not return unto me 
    void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in 
    the thing whereunto I sent it." As to the elect of God, "As many as are 
    ordained to eternal life, believe, however the stream of a graceless 
    generation may go." As to believers, they shall be edified and bettered by 
    it, Micah 2:7, "Do not your words do good to him that walks uprightly?" and 
    very ordinarily the gospel is like a fire, that spreads most in a windy day. 
    Nay, the Lord being with us, it will not be absolutely without effect on 
    those that are not one whit bettered by it. It will be at least for a 
    testimony to be produced against them, for our Lord, at the last day. If you 
    go where they are, the dust of your feet shall witness against them. 
    Salvation was in their offer; it will manifest their unsoundness. The gospel 
    will hang the sign of folly at every wicked man's door, let them entertain 
    it as they will: Malachi 3:2, "But who will abide the day of his coming, and 
    who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like 
    fuller's soap." It will torment them that dwell on the earth. Christ's sword 
    is two-edged, if it do not execution on men's lusts, it will do execution on 
    their souls: Hosea 6:5, "Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets, I have 
    slain them by the words of my mouth." The word will never leave them as it 
    finds them, but will either make them better or worse.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) We shall have protection in our work: Revelation 
    2:1, "Says he who holds the seven stars in his right hand, that walks in the 
    midst of the seven golden candlesticks." If earth and Hell should conspire 
    against us, as long as our Lord has any service for us in the world, we 
    shall be protected. Every one has their day of working, let them trust the 
    Lord as long as that lasts, let them go on in their work, they shall be 
    protected. But when the night comes, appointed by the Lord, wherein he has 
    no more service for us, then, and not until then, shall we be called off; 
    and that night will carry us off whether we be idle or at work.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) We shall have provision: Hebrews 13:5, 6, "Let your 
    conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things as you 
    have, for he has said, I will never leave you nor forsake you, so that we 
    may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do 
    unto me." Let us be at our work, and God will see to our provision: Psalm 
    37:3, "Trust in the Lord, and do good, so shall you dwell in the land, and 
    truly you shall be fed." Bread has been an old temptation to ministers: Amos 
    7:12, 13, "Amaziah said unto Amos, O you seer, go, flee away into the land 
    of Judah, and there eat bread. But prophecy not again any more at Bethel, 
    for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court." But such as were 
    faithful to the Lord have always hazarded the bread, rather than a good 
    conscience: consult verse 14, to the end of the chapter. Nature is content 
    with little, grace with less; if we cannot trust Christ for our bread, I 
    think we will scarcely be able to trust him with our souls. Miserable is 
    that bread which cannot be got down without straining our conscience; but 
    little bread will go far with a good conscience and God's blessing: let as 
    mind that, Daniel 1:15, "And their countenance did appear fairer and fairer 
    in flesh, than the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat."</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) Then, as Elisha said to his servant, 2 Kings 2:16, 
    "Fear not, for they that be with us, are more than they that be with them." 
    Psalm 93:3, 4, "The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up 
    their voice, as the floods lift up their waves. The Lord on high is mightier 
    than the noise of many waters, yes, than the mighty waves of the sea." The 
    faith of the Lord's presence in our work would make all opposition of our 
    enemies very contemptible; seeing he is with us that has the devil in 
    chains, and who sets restraining bounds to the sea, and to the wrath of man, 
    and can in a moment overthrow all the enemies of his work.</p>
<p align="justify">(6.) Then he will be against them that are against us in 
    our work. "I am with you." If the world will make themselves parties against 
    you in your work, then, "Lo, I am with you," on your side against them. A 
    faithful ministry has always been the great eyesore of the world; and none 
    can at any time engage in that work, but must lay his account with 
    opposition. But sooner or later it returns on the heads of their enemies, 
    according to that prophetic prayer, which is an awful hedge about Christ's 
    ministers: Deuteronomy 33:11, "Smite through the loins of them that rise 
    against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Further to engage us to cleave to the Lord's work, let 
    us consider, God will be with his ministers and his church always, even to 
    the end of the world.—Then,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Lose what we will in the faithful discharge of our 
    work, we will never lose our God: "Lo I am with you always." There is 
    nothing we have in the world, but enemies may get their hands upon; but 
    there is one thing which they cannot reach, which is better than all goods, 
    liberty, life; that is, they cannot separate us from the love of our Lord 
    Jesus: Romans 8:38, 39, "For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, 
    nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things 
    to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to 
    separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." There 
    can be no lot so hard, but Christ's presence can sweeten, and make it 
    desirable.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The world will have an end, and all its smiles and 
    frowns also will be at length laid by forever. Why then should its smiles 
    flatter, or its frowns fright us from our Lord's work and interest? A little 
    time will carry off both the slothful and faithful servant. But happy that 
    servant, whom, when his Lord and Master comes, shall find so doing. The 
    solid faith of that life and immortality brought to light by the gospel, 
    which we preach, would, I believe, make us very peremptory in our 
    resolutions of diligence and faithfulness in our work, over the belly of all 
    opposition in the world.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Our Lord's work will never lie for want of hands; he 
    will have a church and a ministry to the end of the world. If we lay it by, 
    others will take it up, and write death on our faces, by yoking us to it 
    even in the heat of the day.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) Our Lord and his people shall stand the last upon 
    the earth, his enemies will drop off after one another, he will outlive them 
    all, and stand a conqueror, when they are all routed, and made to quit the 
    field, "Lo, I am with you to the end." His cause will always be victorious 
    at length, and bear down all before it. Who knows but the wheels of 
    providence may be in motion towards the total overthrow of Prelacy, and 
    ceremonies in Britain and Ireland? Providence has often gone to work in as 
    unlikely a way.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Has Christ promised to be with us in his own work? 
    O! then, let us not divide among ourselves, let us endeavor unity in the 
    Lord with all our might, and cleave to the work of God in this land, as one 
    man, against Popery, Prelacy, superstition, error, and profanity, and 
    whatever is contrary to sound godliness, seeing it is the work laid on us by 
    our Lord in his sacred word, the book of our instructions, and seeing the 
    land has been engaged thereto by solemn covenants with God. If anything ruin 
    this work of the Lord among us, it will be our divisions. No doubt there 
    will be means used by our enemies to divide us, knowing well, that if we 
    once break, we are in danger of being broken more and more. Therefore let us 
    pray and act for unity in the Lord; though, like the builders of the wall of 
    Jerusalem, we be separated upon the wall, yet being upon the wall, all at 
    our work, the work will go on. But that which will be our ruin, will be one 
    party throwing down what the other builds up; which will be the case, if in 
    the anger of the Lord we be divided. If the mountain of the ministry fall a 
    burning with the fire of division, all will quickly fall into the sea; but 
    our unity will be our strength: and yet as contemptible as the ministry of 
    this church is at this day in the eyes of many, their unity will make them 
    beautiful as Tizrah, and terrible as an army with banners; yes, even in our 
    evil time, would afford us a glimmering prospect that the Lord would yet 
    fill his house with his glory, Isaiah 52:8, "Your watchmen shall lift up the 
    voice, with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to 
    eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion;" Matthew 18:19, "Again, I say unto 
    you that if two of you shall agree upon earth, as touching anything that 
    they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven." 
    "Agree," or, or as the word is, sympathize, sound together. I take both 
    these to be an allusion to that sweet passage, 2 Chronicles 5:13, "It came 
    even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound 
    to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord; and when they lifted up their 
    voice with the trumpets and cymbals, and instruments of music, and praised 
    the Lord, saying, For he is good, for his mercy endures forever; that then 
    the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the Lord; so that the 
    priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud, for the glory of 
    the Lord had filled the house of God." If, then, we have any love to the 
    Lord, to his interests, to his people, to our own souls, let us be one in 
    the Lord's work. Cursed will that carnal interest be, that shall loose a pin 
    in the tabernacle of Zion.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Has Christ promised to be with us in his work? Then 
    let us not forget him who is with us, let us love Christ, let us preach 
    Christ; this is our great work at all times, Ephesians 3:8, "Unto me, who am 
    less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach 
    among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ." Let us beware of 
    legal preaching; let that be the scope of our preaching, which is the great 
    design of the gospel, to discover the corruption of men's nature, and to 
    exalt the riches, power and freedom of grace in Christ Jesus. We have the 
    more need to take heed to this, because the corrupting of the doctrine of 
    the gospel is like to be the temptation of our day.</p>
<p align="justify">To conclude: As to you, the people, whether you be in the 
    Lord's interests or not, you have heard what you may apply to yourselves. I 
    think, upon the whole, if you be wise, you will say with these, Zechariah 8. 
    "We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you." The profane 
    world will be ready to laugh at this, but both ministers and people must lay 
    their account to be fools in the world's eyes, if they will be wise in the 
    sight of God.</p>
<p align="justify">Let none think from what I have said, that I have 
    proposed myself as an example, or that I have forgot myself in this matter. 
    God knows, I look on myself as the weakest and most unfit, for a time of 
    trial, of all the servants of my Lord. But let truth stand and take place, 
    come of the speaker what will. I desire, with you, to fix mine eyes on the 
    promise of His presence, who has said, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto 
    the end of the world."</p>
