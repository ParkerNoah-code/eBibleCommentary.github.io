    MATTHEW 5:6 "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after 
    righteousness; for they shall be filed."</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
    WE are called to a solemn spiritual feast for the nourishment of our souls. 
    But it is often seen, that many go to it, who yet come away empty. The fault 
    is not in the feast itself, as if the provision were scanty; but in the 
    guests, who often sit down without an appetite. Our text, which is a part of 
    our Lord's sermon on the mount, discovering who are the truly blessed or 
    happy, points out to us the worthy communicants, who shall be entertained at 
    the Lord's table. And in it there are two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The hungry and thirsty after righteousness, declared 
    blessed, by him who knows exactly, who are blessed and who not, as being the 
    puchaser and bestower of the blessing. The world accounts those the happy 
    ones who are full; Christ accounts them happy who hunger and thirst. But it 
    is not every sort of hunger and thirst, but hunger and thirst after 
    righteousness; those who are longing and earnestly desiring righteousness, 
    as ever a hungry man desired bread, or a thirsty man drink.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is the ground on which they are declared 
    blessed; For they shall be filled. The appetite of their souls shall be 
    satisfied. There is many a gaping mouth in the world, some are gaping for 
    one thing, some for another, and all to satisfy their lusts: they shall 
    never be satisfied, but they who hunger and thirst after righteousness shall 
    be filled. The Lord himself shall fill them as the sheep of his pasture.</p>
<p align="justify">Doctrine. They who hunger and thirst after righteousness, 
    shall be filled.</p>
<p align="justify">In speaking to this, I shall consider,</p>
<p align="justify">I. The righteousness for which these happy persons hunger 
    and thirst.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Show what this happy hunger and thirst after this 
    righteousness is.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Their blessedness, or the fill secured to them. We 
    are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To consider the righteousness for which these happy 
    persons hunger and thirst.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is an imputed righteousness, in which they may 
    stand before God, obtain remission of sin, and the favor of God. "And be 
    found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but 
    that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God 
    by faith." The soul sensible of the damning nature of sin, and the 
    naughtiness of all men's own righteousness, and the severity of God's 
    justice, will be pained and scorched, through the apprehension of the want 
    of a righteousness to cover it before the Lord, as ever one was with hunger 
    and thirst. Their great question will be, Wherewithal shall I appear before 
    the Lord? How shall I be in case to stand before the awful tribunal?</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is an implanted righteousness, by which they may 
    walk before the Lord in the land of the living and please him. "O wretched 
    man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" Deeply 
    sensible of this depravity of nature, they cry with David, each for himself, 
    "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me." 
    They seek the renewal of their nature, being changed into the image of God, 
    and to be made partakers of the divine nature. This constitutes a 
    righteousness or holiness of heart and life, that one may speak and act in a 
    holy and righteous manner. "Oh! says David, that my ways were directed to 
    keep your statutes." This they who shall be filled, hunger and thirst after. 
    In a word, it is a righteousness without them, and within them, a 
    righteousness, upon them and in them. It is righteousness and holiness. This 
    is the object of the desires of the happy soul. We are,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show what this happy hunger and thirst after this 
    righteousness is. There is in it,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A sense of want of righteousness. The prodigal's 
    return to his father commenced, when he began to be in want. The hungry soul 
    is cured of the disease of the Laodiceans. Such persons no longer imagine 
    themselves rich and increased in goods, and having need of nothing, but feel 
    themselves wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. However 
    they have slept long, their eyes are now opened, and they see their want of 
    righteousness. They are guilty, and have nothing of their own to cover them 
    before God. They see that they are defiled, corrupted, and all over unclean 
    in heart and life. "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our 
    righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we do all fade as a leaf; and our 
    iniquities like the wind, have taken us away." Whatever they have thought, 
    they dare no more say to any, I am holier than you. But with the leper cry 
    out, unclean, unclean.</p>
<p align="justify">2. A painful sense of the need of righteousness. I 
    perish, said the prodigal, with hunger. They do not merely see a want of it, 
    and as many self-condemned sinners do; but as the hungry man is pained, and 
    uneasy for want of bread, and the thirsty for lack of drink; so are they for 
    want of righteousness. The hunger for righteousness seizes them, and they 
    find a pressing need of it. The day has been that they have reigned as kings 
    without righteousness, imputed or implanted. But now they can do so no more, 
    they find they must be righteous and holy, or else perish.</p>
<p align="justify">3. A sense of utter inability to help themselves. See the 
    case the poor hungry soul is brought to, "When the poor and needy, says 
    Isaiah, seek water, and there is none, and their tongue fails for thirst." 
    There has been a famine of righteousness in the world ever since Adam's 
    fall; were there as little bread as there is righteousness among us, most of 
    us would be starved to death, and all of us would look with pale faces. 
    There is some righteousness indeed, but it is not the produce of our 
    country, it is all imported from the King's country, and they who have got 
    of it have none to spare. The wise virgins could afford none of their oil to 
    the foolish virgins. So the poor soul looking abroad among his fellows, sees 
    there is no help for him in them; looking within himself, sees nothing but 
    emptiness there; and is like Hagar, laying down the child for dead, for lack 
    of water in the wilderness.</p>
<p align="justify">4. An esteem and value of righteousness above all things 
    else. Unto them who believe Christ is precious. Those who are sore pressed 
    with hunger, value meat above other things, and therefore they will part 
    with anything for food. So will the soul hungering after righteousness. The 
    man who found the pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and 
    bought it. An imputed righteousness to cover the soul before the Lord, and 
    an implanted righteousness to restore the soul to the image of God, is the 
    chief thing which the hungering soul values, and will be content to let all 
    other things go, so as the soul may gain these. "Yes doubtless, and I count 
    all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my 
    Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but 
    dung, that I may win Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">5. An earnest longing desire after righteousness. "As the 
    deer pants after the water brooks, so pants my soul after you, O God." The 
    hungry soul has its appetite sharpened, and goes out in desire after Christ 
    and his grace. Hear the breathings of the hungry soul, "Oh that you would 
    rend the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might flow 
    down at your presence. Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might 
    come even to his seat! O God you are my God; early will I seek you; my soul 
    thirsts for you, my flesh longs for you in a dry and thirsty land where no 
    water is." They see a beauty and glory in righteousness, for which it is to 
    he desired, it is the thing that is most suitable to their case. Hence they 
    desire it above all things, and the strength of their affections is bestowed 
    upon it, as the one thing needful. This they earnestly desire of the Lord, 
    and will seek after.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly. An unsatisfiedness with all things, while the 
    soul's desire after righteousness is not satisfied. Fill a hungry man's 
    pocket with gold, clothe him in scarlet, cover a table to him with the most 
    precious vessels, what can all these do for his relief? So whatever the 
    hungry soul may have, under the want of Christ and his righteousness and 
    grace, it cannot be satisfied; there is still a restlessness in the heart, 
    until it be set on the breast of the divine consolations. We proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To consider their blessedness, or the fill secured 
    to the hungry and thirsty soul. They shall be filled. We may take up this in 
    these four things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. God will set meat before them. He himself will 
    entertain them. It is not they shall fill themselves, but they shall be 
    filled, to show the efficacious working of divine grace, in hungry souls. 
    "When the poor and needy seek water and there is none, and their tongue 
    fails for thirst. I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not 
    forsake them." To them will the Spirit of the Lord say, Eat, O friends, 
    drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved. God is well pleased with that 
    temper of mind wrought by his own Spirit in them, and he will be their 
    shepherd, and see that they do not want. He will furnish their table to 
    them.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They shall eat and feed on the provision set before 
    them. "The meek shall eat and shall be satisfied, they shall praise the Lord 
    that seek him; your heart shall live forever." Their hungering shall make 
    way for feeding, for believing, use-making and applying Christ and his 
    righteousness to their own souls. There is no filling without eating and 
    drinking, so the promise of filling, implies the promise of believing, which 
    is the spiritual eating and drinking. Though meat be set before a hungry 
    man, if he put not forth his hand, and take and eat, he may starve for all 
    the meat before him; so the hungry soul must be a believing soul, that it 
    may be filled.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They shall partake of righteousness from Heaven. They 
    shall get what they desire. Righteousness they long for and righteousness 
    shall be given them. They shall receive righteousness from the God of their 
    salvation. They shall get the white garments, which will cover their 
    spiritual nakedness; and so obtain remission of sins, reconciliation with 
    God, adoption into his family, and a right to glory. They shall get grace to 
    sanctify them, to subdue their corruptions, to strengthen them for duty, and 
    against temptations, and to conform them more and more to the image of God. 
    They shall get Christ himself, and all things in him and with him. But of 
    him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and 
    righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Their souls shall be satisfied in this participation 
    of righteousness. It is not only said, they shall eat, but also they shall 
    be satisfied. They shall have a rest to their conscience, by his sin-atoning 
    blood, and a rest to their hearts, by his sanctifying Spirit. They had a 
    sense of want, that created them an appetite, and sharp desire; their sense 
    of enjoyment, shall create them delight. "You have put gladness in my heart, 
    more than in the time that their corn, and their wine increased." There is 
    enough in Christ's imputed righteousness which he implants in the soul, to 
    satisfy the soul. It is suitable to the desires of the immortal soul, and 
    therefore satisfying, as being perfecting to its nature.</p>
<p align="justify">This filling of the soul, as in the case of the body, is 
    carried on by degrees. And,</p>
<p align="justify">The beginning of it is in the hungry soul's application 
    to Christ by faith, closing with him, and fixing on the breasts of his 
    consolations. "I am, said Jesus, the bread of life: he who comes to me, 
    shall never hunger; and he who believes on me shall never thirst." The first 
    taste the soul gets of Christ in believing, it has enough, not indeed to 
    stay its pursuit after more of Christ, but after the world, and the lusts 
    thereof. It finds so much in Christ that it is resolved and convinced it 
    needs not to go to seek satisfaction any where else. "But whoever, says 
    Jesus, drinks of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst, but 
    the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of living water, 
    springing up into everlasting life." This makes the soul say, "Whom have I 
    in Heaven but you, and there is none on earth that I desire besides you." In 
    him it takes up its everlasting rest. For we which have believed do enter 
    into rest. Thus they are set down to a full table.</p>
<p align="justify">The progress of this filling, is in the soul's abiding in 
    Christ, and continuing with him, making use of him daily, for the supply of 
    all its wants. "If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, says Jesus, 
    you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done unto you." Though the 
    communion table is but seldom covered, yet the Lord has still a covered 
    table, for his children to feed at, which is never drawn. "For my flesh, 
    says he, is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed." And they may still 
    be filling their souls with righteousness, by faith making use of Christ for 
    all; though alas! there are many times long interruptions in their spiritual 
    feeding.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, The consummation of this, is in the believers' 
    being ever with the Lord in glory. "Where they shall hunger no more, neither 
    thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the 
    Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead 
    them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away all tears from 
    their eyes." There they shall be completely filled; there they shall be 
    eternally filled without loathing, and have an eternal appetite, without any 
    the least uneasiness. "For there grows the tree of life, which bears twelve 
    manner of fruits, and yields her fruit every month, and the leaves of the 
    tree, are for the healing of the nations."</p>
<p align="justify">Use 1. Of information. Hence we may learn,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That those who are not hungering and thirsting after 
    righteousness, are not meet guests for the Lord's table, and they will get 
    no good of it, if they come to it. There can be no just complaint on our 
    Lord's house, though some go from his table, and get not a meal. For such 
    are found not to be pressed with spiritual hunger, why then should they be 
    filled? They are not meet guests at a table covered for hungry souls, for 
    they will loathe the food that is set before them there, and as they are not 
    meet for it, so they are not welcome to it; they have not the wedding 
    garment, and they will be sent away empty from the full table. For while 
    "God fills the hungry with good things, the rich he sends empty away. And 
    such are,</p>
<p align="justify">All sleeping Christians, who, though they have grace in 
    the root, yet have it not in exercise, Song 5:1â€“3. They have lost the sense 
    of their souls' need, and their desires after spiritual things are sunk, and 
    a woeful listlessness and indisposition for the food of their souls is 
    fallen to them; this is the case of many at this day.</p>
<p align="justify">All unregenerate persons, who having nothing of the new 
    nature in them, are incapable of hungering and thirsting after 
    righteousness, the proper nourishment of it. They are not capable of 
    relishing spiritual things, because themselves are wholly carnal, and 
    therefore can savor nothing but the world and their lusts. "The natural man 
    receives not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto 
    him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."</p>
<p align="justify">All presumptuous, insensible, unhumbled sinners, who are 
    content with their own condition in spiritual matters, and are no way 
    desirous to get it made better. They think they stand in need of nothing. 
    They are not in pain for want of righteousness, but can hold on in their 
    present case, blessing themselves in their hearts, that they are not so bad 
    as others, or have attained to a form of godliness.</p>
<p align="justify">All such whose hearts are so hungering and thirsting 
    after other things, that they have no desires for Christ, and his grace. 
    There are many in whom there is such a ferment of hellish desires after the 
    profits, pleasures and vanities of the world, who are so thirsting after 
    this and the other good thing of the world to themselves; thirsting after 
    revenge on their neighbors, and for satisfaction to this and the other lust, 
    that no true desires after Christ and his grace, can get sprung up in their 
    souls, James 4:2, 3. 1 Peter 2:1â€“3.</p>
<p align="justify">2. We learn that those whose souls are hungering and 
    thirsting after righteousness, may come forward to the Lord's table, with 
    confident expectations that they shall be filled. They have the Lord's 
    promise for it in the text, which is an excellent token for the communion. 
    And we might promise ourselves a good time of it, if there were a strong cry 
    of hunger and thirst among the children. For God promises "to pour water 
    upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground." Were we gaping 
    for righteousness like the parched ground, he would come and rain 
    righteousness upon us. And that you may know this token, and whether you 
    have it, take these signs.</p>
<p align="justify">True hunger and thirst after righteousness, after the 
    Lord, whose name is the Lord our righteousness. A thirst after righteousness 
    separated from Christ himself, is a vicious appetite of legal and 
    self-righteous persons, by which they would build up themselves on another 
    foundation than that which God has laid in Zion. Therefore the saints still 
    hunger and thirst for the Lord himself, in whom they have righteousness and 
    strength.</p>
<p align="justify">It is a hunger and thirst after all righteousness. Many 
    profane and careless souls, will desire to partake of Christ's imputed 
    righteousness to save their souls from Hell, but they are not anxious to get 
    holiness of heart and life. Others are at great pains to conform themselves 
    to the law, in their life, but they lay so much weight upon that, that they 
    are not solicitous for the imputed righteousness of Christ. But the sincere 
    soul hungers for both, Christ for justification and sanctification.</p>
<p align="justify">It is a hunger and thirst after all the parts and degrees 
    of righteousness. The hungry soul has use for all of Christ's righteousness, 
    the righteousness of his birth, life, death, and must be covered all over 
    with it, without mixing their own with it in any part. And it is set for all 
    the parts of inherent righteousness, of nature, heart and life, in every 
    point, even in that where their weak side lies. And they will not sit down 
    on any measure or degree of it, but still be aspiring to perfection. "For 
    every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure. And 
    forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things 
    which are before, they press toward the mark for the prize of the high 
    calling of God in Christ Jesus."</p>
<p align="justify">It puts the soul on resolute endeavors after 
    righteousness. The hungry will use every mean and make every exertion to be 
    filled. Discouragements will not break off its pursuit. Necessity has no 
    law. And hunger will break through stone walls. So if your hunger quicken 
    you to seek after Christ resolutely, it is a good sign.</p>
<p align="justify">The true hunger of the soul cannot be otherwise satisfied 
    than by the enjoyment of Christ. Many have some hunger after Christ, but not 
    finding their souls satisfied in him, they go away to the creature and seek 
    that in them, which they could not find in him.</p>
<p align="justify">Use 2. Of exhortation. Labor to get this hunger and 
    thirst raised in your souls. Sharpen your appetite after your spiritual 
    food. Consider the Lord is covering a table for us. It is a pity we should 
    want an appetite for it. The paschal lamb was to be wholly eaten, so 
    appetite was necessary, and so it is also with us.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, who knows how far we may have to go upon this 
    meal. But if we hunger not, we will not eat.</p>
<p align="justify">Consider also that it will readily fare with you 
    according to your appetite. If you have an appetite, you shall be filled, 
    for it is a sign of the new nature, which God will see to support. The 
    appetite is of God's giving and he will satisfy it. His faithfulness is 
    engaged in the cause. Amen.</p>
