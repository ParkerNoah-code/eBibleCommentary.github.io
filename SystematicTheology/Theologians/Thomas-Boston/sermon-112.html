    of the Lord</font></b></p>

    Proverbs 8:35, "Whoever finds me, shall obtain favor of the Lord."</p>
<p align="justify">BY the favor of the Lord is not meant reconciliation, or 
    a state of favor with God, for that is comprehended in the life found; but 
    the benefits, fruit, and effects of God's favor, all along from the time the 
    sinner is taken into favor. The word rendered obtained, signifies to bring 
    forth as out of a treasure or storehouse. This treasure is open to the 
    sinner, and access to it granted him, upon his union with Christ, so that 
    from thence he may afterwards bring forth as he needs.</p>
<p align="justify">The doctrine deducible from the words is,</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. A sinner once interested in Christ, shall 
    obtain favor of the Lord, bringing it forth as out of a treasure to which he 
    is allowed access.</p>
<p align="justify">In handling this point, I shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Show some things supposed in this truth, tending to 
    clear the meaning of it.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Wherein the soul once interested in Christ shall 
    obtain favor of the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Confirm the doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Apply.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I will show some things supposed in this truth, 
    tending to clear the meaning of it.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is a treasure of favor for poor sinners with the 
    Lord; Matthew 13:44, "The kingdom of Heaven is like unto treasure hidden in 
    a field," etc. A treasure speaks preciousness, variety, and abundance. God's 
    favors are precious, because of his infinite excellency; there is a variety 
    of them, suited to all the cases the sinner can be in; and there is 
    abundance of them, an inexhaustible stock, sufficient to supply them all, 
    and that at all times.</p>
<p align="justify">2. This treasure is locked on sinners out of Christ, they 
    have no access to it, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and 
    strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in 
    the world, Ephesians 2:12. There is favor with God, but it is not for such 
    sinners; the treasure of wrath is their treasure, Romans 2:5. They have no 
    saving interest in the Mediator, therefore no saving interest in the 
    treasure of favor. It is hidden in the field of the gospel; but the field is 
    not theirs, so not the treasure neither.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The sinner once interested in Christ has free access 
    to the treasure, to bring forth from thence whatever he needs; hence says 
    the apostle, Hebrews 4:14, 16, "Seeing then that we have a great High 
    Priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God,—let us 
    therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, 
    and find grace to help in time of need. But it may be objected, Is there not 
    free access to that treasure of favor proclaimed to all to whom the gospel 
    comes? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. It is so. But we may conceive, as it were, a 
    twofold door of this treasure; the outer door, in the free offer of the 
    gospel, the inner door, even Jesus Christ himself. Both are closed on fallen 
    angels; the outer door is opened to sinners of the tribe of Adam, that they 
    may freely partake of it, if they will come in by the inner door; but until 
    they enter by this last, they cannot reach it. But the sinner once 
    interested in Jesus Christ is put in possession of the treasure, so as to 
    have access to it at any time thereafter, when he is disposed to bring forth 
    favor out of it; John 10:9, "I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he 
    shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Even the sinner when he is interested in Christ, will 
    still be needing, while he is in this world. It is true, he will never be 
    again reduced to the extremity of total want, John 4:14, but he will be 
    under partial wants while he lives here, John 13:10. And there is such an 
    emptiness woven into the very nature of the creature, that the saints in 
    Heaven, though they will feel no want, yet will not become self-sufficient 
    by glorification.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly. As it is the privilege of believers, that they 
    may, so it is their duty that they do, bring forth and fetch supply for all 
    their wants out of that treasure. They must still have recourse to it, in 
    all exigencies; and they are welcome to it. They are let into it, by their 
    union with Christ, and they should make use of it in their daily walk. And 
    when they come to Heaven, they shall be filled from it for evermore, 
    Revelation 7:17, "For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne, shall 
    feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God 
    shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."</p>
<p align="justify">II. I proceed to show wherein the soul once interested in 
    Christ shall obtain favor of the Lord. They shall obtain it in all things, 
    cases, and conditions, which they meet with or shall be in. The promise is 
    broad and large, Hebrews 13:5, "I will never leave you, nor forsake you." 
    Romans 8:28, "All things shall work together for good to them that love God, 
    to them that are the called according to his purpose." Go as it will with 
    the nation, the church, or themselves in particular, they shall always 
    obtain favor. But it will not be amiss to condescend on some particulars. 
    They shall obtain favor,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In prosperity, when things in the world are in a 
    thriving condition with them. That is what destroys many, Proverbs 1. but it 
    shall not destroy them, and that is a great favor; Job 1:10, "Have not you 
    made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has upon 
    every side?" a hedge not only about his house, etc., but about him. Many 
    have the former, while they want the latter, and so are ruined. There is a 
    threefold favor that a gracious person may obtain of the Lord in this case.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Balancing grace, to make them carry evenly and 
    usefully in prosperity. Job got it in his prosperity, chapter 1:5. The sun 
    of prosperity shone on him, and he was helped of God to retain his 
    tenderness, and to improve the smiles of outward providences to the honor of 
    God. And considering what a corrupt nature the best have, and how slippery 
    ground the world's heights are, they obtain favor of the Lord indeed, whom 
    Satan gets not cast over that precipice to their ruin.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Balancing providences, some such mixture of 
    bitterness in their cup, as keeps them from mistaking themselves, and makes 
    them sing of mercy and judgment; as the apostle experienced in his own case; 
    2 Corinthians 12:7, "And lest I should be exalted above measure through the 
    abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, 
    the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above 
    measure." It is no small favor to the Christian to have some thorn of 
    uneasiness put under him while he is here, to keep him from lying down among 
    the lions' dens and mountains of leopards, and sleeping in these dangerous 
    places. Every rub a Christian meets with in his way through the world, is a 
    memorandum for him, that "this is not his rest." If that do not prevail, 
    there is,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The change of the course of providence into 
    adversity. Many times that is as great a favor as a Christian can meet with; 
    Zephaniah 3:12, "I will also leave in the midst of you an afflicted and poor 
    people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord." Sometimes the 
    Christian begins to feather his nest, and lie secure and forgetful of God; 
    but God sets fire to his nest, and he is obliged to look to God whom he had 
    forgotten. The world grows a burden to him, and God raises a wind that blows 
    the burden off his back. And he draws away some gilded earth from him, that 
    was drawing his heart from God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In personal outward afflictions, to which the people 
    of God are liable as well as others. O it is a sad case with Christless 
    sinners, under affliction: they cry out under their trouble, but they an not 
    bettered by it; Job 35:9, 10. Nay, many are worsted by their afflictions, 
    their spirits are embittered; they have no comfort from earth, and they have 
    none, and apply for none from Heaven. But the sinner once interested in 
    Christ shall obtain favor is this case.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They shall be bettered by it; Romans 8:28, 
    forfeited. Though they may for a time be fruitless under affliction, and as 
    a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, yet they shall be brought to themselves, 
    and gain some spiritual advantage thereby. And that is no small favor, to 
    gather figs of such thorns and briers.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They shall be supported under it; Isaiah 43:2, "When 
    you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, 
    they shall not overflow you; when you walk through the fire, you shall not 
    be burnt; neither shall the flame kindle upon you." Though with one hand 
    they be cast down, they shall be held up with the other. They have fatherly 
    pity and sympathy in all their afflictions, Isaiah 63:9, and in their 
    hopeless case the everlasting arms are underneath them.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) They shall have deliverance in due time, one way or 
    other, that they shall not perish in their affliction. Though the night be 
    ever so long, the morning comes; the days of their mourning shall end; Psalm 
    34:19, "Many are the afflictions of the righteous; but the Lord delivers him 
    out of them all."</p>
<p align="justify">3. In desertion. Christ's spouse may be under desertion; 
    the Lord may withdraw and hide himself from those that are dear to him; they 
    may for a time "walk in darkness, and see no light;" Isaiah 50:10, "go 
    mourning without the sun," and be so pressed that they cannot contain 
    themselves from crying out; Job 30:28. All communication between Heaven and 
    them may seem to be stopped and blocked up; Lamentations 3:8. They may be 
    under fearful terrors from the Lord; Job 6:4. And this case may be of long 
    continuance with them, as in Heman; Psalm 88:15, "I am afflicted and ready 
    to die, from my youth up; while I suffer your terrors, I am distracted." But 
    in such a case they shall obtain favor of the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They shall never be totally deserted or forsaken. 
    Though the husband may withdraw, yet the relation shall never be broken, nor 
    shall they go out of mind with him, though they may apprehend themselves to 
    be forgotten; Isa, 49:14, 15, 16. They shall have now and then some gleam of 
    light in their darkness, and a secret support shall never be wanting; Psalm 
    112:4; Deuteronomy 33:27.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) They shall not be finally deserted; Isaiah 54:6. 
    Though he may be gone, he will certainly return. There is a seed of joy 
    sown, which though it lie never so long under the clod, it cannot rot, it 
    will spring up; Psalm 97:11. And for the spirit of heaviness they shall get 
    the oil of joy. And the ill reports which unbelief has spread concerning a 
    trying, hiding God, shall be proved false.</p>
<p align="justify">4. In temptation. While they are in the world, they are 
    in a place of snares and temptations. Sometimes public temptations are 
    going, compliance with which being fashionable it is hard to stand the 
    shock. Private temptations are never wanting from a busy devil, an ensnaring 
    world, and an evil heart. These are means of remediless ruin unto many. But 
    in such a case they shall obtain favor of the Lord. They shall either,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Be made to keep their ground against the temptation, 
    and stand conquerors; 2 Corinthians 12:9. They shall have grace to discover 
    the snare, and grace to withstand the solicitations to comply with it. And 
    that is a great favor bestowed on poor, weak, self-emptied Christians, in 
    whom grace from the treasure of favor does triumph; while others leaning to 
    themselves are suffered to fall; Isaiah 40:30, 31. The truth is there is no 
    temptation so contemptible, but it will lay a self-confident man on his 
    back; and none so great, but by faith the weakest Christian may get over it; 
    Philippians 4:13. I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) At least temptation shall not get a complete victory 
    over them as over unbelievers; Luke 22:31, 32, "And the Lord said, Simon, 
    Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; 
    but I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not" Satan carried Peter 
    far, even to the denying of Christ; but yet he found favor, that he could 
    not get him all the length he would have had him. They may fall deep in 
    temptation, but they will not be suffered to drown; for the Lord upholds 
    them with his hand, Psalm 37:24.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Even when fallen into sin, the Lord will not leave 
    them, nor cast them off; Hebrews 13:5. They grieve the Spirit by their 
    falls; so they may expect in that case, that God will withdraw the light of 
    his countenance, that he will set a mark of his indignation upon their way, 
    and it may cost them broken bones before they recover. Yet in this case they 
    shall obtain favor of the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) God will not suffer them to lie still in it, but 
    will raise them up again, John 8:35. Some fall off, and are never recovered; 
    but as for believers, not one of them shall be lost. God's love to them is 
    through Jesus Christ; and forasmuch as he is always beloved of the Father, 
    they shall ever be loved for his sake, Psalm 89:30–33. And love is active to 
    raise up the beloved party fallen.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) While be raises them up, he will make their falls 
    work for good, Romans 8:28. Out of the eater shall be brought forth meat, 
    and out of the strong sweetness. Satan shall be outshot in his own bow. They 
    shall thereby be let into a clearer view of the corruption of their nature, 
    see more need of Christ and his grace, be more emptied of themselves, and 
    learn to prize imputed righteousness more, and so be led more to a life of 
    faith, and close dependence on the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">6. In a time of public calamity. We have all reason to 
    look for such a time on this guilty declining generation, that God will sum 
    up the old and new debts of Scotland, and charge them together upon the 
    generation that is filling up the measure of our fathers. But come what will 
    come, they that are once interested in Christ, shall obtain favor of the 
    Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It may be they shall be hid, and kept out of 
    trouble, that the stroke shall not reach them, Zephaniah 2:3. The floods may 
    swell, yet he who sits on the floods can keep them from touching his own 
    when he will; and often does so, Psalm 32:6, "Surely in the floods of great 
    waters, they shall not come near unto him. Whatever be the stroke that is 
    sent, every arrow has its commission, and can touch none whom God will have 
    safe, Psalm 91:7; as in the cases of Noah and Lot.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) If it do fall upon them, they may expect a gracious 
    mixture of favor in it; Jeremiah 15:11, "The Lord said, Truly it shall be 
    well with your remnant, truly I will cause the enemy to entreat you well in 
    the time of evil and in the time of affliction. And the Lord has often made 
    his care of his people in common calamity, with the beautiful mixture of 
    kindnesses with sharp trials, more desirable in the outcome, than to have 
    been kept quite free, Romans 5:3. This made Paul take a pleasure in 
    distresses, 2 Corinthians 12:10.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Though it should come to an extremity with the child 
    of God, yet the sting shall be out of it, and so it shall do him no real 
    harm. Death is the worst of it, but the child of God may meet it with that 
    saying; 1 Corinthians 15:55, "O death, where is your sting? O grave, where 
    is your victory?" The truth is, whereas the blessings of the wicked are 
    cursed, the curses are changed into blessings to them that are in Christ, 
    Romans 8:28.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly. At death, and through all the ages of 
    eternity. During life the wicked receive many common favors from the Lord, 
    but at death that spring is quite dried up to them. But then the spring of 
    favor to them that are in Christ, never to be interrupted any more, begins 
    to flow abundantly. They shall obtain favor of the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They shall then be perfectly freed from sin, and all 
    inclination or temptation to it, Hebrews 12:23. They will then get a full 
    answer to that petition, "Lead us not into temptation." The leprosy in the 
    house will then be quite removed, when it is pulled down. And the body of 
    sin shall breathe out its last with the death of the body.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They shall be freed from all trouble whatever, and 
    enjoy perfect happiness in the full enjoyment of God, Revelation 14:13. At 
    the last day their bodies shall obtain the favor of a blessed resurrection, 
    and soul and body shall be eternally glorified together.</p>
<p align="justify">III. I shall next confirm the doctrine, That a sinner 
    once interested in Christ, shall obtain favor of the Lord. This is evident, 
    if you consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. They have a right to the whole treasure of favor 
    through Jesus Christ, in whom they are interested; 1 Corinthians 3:22, 23, 
    "All are yours; and you are Christ's." It is the purchase of his precious 
    blood, and a purchase made for them; and hence not only the love and mercy 
    of God, but the justice of God secures their enjoyment of it, 2 
    Thessalonians 1:6, 7.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Jesus Christ is the dispenser of the treasure, the 
    high Steward of the house of Heaven. As he has purchased it by his blood, so 
    the Father has put the dispensing or distributing of it in his hand, John 
    5:22, Matthew 28:18. Now he is their best friend, yes, he is their husband, 
    their head, and they are members of his body. How then can they miss of 
    obtaining favor of the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The enjoyment of it is secured to them by the covenant 
    of promises. In the covenant there are promises suited to every case they 
    can be in; all these are "yes and amen in Christ." So being interested in 
    Christ, they are interested in all the promises, 2 Peter 1:4. These are the 
    several articles of their marriage covenant with Christ, by which the whole 
    treasure of the favor of God is settled upon Christ's espoused ones, for 
    their through bearing in time, and complete provision to all eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly. They have each of them a private key to the 
    treasure, and that is faith; hence says our Lord, Matthew 21:22, "All things 
    whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive." There is a 
    cloud of witnesses, Hebrews 11, who did, and suffered great things; not by 
    their own strength, but by furniture from Heaven; and how did they obtain 
    it, but by faith, that self-emptying, taking, receiving grace, out of 
    Christ's fullness? They who can rightly manage this key, need never want, be 
    their case as low as it can be; faith is a noble provider, bringing strength 
    to the weak, light to the blind, food to the hungry, clothing to the naked, 
    etc.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall shut up this doctrine with some improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">USE I. Of information. It informs us, that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Jesus Christ is the way to the Father, and the only 
    way, John 14:6. Whoever would obtain favor of the Lord, most make him their 
    friend in the first place. For he is the one Mediator, and all communication 
    that we have with Heaven most be by him. They who place their confidence of 
    acceptance with God in their duties, will obtain indignation and wrath, 
    instead of favor from the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">For in Christ only God is or can be well pleased with one 
    that is a sinful creature.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Those who are interested in Christ are made up 
    forever, their bread is baked for time and eternity. They are provided for 
    all conditions they can be in, or circumstances they can be brought into. 
    This is a plentiful treasure, and a treasure that has no bottom, which is 
    made over to them in Christ. Alas! that ever any losses in the world should 
    disquiet a believer, that "has in Heaven a better and an enduring 
    substance," Hebrews 10:34. He may put his gain in Christ in the balance with 
    all worldly losses, and it will weigh them all down.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Those who are without Christ are without the favor of 
    God, Ephesians 2:12. Common favors they may receive, but special favor is 
    far from them. The truth is, the best things they get are blasted to them; 
    hence their prosperity destroys them, and the very gospel of God is the 
    savor of death. How can they have the favor of a holy just God, who are not 
    reconciled to him in his Son, and clothed with his righteousness?</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly. It is believers' own fault, that at any time 
    they are not sufficiently provided according as their case requires. They 
    may have it for the bringing it forth out of the treasure, John 1:16. The 
    breasts are full, if we would suck of the divine consolations. The armory is 
    sufficiently furnished for the spiritual warfare, if we could bring forth 
    the weapons. The promises which the believer is interested in, are the 
    channel of conveyance of supply; but alas! faith is often wanting, which 
    should draw it in through these means of conveyance. If we could believe, 
    all things would be possible.</p>
<p align="justify">USE II. Of exhortation, both to sinners and saints. And,</p>
<p align="justify">First, To sinners. Labor you above all things to get an 
    interest in Christ. O that I could engage you to this pursuit! Truly this is 
    and ought to be made by you the great business of your life, the great 
    interest you are to pursue, John 6:29. You are all pursuing someone interest 
    or other; and carnal worldly interest is what has the greatest number of 
    followers. I would exhort you to labor to secure an interest in Christ. To 
    press this, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 1. An interest in Christ is the most worthy 
    interest you can pursue. And I would commend it to you as such, as deserving 
    your highest esteem and regard, as far excelling all the low and secular 
    interests that can possibly engage your attention. It is the one thing 
    needful, in comparison of which all other pursuits are arrant trifles.</p>
<p align="justify">MOTIVE 2. It is an interest that you may now obtain. 
    Christ is willing to be yours, and to confer upon you his whole fullness, 
    all the riches of his grace and glory. "Behold, now is the accepted time: 
    behold, now is the day of salvation." "Today, if you will hear the voice of 
    Christ speaking in the gospel, harden not your hearts." Christ now calls you 
    to come to him, that you may have an interest in him. O then for the Lord's 
    sake, and your own souls' sake, delay not to come to him, that you may have 
    life, and obtain favor of the Lord.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, To saints. Labor you to improve your interest 
    in Christ, by bringing in to yourselves daily out of that treasure for 
    whatever you need. The treasure is opened to you, you are allowed free 
    access to it; improve your privilege by bringing forth out of it suitable 
    supply for all your wants.</p>
<p align="justify">Question But bow is that to be done? what way can one 
    bring forth supply out of the treasure of favor? Answer: By faith. Faith is 
    the key of the treasure-door that opens it, the feet that carry into it, the 
    hand of the soul that takes up the necessary supply, and brings it away, 
    Hebrews 11. Hence the believer is said to "live by faith," Gal 2:20, it 
    being that which by its communication with Christ maintains the spiritual 
    life, and is the great provider for all graces. Now, to manage this work 
    successfully,</p>
<p align="justify">1. You most lay all your wants upon him. That moment that 
    Christ and a soul meet in the everlasting covenant, the soul embracing him 
    in the gospel-offer, he says to the soul, as Judg. 19:20, "Peace be with 
    you; however, let all your wants lie upon me." Whatever you want for soul or 
    body, duty or danger, time or eternity, let it all lie on me. And this is 
    agreeable to the marriage covenant, wherein the provision lies upon the 
    husband, 1 Peter 5:7. Now faith is to say, "Be it so; from henceforth all my 
    wants be on my Lord." And this implies two things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Renouncing of self-provision, or living on one's own 
    stock and purchase; Matthew 16:24, "If any man will come after me let him 
    deny himself." Faith empties a soul of itself; it is a man's going out of 
    himself to Jesus Christ for all. While the provision brought from Egypt 
    lasted, the manna fell not; and while men are busy bringing forth of their 
    own store for their needs, the treasure in Heaven is locked upon them; but 
    it is opened to the self-emptied believer; Luke 1:53, "He has filled the 
    hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent empty away."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Trusting him for the supply of all your wants, 
    betaking yourselves to him to live wholly by him. You must be like a poor 
    man, who can do nothing for himself, being utterly unable to work and win 
    anything, that casts himself on his rich friend for all he needs, Psalm 
    55:22, 1 Peter 5:7, it is a pithy description of faith which we have; Ruth 
    2:12," The Lord God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to trust;" for 
    the believer is like a silly chicken unable to preserve itself from the bird 
    of prey, getting in under the wings of the dam for protection.</p>
<p align="justify">2. You must lay your wants before him, table your 
    complaints and present your petitions unto him, upon whom all your wants are 
    laid, Matthew 21:22. Thus Paul did again and again, and brought forth 
    plentifully out of the treasure, 2 Corinthians 12:8, 9. What God has a mind 
    to give, he will yet have his people to seek. And this imports,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) A free unfolding of your case to him, as to your 
    best friend, able and willing to help, Ephesians 3:12. Faith makes the 
    believer pour out his heart to the Lord, Psalm 62:8. You most unfold it 
    freely, fully, without reserve; for to do otherwise would argue distrust. 
    Many a time the believer's heart is full of griefs, sorrows and anxieties; 
    but the best ease a pained heart can get, is pouring out itself in the bosom 
    of a God in Christ, Canticles 7:11.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) A resignation of the matter into the hands of the 
    Lord, Psalm 37:5. He is infinitely wise, and the care of the house-hold of 
    Heaven is devolved upon him by his Father, John 5:22. He is to judge what 
    wants are really fit to be supplied to every one, what measures of supply 
    they must have, at what time the supply is to be communicated, and in what 
    manner. And it is the work of faith to leave all these upon him, and rest 
    satisfied in his wise disposal.</p>
<p align="justify">3. You must believe the promises relative to the supply 
    of your needs; Matthew 21:22, "All things whatever you shall ask in prayer, 
    believing, you shall receive." God will have his people deal with him in the 
    way of trusting of his word of promise. And the more firm trust we have in 
    his word, the more abundantly do we receive of his fullness. They are the 
    breasts of the divine consolations, and faith sucks the sap of them, by 
    believing them; Psalm 28:7, "The Lord is my strength and my shield, my heart 
    trusted in him, and I am helped."</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) You must believe them as a sure word, that shall 
    certainly be made out, Psalm 119:160. The unbelieving world take the 
    promises but for fair words, which they will not trust to; but do you take 
    them for sure words, big with mercy and favor, which shall not miscarry, but 
    certainly bring forth at the set time, Psalm 12:6.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) You must believe them with a faith of particular 
    application, not only that they shall be made out to others, but that they 
    shall be made out to you, Mark 11:24; James 1:6, 7. What can you be the 
    better of a salve not applied to your sore, or of a promise not applied to 
    your soul? The devils may believe that the promises shall be accomplished, 
    but they cannot believe they shall be accomplished to them. In our national 
    covenant we abjure the Pope's general and doubtful faith. But alas! the 
    applicatory and appropriating act of faith, whereby one appropriates Christ 
    and his benefits to one's self, is much fallen out of our divinity 
    now-a-days, and is in hazard of being extruded, that it may not enter again. 
    The promises are God's blank bills and bonds; if you do not by faith fill up 
    your own name in them, what will they avail you?" But fill it up by faith, 
    and come forward with them in your hand, saying with David, Psalm 119:49, 
    "Remember the word unto your servant, upon which you have caused me to 
    hope."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, Wait and hang on about the Lord's hand 
    confidently, until the supply come, using the means of God's appointment for 
    it, Isaiah 40; Psalm 27. Faith and the use of means do sweetly agree, so 
    that they be means of God's appointment, Psalm 37:3. And they must not be 
    separated. To use means without dependence on the Lord for the success, is 
    atheism; to pretend to believe, and neglect the means of God's institution, 
    is presumption. But be you in the use of means, and wait on him with 
    confident expectation, that what is good the Lord will give. This is it 
    which in the Old Testament is celebrated under the name of trusting, 
    relying, and staying on the Lord. Trust reposed in a generous man, is a 
    strong tie on him to answer expectation, Genesis 19:8. And they who trust in 
    the Lord shall never be ashamed.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus I have shown you, how you may bring forth out of 
    God's treasure of favor. O you Christians who have interest in Christ, let 
    this be your daily work; apply to the treasure. For motives, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a high privilege that it is open to you, and you 
    have access to it, and will you not improve it? If you consider that it is 
    shut on the most part of the world, that it was opened to you by the blood 
    of the Son of God, by the operation of the Spirit of God upon you, bringing 
    you to embrace the everlasting covenant, you will prize that access, and 
    improve it. Had one ready access allowed them to their prince's favor, would 
    they slight it? No surely.</p>
<p align="justify">2. This is the Christian life, by which true believers 
    are distinguished from hypocrites, even the life of faith, Galatians 2:20. 
    And what is that but the daily traveling between their own emptiness and the 
    fullness that is in Jesus Christ? Whereas the hypocrite, lives upon his own 
    stock, a stranger to communion with God, and drawing supplies from him in 
    the way of believing. As ever you would prove yourselves sincere Christians 
    then, take this way.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The want of this is the cause that Christians lead 
    such poor lives as they do; Matthew 13., "He did not many mighty works 
    there, because of their unbelief." Many who have cordially embraced Christ 
    in the gospel-offer, spend their time in complaining of their wants, more 
    than applying to the treasure for supply; more in doubting of their interest 
    in Christ, more than in improving it this way; in disputing their right to 
    the treasure of favor in Christ, more than believing. And hence such,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Unfruitful lives, little progress in holiness, 
    victory over corruption, usefulness for God in their stations, etc., 
    Colossians 2:6, 7. Little faith will always make little holiness; forasmuch 
    as faith purifies the heart, and is the blessed instrument of the soul's 
    communion with God, by which influences from Heaven are brought down, 
    without which the soul must needs be in a withered case.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Uncomfortable lives. God is "the God of 
    consolation," Romans 15:5, and the way to obtain it is in the way of 
    believing, verse 13. The truth is, it is no wonder the Christian, when he 
    looks to himself, be discouraged, and drive heavily, since often he can see 
    nothing there but weakness, darkness, and deadness; but faith looks to 
    Christ, and sees a fullness in him, "Who of God is made unto us wisdom, 
    righteousness, sanctification, and redemption;" Colossians 2:9, 10.</p>
<p align="justify">4. This is a day when Christians have much need to keep 
    up communion with God, and live by faith, Ephesians 5:16. It is a day 
    wherein religion is like to die out, and the little of it that is left is in 
    hazard of dwindling away, in principle and practice, into mere morality; it 
    is a day of many temptations and snares, and withdrawing of the Spirit, and 
    wherein judgment seems to be hastening on apace, spiritual and temporal 
    judgments too, for that men have not received the truth in the love thereof, 
    and have walked in darkness while they had the light.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, They are most welcome to the Lord, who come 
    with the most holy boldness, and oftenest unto him, for supply out of the 
    treasure; Matthew 15:28, "O woman, great is your faith: be it unto you even 
    as you will." Those honor God most, who are most emptied of themselves, and 
    have most business in Heaven, for supply of their wants. It is a pleasure to 
    have full breasts sacked; and there is a fullness in this treasure of favor 
    lodged in Christ. His fullness is not the fullness of a vessel only to serve 
    itself, but of a fountain to be communicated. O then bring forth daily out 
    of it.</p>
