          Christ to Be Found in the Ordinances, with the Import and Happy
          Effects of Finding Him.<br />
          <br />
          Thomas Boston, 1676–1732<br />
           
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Proverbs 8:35, "For whoever finds me, finds life, and shall obtain
          favor of the Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          THIS chapter represents to us Wisdom speaking openly and most
          earnestly to her hearers. The discourse begins, verse 4, and goes on
          to the end of the chapter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It may here he inquired, 1. Who or what is this wisdom that speaks? I
          answer, Jesus Christ, the personal Wisdom of God; Luke 11:49; 1
          Corinthians 1:24, in both which passages Christ is expressly called
          "the Wisdom of God." This appears from the personal properties
          ascribed to this Wisdom, as,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Subsistence, verse 30, "Then I was by him, as one brought up with
          him; and I was daily his delight." Compare John 1:1, "In the beginning
          was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The manner of subsistence, namely, eternal generation: verses
          22–24, "The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his
          works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or
          ever the earth was. When there was no depths, I was brought forth;
          when there was no fountains abounding with water."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Personal attributes and effects; verses 14–17, etc., "Counsel is
          mine, and sound wisdom; I am understanding, I have strength," etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It may be inquired, 2. To whom he speaks? I answer, "To men," verse 4,
          "Unto you, O men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of men;" sinful
          and ruined men, who stand in need of salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It may be inquired, What he speaks? I answer, The sum of it all is
          to commend itself to their souls, from their eternal happiness, verse
          11, and downwards, "for wisdom is better than rubies; and all the
          things that may be desired, are not to be compared to it," etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. What is the application of this discourse? It is an exhortation to
          hear his voice, comply with it, and close with him, verse 32, and
          downwards, "Now therefore hearken auto me," etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In the two last verses is the conclusion of the whole matter.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Happiness is enrapt up in the enjoyment of him; verse 35, "For
          whoever finds me, finds life, and shall obtain favor of the Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Ruin is inevitable in the rejecting of him; verse 36, "But he who
          sins against me, wrongs his own soul; all they that hate me love
          death."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The former is the subject of our text; in which consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The connection with the preceding words, "For;" showing them to be
          the reason of the blessedness pronounced on those that "hear him,
          watching daily at his gates," etc. These gates are the ordinances. It
          is supposed that he comes out at these gates, and so men being found
          watching at them, find him when he is pleased to come forth. It is a
          metaphor, which may be taken either,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) From scholars, whose hearts being set on learning, wait on at the
          school-door, until they can get in; or,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) From courtiers: Esther 2:21, or others waiting for access to
          their prince.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Or from clients waiting on their advocates, or their judges late
          and early. Or,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) From lovers, who will hang on, watching for a meeting; Job 31:9.
          They that thus watch and wait at Christ's gates, until he come forth,
          for getting their errand, are made up forever. Which is the import of,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The words themselves; describing the happiness of those that find
          Christ. Wherein there are two things—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, The happy man in heaven's account, "Whoever finds me." It
          imports, that it is not every one that comes to his gates that finds
          him; many go as they came; but some do find him. The world counts him
          the happy man that finds riches, honors, pleasures, etc, like Ephraim,
          who said, "I am become rich, I have found me out substance;" Hosea
          12:8; and therefore they watch and wait greedily where they may have
          them, saying, "Who will show us any good?" Psalm 4:6. But when they
          have found what they were seeking, it often appears, that they have
          been seeking and have found their own rain. But he is happy indeed
          that finds Christ, for he finds an upmaking treasure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, The happiness of that man; which lies in two things,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) He who finds Christ "finds life." Without him we are dead men;
          but falling on Christ the fountain of life, as the man's dead body on
          the bones of Elisha; 2 Kings 13:21, the soul gets life, eternal life,
          that will never die out any more. [Hebrews has found;] in finding me,
          he has found life; 1 John 5:12, "He who has the Son, has life."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) He "shall obtain favor of the Lord;" for the Father is well
          pleased with Christ, and with all who are in him. He shall be accepted
          with the Lord; Ephesians 1:6. The sky shall clear on him, which was
          lowering before. Heaven shall smile on him. Yes, he shall bring forth
          favor from the Lord, as out of a treasure now opened to him; so the
          word intimates.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          From the connection of the text with the preceding context, we may
          observe the two following doctrines, viz—
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE I. The ordinances are the place where Christ is to be found
          of poor sinners.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. II. People may come to ordinances, and yet not find Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I shall discuss these two doctrines before I enter on the words
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. I. The ordinances are the place where Christ is to be found
          of poor sinners.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In handling this doctrine, I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Show what are the ordinances in which Christ is to be found.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. Confirm the doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">III. Lastly, Apply.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I am to show what are the ordinances wherein, especially, Christ is
          to be found. If any of you have Job's desire; Job 23:3, "O that I knew
          where I might find him!" I would direct you to "go out by the
          footsteps of the flock;" Canticles 1:8, where to find him. These
          ordinances are,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The divine ordinance of meditation; Hag. 1:5, "Thus says the Lord
          of hosts, consider your ways." Here is the first sight often that a
          sinner gets of Christ; as did the prodigal son; Luke 15:17, "When he
          came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have
          bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!" Therefore David
          advises his enemies to this; Psalm 4:4, "Commune with your own heart
          upon your bed." And here the saints have often got renewed sights of
          him, to their soul's satisfaction; Psalm 63:5, 6, "My soul shall be
          satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise you
          with joyful lips; when I remember you upon my bed, and meditate on you
          in the night watches." What is it that keeps Christ and many sinners
          asunder, but that really they will not come near this gate of wisdom?
          They will not think on their case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Christian conference about spiritual matters. Hence we read of this
          being practiced in a very declining time; Malachi 3:16, "Then they
          that feared the Lord, spoke often one to another. This was the gate at
          which the two disciples found and met with Christ; Luke 24:32, "Did
          not our hearts burn within us," say they, "while he talked with us by
          the way, and while he opened to as the scriptures?" As two cold flint
          stones struck one upon another produce fire; so does spiritual
          conference sometimes warm cold hearts; Canticles 5:8, 9, and 6:1.
          Meetings for Christian fellowship have been meeting-places with Christ
          to many; the due consideration whereof might well encourage and stir
          up Christians to a more frequent attendance upon them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Singing of the Lord's praises. This is a commanded duty; Ephesians
          5:18, 19—"Be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms,
          and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your
          heart to the Lord." What made David so frequently to wait on about
          this gate, but that he knew the King used to come forth that way? Here
          Paul and Silas got a joyful meeting with Christ even in a prison; Acts
          16:25, 26. It is pity, that people should treat it as a blind gate, at
          which they never look for the Lord to come forth. But in the
          experience of the Lord's people he is to be found there. The heavenly
          melody sometimes melts hard hearts, elevates drooping souls, and fills
          them with glowing affection to Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Prayer. It is called seeking of God, and is the highway to find
          him. It has a large promise; Matthew 7:7, "Ask, and it shall be given
          you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto
          you;" and it has been the gate of Heaven to many a soul. It is a
          four-leaved gate, and at every one of the leaves the King has shown
          himself to poor sinners.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Public prayer, at which Lydia got her heart opened; Acts 16:13,
          14.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Private prayer, whether in one's family; Acts 10:30, or otherwise
          in society with others privately; Acts 12:12. This social prayer has a
          large promise made to it; Matthew 18:19, "I say unto you, That if two
          of you shall agree on earth, as touching anything that they shall ask,
          it shall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Secret prayer. Many a soul has found Christ there. There Jacob
          got the blessing; Genesis 32:24. There Daniel beheld the King in his
          glory, and obtained favor; Daniel 9:22. This has many a time made the
          corner of a barn, byre, or dyke-side, a Bethel, a Peniel; and these
          are more esteemed than a king's palace, by the children of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) Ejaculatory prayer. This has many times suddenly opened, to the
          soul's finding of Christ. So it did with Moses; Exodus 14:15,
          "Wherefore cry you unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that
          they go forward;" and with Nehemiah, chapter 2:4. No wonder they do
          not find him, that watch not at this gate.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. The word. This is the most patent door of Heaven, at which the King
          usually comes forth to his attendants, that come to wait on him there.
          It is a two-leered gate.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The word read, Revelation 1:3, "Blessed is he who reads."
          Augustine hearing a voice, Take up and read, opened Romans 13:12, 13,
          and was converted. Junius was brought to Christ by reading John 1.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The word preached, 1 Corinthians 1:21,—"It pleased God by the
          foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. This is a well of
          salvation at which three thousand persons at a time drank and lived,
          Acts 2:41. The eunuch met with Christ at this gate, where the one,
          namely, hearing the word, opened after the other, namely, reading the
          word; and be found favor with the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, The sacraments, baptism and the Lord's supper. These are
          sealing ordinances, in which many have had sensible communion with
          Jesus Christ. It is true, the first finding of him is not to be
          expected here; but though they are not converting, they are confirming
          ordinances; and as such, happy means of strengthening the believer's
          faith and love, and increasing his acquaintance with Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. In order to confirm this doctrine, consider,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The ordinances are by Christ's own appointment the trysting-places,
          wherein he has promised to be found of those that seek him; Exodus
          20:24, "In all places where I record my name, I will come unto you,
          and I will bless you." So that coming thither to wait on him, they may
          expect to find him there. It is the divine appointment put upon them,
          which is accompanied with a blessing, that gives ground of hope in the
          case. By this they are,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Trysting places for sinners; where they may be convinced,
          converted, and regenerated; James 1:18, "Of his own will begat he us
          with the word of truth." These are the pools where the Spirit troubles
          the water for the cure of sinners of their deadly soul diseases. And
          there Christ and the sinner meet, for making up the spiritual match.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Trysting places for saints; where they may receive life more
          abundantly, 1 Peter 2:2, 3. In them he keeps his lower table for the
          feeding of those to whom he has given life. They are the inns in the
          way to Immanuel's land; the pools in the way to Zion, the wells of
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They are the places wherein his people seek him, who know best
          where he is to be found. When the spouse had lost sight of her
          beloved, she goes to the ordinances to seek him; Canticles 3:2, "I
          will rise now," says she, "and go about the city in the streets, and
          in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loves." And they are
          the places where his people have found him, and do find him; Canticles
          7:5, "The king is held in the galleries." So it is even as natural to
          them to go to these duties and ordinances when they would see him, as
          for a child to seek out the mother, in the place where she is
          accustomed to be. And when they find him not in one duty, they go to
          another, until going the little further they find him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. They are what the Lord has allowed his people to supply the want of
          Heaven, until they come there; the tabernacle set up in the
          wilderness, until they get the temple in Canaan. And therefore they
          must last until then and no longer; Ephesians 4:11, 12, 13, "And he
          gave some, apostles; and some prophets; and some evangelists: and
          some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the
          work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ; until we
          all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of
          God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the
          fullness of Christ." When John saw the new Jerusalem, he made that
          observe on it; Revelation 21:22, "I saw no temple therein; for the
          Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple of it." But they could
          not supply that place, unless Christ were there; but he is there;
          Matthew 28., "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
          world." Canticles 4:6, "Until the day break, and the shadows flee
          away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of
          frankincense.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. Lastly, I come now to apply this doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">USE I. Of reproof. It reproves,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Those who slight attendance on ordinances, public, private, or
          secret. It is much to be lamented that there are so many who do so,
          and that so little prevails with many to do it. Ah! sirs, if you look
          on this practice in its true colors, it is a slighting of Christ, and
          an opportunity of meeting with him. It is a breaking of the
          appointment which the Son of God has made with you; and if the
          appointment be broken must not the business you have with him stick?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Those who will come to ordinances to meet with some that they have
          worldly business with. They will come to the church on the Lord's day,
          because they have somebody to meet there, perhaps a servant to
          bespeak, etc. This is a grossly profane abuse of the ordinances of the
          Lord; a turning of that which Christ appointed for the service of your
          souls, to the service of your lusts; a turning of that which is
          appointed for your eternal interest into your carnal interests. What
          will these say, when Christ rises up to plead with them at the great
          day? when they shall hear, that his being to be found there, could not
          bring them there; but they would go for fellow-worms, to transact
          business with them?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Those who come to ordinances, but seek not to find Christ there; of
          such the Lord speaks; Isaiah 29:13, "This people draw near me with
          their mouth, and with their lips do they honor me, but have removed
          their heart far from me." How many go to prayers, sermons, etc., who
          have it not in their view to meet with Christ in them? So they come
          away without him, and they do not mourn because they find him not; and
          how can they be so affected, since it was not their errand to meet
          with him?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Those who stand in the way of others attending on ordinances. The
          effect of this is to keep them out of Christ's way, and to hinder
          their keeping appointment with the Son of God; by which they become
          answerable for all the damage that thereupon ensues to the souls of
          such; Luke 11:52, "Wo unto you, lawyers! for you have taken away the
          key of knowledge; you entered not in yourselves, and them that were
          entering in, you hindered.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE II. Seek Christ in ordinances, and come to them with a design to
          find Christ there. When you go to read the word, to secret duties, or
          family duties, or public ordinances, think with yourselves, "I am
          going to wisdom's gates, O shall I not see the King's face? find the
          smell of his garments, get some communion with Christ?" When Mary
          missed him in his grave, she could not be satisfied with a vision of
          angels, but wept on, until she found him, John 20:11–16. O that there
          were such a heart in us! For motives to enforce this exhortation,
          consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. He is well worth the seeking. "He who finds Christ, finds life." If
          his transcendent beauty and peerless excellencies were known, we could
          not but seek him until we had found him; John 4:10, "If you knew the
          gift of God," says Christ to the woman of Samaria, "and who it is that
          says to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he
          would have given you living water." They that find him are made up for
          time andeternity. When you come to ordinances, know you where you are?
          You are upon a beautiful field, and it may be your own. You see the
          surface of it, but know you what is in the affections of it? A
          treasure, and Christ is that treasure, Matthew 13:44. The ordinances
          are the earthen vessels, but there is a treasure in them, 2
          Corinthians 4:7.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That is what the people of God have been seeking, and are intent
          upon in ordinances, in all ages, however careless the blind world has
          been about it. And they sought always again, because they had once
          found; they still desired to drink of that fountain, after they had
          once tasted of it. Hence says David; Psalm 27:4, "One thing have I
          desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the
          house of the Lord, all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of
          the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. Psalm 63:2, "My flesh longs
          for you, to see your power and your glory, so as I have seen you in
          the sanctuary. When Jacob found himself engaged with Christ, how
          intent was he? Genesis 32:24, "I will not let you go, except you bless
          me." This has made them follow ordinances to the fields and the
          mountains, at the hazard of their lives by persecutors; and they
          thought all hardships little enough, to find Christ in them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. What avail ordinances, if you do not find Christ in them? Upon this
          consideration, we should take Moses' protestation before we go to
          them; Exodus 33:15, "If your presence go not with me, carry us not up
          hence." They are but empty husks without him, and cannot feed the
          soul; he is the marrow and sap of them; John 6:63, "The words that I
          speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life." Mary met with a
          disappointment, when she saw two angels in the sepulcher, but Christ
          himself was away. Should the man that has a petition for life, be
          brought before the chair of state, but his prince not in; would he not
          say, "Alas! it is the king alone himself that can do my business;" so
          here, when the soul seeks Christ, ordinances alone will not satisfy
          it; no, the man wants to enjoy Christ in them, as he alone is suited
          to his case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, It is a great pity you should not meet, when the parties
          have come so far on the appointment. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Most of you come hither from a considerable distance; it is pity
          you should forget your errand when you are come. You come too far for
          nothing; the pains and toil of waiting on ordinances, I think, should
          even stir you up to think with yourselves, "What am I at this pains
          for? what am I seeking? shall I make nothing for my soul by it?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) But Christ came farther for it than any of you to keep this
          appointment, and it cost him infinitely dearer than it does any of
          you. It cost him a long journey from Heaven to earth; to sweat drops
          of blood, and to lose his precious life on a cross, before there could
          be a possibility of your meeting with him in ordinances. And now when
          he is come, shall the meeting misgive between him and your souls? But
          I must proceed to consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. II. People may come to ordinances, and yet not find Christ.
          One may be found at Christ's palace gates, and yet never see the King
          come forth; as Absalom did in another case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here I shall give the reasons why it is so, and then apply the point.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I am to offer some reasons why sinners may come to ordinances, and
          not find Christ. And these are all on the sinner's side.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Some have no design of finding Christ in ordinances at all; they
          have no such thing as a meeting with Christ before their eyes. But the
          Sabbath-day is an idle day, and they will go to the church, and see
          and be seen, Isaiah 1:12. May be they like to hear the preaching, as
          they would like a lovely song to divert them. But for a Christ in the
          preaching, a Savior for their lost souls, manifested therein; that is
          what never comes in their head. They are like Ezekiel's hearers, of
          whom the Lord says, chap, 33:31, 32, "They come unto you as the people
          comes, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words,
          but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much love,
          but their heart goes after covetousness. And lo, you are unto them as
          a very lovely song of one that has a pleasant voice, and can play very
          well on an instrument: for they hear your words, but they do them not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Many are indifferent whether they find Christ in ordinances or not.
          And by their indifference they even court a denial from the King. They
          are not at pains to tryst with him, in earnest, before they come to
          public ordinances. They do not prepare for the meeting, by casting
          down the idols of jealousy, 1 Peter 2:1, 2. Their spirits are very
          flat, and their desires languid when at ordinances; they are not
          fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. They stand at the palace-gate,
          but they do not ask, seek, and knock, Matthew 7:7, and go their way
          contented, though they do not find him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Some desire not to see him at all; Job 21:14, "They say unto God,
          Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of your ways; they are
          well content he show not himself to them. If his harbingers which go
          before him, namely, convictions of guilt and danger, once begin to
          appear, they quickly shut their eyes, and will be very desirous to get
          out of their way. They have no heart for the match with the Lord of
          glory, and so care not for coming to a treaty about it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, Some who may have desires of meeting with Christ, yet
          cannot away with on-waiting at the gates, and going about from one
          gate to another, until they find him. We are naturally addicted to
          unbelieving haste, John 7:6. If the Lord do not keep our time which we
          set, we conclude he will never come, Psalm 116:11. But faith is a
          waiting grace, and sets no time, but persists in that exercise, Isaiah
          28:16, Lamentations 3:49, 50. Now the King, to try of what metal
          people's desires after him are, delays long his coming forth; and by
          the time that he comes, as it were, the throng is away from about the
          palace-gate, and there remains only here and there one whom the grace
          of God has endued with a principle of on-waiting. And O how heavy is
          it to think, that some who have gone far to find Christ, have lost him
          for not going a little farther I Some have waited long, and have lost
          him for not waiting but a little longer. The Israelites waited for
          Moses until the thirty-ninth day; had they but waited the fortieth
          day, they would not have made sad worshiped the golden calf, Exodus
          32:5. Saul waited for Samuel until the seventh day; had he waited a
          few hours longer, he had not offered sacrifices unwarrantably, and
          been stripped of his kingdom, 1 Samuel 13:8, etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I shall now make some short improvement of this point.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Seek Christ so in ordinances, as you may find him. That is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Seek him sincerely and uprightly with all your heart, Deut 4:29.
          They are blessed that so seek him, Psalm 119:2. Seeking from the teeth
          outward, may prevail with those who know not men's hearts; but not
          with him, who knows the language of the heart, without an interpreter.
          It is true, in a way of sovereignty, he may be found of those that
          seek him not, Isaiah 65:1, and love may make a net for a false heart;
          but who can promise on that?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Seek him honestly and generously for himself, Psalm 105:4. You hear
          of his glorious matchless excellencies, let your hearts be caught in
          the net of his love. And let not his benefits be your only or main
          inducement, like those mentioned, John 6:26, of whom our Lord says,
          "You seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you did
          eat of the loaves, and were filled;" for that casts contempt on his
          person. Sovereignty sometimes comes over this indeed, as in the case
          of Zacchaeus.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Seek him fervently, Romans 12:11. How fervent was the Psalmist's
          heart, Psalm 42:1, "As the heart pants after the water-brooks, so
          pants my soul after you, O God." Psalm 63:1, 2, "O God, you are my
          God, early will I seek you: my soul thirsts for you, my flesh longs
          for you in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; to see your
          power and your glory, so as I have seen you in the sanctuary." Drowsy
          desires and lazy wishes will not find him out, Canticles 3:1, 2. Be
          warm and importunate in your addresses, and the King will come forth
          at length, Luke 18:7.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Seek him humbly, Psalm 10:17. The woman of Canaan is a noble
          instance of a humble seeker, Matthew 15:23, etc. Beggars most not be
          choosers. Humility teaches to be thankful for a crumb, for a passing
          view of the King.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Seek him diligently, Hebrews 11:6. Careless seekers can hardly look
          to be finders. Seek diligently, as the spouse on considering her case
          did, leaving no corner of the city untouched, that she might find him,
          Canticles 3:2; as those who are searching for hidden treasure Proverbs
          2:4, 5.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Seek him mournfully, Luke 2:48. Mary did so, and found him, John
          20:11, etc., and Jacob also, Hosea 12:4. When he withdraws, were one
          mourning for the want, it would be a hopeful sign. Lament after the
          Lord; there is good reason for it at this day.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Lastly, Seek him constantly, until you find him, therein intimating
          the example of the church; Lamentations 3:49, 50, "My eye trickles
          down and ceases not, without any intermission: until the Lord look
          down, and behold from Heaven." Be resolute not to give over until you
          have met with him, and be sure you will not be disappointed in the
          end.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I come now to the words themselves. The happy man is he who finds
          Christ. Finding of Christ is the upmaking of the soul, it is man's
          happiness; no wonder it be a big thing, comprehending much. I take it
          up in these two.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) A saving discovery of Christ made to the soul; so the word is
          used, Matthew 13:46, in the case of finding the pearl.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) An interest in him, yes, actual possession of him, as one's own
          obtained. So in our text, finds life, that is, really gets life. So
          they find him, who get such a discovery of him, as terminates in their
          closing with him, whereby he is theirs, and they are his.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The following doctrines offer themselves from the words now and
          formerly explained.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. I. Then do people find Christ, when, upon a saving discovery
          of Christ made to their souls, they close with him by faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">DOCTRINE. II. Sinners finding Christ, find life.</p>
        <p align="justify">I shall handle each doctrine in order.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. I. Then do people find Christ, when, upon a saving disco
          very of Christ made to their souls, they close with him by faith. This
          I shall explain and apply.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In explaining the doctrine, I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Offer some things in the general touching the finding of Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. More particularly explain the soul's finding of Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I am to offer some things in the general touching the finding of
          Christ. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. There is a twofold finding of him; initial, and progressive.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, There is an initial finding of Christ, which is the soul's first
          finding of him, the first meeting between Christ and the soul, Matthew
          13:45, 46, when the dead soul meets with the life-giving Savior. Upon
          this our salvation depends.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, There is a progressive finding of him, which is a child of God's
          finding of him in the progress of his state of grace, Matthew 7:7.
          Thus the spouse found him, Canticles 3:4, after some partial
          withdrawing from her.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The difference between these two lies in this, that the immediate
          effect of the former is union, of the other, actual communion with
          Christ. The one is the marriage with Christ, the other the return of
          the husband to his deserted spouse. The text, I think, comprehends
          both; but the first mainly; compare verse. And both consist of a
          discovery of Christ, and a receiving him; the latter as well as the
          former; the one initial, the other progressive. It is the first of
          these I intend.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. There are some things to be observed touching this finding of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Sinners in their natural state have lost God, Ephesians 2:12. God
          is not their God, they have no saving interest in him. There was a
          covenant of friendship between God and innocent man; but, alas! that
          covenant was broken, and man quite lost his friend, his God. So he
          goes up and down the world, in his natural state, a poor friendless
          creature.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Man is a seeking creature; for he cannot miss to know that he
          wants, nor to desire to have his wants supplied; Matthew 13:45. He
          goes through the creation, seeking something to satisfy his heart. And
          when one will not do, he goes to another. The soul of man, though in
          its blindness it knows not what it would be at, is still seeking; like
          a nest of young birds still gaping for meat from the dam.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, There is no rest for, nor satisfying of the soul until it come
          to God. This is not from any desire the soul has of God while in its
          natural state, but arises from the natural state of it, whereby it
          comes to pass, that nothing less than an infinite good can satisfy it.
          Therefore the natural man is represeuted as one ever laboring, but
          never able to get rest; Matthew 11:28, Isaiah 55:1, 2. And its life is
          a wandering and seeking without intermission; Matthew 13:45, 46.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, God is in Christ, to be found in him, and in him only; 2
          Corinthians 5:19, Colossians 2:9. As the Israelites, who wandered
          forty years in the wilderness, had a tabernacle set up among them,
          where they might find God, which was called (Hebrews) the tabernacle
          of meeting; so Jesus Christ is the true tabernacle of meeting between
          God and sinners; and he is no where else to be found. So that until
          the soul fall on Christ in its weary search, it can never come to God,
          nor to true rest.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. I shall more particularly explain the soul's finding of Christ.
          There are two things in it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, The soul savingly discovers and discerns Jesus Christ, by a new
          light let into it; John 17:3. There is a twofold discovery of Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) An objective discovery of him in the gospel, given to all who
          hear it. Thus the sun's light discovers all things in the presence of
          the blind man, but alas! he cannot perceive them for all that.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2) A subjective discovery, when the eyes of the understanding are
          opened to see what is so discovered; Acts 26:18, Isaiah 33:17. This is
          the finding of Christ, in respect of which the sinner is like Hagar
          near the well; Genesis 21:19. Jesus Christ is near the man; Romans
          10:8, but he sees him not, so still he wants him, until, the Lord
          opening his eyes, he discerns Christ, and so finds him. The soul then
          beholds him in a twofold glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The glory of his person, as God-man: an admirable person, a
          nonsuch, the chief among ten thousand, Canticles 5:10. The soul
          finding Christ, beholds him as the Father's fellow, the brightness of
          his glory, and the express image of his person; Heb 1:3, in respect of
          his divine nature; and as our kinsman, and the glory of mankind, in
          respect of his human nature; the flower of Adam's posterity, holy,
          harmless, undefined, and separate from sinners.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The glory of his mediatory office, 1 Timothy 2:5. The soul gets a
          sight of him, as the great Daysman between God and sinners, fit to lay
          his hand on both parties. It beholds him as the tabernacle of meeting,
          where God meets with the sinner to make up the peace; as that noble
          Personage appointed of the Father the repairer of the breach made by
          sin; the great Surety and Cautioner for sinners' debt and God's glory.
          And there are six things the soul now sees in Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1) A transcendent excellency, beauty, and loveliness in him; Isaiah
          33:17, Canticles 5. It sees him lovely in his natures, in his offices,
          in his holy life, and in his bloody death; lovely in himself, and in
          his purchase. It is a too common question that the daughters of
          Jerusalem put to the spouse; Canticles 5:9. What is your beloved more
          than another beloved? The world sees no beauty in him, for which he is
          to be desired; they see more beauty in carnal worldly objects, than in
          the Plant of Renown. But no sooner does the soul find him, but it sees
          him lovely above all persons and things. His discovered excellency
          darkens all created glory, as the sun arising darkens the
          candle-light, and makes the stars hide their heads; Matthew 13:45, 46.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) A fullness in him for the supply of all its wants; Colossians
          1:19, "It pleased the Father, that in him should all fullness dwell.
          There is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) A fullness of the Godhead in him, Colossians 2:9. The soul that
          has lost God, finding him, finds God in him, John 14:11.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) A fullness of merit, for our justification, and a title to
          Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) A fullness of Spirit, for our sanctification, and making us meet
          for Heaven. Finding Christ, the soul finds a treasure, for
          preciousness, abundance, and variety.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">(3.) A suitableness in him; and that is twofold.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          [1.] A suitableness in Christ to their own case, as when a hungry man
          finds meat, or a naked man clothes, Revelation 3:18. The soul of man
          goes through the creation, seeking a match in whom it may rest; but it
          never finds a suitable one until it find Christ. Still the bed is
          shorter than that it can stretch itself upon it, and the cover
          narrower than that it can wrap itself in it; but coming to Christ, the
          soul finds him completely suited to its case; suited to still and
          quiet the conscience by his sin-atoning blood, and to satisfy its
          craving desires by his all-fullness. There appears, then, a
          suitableness in everything in and about him; in his natures, in his
          offices, in his life and death, resurrection, ascension, etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          [2.] A suitableness in him to the glory of God. The sinner whose eyes
          are opened can never expect salvation but in a way suitable to God's
          perfections, his holiness and justice; and the mystery of Christ
          appears thus suited, 2 Corinthians 4:6. Here at once appears how
          justice is satisfied, and the sinner saved; and God has his glory and
          the sinner his salvation together.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) The wisdom of God in him, 1 Corinthians 1:24. The wisdom of God
          eminently appeared in the creation, and appears every day in the works
          of providence; but the master-piece of divine wisdom is the mystery of
          Christ, wherein is the greatest display of the divine perfections, his
          power, justice, holiness, mercy, love, goodness, and truth, all woven
          together by infinite wisdom. And there is none that finds Christ, but
          must say that that device is one becoming infinite wisdom.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (5.) An ability to save, Hebrews 7:25. When sin appears in its native
          colors to the awakened conscience, the soul is apt to question, if
          there be any balm in Gilead for such wounds; if there be any hope of
          such a case. But when Christ is discovered to the soul, he appears as
          the Lord of hosts, mighty to save; there is merit enough in his blood
          to wash away the deepest guilt, and efficacy enough in his Spirit to
          subdue the strongest corruptions.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (6.) Lastly, Willingness to save, and to communicate of his fullness
          to the needy soul, Hebrews 4:15, 16. The discovery of this was what
          brought the prodigal son home, Luke 15:17, and the utter want of it
          must make the starving soul die in despondency. This is that which of
          all things awakened sinners have most ado to discern in Christ, if he
          be willing to save them, to bestow his precious blood to wash such
          vile wretches as they. But it is discovered in lesser or greater
          measure to all that find Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, Upon this discovery of Christ made unto and by the soul, the
          soul closes with Christ by faith. There is such a connection between
          these two, that
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) None can close with Christ without it, Canticles 5:9. People may
          love an unseen Christ, but not an unknown Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) All that get it close with him, Psalm 9:10, John 4:10. For,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Such a discovery of Christ is not made to the soul until it be
          hunger-bitten, lost in its own eyes, and would be content with a
          Savior on any terms, Acts 9:6, Proverbs 24:7. A starving person needs
          no other invitation to eat but to see meat; and when Christ is
          discovered to the soul lost in its own eyes, it will embrace him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The nature of the object speaks for itself, John 4:10. Christ
          discovered to the soul is precious, 1 Peter 2:7, and he who once finds
          the pearl, will gripe at it to make it his own. He is suitable to its
          case, which likewise insures the soul's closing with him, as the sick
          man with the physician, or the captive with the deliverer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is always attended with a heart-conquering power, Psalm 110:3.
          When the Lord opens the eyes in saving illumination, he looses the
          heart by renewing the will, and so brings the soul to embrace Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I shall now apply this branch of the subject.</p>
        <p align="justify">USE I. Of information. This shows us,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. They have never found Christ, nor seen his glory, who have not
          closed with him, Psalm 9:10. They who have not matched with Christ,
          have never yet seen nor known the glorious Bridegroom, John 1:10, 11.
          For all they have heard of him in the word, or seen of him in the
          sacraments, they are still unacquainted with him, and he has ever been
          a veiled beauty to them. A look of him with an illuminated eye of the
          mind, would have conquered their souls to his love, Isaiah 45:22.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They who reject Christ and his way, and think they have reason for
          so doing, must know that their judgment is not to be regarded; for
          they are blind men judging of colors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) There are some who never made so much as a show of trial of
          Christ and his way. They were estranged from God from the womb, and
          they held even forward in their course of sin to this day, without
          changing; and they are making lies of Christ to themselves and others,
          Psalm 58:3. Poor souls, they know no better, they are under
          soul-ruining delusion. If their eyes were opened, they would hate what
          they now love, and love what they now hate, Tit 3:3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) There are others, who, after a seeming trial made of Christ and
          his way, have cast them behind their back, 2 Peter 2:22. But neither
          have they ever got a discovery of him, for as long as they have hung
          on about Wisdom's gates, 1 Corinthians 2:8. They have got into the
          outer court, of prayer, the communion-table, a fair blooming
          profession; but they never got into the inner court, to see the King
          in his beauty. Let both know, that there is something in religion
          which they never knew to this day; and while they despise it, they
          despise what they know not. And if they knew what they know not, they
          would as soon embrace death and Hell, and throw away their own life,
          as do what they do.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. You who have got such a discovery of Christ as has determined you
          to close with him, you have found Christ, and happy are you. All the
          people of God have not alike sensible enjoyment of Christ, Matthew
          17:1, 2, nor alike measure of manifestations of him. Neither are their
          comforts of alike height, more than their downcastings are of alike
          depth. But that discovery of Christ which terminates in the soul's
          closing with him, is saving.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE II. Of trial. Hereby you may try whether ever you have found
          Christ or not. We have been long making the fashion of seeking, let us
          try whether we have come speed or not. If you have got such a
          discovery of him, as has terminated in your souls' closing with him,
          you have found him. And you may know it by these marks,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MARK 1. If you have found Christ, you will value the discovery as a
          matchless favor, and display of free grace, Matthew 13:44. Like as a
          poor man, traveling through a desert, in want of all things, would
          value his finding a covered table and all necessities; so will the
          soul that has been seeking rest through the empty creation, and is
          still disappointed, value the discovery of a full Christ made to it,
          Psalm 119:162. You will admire free grace in it, and not impute it to
          your own pains and diligence, that ever you had any acquaintance with
          him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MARK 2. A found Christ will engage your esteem above all other persons
          and things, 1 Peter 2:7. He will be in your eyes the chief among ten
          thousand. The world, and all that is in it will be but loss and dung
          in comparison of him, Psalm 73:25. However low I thoughts you had of
          him before, the market will be raised now, and the rate you will put
          on him will be so high, as the compass of the whole world, nay, the
          compass of men's desires will not be able to afford an equivalent, and
          as good, Proverbs 8:11.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MARK 3. The discovery of Christ in his glory, will show sin in ugly
          colors, and fill a soul with self-loathing and abhorrence, Job 42:5,
          6; Isaiah 6:5. Delusion puffs up, but real manifestations of Christ
          are humbling. As in the balances, one scale goes up when the other
          goes down; so the more Christ is exalted in the eyes of a sinner, the
          more sin and self are depressed. Doves' dung and donkeys' heads gave a
          great price in Samaria, when bread was not to be had, but when it came
          they were no more valued. That light will discover the worthlessness
          even of one's duties, and show one's own righteousness like a
          moth-eaten garment, held up before the sun, Isaiah 64:6; and leave one
          poor in spirit before the Lord.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MARK 4. A found Christ will engage the sinner's heart and affections,
          loosing the bond between them and other lovers, and dispose the soul
          to say, as Isaiah 26:13, "O Lord our God, other lords besides you have
          had dominion over us; but by you only will we make mention of your
          name." There is an overcoming glory in him, which being discerned does
          infallibly give him the preference in the heart to all competitors,
          Titus 2:11. A believing view of his glory fills the heart with desire
          after him, and love to him above and beyond all other things, Isaiah
          26:9; Canticles 1:3. Many a stroke the law, perhaps, has given to
          break the bonds of iniquity; but still they hold the sinner fast. But
          when the gospel fire is set on in the soul, and thereby Christ is
          discovered in his matchless excellency to the soul, these bonds are
          burnt and melted down.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MARK 5. Christ being found, the sinner parts with all for him, without
          reserve; and when he has left all for him, he thinks he has a good
          bargain, Matthew 13:46. Where any reserve is made, there is no saving
          discovery of Christ made there, who in his first appearance in the
          soul says effectually, "If you take me, let these go their way." The
          soul parts with all sin;
        </p>
        <p align="justify">(1.) In respect of affliction, Romans 7:19.</p>
        <p align="justify">(2) Of voluntary subjection, Romans 6:14.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Of allowed residence, Romans 7:24. It parts with self too.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Civil self, friends, credit, ease, etc., Luke 16:26; Hebrews
          11:24, 25; Deut 33:9.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Natural self, even life itself is at his disposal. All that a man
          has will he give for his life; but one will not give a found Christ
          for it, Luke 14:26. And
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Religious self is parted with, whereby the soul "counts all
          things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ,"
          Philippians 3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MARK 6. A saving discovery of Christ transforms the soul into his
          image. The sight of the most beautiful object on earth cannot work a
          likeness to it on the beholders; but a manifestation of Christ does
          it, 2 Corinthians 3:18. Love breeds likeness, and likeness nourishes
          love, and none see Christ in his glory, but they love him, and
          therefore do put on Christ, Romans 13; laboring to walk as he walked,
          1 John 2:6. From that moment the soul finds Christ, it commences
          nonconformist to the world, being transformed, cast into another mold,
          in respect of nature and actions, Romans 12:2. And when at death the
          discovery shall be perfect, so will holiness be, 1 John 3:2.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MARK 7. They that have once had a saying discovery of Christ, will
          always desire further discoveries of him, until they see him as he is,
          Exodus 33:18, "Show me your glory," will be the language of, their
          hearts. Here we have the bridegroom's picture as it were in
          ordinances, in the word; and they who have once seen the beauty of it,
          will always he desiring more. Paul knew much of Christ, but his eye
          was not satisfied with seeing, Philippians 3:10. Christ was the sum of
          his life, Philippians 1:21; the body of divinity to which he desired
          to confine his studies, 1 Corinthians 2:2; for in the knowledge of
          Christ all religion lies; therefore the learning of Christianity is
          the learning of Christ, Ephesians 4:20, 21.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. Sinners finding Christ, find life.</p>
        <p align="justify">In discoursing from this doctrine, I shall;</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Unfold that life which sinners find, finding Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. Confirm the point,</p>
        <p align="justify">III. Make some practical improvement.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall unfold that life which sinners find finding Christ. They
          find a treasure who find Christ, a treasure of life. To open it up, I
          will show,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">1. What life they find who find Christ.</p>
        <p align="justify">2. What are the qualities of this life.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, I will show what life they find who find Christ. It is a life
          that goes as wide as the death they found in Adam; Romans 5:11, "For
          if through the offence of any one, many be dead; much more the grace
          of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has
          abounded unto many." It is a salve proportioned to that sore. The
          sinner's finding life in Christ implies, that without Christ, he is
          under death, which therefore we shall take along with us. And always
          the more of Christ, the more life; and the less of Christ, the less
          life. The sinner then finding Christ, finds,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. A life of grace, in regeneration, which is a spiritual quickening
          of the soul; Ephesians 2:5, "Even when we were dead in sins, has
          quickened us together with Christ." Man in his natural unconverted
          state, is spiritually dead, Ephesians 2:1. Adam eating the forbidden
          fruit, poisoned himself and all his offspring, for it brought
          immediate death to them; it separated them from God the fountain of
          life; and so they lie in their natural state, as buried in the grave
          of sin, void of all life and sense in spiritual things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But in the day of the soul's finding Christ, the Spirit of Christ
          enters into it, and quickens it, as Lazarus's soul entering into his
          body, while Christ stood by his grave. So the dead soul is raised, the
          dry bones come together, and are made to live. The man is endowed with
          a new vital principle, patting him in a capacity to more and act
          graciously, Galatians 2:20. He is a new creature, as one raised from
          the dead. There is a new light let into his mind, a new set given to
          his will, a new regulation made on his affections; all is new, as by a
          first resurrection.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. A life of favor with God; Psalm 30:5, "In his favor is life." God
          is Lord of life and death, and we have forfeited our life to him by
          our rebellions. May not one say then, he is a dead man, who is out of
          God's favor; and he is secured for life, who enjoys it? A sinner out
          of Christ is a dead man, in so far as he is dead in law, and the
          broken law has doomed him to die eternally, Galatians 3:10. All the
          fearful threats and curses of the first covenant, are twisted about
          him as so many cords of death, binding him as a condemned criminal,
          until the day of execution.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the sinner finding Christ, the sentence of condemnation is
          reversed, he is no more a condemned man, Romans 8:1. Christ comes into
          the iron-house, makes a discovery of himself to the sinner in chains,
          and there the match is made between the Bridegroom and the captive
          daughter of Zion. The prison-garments are taken off, and the
          marriage-robe is put on the believer, Philippians 3:9. Then God says,
          "Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom," Job
          33:24. So the chains of guilt drop off, and the prison-doors are set
          open to Christ to hand out his spouse by, and the face-covering that
          was on the condemned is destroyed. Now, who has anything to say, why
          the prisoner may not go forth free with her Lord and Husband? Romans
          8:33. Justice is satisfied, who had the claim against her; the law
          that laid her up, and kept her bound, has no more to demand, Galatians
          2:20. The debt is paid, the bond is got up, and torn in pieces,
          Colossians 2:14. The jailor therefore cannot keep her longer, and
          death which stood before her with a devouring mouth, is swallowed up
          in victory, Isaiah 25:8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. A life of new obedience; Romans 4:4, "Therefore we are buried with
          him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the
          dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
          newness of life." By nature we are quite void of this life, John 15:5.
          The soul in its natural state is never idle indeed, but ever working;
          but then all its works are dead works, Hebrews 9:14, which can never
          please the living God. The old man has his deeds in them that are out
          of Christ, and all their deeds are so; their very religions duties are
          dead works, and in them they are but as walking ghosts. They cannot
          perform one vital action in a spiritual sense; Genesis 6:5, Psalm
          14:3, Titus 1:15.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the sinner finding Christ finds newness of life. He is not the man
          be was. Christ not only brings him out of the grave of his natural
          state but he looses all his grave-clothes of reigning lusts, and sets
          him a-pulling them off, and easting them from him; Colossians 3:8. He
          gives them change of clothing. The man pats on Christ, personates him,
          walking as he also walked. Now his obedience is universal, Psalm
          119:6; his heart is shaped out in breadth and length to the whole law
          of Christ. It is spiritual; it is a cluster of vital actions, whereof
          Christ is the principle; Galatians 2:20, and the end Philippians 1:21.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. A life of comfort. Non vivere valere sed est vita; 1 Samuel 25:6. 1
          Thessalonians 3:8. The natural man has the most uncomfortable life is
          the world. He has no solid ground of comfort, because matters are
          quite wrong between Heaven and him; he has no actual comfort, but as
          it were in a dream, when he drinks of the broken cisterns, as to
          forget his misery: Job 15:21.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the sinner finding Christ finds a life of comfort. He is put into
          a comfortable state, as reconciled to God, and having his sin
          pardoned; Psalm 32:1. And if at any time he want comfort, it is not
          because the ground of it is rased, for that can never be while the
          everlasting covenant remains, 2 Samuel 23:5, but became his eyes are
          held that he cannot perceive it, like Hagar at the well. And in his
          deepest sorrows and distress, there is a seed of comfort that will
          spring up; Psalm 97:11. Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness
          for the upright in heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, Eternal life; John 17:3. Man in his natural state is a dead
          man, liable to eternal death in Hell. And whoever lives and dies in
          that state, cannot miss to perish forever; Mark 16:16. Wherefore
          whenever God opens the sinner's eyes to see his own case, he sees he
          is eternally lost if he get not help; Acts 2:37.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But the sinner finding Christ finds eternal life; John 3. The second
          death can have no power over him, from that happy moment He commences
          an heir of glory, and heaven's happiness is secured to him. Come death
          when it will, come judgment when it will, his happy state is already
          determined by the word, and can never be reversed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, I shall show what are the qualities of the life which they
          find who find Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is a divine life; Ephesians 4:18. So it is the most excellent
          life. The vegetative life, by which our bodies glow, is common to us
          with the plants of the earth; the life of sense, with brutes; the life
          of reason, with infidels; but this life exalts one to a rank of beings
          superior to the rest of mankind, namely, into the rank of saints
          partakers of the divine nature.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is a life of the whole man. Sinners out of Christ are but half
          alive, and that in the worst half too, while their bodies are alive,
          their souls are dead within them; 1 Timothy 5:6. But on the soul's
          finding Christ, the soul is made alive too, and so the whole man
          lives; the better part is quickened. And as the dead souls of the
          wicked will secure the eternal death of their bodies too, death
          spreading itself from their souls to their bodies; so the life of the
          soul will secure the eternal life of the body, life spreading in like
          manner from the soul to the body; Romans 8:11.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is a pleasant life; Proverbs 3:17. Sinners are generally
          prejudiced in the case, as if it were an unpleasant and uncomfortable
          life; but that is the opinion only of those who are unacquainted with
          it; for David could say, Psalm 4:7, "You have put gladness in my
          heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine
          increased." It is true, the pleasure of it is not expressed in the
          noisy way in which the world expresses theirs; it is a water that runs
          deeper than to make such a noise as the shallow brooks and muddy
          streams of the world's pleasures do. But all the pleasantries of the
          men of the world, are light as a feather in comparison of the pleasure
          found in communion with God, the sense of his favor, and the serenity
          of conscience; by this good token, that these will bear up a man in
          the greatest distresses, where those others evanish at the blast;
          Habakkuk 3:17.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. It is a persevering life, that can never be lost; Habakkuk 2:4,
          "The just shall live by his faith." Compare Hebrews 10:38. It is a
          life that, from the moment it is given, shall never die out forever;
          John 4:14. The life of inherent grace may be very low, but can never
          be lost; one may lose the sense of the life of favor with God, but can
          never lose the thing itself; John 5:24. They that now lead the most
          honorable and wealthy life in the world, death will put an end to it;
          but this life will make its way through death itself, unhurt.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly, It is a growing life; John 10:10. It is true, the Christian
          life is not always growing, more than the trees in winter. But it is a
          life that grows universally, regularly, and proportionably, until it
          come to its perfection in glory; Proverbs 4:18, "The path of the just
          is as the shining light, that shines more and more unto the perfect
          day." It buds in regeneration, begins to open in progressive
          sanctification, and is full spread in glory; but it shall never
          wither, but be fresh and fragrant through eternity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. In order to confirm this doctrine, That sinners finding Christ
          find life, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The Mediator, by the Father's appointment, is the immediate
          receptacle of life for all to whom life is designed by the Father,
          Colossians 1:19; as the bowl in Zechariah's candlestick received the
          oil from the two olive-trees, and communicated the same by the pipes
          to the lamps; Zechariah 4:2, 3. God seeing all mankind dead in Adam.
          but having destined the elect number to life, has pat life for then
          all in the Mediator, as in a sure repository, where it cannot be lost;
          1 John 5:11, hence the apostle draws the conclusion of our text; verse
          12, "He who has the Son, has life;" even as he who has a woman in
          marriage, has all that is hers; so he who has Christ not only has a
          right to, but actually has life, even everlasting life; verse 13; John
          5:24. He who buys the field has the treasure in it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. As Adam lost his life, and that of all his posterity, by his losing
          of God, who is the life and soul of the soul of man; Psalm 30:5, in
          separation of the soul from whom its death lies; so the sinner finding
          Christ finds God again, and therefore must needs find life. God is in
          Christ, the fullness of the Godhead is in him; Colossians 2:9, and by
          him the believer comes to God; Hebrews 7:25, for that was the end of
          his death," that he might bring us to God;" 1 Peter 3:18. The Father
          becomes his Father, the Son his Savior, the Holy Spirit his
          Sanctifier; for a whole Trinity is made over to the sinner in the
          covenant "I am your God." So finding Christ, the sinner finds the
          whole Trinity of persons; how then can he but find life?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The sinner finding Christ finds the Spirit of life. This is so
          certain, that "if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of
          his," Romans 8:9. Not only do the graces of the Spirit dwell in them
          who have found Christ, but the person of the Spirit, the cause of the
          other; Romans 8:11. This is that which gives them life, preserves it
          that it cannot be lost, increases it, and at length perfects it; John
          4:14. We see many who getting some light touches and common operations
          of the Spirit, seem to live for a while; but their seeming life wears
          away by degrees, and they never recover it; why? because not having
          found Christ, they have not found life, nor the Spirit either. But
          believers are recovered from their decays, because the Spirit of life
          still remains with them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The sinner finding Christ, is united to him as a member of his
          body; Ephesians 3:17. Hence his life secures theirs; John 14:19,
          "Because I live, you shall live also." They cannot die, as long as be
          lives, and therefore their life is everlasting. As members of Christ,
          the Spirit of Christ dwells in them, as the principle of their life;
          and they derive spiritual nourishment from him, as the branches from
          the vine-stock. Hence it is that the resurrection of their mortal
          bodies is secured to them, according to Romans 8:11, "But if the
          Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he who
          raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies,
          by his Spirit that dwells in you." So that finding Christ, they find
          everlasting life of soul and body.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. The sinner finding Christ, finds all the promises of the
          everlasting covenant, which are all promises of life, as the
          threatenings of the law are of death; Titus 1:2; 2 Corinthians 1:20;
          for the promises are immediately made to Christ; Galatians 3:16, and
          in right of him they become ours. Hence "he who spared not his own
          Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also
          freely give us all things?" Romans 8:32. Some would reckon themselves
          made up all their life, if they did find a parcel of bank-bills; but
          he who finds Christ, finds heaven's bank-bills, which being presented
          to God, will get payment of them to the bearer, be who he will, and
          that such as will make him live happily through the ages of eternity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. The sinner finding Christ, finds a satisfactory answer to all the
          law's demands, which staves him off from life until they be satisfied.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The law demands the debt of perfect obedience, if the sinner will
          have life; Matthew 19:17. In Christ this is answered; for "Christ is
          the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes;"
          Romans 10:4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) It demands the debt of punishment, for satisfaction of justice
          for sin done. The answer is, "I am crucified with Christ;" Galatians
          2:20. Thus he has found a complete righteousness, in which the law
          itself can find no blemish nor defect. Thus the current of death
          towards the believer is stopped, and the waters of the curse are dried
          up; and life flows into the soul, and the blessing comes in room of
          the curse.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. Lastly, To sum up all in a word, The sinner finding Christ, finds
          all things necessary to make him happy. See the believer's
          possessions, what he gets with Christ when he gets him; 1 Corinthians
          3:22, 23, "Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life,
          or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; and you
          are Christ's; and Christ is God's." Romans 8:32, "He who spared not
          his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with
          him also freely give us all things?" There is a treasure in him, or he
          is a treasure, and the treasure becomes the believer's; Matthew 13:44.
          There are unsearchable riches in him, and they are all made over to
          the believer; Ephesians 3:8. Look to the whole of Christ's purchase,
          what he bought for poor sinners with his blood, and the soul finding
          Christ finds it all, and may say, It is all mine.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I shall now make some practical improvement of this branch of the
          text.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">USE I. Of information. This informs us,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That the best way for one's security in an evil day, is to have
          found Christ. This is a day of impending wrath, wherein God is
          threatening to cause death overflow the nation. The true way to answer
          God's call in the dispensation of the day, is to seek Christ, that you
          may find him; so shall you find life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, God is threatening to take away men's substance, the means of
          life, making the heavens as brass, and the earth as iron. He has
          locked up in great measure the pastures of the field, so that the
          beasts groan under the sins of men. And no wonder, considering the
          sinful improvement that has been made of their prosperity. But if all
          should go together, it cannot break the true Christian, who finding
          Christ has found life, and may say as Habakkuk 3:17, 18, "Although the
          fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines, the
          labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat, the
          flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in
          the stalls; yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of
          my salvation."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, God is threatening to make death ride in triumph among men. He
          has been sweeping away multitudes abroad; and how can these nations
          think to escape, nations lying under the fearful guilt of former
          times, and who have been long busied in filling up their cup to the
          brim? All ranks in church and in state have corrupted their ways; and
          when we consider the unnatural marriages, and unnatural murders, that
          have fallen out more than at any time ever I remember, I cannot but
          take them for presages, that the things which concern this generation
          are making haste, the hearing of which will make men's ears to tingle.
          Well, Sirs, happy are they that find Christ; for they shall find life,
          when death in its most frightful aspect shall seize a God-provoking
          generation, and make all their courage fail in one moment, never to
          recover.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. There is no way to attain to holiness, and acceptable obedience in
          good works, without finding of Christ, or closing with him upon a
          saving discovery of him made to the soul. Find what we will, if we
          find not Christ, we will remain in a state of death; and all the
          reasons and motives that can be fetched from Heaven or Hell, will not
          quicken us; and therefore cannot put us upon the doing of the least
          good work; for, says Christ, "without me you can do nothing," John
          15:5. It is true, that, as, in an earthquake, dead bodies may fly from
          one place to another, by the force of commotion, yet still void of
          life; so an unbeliever, by the fear of punishment and hope of reward,
          may work, as one for his life; but alas! his works are but dead works
          still.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The true way to holiness is the finding of Jesus Christ; John 6:28,
          29, "Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the
          works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, this is the work of
          God, that you believe on him whom he has sent." If ever you would be
          holy, believe; if you would reach the highway called the way of
          holiness, betake yourselves to him who is the way, and the truth, and
          the life; John 14:6. As the dead man
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2 Kings 13:21,) let down into Elisha's grave, as soon as he touched
          the bones of Elisha, revived, and stood up on his feet; so the dead
          soul meeting with Christ by participation of his Spirit is quickened.
          And as a wick put to a burning lamb is lighted, so as immediately they
          join flames, and burn on; so the soul finding Christ finds life,
          embraces him, and lives by him and to him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Christ does not set his people to work for life, to procure life to
          themselves by their own working; he has given them life, a life that
          will never end, in their union with them, and bids them work from that
          life. The law or covenant of works says to them who are under it, Do
          this, and live; if you will have life, work and win it; Matthew 19:17.
          But Christ says to the poor tired creature, busy at labor in vain,
          Come to me that you may have life. And having come and received life,
          he sets it to work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Faith and obedience are inseparable; John 15:5, "He who abides in
          me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit." Romans 6:14, "Sin
          shall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the law, but
          under grace." The life that sinners find, finding Christ is without
          question, for the kind of it, a holy life; and the manner of one's
          working must needs be of a piece with the manner of one's being. When
          Nebuchadnezzar was driven from men to herd with the beasts of the
          field, he lived like the beasts. Men living in sin, walk in it;
          Colossians 3:7. And those who are blessed with a life that is holy in
          the nature of it, must needs be holy in their walk; and if that life
          were perfected, they would be perfectly holy. So where there is no
          holiness, there is no life, no faith, no union with the holy Jesus.
          Unholy professors are dead sinners, and will be buried out of sight in
          the pit; Hebrews 12:14, "Without holiness no man shall see the Lord."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, The one thing we have to seek above all things, for time
          and eternity, is to find Christ. For whoever finds him finds life, for
          time and eternity. And this is not the work only of the time of our
          first conversion to God, but the work of our whole lives, 1 Peter 2:4,
          compared with verses 2, 3. For always the more we find of Christ, we
          have the more life, and the less of him, the less life. Finding Christ
          we find all for holiness and happiness. The Jews say, that the 613
          precepts of the law are all reduced to this saying, Habakkuk 2:4, "The
          just shall live by his faith." And the truth is, the sum of the
          Christian life lies here; Galatians 2:20,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. II. Of exhortation. Seek Christ until you find him, and find life
          in him and by him. To press this, I offer the following motives.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 1. Man is a seeking creature: Matthew 13:45. Sinners out of
          Christ are as busy seeking as others are, like the watch going as fast
          when wrong as when right. There is a void within that would be filled;
          but the matter is, they go all wrong in their search, They are seeking
          a rest to their hearts in the creature, and a rest to their conscience
          in the works of the law; but in neither of these will they find what
          they seek. Turn you, sinners, seek Christ; why seek you the living
          among the dead? In Christ only is to be found what you are seeking,
          rest to the conscience and to the heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 2. Now is the time he is to be found; Isaiah 55:6. The day will
          come when he will not be to be found; and be the sinner has no more
          access to life. Remember the case of the foolish virgins; Matthew 25.
          That is a heavy word; Proverbs 1:24, 26, "Because I have called, and
          you refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;—I also
          will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear comes." And
          how stinging will it then be to think, that the time of seeking Christ
          was spent in seeking what cannot profit; and that then all access to
          him is lost forever.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE. You will be made up forever, if you find Christ; and undone,
          if you find him not; Proverbs 8:35, 36. If one was taken up all the
          days of his life, seeking him, and should find him at last, all would
          be found to be well bestowed; Matthew 13:45, 46. And find what we
          will, if we should find all the wealth, honors, and pleasures of the
          world, it would not compensate the loss of a missed Savior; Matthew
          16:26. But I will branch out this exhortation in two particulars,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, Sinners, seek to find Christ, and to find life in him, by
          getting a saving discovery of him made to your souls. To press seeking
          of this saving discovery, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOT. 1. There is no closing with Christ, or believing in him, without
          a saving discovery of him made to the soul; Psalm 9:10; John 4:10. Men
          may believe in an unseen, but not an unknown Christ. There is an
          illumination in the knowledge of Christ, that is necessary towards the
          embracing of him. Without it the wounded soul will pine away in its
          wounds, not knowing the Physician; and the sinner in his sins, not
          knowing the Savior.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. All your labor in religion, without this, will be but working in
          the dark, and labor in vain; John 14:6, compared with Ecclesiastes
          10:15. What will all attainments in religion avail, without the
          knowledge of the main thing, that is, the knowledge of Christ? Matthew
          7:22, we find some prophesying in Christ's name, in his name casting
          out devils, and in his name doing many wonderful works, who lose all
          their pains, because there was no saving acquaintance between Christ
          and them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The discovery of Christ is the most excellent discovery that men
          are capable of. Therefore Paul determined to seek after nothing but
          that; 1 Corinthians 2:2; he preferred it to all other things;
          Philippians 3:8. What though men be ever be well acquainted with the
          nature of the creation, and can dive into the secret mysteries of
          nature, with the reasons of the same? if they be unacquainted with
          Christ, it is but a bewitching vanity, and a gilded ignorance.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The knowledge of Christ appears to be the most noble, if one
          considers,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The superlative excellency of the object; Col 2:9, "In him dwells
          all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The way and manner one comes to this knowledge. Not by the light
          of nature; this cannot discover Christ to a soul; not by mere
          objective revelation in the word; men may indeed learn much of Christ
          that way, but may go to Hell for it all; but by the light of the
          Spirit and subjective revelation; Matthew 16:16, 17.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) The certainty of it, which surpasses all demonstration; Hebrews
          11:1.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) The usefulness of it. Other knowledge men may have, and perish
          with it; all the arts and sciences in the world cannot give life to
          the soul; but this is life, eternal life to them that have it; John
          17:3. Wherefore all other researches are but laborious trifling,
          unless in so far as they are subservient to this.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Christ discovered in his glory will satisfy your souls, and arrest
          your hearts; Matthew 13:45, 46, "Be shut my eyes and ears," says
          Luther, "and say, you know no God out of Christ, none but he who was
          in the lap of Mary, and sucked her breasts." What is the reason of the
          apostasy and backsliding of many, but that they were never brought
          into this inner court of religion? If they had, they had been held
          fast. They had seen in him what is fully commensurate to the desires
          of a soul, and therefore had no occasion to have gone back unto the
          world and their lusts. This would be an anchor of the soul, in the
          midst of temptations, troubles, persecutions, and losses, arising from
          whatever quarter they may; and is the absolutely best way to fix the
          heart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Christ is a veiled beauty, an unknown Christ to the most part of
          the hearers of the Gospel, and to all those to whom the Holy Spirit
          has not given saying illumination, Canticles 5:9, compare John. 1:10.
          Beware he continue not to be so unto you. Seek to get the veil
          removed, that you may see that in Christ, which the world left to
          perish in their iniquity never sees. The leading difference between
          the wise and the foolish builders, and the wise and the foolish
          virgins was, the one had illumination, the other had not.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly, Without a saving discovery of Christ, you perish, John
          17:3. Isaiah 53:11. Ignorance of, and unacquaintedness with Christ
          must needs be fatal to the soul, since he is the only way to the
          Father, and there is no salvation in any other. It is the great design
          of the Gospel to bring souls acquainted with Jesus Christ; so where
          that is not reached, the gospel has not its effect; and when the
          gospel has not a saving effect, the law will take effect to one's
          condemnation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I shall give you some directions for obtaining this discovery of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DIRECTION 1. Labor to be acquainted with yourselves, your own
          sinfulness and misery. And for that cause lay your hearts, lives, and
          state, to the rule of the holy law. Conviction leads the way to saving
          illumination, the knowledge of the disease to that of the physician,
          Acts 16:30, 31.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Seek the discovery of Christ in your attendance on public
          ordinances, Proverbs 8:34. These are the galleries where the king
          walks, the lattices by which he shows himself. See Psalm 45:8. There
          is the market where the eye-salve is to be bought of him. There
          Lydia's heart was opened. It is good to be in Christ's way, as
          Zacchaeus was. And were we looking and longing for a discovery of him
          there, we would not long want it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Seek the discovery of him in his written word, the scriptures, for
          they are they which testify of Christ, John 5:39. God's word is the
          great means of illumination; Psalm 19:8. The Psalmist found it to be
          so by experience, Psalm 119:130, "The entrance of your words gives
          light; it gives understanding unto the simple." It is the special
          instrument the Spirit uses for illumination.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Seek it earnestly in prayer, Proverbs 2:3–5. When the disciples
          were together at prayer, the doors being shut, he manifested himself
          unto them. We are not to expect bodily discoveries of Christ; if we
          had them, they would not do our turn; the Jews saw him so who believed
          not on him; but we are to seek a discovery of Christ in the glory of
          his person and offices, by the Spirit, which alone can be attended
          with saving effects.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly. Whenever the Lord lets in the least beam of heavenly light
          into your souls, cherish it, though it may be painful by discovering
          your sin and misery; make much of it; after little, more may come,
          Hosea 6:3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, Seek to find Christ and life in him, by getting an interest
          in him. The soul then finds Christ, and has life, when it has got an
          interest in him. If you inquire how that interest is got? It is
          through faith. God has given to us eternal life in the free offer of
          the gospel, and that life is in his Son, 1 John 5:11. Believe the word
          of the gospel with particular application to yourselves, receive and
          rest on him siducially for life, the life of grace and glory, and you
          have it. Wherefore come to Christ, that you may have life. To press
          this, consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 1. You are to come to Christ, that you may get life in and by
          him, Isaiah 55:1, 2, "He, every one that thirsts, come you to the
          waters, and he who has no money; come you, buy and eat, yes, come, buy
          wine and milk without money, and without price. Wherefore do you spend
          money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which
          satisfies not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat you that which is
          good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness." Revelation 3:20,
          "Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and
          open the door I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
          with me." Here is an invitation to life, let not that complaint be
          made of you, John 5:40, "You will not come to me, that you might have
          life." Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, It is an offer the fallen angels never got. When Christ was born
          there was good-will towards men, but no sign of it towards fallen
          angels. Yet they are in themselves a rank of beings superior to
          mankind, and he owed no more to us than to them. Only his sovereign
          pleasure made the difference. "How then shall we escape, if we neglect
          so great salvation?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, It is an invitation not given to millions in the world, who are
          the sons of Adam as well as we. Many kingdoms and empires in the world
          lie in darkness and the shadow of death, and no offer of life is made
          to them; but it is made to you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, It is the greatest offer that ever was or shall be, that Heaven
          can give and earth receive, admired by angels, and grudged by devils;
          and shall it be slighted by men? even an offer of the son of God, and
          eternal life in him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, It is an offer frequently repeated. Now sinner, Christ is
          boding himself and eternal life upon you. You have given him many
          refusals, but he will not yet take your refusal, but continues the
          offer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 2. Christ is very willing to give himself, and eternal life in
          himself to you, John 6:37. Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, How ample and large the gospel offer is, excluding none that will
          come, Isaiah 55:1, forfeited. Revelation 22:17, "Whoever will, let him
          take the water of life freely."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, There is no case a sinner can be in, that shall mar his
          reception with Christ, and partaking of life, if he will come to
          Christ; Isaiah 1:18, "Come now, and let us reason together, says the
          Lord; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
          though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." Manasseh's
          bloodshed and witchcraft, Paul's blasphemy and persecution, and Mary
          Magdalene's lewdness, hindered not their getting life in and by
          Christ. When he was in the world, he raised Lazarus when sinking in
          the grave, as well as the ruler's daughter newly dead.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, He takes kindly notice of the sinner's first steps towards him;
          the father met the prodigal son while yet a great way off. See
          Jeremiah 31:18–20. He surprises souls with looks of kindness
          preventing them, Isaiah 65:1, as he did Paul, Zacchaeus, and others.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, He is atgreat pains with sinners to bring them to himself for
          life. He stands and knocks; by convictions, surprising mercies rods,
          and crosses, he says in effect, "Why will you die?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 3. You are commanded to come to him, that you may have life; 1
          John 3:23, "This is his commandment, that we should believe on the
          name of his Son Jesus Christ." All the gospel invitations are
          commands; so that it is not left to you whether to come or not; but
          you are peremptorily enjoined. Consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, You are creatures owing obedience to the commands of your
          sovereign Lord; and therefore trample not on his gospel command.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, How highly merciful and reasonable this command is. All God's
          commandments are most righteous, Psalm 119:128. But behold this is an
          eminently merciful and reasonable one, that the creature should seek
          the favor of its Creator; that man should be at peace with God; that
          the poor sinner should go to the rich Savior, the sick to the
          Physician, the guilty flee to the city of refuge and live, and the
          dying soul have recourse to the fountain of life. And all this under
          the pain of God's displeasure.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3dly, What a mercy it is that there is not a countermand; that when
          Adam and his offspring fell, God did not forbid them ever to hope for
          the least grain of mercy; but graciously invites and entreats, yes,
          and commands them to come and partake of his favor?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4thly, It is such a command, that if it be not obeyed, God has no
          value for all other obedience, 1 John 3:23, John 6:29.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOT. 4. You need Christ, and you need life; you have an absolute need
          of both. Do you not need grace, the favor of God, pardon of sin, the
          light of his countenance, the influences of his Spirit, the
          manifestations of his love? Without these you can never be happy, but
          eternally miserable. O then seek to find Christ, and life in him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. Ult. Hereby you may try whether you have found Christ or not. The
          soul yet dead in sin has not found him; but where there is spiritual
          life, Christ is found by that soul. How shall one know whether he be
          spiritually dead or alive? I will offer but three marks.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MARK 1. Spiritual light, not only let into the conscience, but into
          the heart, 2 Corinthians 4:6, John 8:12. And that may be known by
          these two things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) The discovery it makes. The light of life shows a man his former
          darkness, making him say, "Once was I blind, but now I see." It
          discovers sin in its sinfulness, not only as dangerous, but as
          loathsome and abominable; the sinfulness of heart-sins as well as of
          life-sins; the first movings of sin, as well as of sin ripened by
          consent or action; the man's own utter inability to help himself, and
          the need of Christ both for justification, and sanctification;
          Christ's preciousness, and perfect suitableness to the sinner's case.
          This is the discovery made by the light of life, or saving
          illumination, Luke 15:17, 1 Peter 2:17.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) The efficacy it has on the soul, Matthew 3:11. There are many who
          have a great deal of light; but it has no more efficacy on them to
          bring them from sin to holiness, than painted fire has to burn. But
          the light of life humbles the soul before God; causes grief for sin
          and hatred of of it, as contrary to God's holy nature and will; a holy
          despairing of help by ourselves or any other creature; and a betaking
          one's self to Christ for all, for pardon, and favor with God, for
          holiness and happiness, Philippians 3:3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MARK 2. Where there is spiritual life there is spiritual sense and
          feeling. In spiritual death all the senses of the soul, so to speak,
          are locked up; and they may be at some times very dull in those who
          are spiritually alive. But it is evident, that in the quickening of
          the soul they are restored, and never lost again altogether. The eyes
          of the soul are opened to see God, Christ, sin, the world, and all
          things that concern the soul, in other colors than formerly. They hear
          his voice in his word and in his rod, and they discern it from all
          others, Canticles 5:2, so that their great business is to answer his
          call. They have tasted that the Lord is gracious; they have the
          witness in themselves, that there is something in religion more
          desirable than all the profits and pleasures of the world, John 5:10.
          They can say from their experience, that all his garments smell of
          myrrh, aloes, and cassia, Psalm 45:8, that everything about Christ is
          lovely and desirable. The fullness of grace lodged in him, is savory
          to them, Canticles 1:3. Their sense of feeling is awakened; the burden
          of sin they sometime went lightly under, makes them gross now, and
          long to be rid of it, as ever a poor prisoner was of his chains;
          Romans 7:24, "O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the
          body of this death?" Every limb of that body is a weight to them. And
          they are sensible of Christ's goings and comings, his hidings and
          manifestations of himself, and the power of his grace; Psalm 30:7,
          "Lord, by your favor you have made my mountain to stand strong; you
          did hide your face, and I was troubled."

          MARK 3. Where there is spiritual life, there is a kindly heat and
          warmth of the same kind. There is a threefold flame kindled in the
          believer in the day of his being restored to life, though it acts not
          alike vigorously in all, nor in the same person alike at all times.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) There is a flame of holy desires; Isaiah 26:9. They have longing
          desires after righteousness, both imputed and implanted; Matthew 5:6,
          they are set for the one as well as the other. They have ardent
          desires after communion with God in Christ; Psalm 42:1. Hence the
          secret cries of the soul, O that I knew where I might find him! O when
          will you come unto me!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) There is a flame of love to Christ; Romans 5:5. They love him
          above all persons and things; Luke 14:26. They love his truths, his
          whole word; his commands, though striking against their corruptions;
          Romans 7:22, his promises, as the sweetest cordials to a soul fainting
          under the apprehensions of wrath, or prevailing of corruption; the
          threatening of his word approving them heartily as most just; Romans
          7:12. Their hearts warm to any in whom God's image appears, and that
          because of that image; 1 John 3:14. They love his ordinances; Psalm
          84:1, because they are his institutions, and the appointed means of
          communion with him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) There is a flame of zeal for Christ; Psalm 69:9. They are
          concerned for his honor in the world, the thriving of his kingdom. It
          vents itself in indignation against sin in themselves and others,
          because of the dishonor it reflects on Christ; 2 Corinthians 7:11, in
          endeavoring to be active for God in their station, and grieving for
          the ills which they cannot help, saying with David, "Rivers of waters
          run down mine eyes, because they keep not your law," Psalm 119:136.
