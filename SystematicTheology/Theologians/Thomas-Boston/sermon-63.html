<p align="justify"><br/>
    John 13:8 "If I wash you not, you have no part with me."</p>
<p align="justify">THESE words are Christ's answer to Peter refusing to let 
    Christ wash his feet. No doubt it was a kind of modesty, reverence, and 
    humility, that put Peter on this peremptory refusal of Christ's astonishing 
    kind offer. But all is not gold that glitters. There is much of this bastard 
    humility in the world, whereby people refuse Christ's offers, and put them 
    away from them, with a very good grace, and great respect to the Lord 
    Christ, as they think. Christ comes to sinners in the gospel, and offers to 
    wash them from their pollution: But will they offer a foul defiled soul to 
    God Almighty, the infinitely holy Savior, to be washed by him? No; they 
    think they know more of their own sinfulness and unworthiness, and of 
    Christ's greatness and holiness, than that comes to. And so they affront 
    him, under a pretense of honoring him.</p>
<p align="justify">There are three characters of this false humility.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It condemns the generation of the righteous, who came 
    all to Christ, at his command, to be washed by him, receiving it with 
    admiration of his condescension. The other disciples, no doubt, were struck 
    with amazement at Christ's coming to wash their feet: but true humility took 
    Christ's will for law and right, and makes them silently yield themselves to 
    the Lord. But Peter's behavior condemns them, as rude and disrespectful, 
    verses 5, 6, "After that, he pours water into a basin, and began to wash the 
    disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded. 
    Then comes he to Simon Peter: and Peter says unto him, Lord, do you wash my 
    feet?</p>
<p align="justify">2. It keeps Christ at a distance, and so proceeds not 
    from faith, but unbelief, verse 6. No doubt, when Christ stretched out his 
    hand to wash Peter's feet, he drew them in quickly to him; and showed by his 
    deeds, as well as his words, that he had no mind that Christ's fair hand 
    should come on them. So folk, under a sense of sinfulness, may flee from 
    Christ, while he follows them.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It argues a heart not duly humbled; and so it is but 
    accursed pride under the veil of a show of humility.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Carnal wisdom and reason has the ascendant, and will 
    not bow to divine revelation: verses 7, 8, "Jesus answered and said unto 
    him, What I do you I know not now; but you shall know hereafter. Peter says 
    unto him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, "If I wash you 
    not, you have no part with me." Let the gospel of God's grace be delivered 
    never so plain, they will not give over measuring divine mysteries by their 
    carnal reason.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Insensibleness and self-conceit prevails. Peter 
    doubtless thought either that his feet needed no washing, but that they 
    might be borne with even in Christ's presence, as they were; or, if they 
    did, he would wash them himself. So he is peremptory in his refusal. And 
    this lies at bottom in that false humility: either they think they are not 
    so very polluted, but that they may be borne with; or else, that they will 
    wash themselves clean before they come to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">In the text our Lord gives Peter a word that brings him 
    down in a moment from all his heights, and makes him not only content, but 
    earnest to be washed all over by Christ, without pretending to wipe off one 
    spot off himself by himself: "If I wash you not, you have no part with me. 
    Verse 9, Simon Peter says unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my 
    hands and my head." This word strikes Peter to the heart, "If I wash you 
    not, you have no part with me." Peter, no washing by me, no part with me to 
    salvation. Washing by me, and part with me, you nor no man shall ever be 
    able to separate in your cases. Have the one, have the other; want the one, 
    and upon heaven's truth you want the other."</p>
<p align="justify">I think it is an insipid question here, why so severe a 
    threatening for refusing so small a thing? For Christ says not, if I wash 
    not your feet, you shall have no part with me; but simply, "If I wash you 
    not, you have no part with me," in the present time. Neither could it be 
    drawn to the washing of the feet, if the questionists did not first suppose 
    a change of the tense the Holy Spirit uses, which is not at least without 
    necessity to be admitted. (Gr.) If I washed you not, or, if I have not 
    washed you, you have no part with me. Peter, if you belong to me, I have 
    done more for you, than to wash your feet with water; I have washed you with 
    my blood: if you have taken that vastly costlier washing off my hand, why 
    refuse you this? If I have not so washed you, you have no part with me; for 
    none have part with me, but those whom I so wash."</p>
<p align="justify">The words then bear an inseparable connection between two 
    things in the case of sinners, standing and falling together.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The washing of them by Christ. Revelation 1:5.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Their having part with him, partaking of his saving 
    benefits, being joint heirs of Heaven with him. Compare Deuteronomy 14:27, 
    "And the Levite that is within your gates, you shall not forsake him: for he 
    has no part nor inheritance with you." The Scripture knows no part sinners 
    can have of salvation or of Heaven, but with Christ: Acts 4:12, "Neither is 
    their salvation in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven 
    given among men whereby we must be saved." They that miss their part with 
    Christ, there is but another side where their part will fall: Revelation 
    21:8, "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, 
    and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have 
    their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the 
    second death." Now, if a sinner either be not washed at all, or be washed 
    only with the nitre and soap of his own faithless endeavors and reformation; 
    if he be not washed by Christ; he has no part with him, he is none of his; 
    he is in a state of death and destruction lying ready to be cast out as an 
    abominable thing, into the unclean place, the stinking lake.</p>
<p align="justify">The relation between these two, is, the former is a 
    necessary consequent of the latter; and therefore is held forth as a 
    necessary evidence of it. All that have saving part with Christ are washed 
    by him: therefore, if Christ has not washed you, you have no saving part 
    with him.</p>
<p align="justify">The doctrine deducible from the words is as follows.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE A sinner's having any saving part with Christ, 
    and his being washed by Christ, from his sin, are simply and absolutely 
    inseparable.</p>
<p align="justify">In discoursing from this doctrine shortly at the time, I 
    shall,</p>
<p align="justify">I. Consider a sinner's having part with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">II. His being washed by Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">III. The inseparableness of the two.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Improve the doctrine.</p>
<p align="justify">I. The first thing to be spoken to, is, A sinner's having 
    part with Christ. And this we take in two things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. His being of Christ's mystical body, through union 
    with him: 1 Corinthians 12:12, 13, "For as the body is one, and has many 
    members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so 
    also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether 
    we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made 
    to drink into one Spirit." There are but two general corporations of mankind 
    on earth, Heaven, and Hell: the corporation of the first and fallen Adam, 
    who has diffused all manner of pollution and defilement over those that are 
    his, not to be washed off by human are; and of this society we are all by 
    nature members: the corporation of the Second Adam, Christ, who cleanses and 
    purifies all that are his, from that pollution and defilement; for the 
    latter is raised out of the former. See the two, 1 John 5:19, "And we know 
    that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness." 2 Corinthians 
    6:17, Wherefore come out from among them, and be you separate, says the 
    Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you." Now, if you 
    are not washed by Christ, you belong not to the Second Adam's corporation; 
    you belong not to Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The sinner's having communion with Christ in his 
    saving benefits, partaking of them in fellowship with him: 1 John 1:3, "That 
    which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that you also may have 
    fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with 
    his son Jesus Christ." All salvation is in Christ; so that they who have 
    part with him, are complete in him, Colossians 2:9, 10. And salvation is in 
    him exclusively to all other, Acts 4:12. Now, if you are not washed by 
    Christ, you have no communion with him in his saving benefits, no part in 
    his salvation, and so none in salvation at all. Christ has a righteousness 
    fully answering the law's demands; it is so broad a white clothing, that it 
    covers all his people, partaking with him in it, Romans 3:22. But if he wash 
    you not, you have no part in it. He has taken out a new right to God, as his 
    God, and all his people partake with him in it: Romans 8:17, "And if 
    children then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ." John 20:17, 
    "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God." But 
    if Christ wash you not you have no part, he is not your God.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The next thing to be spoken to, is, The sinner's 
    being washed by Christ. This is inseparable from his having part with 
    Christ, and is the privilege of all, and only those who have part with him. 
    Concerning this washing I offer these particulars.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is a filthiness in sin, whereby the soul is 
    polluted and defiled before the Lord. This is supposed in the washing from 
    it: Ezekiel 36:25, "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall 
    be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse 
    you." Sin does not only make the sinner guilty, but filthy and abominable. 
    It is the abominable thing that God hates, Jeremiah 44:4. filth itself, 
    Isaiah 4:4. This filthiness of sin lies in its contrariety to the holiness 
    of God expressed in his law. Holiness is the glory of God, and the beauty of 
    the soul, Exodus 15:11; sin the deformity and filthiness of it. Hence,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, It makes the sinner loathsome before God, that he 
    cannot look on him, but with abhorrence; and with such abhorrence as one 
    looks upon a thing he has a natural antipathy at, Zechariah 11:8, "My soul 
    loathed them." Habakkuk 1:13, "You are of purer eyes than to behold evil, 
    and can not look on iniquity." Psalm 5:4, "For you are not a God that has 
    pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with you."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, It fills the soul with shame before God. I mean not 
    that holy shame that proceeds from a joint view of sin's loathsomeness, and 
    God's pardoning grace in Christ; that is a fruit of the Spirit, Ezekiel 
    16:60, 61, "I will establish unto you an everlasting covenant. Then you 
    shall remember your ways, and be ashamed." But I mean a natural shame, 
    whereby the sinner, obliged to fix his eyes on God's holiness, and seeing 
    his own unlikeness to him, his countenance falls, he is damped, and filled 
    with dread and horror, and therefore labors to make away out of his 
    presence; as Adam did, Genesis 3:10, "I heard your voice," said he to the 
    Lord, "in the garden: and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hidden 
    myself." Now, unwashed sinners are filthy all over.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Their nature is filthy, Psalm 14:3, "They are all 
    gone aside, they are altogether become filthy: there is none that does good, 
    no not one." Sin has spread its defilement over all the faculties of their 
    souls, and over all the members of their bodies: Titus 1:15, "Unto them that 
    are defiled, and unbelieving, is nothing pure; but even their mind and 
    conscience is defiled." Their very bodies, however perfumed and adorned, are 
    filthy before God with spiritual filth cleaving to them, Hebrews 10:22.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Their life and conversation is filthy, 2 Peter 2:7. 
    Their daily walk is a heaping new filth upon their already filthy souls. 
    Their habitual filthiness produces still actual filthiness, as the poisoned 
    spring sends forth poisonous streams, Psalm 14:1.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ has them all to wash who get part in him. Hence 
    the redeemed church sings praises to him that loved them, and washed them 
    from their sins in his own blood, Revelation 1:5. They come to him in their 
    pollution, and are washed by him; they come to him defiled all over, in the 
    defilement of their nature, and of their life, that they may be washed; and 
    coming to him by faith, it is done, Ezekiel 16:8, 9; Romans 4:5; 2 
    Corinthians 5:17. How can it be otherwise? for they cannot wash themselves 
    before they come. Is it possible for people to wash, before they come to the 
    waters? or to bathe before they come into the laver?</p>
<p align="justify">3. All those who take part with him by faith, he washes 
    with his blood from their sin, Hebrews 12:24; Revelation 1:5. He offered 
    himself a sacrifice to God for sin, and the blood of the slain sacrifice is 
    sprinkled on the sinners in him, for their cleansing: 1 John 1:7, "The blood 
    of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin." The stain of sin was so 
    deep, that nothing else could wash it out: and had he not provided the laver 
    of his own blood, Abraham, Paul, and all the saints now in glory, since they 
    were once filthy, would have been filthy still, with Cain, Judas, and other 
    filthy vessels of wrath.</p>
<p align="justify">There are two things in his blood, that make it to wash 
    out this stain, as deep as it is.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, An infinite value and dignity; for it is the blood 
    of an infinite person, the blood of God, Acts 20:28, the Son of God, 1 John 
    1:7, the Father's equal, the Most High.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, An infinite efficacy, power, and energy; for the 
    Spirit is in it, the infinite Spirit of holiness, John 6:53. with 63. The 
    blood was given for atonement, because the life of the flesh, or the animal 
    spirits, are in the blood, Leviticus 17:11. And therefore it was to be 
    sprinkled while it was yet warm with the spirits in it. Now, Christ's blood 
    is always warm and fresh, with the spirits of life and holiness in it, 
    Hebrews 10:20; Revelation 3:1.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is a twofold washing by the blood of Christ; one 
    that makes clean in the eye of the law, leaving not the least mark of a spot 
    on the soul; peculiar to the saints in Heaven, Hebrews 12:23. Another, 
    making clean in the eye of the gospel, though not absolutely: John 15:3, 
    "Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you." Canticles 
    4:7, "You are all fair, my love, there is no spot in you." It is this last 
    our text means only. Only observe, that they are not different kinds, but 
    different degrees of the same washing by Christ's blood. It is the same 
    laver of Christ's blood, that we are washed in before death to fit us for 
    communion with God here, and that same laver that we are washed in at death, 
    to fit us for communion with God in Heaven. Only that efficacy of Christ's 
    blood now exerted on us in part, is put forth on us in full measure to the 
    utter abolition of sin, Ephesians 5:25, 26, 27; Revelation 7:14, 15.</p>
<p align="justify">5. As washing is properly the purging away of filthiness, 
    spots, and stains from the object washed; so the washing from sin is 
    formally and directly the sanctification of the sinner, Ephesians 5:26; 
    Titus 3:5. So if Christ sanctify us not, we have no part in him. Howbeit, it 
    supposes or implies more than that wherein it formally consists.</p>
<p align="justify">In all washing there are two things to be distinguished: 
    the loosing of the filth sticking to the object; for if it do not stick, it 
    cannot defile: and the removing of it being once loosed, which is the 
    washing properly. Accordingly in washing a soul from sin, there are two 
    things.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The loosing of the filth of sin sticking to the 
    soul. Sin sticks to our souls, as pitch or tar to a man's fingers: and there 
    is no removing of it, until once it be loosed by an application of Christ's 
    blood. Now, it is by guilt that it sticks to our soul, 1 Corinthians 15:56. 
    And that is done away in our justification; which must needs go before our 
    sanctification, as the loosing of sticking filth, before the washing it 
    away; as the Holy Spirit teaches, Romans 7:6, "But now we are delivered from 
    the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in 
    newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter." Hence the apostle 
    says of the Corinthians, 1 Corinthians 6:11, "And such were some of you: but 
    you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of 
    the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The removing and purging away the filth of sin, 
    being once loosed: and the same blood that looses it, purges it away in 
    sanctification, as the same water that loosens the filth, carries it away 
    off the cloth; and so the pardoned sinner is made holy: Hebrews 9:14, "How 
    much more shall the blood of Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit, 
    offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works 
    to serve the living God?" Revelation 7:14, "These are they which came out of 
    great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the 
    blood of the Lamb." And this purging away of the filth of sin off the 
    sinner, lies in three things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The putting away of his former loathsomeness before 
    God. The blood of Christ having come over the soul, it is now washed, and 
    God can look on it with delight, Revelation 1:5, 6. He calls her beloved, 
    that was not beloved.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Making of the soul fair and clean before the Lord: 
    Canticles 4:7, "You are all fair, my love, there is no spot in you." The 
    Spirit in the blood leaves his own image on the soul, and carries it all 
    over the man, 2 Corinthians 3:18; Titus 1:14. Life, eternal life, is in that 
    blood, and wherever it comes; and it goes over the whole man, seeds of life 
    are left in the soul that shall never die out. The Spirit in the blood takes 
    of the fullness of grace in Christ, and communicates to them grace for 
    grace, John 1:16, so transforming them into his image.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Removing the legal shame out of the soul before God, 
    and causing it, with child-like kindly blushes, to come before him, and 
    press near him, crying, Abba, Father, with the boldness of faith in greater 
    or lesser measure: Romans 8:15, "For you have not received the spirit of 
    bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby 
    we cry, Abba, Father." Ezra 9:6, "O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift 
    up my face to you, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, 
    and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens."</p>
<p align="justify">6. Faith is the instrumental cause of this washing. Hence 
    the apostle, Acts 15:9, speaks of "purifying the heart by faith." It lays 
    hold upon, and applies the blood of Christ: Romans 3:25, "Whom God has set 
    forth to be a atoning sacrifice , through faith in his blood, to declare his 
    righteousness for the remission of sins."</p>
<p align="justify">7. Lastly, Afflictions are the occasional causes of this 
    washing: Isaiah 27:9, "By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be 
    purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his sin."</p>
<p align="justify">III. The next thing to be considered, is the 
    inseparableness of the two. They are so,</p>
<p align="justify">1. In respect of their subject, which is necessarily one. 
    He who has the one, has the other; and no man can have either of them 
    singly. If you have part in Christ, you are washed by him; if you are washed 
    by him, you have part with him.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In respect of time. That moment one gets part with 
    Christ, he washes him from his sins. In order of nature indeed, part with 
    Christ goes before washing, and justification before sanctification. But in 
    respect of time they come together and at once. That they are so 
    inseparable, appears,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, From the end and design of Christ's death, which 
    cannot be frustrated. He died for that end, that sinners taking part with 
    him by faith, might be washed by him from their sins, Ephesians 5:25, etc; 
    Titus 2:14.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, From the nature of the thing. There is a lively 
    efficacy in Christ's blood to wash away sin: so that the soul come to 
    Christ, and having part in him, must needs be washed; or that precious blood 
    must be counted as dead water, that has lost its virtue, Hebrews 10:20. Can 
    a foul garment be laid in a pure running stream, and the washing of it not 
    be begun the moment that it is laid in? And can an unholy soul be united by 
    faith to Christ, and the washing of it not begun that moment by virtue from 
    his blood?</p>
<p align="justify">USE I. Of trial. You may hereby know whether you have any 
    part with Christ or not, and consequently whether you have a right to the 
    Lord's table or not? Are you washed by Christ from your sin, or not? If you 
    are unsanctified, unholy souls, yet living in the filth of your sins, I 
    declare you have no part with Christ; since where there is no true holiness, 
    there is no true faith.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. How may I know that I am washed by Christ?</p>
<p align="justify">MARK 1. If you are washed by Christ, though you are not 
    washed perfectly, you are washed universally: washed in every part, though 
    not perfectly clean in any part: 2. Corinthians 5:17. "If any man be in 
    Christ he is a new creature: old things are past away, behold all things are 
    become new." You are washed from the gross pollutions of the outward man, 
    from the reigning pollutions of the inner man: Psalm 24:3. 4, "Who shall 
    ascend into the hill of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place? He 
    who has clean hands, and a pure heart; who has not lift up his soul unto 
    vanity, nor sworn deceitfully." There is a new set in you for purity, 
    darting to all the points of the Christian compass, though you fall short of 
    degrees in every point. That compass you find, 1 John 3:3. "And every man 
    that has this hope in him, purifies himself, even as he is pure."</p>
<p align="justify">2. You lay the stress of your acceptance with God, not 
    upon your inherent cleanness, the effect of your washing; but on the blood 
    of Christ, the cause of it: Philippians 3:3. "For we are the circumcision, 
    which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no 
    confidence in the flesh." Close hypocrites never fail to split on this rock. 
    That, Matthew 5:3. "Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the 
    kingdom of Heaven," is set first, for it must be carried through all;" and 
    verse 8. "Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Your hearts are loosed from sin, though it cleaves to 
    you. It lies not like mud in a pool, where there is nothing to wear it out; 
    but like mud in a spring, where the spring-water tends to work it out. So 
    you will be groaning under the remains of your impurity, saying, with the 
    Apostle, Romans 7:24. "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from 
    the body of this death?" You will be content to see every spot, Psalm 
    139:23, 24, that it may be washed off; and really desirous to be made 
    perfectly clean; as was the Apostle, Philip. 3:13, 14, "I count not myself 
    to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which 
    are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press 
    toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of instruction and direction to unwashed souls yet 
    lying in their blood. Sinners, will you be made clean?</p>
<p align="justify">For MOTIVE: To be left lying in the filth of sin, is 
    formally one half of the punishment of the damned, and virtually the whole 
    of it. See the form of Christ's giving up with a sinner, and dropping him 
    forever, Revelation 22:11. "He who is unjust, let him be unjust still: and 
    he which is filthy, let him be filthy still." There is the punishment of 
    loss. And in that filth will be bred and fed the worm that never dies; out 
    of it will arise the fire that is never quenched. And that is the punishment 
    of sense.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, the DIRECTION is, If you would be washed by Christ, 
    get part with Christ. Say not, Will ever I get part with Christ being so 
    unclean, not purified and meet for him? But no impurity of yours can hinder 
    your getting part with Christ, if you will but take it. See the case of the 
    Corinthians, 1. Corinthians 6:11. "And such were some of you: but you are 
    washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the 
    Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God." And you shall rot and pine away 
    in your filth, wash otherwise as well as you will, if you will not take it: 
    Psalm 81:11, 12, "But my people would not hearken to my voice: and Israel 
    would none of me. So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they 
    walked in their own counsels."</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. What access have I to get part with Christ? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Christ and his salvation are a common good 1. 
    John 4:14. "We have seen, and do testify, that the Father sent the Son to be 
    the Savior of the world." Jude verse 3. this salvation is called "the common 
    salvation." I proclaim to every one to come and take their part with Christ, 
    assuring them of welcome: Revelation 22:17. "And the Spirit and the bride 
    say, Come. And let him that hears, say, Come. And let him that is athirst, 
    come: And whoever will, let him take the water of life freely."</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. How may I be possessed of part with Christ? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. By faith, crediting the promise of the gospel, 
    and accordingly trusting on Christ as your Savior, for his whole salvation; 
    for salvation from sin as well as from wrath; for that holiness and purity 
    of heart and life, which are absolutely necessary to make you meet for the 
    inheritance of the saints in light, as well as for that righteousness by 
    which you can only be accepted in the sight of God, and by which alone you 
    can have a sure and indefeasible title to Heaven and glory.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Let the saints consider, that the more part they 
    have with Christ, the more they will be washed; and that faith is the only 
    way to have part with Christ in all his saying benefits, and that it is a 
    mean, of God's appointment, for washing and purification. Hence be 
    exercising faith daily upon Christ, and particularly in the view of going to 
    a communion table, in order to your being washed and sanctified; 
    remembering, that unless Christ wash you, you can have no part with him.</p>

<p align="justify">I ENTERED on these words last Lord's day, on occasion of 
    the sacramental solemnity which was then celebrated among us; observed a 
    doctrine, proposed a method, which was briefly prosecuted, and I made some 
    practical improvement of the subject. But as this text opens a large field 
    of discourse, and contains ample matter for directing faith and practice, I 
    shall now endeavor to prosecute the design of the words more fully, in a 
    series of discourses. For this end I observe the following doctrine, namely,</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. Such an inseparable connection there is between 
    a sinner's having part with Christ, and being washed from his sins by Christ 
    in a work of sanctification, that if a sinner is not washed from his sins by 
    Christ, he has no part with Christ, while he is so.</p>
<p align="justify">Briefly, If a sinner is not washed from his sins by 
    Christ, he has no part with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">In handling this important subject, I shall consider,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What it is to be washed from our sins by Christ, 
    namely, unto a cleanness in the eye of the gospel.</p>
<p align="justify">II. The unwashed or unsanctified sinner's having no part 
    with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">III. Conclude with some practical inferences.</p>
<p align="justify">I. I shall consider what it is to be washed from our sins 
    by Christ, namely, unto a cleanness in the eye of the gospel. And upon this 
    head, I shall show,</p>
<p align="justify">1. What this washing supposes.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Wherein it consists.</p>
<p align="justify">3. How it is done and brought about.</p>
<p align="justify">First, I shall show what our being washed from our sins 
    by Christ supposes.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It supposes in the sinner, a conviction of the 
    filthiness of sin, and his loathsomeness by it. Hence the church says, 
    Isaiah 64:6, "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our 
    righteousnesses are as filthy rags, and we all do fade as a leaf, and our 
    iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away." They that never saw the 
    vileness and abominable nature of sin, are not washed from it; Proverbs 
    30:12, "There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is 
    not washed from their filthiness." The man cries not only, with the 
    criminal, Guilty, guilty; but, with the leper, Unclean, unclean. Sin is not 
    only frightful, but hateful and loathsome to him, as the vilest filth. Now, 
    if you have not been convinced of the filthiness of sin, you have no part 
    with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, This conviction is got by looking into the glass of 
    the law, representing the spotless holiness of God: Romans 7:12, 13, 14, 
    "The law is holy; and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then 
    that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin that it might 
    appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the 
    commandment might become exceeding sinful. For we know that the law is 
    spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin." The glaring beauty of God's 
    holiness expressed in the law, striking the sinner, he sees himself filthy 
    and loathsome before the holy God, as most unlike him.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, It fixes an impression of shame on the sinner. He 
    is ashamed of himself, of what he is, what he has done, and what he has 
    neglected to do; as the publican did, Luke 18:13. who "standing afar off, 
    would not lift up so much as his eyes unto Heaven, but smote upon his 
    breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner." He is like a child, that 
    having got a clean white frock on him, has fallen into the mire, and stands 
    ashamed before his mother in that pickle.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It supposes a willingness to be made clean: Psalm 
    19:12, "Who can understand his errors? cleanse you me from secret faults." 
    It is not easy to bring a sinner that length: Jeremiah 13:27, "Woe unto you, 
    O Jerusalem, will you not be made clean? when shall it once be?" Sin is so 
    woven into our nature, and so strengthened by custom in sin, which is a 
    second nature, that it is harder to make a sinner willing to be made clean, 
    than to bring a swine away from the mire and dirt it loves to nestle and 
    wallow in. But in the day of the washing of a sinner, he is made as willing 
    to be washed as ever child ashamed of his nastying himself is. So if you 
    have not been made willing to be clean, you have no part with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It supposes a conviction that we cannot wash ourselves 
    clean, by anything we can do or suffer: Romans 7:24, "O wretched man that I 
    am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" What mars the washing 
    by Christ with many, is, that they think they can wash themselves clean 
    enough by themselves. They see not how fast the filth of sin sticks to them, 
    and so they think their praying, confessing, reforming, and tears, will do 
    it. But hear what Job says, chapter 9:30, 31, "If I wash myself with 
    snow-water, and make my hand never so clean; yet shall you plunge me in the 
    ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me." This every soul that is 
    sanctified is brought to. Therefore if you have not been convinced, that you 
    cannot wash yourselves clean, by anything you can do, you have no part with 
    Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It supposes a hearty consent of the soul to be washed 
    by Christ. Christ washes none against their will: Jeremiah 13:27, "Woe unto 
    you, O Jerusalem, will you not be made clean? when shall it once be?" They 
    that will needs lie still in their filthiness, shall lie and rot in it 
    forever for him: Revelation 22:11, "He who is unjust, let him be unjust 
    still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still." Hosea 4:17, 
    "Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone." Christ makes all his elect 
    willing to be holy, but he forces holiness on none. Therefore if you have 
    not given a hearty consent of your soul to be washed, you have no part with 
    Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, It supposes a presenting of our defiled souls 
    to Christ to be washed by him. This is the work of faith, by which the soul 
    comes to the waters: Isaiah 55:1, "Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to 
    the waters, and he who has no money; come you, buy and eat, yes, come, buy 
    wine and milk without money, and without price." The soul comes to Christ, 
    as the leper to the priest to be cleansed: Psalm 51:7, "Purge me with 
    hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." 
    Compared with Leviticus 14:6, "As for the living bird, he shall take it, and 
    the cedar-wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them, and the 
    living bird, in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running 
    water." It eyes him as a Savior from the filth, as well as the guilt of sin; 
    as a sanctifier of the unclean, as well as a justifier of the ungodly. 
    Therefore, if you have not presented your defiled souls to Christ, to be 
    washed by him, you have no part with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, I shall show wherein our being washed from our 
    sins by Christ consists. As washing in the general consists in removing 
    filthiness, and making clean; so does the washing of a soul by Christ, lie 
    in removing the filth of sin from off the sinner, and making him clean in 
    likeness to God. Now,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Christ washes sinners in the inner man: Psalm 45:13, 
    "The King's daughter is all glorious within." Pharisaical washings reach the 
    outer man only: but Christ's washing goes to the hidden man of the heart. 
    Adam left us in the mire of sin, with a nature corrupt and filthy, the very 
    reverse of the nature of God; all the faculties of our souls defiled, Titus 
    1:15. But Christ washes our nature and faculties. And this lies in two 
    things.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Removing and washing off that filth of sin, that 
    either cleave to them from our birth, or has been added to them since: Titus 
    3:5. "Not by works of righteousness, which we have done, but according to 
    his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the 
    Holy Spirit." We came into the world with such corruption cleaving to our 
    nature and faculties, as not only disabled us for all good, but made us 
    prone to all evil, and averse to all good. This is strengthened and 
    increased during the time one lives unregenerate. And the corruption of 
    nature spreads itself, and takes many roots in the soul, in diverse 
    particular lusts, Romans 6:12. Now, Christ washing this filth off the soul,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Purges our whole nature and faculties, from that 
    corruption, so far that it does not reign there: Romans 6:14, "For sin shall 
    not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace." 
    The total blindness as to the receiving of the things of God, is purged out 
    of the mind; that reiguing aversion to good, out of the will; and the 
    reigning carnality, out of the affections. The natural corrupt bent of the 
    heart is taken away, removed, and broken; the stony heart is taken away, and 
    a heart of flesh is given, Ezekiel 36:26.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) He purges the soul from its old lusts, loosing them 
    at the root: Galatians 5:24, "They that are Christ's, have crucified the 
    flesh, with the affections and lusts." As in the deluge of waters coming 
    over the earth, trees deeply rooted were washed away by the roots, and lay 
    floating here and there, and so might give some disturbance to the ark: so 
    Christ's efficacious blood coming over the soul, looses old lusts by the 
    roots, though they are not quite taken away, but give disturbance to the 
    believer. They are in him as a broken tooth, they hang at him as a leg out 
    of joint.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, It lies in introducing the beauty of habitual 
    holiness into our souls, in conforming us to the image of Christ: Titus 3:5, 
    forfeited. 2 Corinthians 3:18, "But we all with open face, beholding as in a 
    glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to 
    glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord." As the vessel of brass or silver, 
    being overlaid with nastiness, has nothing of its primitive luster; yet when 
    it is washed and scoured, it recovers some-what of its former brightness: so 
    the unwashed sinner has lost all his primitive spiritual glory: but Christ 
    washing him in the day of grace, he recovers it somewhat; and the washing 
    being perfected in glory, he will be brighter and more glorious than ever. 
    Now, Christ introducing this into our soul,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Implants in us a new nature, which goes over all the 
    faculties of the soul. It is a divine nature, 2 Peter 1:4, as coming from 
    God, and making the soul like God, John 3:6, "That which is born of the 
    Spirit, is spirit." Hence the man is a new creature; all his faculties are 
    renewed, mind, will, and conscience: 2 Corinthians 5:17, "If any man be in 
    Christ, he is a new creature: old things are past away, behold, all things 
    are become new." This nature has a bent and propensity to good, and an 
    aversion to evil, and cannot lose it as long as it is in being: and it will 
    be ever, for it is an immortal nature. Hence the combat, Galatians 5:17, 
    "The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and 
    these are contrary the one to the other; so that you cannot do the things 
    that you would."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) This new nature has in it the seeds of all saving 
    graces: 1 John 3:9, "Whoever is born of God, does not commit sin; for his 
    seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God." Compared 
    with Deuteronomy 30:6, "The Lord your God will circumcise your heart, and 
    the heart of your seed, to love the Lord your God with all your heart and 
    with all your soul, that you may live." We have a swatch of them, Galatians 
    5:22, 23, "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, 
    gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance." And they are taken out 
    of that fullness of grace that is in Christ the head, and communicated to 
    the sinner as a member: John 1:16. "And of his fullness have all we 
    received, and grace for grace." And thus they bear the image of Christ, that 
    as he was meek, lowly, etc. so are they in a measure. And hereby they are 
    enabled for all acts of holy obedience, as a principle of life gives power 
    for motion.</p>
<p align="justify">This is the washing of the sinner in the inner man: and 
    if you are not so washed by Christ, you have no part with him.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ washes sinners in the outward man too: Psalm 
    45:13. "The King's daughter is all glorious within; her clothing is of 
    wrought gold." These two go together, the latter issuing from the former: 
    Psalm 24:3. 4. "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? and who shall 
    stand in his holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart; who has 
    not lift up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully." James 4:8. 
    "Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you 
    double-minded." As the candle within shines through the lantern, so grace in 
    the heart appears in the outward conversation: Matthew 6:22. "The light of 
    the body is the eye: if therefore your eye be single, your whole body shall 
    be full of light." As the corruption of nature reigning, vents itself in 
    abominable works, Psalm 14:1; so the cleansing and purifying of our nature, 
    vents itself in good works, Titus 2:14. "Christ gave himself for us, that he 
    might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people 
    zealous of good works." "For as the tree is, so will the fruit be."</p>
<p align="justify">Now, Christ washing sinners in the outward man.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Removes the filth that before cleave to their life 
    and conversation, Ephesians 4:22. It is no more a vile conversation, nay, 
    nor a vain conversation, 1 Peter 1:18; not a disorderly, but a well-ordered 
    conversation, Psalm 50:23. They that go back to their former conversation, 
    whether in vanity or vileness, show themselves but Satan's washed swine, not 
    Christ's washed saints, 2 Peter 2:22. It reaches,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Their words, and purifies them from corrupt 
    communication. If the heart be circumcised, so will the lips be too: James 
    1:26. "If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his 
    tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain." If grace 
    rule in the heart, the tongue will not be allowed to go at random. The 
    liberty that some take with their tongues in obscenity, lying, swearing, 
    mocking and jesting at serious religion, etc. proclaims them to be unwashed 
    by Christ. See Psalm 15.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It reaches the course of their actions, and purifies 
    it: Hebrews 9:14. "How much more shall the blood of Christ, who, through the 
    eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience 
    from dead works to serve the living God?" It purifies their course from 
    impiety against God, and injustice against man; teaching them to walk, as 
    Titus 2:12. "Soberly, righteously, and godly." Their hands are washed, as 
    well as their hearts: and their feet are washed, that they go not in the way 
    of sinners as before.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, He beautifies them in their life and conversation: 
    Canticles 7:1. "How beautiful are your feet with shoes, O prince's daughter? 
    the joints of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a 
    running workman." Compared with Ephesians 6:15. "And your feet shod with the 
    preparation of the gospel of peace." He makes them "shine as lights in the 
    midst of a crooked and perverse generation;" and helps them to a 
    conversation becoming the gospel. And this also reaches,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Their words. Their tongue is made their glory 
    whereby they glorify God. Instead of corrupt communication, they produce 
    something for the use of edifying. Being translated from the power of 
    darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son, they learn the language of it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The course of their works. They not only cease to do 
    evil but learn to do well, Isaiah 1:16. 17. They become "zealous of good 
    works," Titus 2:14. As it is but half washing that takes away only the gross 
    filth, but makes not clean: so it is but half Christianity, where people 
    satisfy themselves with not doing evil, but set not themselves to do good.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, I shall show how our being washed from our sins 
    by Christ is done and brought about. Christ washes sinners, making use of 
    several things to that blessed purpose.</p>
<p align="justify">First, Christ washes sinners, using some things more 
    immediately for that purpose towards them. And,</p>
<p align="justify">First, Christ washes sinners with his blood, as the most 
    immediate cause of their cleansing. Hence the church ascribes praise to 
    Christ, "who loved them and washed them from their sins in his own blood," 
    Revelation 1:5. The blood of Christ has that place in washing of defiled 
    souls, that water has in washing defiled bodies: so it is the holy water 
    with which we are washed from our sins. Therefore it is called a fountain, 
    and that not only to drink at, but to wash at: Zechariah 13:1, "In that day 
    there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David, and to the 
    inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity." Compared with 1 John 
    1:7, "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin." This 
    blood being applied to the soul polluted with sin, it effectually removes 
    the filth of sin from the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">For understanding this, these things are to be noted.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The defilement or impurity sin leaves on the soul, is 
    not a bodily and visible thing, as nastiness on our bodies or clothes, which 
    may be taken away with hands: but it is a moral and spiritual uncleaness, 
    namely, an unlikenness or contrariety to the holiness of God expressed in 
    his law; so that the washing of a soul from it is the rendering of that soul 
    like unto God in his imitable perfections, expressed in the ten 
    commandments, which express his image unto us, that appeared perfectly in 
    the man Christ, being and walking exactly in every point according to these 
    ten commands, in all their spirituality and extent.</p>
<p align="justify">2. By the blood of Christ in this matter, is not meant 
    simply the blood that ran out of his veins in his circumcision, the 
    sufferings of his life, and crucifixion; but Christ himself sacrificed for 
    us; which sacrifice was begun from the moment of his incarnation, was 
    continued all his life long, was perfected on the cross and in the grave, 
    and received its actual purifying efficacy in his resurrection, as a 
    sacrifice fully offered, and accepted for the ends it was offered for: Titus 
    2:14, "He gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, 
    and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works. Romans 
    4:23, "Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our 
    justification." 1 Corinthians 6:11, "And such were some of you: but you are 
    washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the 
    Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God." Hence we owe our sanctification 
    to the holiness of his nature, and the righteousness of his life, as well as 
    to his death; the former being as essentially requisite to make him an 
    effectual sacrifice for us, as the latter; since no sacrifice could atone, 
    but what was without natural and accidental blemish. But his blood is 
    particularly named in the case,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, For that the life going away with the blood in all 
    living creatures, and so in the man Christ, the shedding of his blood was 
    the perfecting stroke in his sacrificing himself for us: so that we are said 
    to be washed with his blood, as the prisoner is said to be delivered by his 
    cautioner's paying the utmost farthing of his debt. See Romans 1:17, "For 
    therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is 
    written, The just shall live by faith." Compared with Romans 3:25, "Whom God 
    has set forth to be a atoning sacrifice , through faith in his blood, to 
    declare his righteousness for the remission of sins."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, For decency of expression, the term blood being 
    most agreeable to the term washing, which relates to some liquid. Agreeable 
    hereto was it, that after Christ being born holy, had lived holy, and died 
    on the cross, his side was pierced, and there came forth blood and water 
    fitted to wash: the Holy Spirit thereby teaching, that the washing or 
    sanctifying of sinners was to proceed from Christ, in his holy birth, life, 
    and death; thence was the spring of purifying virtue from sin.</p>
<p align="justify">3. As it is by applying water to the unclean thing, that 
    it is washed: so it is by applying to our souls, Christ sacrificed for us, 
    that we are sanctified and washed from sin. A man may stand at a river side 
    bedaubed with mire and dirt, until he die; and yet be never a whit the 
    cleaner if the water of that river, be not brought close upon him: so 
    Christ, in the purifying virtue of his blood, may be within reach of the 
    sinner's hand all his days, and yet he may die in his filth of sin, and lie 
    in it in Hell forever, if Christ and he never come close together in a 
    spiritual union. The blood of sacrifices was first offered to God for 
    atonement, and then it was sprinkled on persons or things for their 
    purification: Hebrews 9:19, "For when Moses had spoken every precept to all 
    the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, 
    with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book and 
    all the people." Compared with Exodus 24:5–8, "And Moses sent young men of 
    the children of Israel, which offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed 
    peace-offerings of oxen unto the Lord. And Moses took half of the blood, and 
    put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. And he 
    took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and 
    they said, All that the Lord has said, will we do, and be obedient. And 
    Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the 
    blood of the covenant, which the Lord has made with you concerning all these 
    words." The offering of the blood of Christ to God is over, near seventeen 
    hundred years ago: but the sprinkling or application of it is still going 
    on: Hebrews 12:22, 24, "But you are come—to Jesus the Mediator of the new 
    covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things than 
    that of Abel." Where it is sprinkled, they are cleansed; where not, they lie 
    still in their filth, having no more cleansing from sin by it, than if it 
    had never been shed.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is not every water that will wash clean; but there 
    is a cleansing virtue in some water, that is not in other water. I am not to 
    inquire into the cause of that difference; but into the cause of the 
    cleansing virtue of the blood of Christ, whereby we are washed from sin, 
    that is not in any other thing, though men have multiplied things for that 
    end. If we inquire into the spring of the cleansing virtue that is in Christ 
    sacrificed for us, and in no other things, we find these two.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, There is a real and proper merit of sinners' 
    sanctification in him. By his sacrifice of himself he has merited at the 
    hand of God the sanctification of us, and washing us from our sin: Ephesians 
    5:25, 26, "Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it: that he might 
    sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word." Christ as 
    really merited our personal holiness, and every good work we do, at the hand 
    of God, as he merited the pardon of atheism and blasphemy to us: so absurd 
    is the merit of our works: Titus 2:14, "He gave himself for us, that he 
    might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar 
    people, zealous of good works." 1 Peter 1:18, 19, "You know that you were 
    not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain 
    conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious 
    blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot." Now, there 
    is no such merit in anything else, that they should wash.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence Christ being applied to the soul, or his blood 
    sprinkled on it, has a loosing efficacy, that the filth of sin is loosed 
    from the soul it stuck close to before: even as the payment of the ransom 
    applied to the captive, actually looses the bond of his captivity; so as a 
    just judge can no more suffer him to be a captive, a prisoner. I showed 
    before, that it is guilt that is that bond. Wherefore, for persons to 
    pretend part with Christ, while yet their filth of sin sticks as close to 
    them, and they to it, as ever, is to blaspheme the justice of the Father, or 
    the merit of the Son; as if either the one did receive the ransom, and yet 
    not set the captive free; or else the other's merit was defective, and 
    therefore ineffectual.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, There is a fullness of the Spirit of holiness in 
    him, or in his blood. Hence he is said, Revelation 3:1, to have "the seven 
    Spirits of God." Christ sacrificed for us, is the receptacle of the Spirit 
    of sanctification, as the animal spirits are in the blood while fresh and 
    warm, as Christ's blood always is: that is, Christ himself as sacrificed, 
    Hebrews 10:20. And that Spirit of sanctification is not in other things, not 
    in Popish penances, not in the legal performances of prayers, tears, 
    confessions, resolutions, etc. which many Protestants use for washing 
    themselves. All these in this case are but dead water, congealed blood 
    without spirits, that defile, but cannot wash.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence Christ being applied to, or his blood sprinkled on 
    a soul, has a cleansing efficacy, removing the filth of sin, and cleansing 
    and brightening the soul in likeness to God: 2 Corinthians 3:18, "But we all 
    with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed 
    into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the 
    Lord." Thus Christ speaking of that application of himself to sinners, as by 
    eating and drinking, which are most close even to the incorporating the meat 
    and drink with the feeder, John 6:53, 54, "Then Jesus said unto the Jews, 
    Truly truly I say unto you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and 
    drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks 
    my blood, has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day;" gives 
    this as the reason of the efficacy, verse 63, "It is the spirit that 
    quickens, the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they 
    are spirit, and they are life." As filthy sores are washed and cleansed with 
    spirituous liquors, filthy souls are washed and cleansed with the blood of 
    Christ, full of the Spirit of holiness.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore to pretend to part with Christ, and yet still 
    to live in your sins, without repentance, or reformation and amendment, is 
    to blaspheme either the blood of Christ, or his Spirit; as if either there 
    were no Spirit of holiness in his blood, or else that that Spirit of 
    holiness has no efficacy to purge away the filth of sin, and make holy.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Washing off of filth and making clean, is according to 
    the degree of the application of the water with its cleansing virtue. It is 
    a very slight spot that will be quite washed off at the very first brush. 
    There is virtue enough in the river, at once to wash clean a filthy object; 
    but the washer applies it but by degrees, so that it may be long before it 
    be got perfectly clean: so there is virtue enough in Christ to wash all whom 
    he washes at all, perfectly clean at once; but that virtue is applied but by 
    degrees, 2 Corinthians 3:18, forfeited. Proverbs 4:18, "The path of the just 
    is as a shining light, that shines more and more unto the perfect day."</p>
<p align="justify">There is a threefold washing of sinners, according to a 
    threefold application of Christ's blood to them.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, A begun washing by a begun application thereof. This 
    is done in the work of conversion. Titus 3:5, it is called the washing of 
    regeneration. Here the soul that before all along was lying in wickedness 
    together with the unclean world, being taken out from among them by 
    effectual calling, and united to Christ by faith, and so having part with 
    him, is washed from his filthiness, by an application of the blood of 
    Christ, that never touched him before, but now streams over him in union 
    with Christ: Ezekiel 16:8, 9, "Now when I passed by you, and looked upon 
    you, behold, your time was the time of love, and I spread my skirt over you, 
    and covered your nakedness: yes, I swore unto you, and entered into a 
    covenant with you, says the Lord God, and you became mine. Then washed I you 
    with water; yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I 
    anointed you with oil."</p>
<p align="justify">Concerning the washing, the effect of this application, 
    observe,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) It is a washing all over; a washing of every part, 
    though not quite clean in any part: 2 Corinthians 5:17, "If any man be in 
    Christ, he is a new creature: old things are past away, behold, all things 
    are become new." Therefore it is called a new birth: Titus 3:5, "Not by 
    works of righteousness, which we have done, but according to his mercy he 
    saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit." 
    John 3:5, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter 
    into the kingdom of God." We do not say a child is born, when his head, or 
    feet, or an arm are born; but when the whole child is brought forth. Some 
    show a head, that, with notions of the principles of religion in it, and a 
    tongue to talk of them, seems to be washed; others show feet, that, by going 
    in the road of outward reformation, and some external duties, seem to be 
    washed. But it is not the washing of regeneration; for it goes not all over 
    them: they are new in some things, but they are just what they were in other 
    things. Trace them to their walk in their employments and relations, to the 
    entertainment given to the beloved lust, to the inner man, and set of their 
    heart with respect to the purity of the holy law; and they are just the same 
    with the world lying in wickedness. That is an evidence, that their washing 
    is with their own nitre and soap, not with the blood of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) It is a washing that puts one in a state of 
    cleanness, bringing him out of a state of filthiness: John 13:10, "He who is 
    washed needs not, save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit." There is 
    a difference between one lying in a mire, and another that has defiled his 
    feet; though both need washing, the latter needs but to wash his feet. Such 
    is the case of the unregenerate and regenerate: Canticles 6:10, "Who is she 
    that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and 
    terrible as an army with banners?" When the dawning is come, it is true it 
    is not broad day-light; but yet it is day, not night. The moon has her 
    spots, yet she is not filthy, but fair.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) That state of cleanness can never be lost, John 
    13:10, forfeited. Many seem to be brought to a state of cleanness, but at 
    length they turn apostates: that says, they were never out of the state of 
    filthiness, and the church of God was but beguiled with them, when they took 
    them for persons in a state of cleanness. They that are once washed, will 
    never apostatize, nor go back again to wallow in the mire: 1 John 2:19, 
    "They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, 
    they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they 
    might be made manifest, that they were not all of us."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, A continued and progressive washing, by a continued 
    progressive application of Christ's blood to the soul. This is done and 
    carried on all along from the first conversion of a sinner, until his death. 
    Therefore though the elders were about the throne in white, yet there was a 
    sea of glass before it, Revelation 4:4, 6. And the fountain stands opened 
    for the house of David, as well as for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
    Zechariah 13:1; for saints as well as for sinners. They that, deeming 
    themselves once washed, find no need of washing more, proclaim themselves 
    not washed by Christ, as do they who betake themselves for it to another 
    laver. They that are come to Christ for washing, are still coming, 1 Peter 
    2:4.</p>
<p align="justify">Two things make this continued washing necessary.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Continued imperfection in the washing of the soul 
    during this life, Philip. 3:12. Believers are in no moment of time perfectly 
    clean; in their most shining moments they are still but as the moon, not 
    without their spots. So that they never want matter of exercise, in purging 
    that they may arrive at a perfect purity: 1 John 3:3, "Every man that has 
    this hope in him, purifies himself, even as he is pure."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) New defilements contracted continually. Though they 
    never lose the state of cleanness, yet they are always needing to wash their 
    feet: John 13:10, "He who is washed, needs not, save to wash his feet, but 
    is clean every whit." An allusion to the priests in the temple service. They 
    are all priests to God, and so washed: but while they go about, such is the 
    defiled world they walk in, the remains of defilement in them, that in 
    everything they contract some spot: James 3:2, "For in many things we offend 
    all." Their heart and life have so many remaining seeds of corruption, that 
    they never want occasion to pluck up weeds.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, this continued washing is by the continued 
    application of Christ's blood, and no other way: 1. John 1:7, "The blood of 
    Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin." For,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] This is the way the saints have looked for it; as 
    David, Psalm 51:2. "Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from 
    my sin." Verse 7, "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and 
    I shall be whiter than snow." As the lepers could, by no are of their own, 
    be so purified as to be admitted to society, but by the priests sprinkling 
    them; so sinners, by no are or endeavors of their own, can be purified so as 
    to be admitted to fellowship with God, but by the sprinkling of the blood of 
    Christ upon them. Therefore the sea of glass, which is the blood of Christ, 
    stands before the throne, that whoever would have communion with God, may 
    wash there, and so be fitted for it.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] There is no merit of holiness, nor fullness of the 
    Spirit in anything else. The doings and sufferings of saints are as free of 
    merit, as those of sinners: Luke 17:10, "So likewise you, when you shall 
    have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable 
    servants: we have done that which was our duty to do." Neither is there 
    anything of the Spirit in them, but so far as the blood of Christ is 
    sprinkled on them, rendering them acceptable, Revelation 7:14; 2 Corinthians 
    2:16. But in the blood of Christ there is a never-failing merit, a constant 
    fullness of the Spirit, to which the soul may have continual recourse for 
    washing, as to a fountain never dry.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, A perfect washing, by a full application of the 
    blood of Christ. And this takes place at death, Hebrews 12:23—"To the 
    spirits of just men, made perfect." Then believers washed in conversion, and 
    who have been all along washed in the blood of Christ, are by the same means 
    made quite clean and without spot: Ephesians 5:25, 26, 27, "Christ loved the 
    church, and gave himself for it: that he might sanctify and cleanse it with 
    the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a 
    glorious church not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it 
    should be holy, and without blemish." This lies in two things.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The doing away the remains of sin wholly. The 
    reigning power of sin being broken by the first application, it is gradually 
    removed by further application, and quite carried off by the full 
    application at death. Not the least stain, nor mark of it, will then be left 
    on the believing soul. But the filth of sin now carried off in part from the 
    whole man, will then be wholly carried off from every part.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The perfecting of the image of God: 1 John 3:2, 
    "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we 
    shall be: but we know, that when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for 
    we shall see him as he is." The several lineaments of it are indeed drawn 
    now upon the believer, but mixed with corruption in every part: but then it 
    shall be without mixture, every part getting the finishing stroke in that 
    image, 1 Corinthians 13:10. "But when that which is perfect is come, then 
    that which is in part shall be done away." So shall they "shine as the 
    brightness of the firmament, and as the stars forever and ever," Daniel 
    12:3. "The righteous shall shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their 
    Father," Matthew 13:43.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, it is by a full application of the blood of Christ, 
    that is, by a full participation of Christ crucified in his purifying 
    virtue, that this washing is made: Revelation 7:14, 15, "These are they 
    which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made 
    them white in the blood of the Lamb." Therefore are they before the throne 
    of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he who sits on the 
    throne shall dwell among them." The cleansing virtue going out from him to 
    the soul in some measure now, will then go out in full measure, as when a 
    sluice is opened, and carries all away before it: 2 Corinthians 3:18, "But 
    we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are 
    changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of 
    the Lord." Compared with 1 John 3:2, forfeited. The soul putting off the 
    body, unites more closely with Christ than ever, and so partakes of his 
    merit, and fullness of Spirit, to a pitch of perfection: Ephesians 4:13, 
    "Until we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the 
    Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the Stature of the 
    fullness of Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Christ washes sinners by his Spirit: Titus 3:5, 
    "Not by works of righteousness, which we have done, but according to his 
    mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy 
    Spirit." 2 Thessalonians 2:13, "God has from the beginning chosen you to 
    salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth." 
    And the Spirit of Christ has that place in washing defiled souls, that the 
    hand of the washer has in washing the defiled body of another. The hand 
    being the instrument of action with men, the Spirit of Christ is held forth 
    under that notion, the whole work of the application of Christ's redemption 
    to us being done by him: Acts 11:21, "And the hand of the Lord was with 
    them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord." Isaiah 53:1, 
    "Who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" 
    Matthew 12:28, "But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the 
    kingdom of God is come unto you." Compared with Luke 11:20, "But if I with 
    the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon 
    you." So Christ washes sinners with his blood, by his Spirit: John 3:5, 
    "Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the 
    kingdom of God." 1 John 5:8, "And there are three that bear witness in 
    earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in 
    one." This the apostle very plainly teaches, 1 Corinthians 6:11, "And such 
    were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are 
    justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God." So 
    Christ's hand has never come on that soul for washing, which is destitute of 
    the Spirit of Christ: Romans 8:9, "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, 
    he is none of his."</p>
<p align="justify">Now, of the work of the Spirit of Christ in the washing 
    of a sinner, we may take a view in the following particulars.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The Spirit of Christ discovers to the sinner his 
    pollution and defilement of soul: John 16:8, "And when he is come, he will 
    reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment." He 
    brightens the glass of the holy commandments of the word, and he opens the 
    sinner's eyes, and determines him to look into that glass: and so the 
    sinner, getting a new sight of the holiness and purity of God, Habakkuk 
    1:13, gets a new sight of himself, that he cries out, with the leper, 
    Unclean, unclean; and says, with the church, Isaiah 64:6, "We are all as an 
    unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags." Then he sees 
    that loathsomeness in sin that he saw not before; the loathsomeness of his 
    nature, heart, and life; not excepting those sins he looked on formerly as 
    beautyspots, glorying in them, Philippians 3:19. And he is filled with shame 
    and confusion before the Lord; like those, Jeremiah 3:22, "Behold, we come 
    unto you, for you are the Lord our God." Verse 25, "We lie down in our 
    shame, and our confusion covers us: for we have sinned against the Lord our 
    God, we and our fathers from our youth even unto this day, and have not 
    obeyed the voice of the Lord our God." And if you have no experience of 
    this, you have no part with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2. He discovers to the sinner the laver wherein he may be 
    washed from that spiritual pollution, the fountain wherein he may be 
    purified, namely, the blood of Christ, or Christ himself as crucified and 
    sacrificed for us: 1 Corinthians 2:12, "Now we have received, not the spirit 
    of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things 
    that are freely given to us of God." Here is the only effectual mean for 
    purification, the only true purgatory, Jesus Christ in the purifying virtue 
    of his blood, Hebrews 1:3. And the Spirit points it out to the sinner. This 
    is called "revealing of the Son," Galatians 1:16; in our Catechism, 
    "enlightening our minds in the knowledge of Christ." Concerning which you 
    may note,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, That it is natural to men under a sense of their 
    filthiness, to look to and run to lavers of their own for washing 
    themselves, however ineffectual they are: Hosea 5:13, "When Ephraim saw his 
    sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and 
    sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound." 
    Hence the first question, "What shall we do to be saved?" They have neither 
    eyes to see, nor hearts for the blood of Christ, as the alone mean of 
    washing from sin. The whole ceremonial law pointed the Israelites to Christ 
    as the only remedy for soul pollution, yet they are as great strangers to 
    it, as if they had never heard of it. Hence we have these questions, with 
    the Lord's answer, Micah 6:6, 7, 8, "With which shall I come before the 
    Lord, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with 
    burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? will the Lord be pleased with 
    thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my 
    first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my 
    soul? He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require 
    of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your 
    God?"</p>
<p align="justify">2dly It is the work of the Spirit alone to discover it, 
    so as to bring the unclean soul to it. As Hagar saw not the well though it 
    was near her, until the Lord opened her eyes; so the sinner sees not the 
    opened fountain for sin and impurity, until the Spirit enlighten the mind: 
    John 16:14, "He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall 
    show it unto you." And he shows it effectually to the sinner, together with 
    the ineffectualness of all things else for that purpose. And,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The Spirit shows the ineffectualness of all other, 
    in the glass of the law in its spirituality and extent. There the sinner 
    beholds all that he can do or suffer needs itself to be washed, being 
    polluted and defiled, and so that it can defile him, but not wash him. Hence 
    says the church, Isaiah 64:6, "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all 
    our righteousnesses are as filthy rags, and we all do fade as a leaf, and 
    our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) In the glass of the promise of the gospel, he shows 
    the true laver, Christ Jesus: John 3:16, "For God so loved the world, that 
    he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him, should not 
    perish, but have everlasting life." The Spirit brings home the promise of 
    the gospel, and demonstrates it to the sinner, 1 Corinthians 2:4. And he 
    demonstrates,</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] The infallible efficacy of it to cleanse from sin: 1 
    Thessalonians 1:5, "For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also 
    in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance." Notwithstanding 
    all that the word says of the efficacy of Christ's blood to wash from sin, 
    that mystery is but folly to carnal men, until the demonstration of the 
    Spirit come: 1 Corinthians 1:23, 24, "But we preach Christ crucified, unto 
    the Jews a stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them 
    which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the 
    wisdom of God." Then the soul says, as Matthew 9:21, "If I may but touch his 
    garment, I shall be whole."</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] The sinner's access to it in particular; that the 
    fountain is not only open, but open for him, 1 Corinthians 2:4, 5. If this 
    be not, the sinner can never apply it to himself by faith. And this the 
    Spirit does by opening the general warrant of the word, and applying it 
    particularly to the sinner.</p>
<p align="justify">3. He brings the sinner into the laver, puts him into the 
    water as it were. We are naturally in the case of that man at the pool, who 
    said, John 5:7, "I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into 
    the pool." Though the laver of Christ's blood be near by us, we cannot put 
    in ourselves for washing. Now, the Spirit does the sinner this good office: 
    and he does it by uniting him to Christ, whereby the unclean soul is plunged 
    into the fountain opened for sin: 1 Corinthians 12:13, "For by one Spirit 
    are we all baptized into one body; and have been all made to drink into one 
    Spirit." And the Spirit brings the sinner into the laver.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Passively, entering into the dead and defiled soul 
    whereby the soul is quickened: Ezekiel 36:27, "And I will put my spirit 
    within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and you shall keep my 
    judgments, and do them." Romans 8:9, "But you are not is the flesh, but in 
    the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man 
    have not the Spirit of Christ, be is none of his." Christ communicates the 
    Spirit, which is his own Spirit dwelling in him, to the dead and defiled 
    soul; and so the soul is passively united to Christ, and quickened. Thus 
    Christ draws the sinner to him for washing, by the Spirit.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Actively, working faith in the sinner, whereby he 
    comes to Christ, and unites with him: Colossians 2:12, "Buried with him in 
    baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the 
    operation of God, who has raised him from the dead." Compared with 2 
    Corinthians 4:13, "We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is 
    written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken: we also believe, and 
    therefore speak." Ephesians 3:17, "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by 
    faith." The soul being drawn, runs; being united to Christ, unites with him; 
    being put into the opened fountain, dips himself over head and ears in it, 
    Romans 3:25. This actual believing the Spirit produces in the sinner 
    immediately out of the spiritual life given by the communication of himself 
    to him: Philip 2:13, "For it is God which works in you, both to will and to 
    do of his good pleasure." John 5:25, "Truly, truly, I say unto you, the hour 
    is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: 
    and they that hear shall live." Compared with chapter 1:12, 13, "But as many 
    as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to 
    them that believe on his name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the 
    will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."</p>
<p align="justify">Now, the unclean sinner thus brought to Christ, and 
    united to him is in the fountain, and cannot miss to be washed from his sins 
    with the blood of Christ: and the only hand that brings him there is the 
    Spirit of Christ. Now, he has part with Christ, communion necessarily 
    following upon the union.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, The Spirit washes the unclean soul in the 
    laver, applying Christ to it in the purifying virtue of his blood; as one 
    washes an unclean person in water, applying the water to him; 1 Peter 1:2, 
    "Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through 
    sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of 
    Jesus Christ." And according to the degree of that application of Christ to 
    the sinner, in the purifying virtue of his blood, made by the Spirit, such 
    is the degree of the sanctification or washing of the sinner. For 
    understanding this mystery, Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The soul being united to Christ, is clothed with his 
    merit, as for justification, so for sanctification also: Revelation 3:18, "I 
    counsel you to buy of me white clothing, that you may be clothed, and that 
    the shame of your nakedness do not appear." Sanctification is a great 
    privilege and costly, bought with the Redeemer's blood: 1 Peter 1:18, 19, 
    "You know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and 
    gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; 
    but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and 
    without spot." Titus 2:14, "Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us 
    from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of 
    good works." And the merit or righteousness of Christ being on a man, by 
    union with Christ, is the ground in law for his partaking of the benefit of 
    sanctification, as a benefit purchased for him: even as the guilt of Adam's 
    first sin on us, is the ground in law for God's denying us the 
    sanctification of our nature in our birth, upon which the corruption of 
    nature is conveyed to us from Adam.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Sinners united to Jesus Christ, have communion with 
    him in his death and resurrection; I. e., they have a common interest with 
    him therein, they are in law reckoning their death and resurrection too: 
    Colossians 2:12, "Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen 
    with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from 
    the dead." The reason is, because Christ died and rose again as a public 
    person, their head, in their name: Romans 6:4, "Therefore we are buried with 
    him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead 
    by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life." 
    And this communion with Christ in his death and resurrection, is the spring 
    of their sanctification; it is that which sets all the wheels in motion, 
    that concur to the washing them from their sins: Romans 6:3–6, "Know you 
    not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized 
    into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that 
    like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even 
    so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted 
    together in the likeness of his death: we shall be also in the likeness of 
    his resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that 
    the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve 
    sin."</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Christ dying put off from himself the whole body of 
    all our sins, which before were upon him by imputation; and rose again 
    without sin imputed, as he was ever without sin inherent: Romans 6:10, "For 
    in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he lives, he lives unto 
    God." For he by his death having fully satisfied for sins, the guilt of them 
    whereby they cleave to him, was dissolved of course, and he shook them all 
    off as Paul did the viper into the fire, having no more power to cleave to 
    him or hurt him. Which death and resurrection being of a public person, 
    their head, has, by the merit thereof, a power of conforming all his members 
    thereto, in dying to sin, and rising to newness of life; even as there was a 
    contrary power in Adam's sin and death: Philip. 3:10, "That I may know him, 
    and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, 
    being made comformable unto his death." Compared with Romans 6:5, 6, 
    above-cited.</p>
<p align="justify">4thly, Sinners having communion with Christ in this his 
    death and resurrection, are in him legally dead to sin, freed from it in 
    point of right, and alive spiritually to God: Romans 6:10, 11, "For in that 
    he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he lives, he lives unto God. 
    Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin; but alive 
    unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord." The body of the sins of the flesh 
    is legally put off them, and they are clean: even as the captive or prisoner 
    to whom is legally applied the paying of the ransom or debt by the 
    cautioner, is, in the moment of that application, legally free, and no more 
    a captive or prisoner in point of right; though it may take some time before 
    he be brought freely out of the dungeon, and his prison garments be got all 
    of them off, and his irons be all knocked off.</p>
<p align="justify">5thly, Upon this ground the Spirit applies Christ's death 
    and resurrection really to them, conforming them in their own persons 
    thereto: even as when the judge has legally applied the payment of the 
    ransom to the captive, by sustaining it as paid for him; a messenger applies 
    it really by opening the prison-doors, knocking off the chains, and bringing 
    him out: Galatians 6:14, "But God forbid that I should glory, save in the 
    cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and 
    I unto the world." Philip. 3:10, "That I may know him, and the power of his 
    resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable 
    unto his death." Compared with 1 Peter 1:2, "Elect according to the 
    foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit unto 
    obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ." So that by the 
    Spirit they are changed into the image of Christ dead and risen again: 2 
    Corinthians 3:18, "But we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the 
    glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, 
    even as by the Spirit of the Lord," Romans 6:5, "For if we have been planted 
    together in the likeness of his death; we shall he also in the likeness of 
    his resurrection."</p>
<p align="justify">6thly, The Spirit applies Christ's blood, death, and 
    resurrection, to sinners, really, by conveying from Christ the head, unto 
    them as his members, a certain measure and degree of that all-fullness of 
    grace that is lodged in him, which he died to purchase, and rose again to 
    apply: Colossians 1:19, "For it pleased the Father, that in him should all 
    fullness dwell, John 1:16, "And of his fullness have all we received, and 
    grace for grace." Compared with John 16:14, 15, "He shall glorify me: for he 
    shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you. All things that the 
    Father has, are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and 
    shall show it unto you." All the grace that is in the saints in Heaven or 
    earth, or ever shall be, comes from the fullness of grace in the man Christ; 
    as all the light of the world from the sun: and the Spirit communicates it 
    to them from him. Now, all graces are in Christ, and the Spirit communicates 
    to his members of them all, John 1:16, forfeited.</p>
<p align="justify">7thly, Thus the blood of Christ applied by the Spirit, 
    penetrates or seeks in to the unclean soul, to the washing it from its 
    filthiness; Ezekiel 36:25, "I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you 
    shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I 
    cleanse you." For wherever that grace comes, it must needs have a twofold 
    effect:</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) To remove sin according to its measure, and so to 
    carry off spiritual filthiness. Where humility comes, pride goes; where 
    heavenliness of mind takes place, there sensuality and worldliness are 
    dislodged; and so of other graces. For grace and sin are two contraries; 
    whereof as the one gains, the other must needs lose.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) To beautify and brighten the soul. Hence she is, 
    like "the king's daughter, all glorious within; her clothing is of wrought 
    gold," Psalm 45:13. For the more grace one has, the more he is like God. And 
    this grace is immediately derived to us from Christ; who is the image of the 
    invisible God, and therefore fairer than the children of men, Psalm 45:2; 
    that we being thereby rendered like Christ, may be rendered like God, in his 
    imitable perfections.</p>
<p align="justify">8thly, This communication of grace, by the Spirit, from 
    Christ, to us being united to Christ, is the Spirit's applying Christ's 
    blood to us; inasmuch as the blood of Christ is as it were the vehicle of 
    his grace, as the water is of the soap, that cleansing thing, Malachi 3:2, 
    Christ is like fuller's soap. In this view is that prayer for 
    sanctification, Psalm 51:2, "Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and 
    cleanse me from my sin." Wash me, namely, as a fuller does. In vain is the 
    soap used without the water for washing; and in vain will we look for 
    sanctification by the grace of Christ, without the merit of his blood on us. 
    It is in the stream of his blood going over our souls, that his grace is 
    brought into and left in them, to the beautifying of them in holiness. By 
    the merit of it, it has a double effect. One relative, and immediate, to our 
    justification. Hence the apostle, Hebrews 12:24, speaks of "coming to Jesus 
    the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that 
    speaks better things than that of Abel." Another effect it has, real, and 
    mediate, to our sanctification. Hence the apostle describes Christians as, 1 
    Peter 1:2, "Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through 
    sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of 
    Jesus Christ." And this is effected through the grace of Christ that it 
    brings down with it. It is the bruising of the bread-corn that fits it to be 
    bread; the dying of the corn of wheat, that brings forth more wheat: so it 
    is the crucifying of Christ, that fitted him to be a fountain of grace, 
    whereof sinners might drink; it is the blood or death of Christ that makes 
    Christians, that is, men after his image, John 12:24. Thus the Spirit's 
    conveying of grace from Christ to us, is his sprinkling us with the blood of 
    Christ for our sanctification, 1 Peter 1:2; to be distinguished, though not 
    divided, from the sprinkling for our justification, Hebrews 12:24.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, According to the measure of the former sprinkling 
    or application of the blood of Christ, so is the measure of our 
    sanctification, purification, and cleansing from sin. The other having only 
    a relative and immediate effect, is not capable of degrees: so it is alike 
    in all believers. But this having a real and mediate effect through the 
    grace conveyed in it, is made in very different degrees and measures, as a 
    spring or fountain running into a vessel. And there are three degrees of 
    this application of Christ's blood by the Spirit, as before observed.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, A begun application of it, in the soul's union with 
    Christ at first in effectual calling. That moment the sinner becomes a 
    member of Christ, the Spirit begins the application of Christ's blood to him 
    for his sanctification, conveying real inherent grace to him from Christ his 
    head, 2 Thessalonians 2:13, compared with John 16:14, and 1:16. The sluice 
    of grace in Christ that was quite stopped before as to the sinner, is then 
    opened in a measure to run over him for his washing from sin. And as to this 
    measure,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is some measure of all saving grace that is then 
    communicated to the believer from Christ, his head, by the Spirit: John 
    1:16, "And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace." As 
    the wax receives every point in the seal, so the believer receives every 
    grace in the man Christ. Hence the apostle, Ephesians 1:13, speaks of 
    believers being "sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise. As all saving 
    graces are lodged in Christ without measure, John. 3:34, so a seed of them 
    all is communicated to his members, 1 John 3:9, of faith, love, repentance, 
    or a set of heart turning God-ward, humility, meekness, etc. And though some 
    graces may be more apparent and topping in a believer, than others; yet he 
    wants none of them altogether, Hebrews 8:10. The effect of this is the 
    habitual sanctification of the believer, whereby the dominion of sin is 
    broken; the pollution and defilement by sin is begun to be removed, and the 
    soul is made habitually holy. More particularly, hereby,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The believer's nature is renewed, Ephesians 4:23, 
    24. He is renewed in the whole man, his whole person, soul and body, 1 
    Thessalonians 5:23. There are quite new qualities derived from Christ, into 
    his mind, will, and affections; habits of grace infused into them by the 
    Spirit from Christ, which habits of grace are the immediate principle of 
    gracious actings, distinct from the new vital powers that go before faith. 
    The body is renewed in communion with the renewed soul. Hence the apostle 
    exhorts the Romans, Romans 6:13, "Neither yield you your members as 
    instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as 
    those that are alive from the dead; and your members as instruments of 
    righteousness unto God." So sanctification is quite another thing than the 
    bare amending of our lives; and holiness quite another thing than moral 
    virtue, which can never give us this new nature.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, He becomes a new creature, 2 Corinthians 5:17; not 
    only a spiritually living creature, as in the quickening of the dead soul, 
    John 5:25, before faith in effectual calling, called the first regeneration, 
    John 1:12, 13, answering to the conception in natural generation; but a new 
    creature in all its parts, by the work of sanctification; a second 
    regeneration, following after faith, and answering to the forming of the 
    conception into the distinct members in the womb, however small, Titus 3:5; 
    Ephesians 2:10; 1:13. Hence there is not only a new head, feet, or life, in 
    the case; but a new man, where all saving graces concur, as all the several 
    members in a human body.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, He is made over again in the image of God, bearing 
    his image as a child of the father, Colossians 3:10. And this comes to pass, 
    in that the new creature being entirely sprung of Christ, being made by 
    receiving from him grace for grace in him, must needs be his image, 
    Galatians 4:19. And he is the image of God; therefore it must be the image 
    of God too. Thus Eve was made after God's image, but mediately, being made 
    after Adam's image, who was made immediately after God's, Genesis 2:18, 
    margin, compared with 1 Corinthians 11:7, 8.</p>
<p align="justify">4thly, He becomes one spirit with Christ, which is the 
    oneness with Christ that is the result of our uniting with him, 1 
    Corinthians 6:17, "He who is joined unto the Lord, is one spirit." The 
    Spirit is the principal cause, faith the instrumental cause, joining or 
    uniting us to Christ; but this is it whereby Christ and the believer 
    formally coalesce or go together into one, namely, one spirit, that is, one 
    spiritual nature, Hebrews 2:11: even as Eve was one flesh with Adam, being 
    made of him, of his flesh and bones; to which the Apostle alludes, Ephesians 
    5:30. "For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones." 
    Suppose a tree had a virtue of changing the graft into its own nature, as 
    Christ has; the gardener ingrafts, the engraft by his are unites close with 
    the stock: then the stock conveys of its juice into the engraft, whereby the 
    nature of the engraft is changed; here is the oneness arising from the 
    uniting, they are one tree, of one nature. So the Spirit puts the soul to 
    Christ, by faith it unites close with him: then Christ by his Spirit conveys 
    of his graces to the soul, which change its nature into his own, and so they 
    go into one, namely, one spiritual or divine nature, 2 Peter 1:4, partaking 
    of it with him, and that from him. So they are his seed, Isaiah 53:10.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, He is put in a near capacity for all acts of holy 
    obedience, whether in doing or suffering, Deuteronomy 30:6; Hebrews 8:10; 
    the seed of the several saving graces derived from Christ, and implanted in 
    him, tending of their own nature to spring according to their several kinds. 
    If the seed of any grace were wanting in him, then he would be in no near 
    capacity for acting that grace wanting. Like as a dead man, who is not only 
    quickened by a miracle, but is risen and come out of the grave, is in an 
    immediate disposition for the common actions of life; so in this case of 
    sanctification, the soul is not only quickened, as it is in effectual 
    calling, but is in the nearest capacity to walk what way the Lord calls: 
    Romans 6:4, "Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that 
    like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even 
    so we also should walk in newness of life." In effectual calling, Christ 
    says to the sinner, Arise; in sanctification he says, Loose him, and let him 
    go.</p>
<p align="justify">2. But it is not a full measure of any grace that is then 
    communicated from Christ by his Spirit to the believer: "For we know but in 
    part," says the apostle Paul, 1 Corinthians 13:9. And says the same apostle, 
    Romans 7:23, "I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my 
    mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin, which is in my 
    members." The believer has derived to him from Christ, the graces of faith, 
    love, etc. but none of them in perfection: even as when the child is 
    perfectly formed in the womb, there is head, eyes, hands, feet, etc. but all 
    of them very small, none of them come to perfection. Now, so far as they go, 
    they do remove sin with its pollution off the soul: but they cannot fill up 
    the room in any part; therefore there are remains of corruption in every 
    part, mind, will, and affections, and the body in communion with the corrupt 
    part, Romans 7:14.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, the consequent of this is an imperfection of 
    sanctification: the believer is sanctified, but not perfectly sanctified. 
    More particularly, hence,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, There two contrary principles in believers; the 
    flesh and spirit, the new and old man, the new nature derived to them from 
    the second Adam, the old unrenewed nature from the first Adam: the one the 
    old inhabitant, the other the new incomer upon it; like the house of Saul, 
    and the house of David, in Israel. Hence believers are a mystery to the 
    world, yes to themselves: Can. 6:13, "Return, return, O Shulamite, return, 
    return, that we may look upon you: what will you see in the Shulamite? as it 
    were the company of two armies." Romans 7:16, 17, "If then I do that which I 
    would not, I consent unto the law, that it is good. Now then, it is no more 
    I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, There is a continual combat in them, between these 
    two contrary principles, being together side for side, as it were, in every 
    part: Galatians 5:17, "For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the 
    Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other; so 
    that you cannot do the things that you would." Thus the believer is like 
    Rebekah, Genesis 25:22, 23, who had the children struggling together within 
    her; and who was told by the Lord, upon her inquiring into the affair, that 
    two nations were in her womb, and two manner of people should be separated 
    from her affections. The two armies war in the Shulamite, Canticles 6:13. So 
    that the believer's heart by that means is often like a field of battle, 
    where there is much confusion and struggle. There is something like this 
    found sometimes in the unregenerate; but in them the struggle is between the 
    flesh in one part lusting, and the flesh in another part fearing, 2 Peter 
    2:15, compared with Numbers 22:18. In the saints it is between the flesh and 
    the spirit in one and the same part, receiving and refusing the same 
    spiritual truth or falsehood, willing and nilling the same good or evil, of 
    its own proper motion, Romans 7:15, 16, forfeited.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Neither their good nor ill actions are carried to 
    perfection, Galatians 5:17, forfeited. For the two contrary principles being 
    thus yoked, neither of them gets its full swing. When grace prevails to 
    carry the good point, yet corruption clogs it in some measure: and when 
    corruption prevails, grace clogs it in some measure; Cant 4:2, "Your teeth 
    are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the 
    washing: whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them." 
    Saints in Heaven in good, and unregenerate men in evil, are like strong men 
    traveling in a calm day; saints on earth, in good or ill, are like men 
    traveling with a strong wind blowing in their face, that cannot make the way 
    that otherwise they would.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Howbeit, it is a predominant measure of grace that is 
    then conveyed by the Spirit from Christ to the soul: Romans 6:14, "For sin 
    shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under 
    grace." Grace is put in the heart to rule, though in midst of its enemies, 
    which makes it difficult to maintain its superiority. Not that it is 
    predominant in every particular event and encounter; experience testifies 
    the contrary. Hence, says the apostle, Romans 7:23, "I see another law in my 
    members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity 
    to the law of sin, which is in my members." But it is fundamentally and 
    habitually predominant; that is, it is more firmly rooted as an immortal 
    seed against a mortal one, and generally speaking it prevails. Hence,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The dominion and reigning power of sin is broken, 
    Romans 6:14, forfeited. It is turned off the throne it had before, and is 
    put under the check of a superior principle. Hence the apostle says, 1 John 
    3:9, "Whoever is born of God, does not commit sin; for his seed remains in 
    him: and lie cannot sin, because he is born of God." Thus Christ delivers 
    the soul from that enemy, to serve him. Hence is that of the prophet, Isaiah 
    9:4, "You have broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, 
    the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian." Indwelling it may be for 
    a time, and, as a troublesome guest, breed much disturbance in the house: 
    but it is no more master of the house. This was typified by the remains of 
    the Canaanites in the land, which Israel could not drive out, but yet 
    brought them under tribute, Jude. 1:19, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, It shall be quite expelled at length: Romans 16:20, 
    "The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly." Whatever 
    particular battles it won, the wars shall end in its ruin: 1 John 5:4, 
    "Whatever is born of God, overcomes the world." When the true Israelite 
    comes to the Red Sea of death, these Egyptians shall be swallowed up there, 
    and he shall see them all dead on the shore. Sin is crucified by the 
    incoming of grace, and though the thief being on the cross may rage and 
    blaspheme, yet shall he never come down until he breath out his last.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, There is a continued application of the blood of 
    Christ made to the believer by the Spirit, during his after continuing in 
    the world. For the soul once united to Christ, his Spirit dwells in it ever 
    after, never quits his dwelling. Hence Christ said to his disciples, John 
    14:16, 17, "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, 
    that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth, whom the 
    world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you 
    know him, for he dwells with you, and shall be in you." And the Spirit 
    continues that application to it from time to time until death, conveying 
    fresh supplies of grace to it from Christ the head. Hence the grace of 
    Christ conveyed to believers is held forth under the notion of a 
    spring-well; John 4:14, "But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give 
    him, shall never thirst: but the water that I shall give him, shall be in 
    him a well of water springing up into everlasting life;" which is still 
    affording new water. The fullness of grace in Christ is the spring-head, 
    Colossians 2:19. The receivers into which it runs, are believers, his 
    members, that receive supplies of grace from him, as the branches supplies 
    of juice from the stock: John 15:5, "I am the vine, you are the branches: he 
    who abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit." And the 
    conveyer of these supplies from the head to the members, Philip 1:18, with 
    verse 11, is the Spirit. For clearing this purpose, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Though one is renewed, and has the seed of all grace 
    planted in him, in the begun application issuing in habitual sanctification; 
    yet he is not able of himself to exercise one grace, to wash off one 
    remaining spot, or add to himself one stroke of purity: but thereto is 
    necessary a new supply by the Spirit, 2 Corinthians 3:4, 5. Even of our 
    gracious selves we can do nothing; can bring forth no fruit of grace, John 
    15:5, even when furnished with gracious qualities. This is not so very 
    strange, if we consider, that though we have the power of natural motion, 
    yet we cannot move a finger without a common providential influence of the 
    Spirit, Acts 17:28, "For in him we live, and move, and have our being." 
    Though fresh seed be cast into the earth, if the influence of the sun and 
    rain is withheld, it springs not.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Hence every gracious act of ours is a fruit of the 
    Spirit produced by him in us, through these supplies of grace; as the 
    springing of the seed is by the warmth and moisture it gets from the 
    heavens, Galatians 5:22, 23; Ephesians 5:8. Hence the Spirit is said to lust 
    against the flesh, Galatians 5:17, as producing these lustings in us; even 
    as he is said to groan, Romans 8:26. So every act of mortification is by the 
    Spirit, Romans 8:13, "If you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the 
    body, you shall live." And so also is every act of obedience, Philippians 
    2:13, "For it is God which works in you, both to will and to do of his good 
    pleasure." So that take away the Spirit, and you take away all true 
    holiness.</p>
<p align="justify">3. These supplies of grace are given in such a measure 
    only, in the continued application, as in the begun application. There is 
    some measure of every grace supplied, Colossians 2:19. Hence, (Ephesians 
    5:9.), "The fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and 
    truth." But there is not a full measure of any grace: 1 Corinthians 13:9, 
    "For we know but in part." Yet there is a predominant measure, 2 Corinthians 
    12:9. Hence the imperfection of actual sanctification; there are still some 
    spots to wash off while here. Washing of foul clothes will take time; there 
    is much work for the hands there. But the washing of foul souls ordinarily 
    takes more than the longest work of that kind. The Spirit could wash us 
    perfectly clean in an instant, by a full application of the blood; but it is 
    otherwise ordered. The thief on the cross was washed clean in a moment: but 
    ordinarily the washing is gradual.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, These continued supplies of grace continue the 
    washing of the soul; inasmuch as thereby,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Inherent grace is preserved, that it die not out, 
    amidst so many snares and temptations. It is but a created quality, and of 
    itself would wither away and die out, and so leave the soul overwhelmed anew 
    with the filth of sin, if it were not fed. Hence the Lord says, Isaiah 27:3, 
    "I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment; lest any hurt it, I 
    will keep it night and day." John 15:5, 6, "I am the vine, you are the 
    branches: He who abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much 
    fruit: for without me you can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is 
    cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them 
    into the fire, and they are burned. But the continued supplies from Christ 
    by the Spirit, render it an abiding immortal seed, 1 Corinthians 1:8, 9, 
    compared with John 14:19; Jude verse 1.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Inherent grace is excited, that it lie not idle, 
    Canticles 5:4. Sometimes it lies like fire under the ashes; new supplies 
    coming in by the Spirit, it is stirred up, and casts abroad its light in the 
    soul. Hence the Spirit is compared to the wind, Canticles 4:16. Being 
    excited to action, it removes sin; as the stopped spring loosed, works out 
    the mud. And,</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, It is increased and strengthened, that it may act 
    more vigorously towards the expulsion of its enemy, Colossians 1:10; 
    Ephesians 3:16; Isaiah 40:29. As an addition of soap makes the washing go on 
    more thoroughly, so the fresh supplies of grace from Christ by the Spirit 
    carry on the washing of the soul, causing the stream run higher to the 
    carrying off more of the filth of sin, and beautifying the soul more.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, There is a full application of the blood of Christ 
    to the soul made by the Spirit at death. That moment the soul and body are 
    separated, the Spirit brings in a full stream of grace from Christ into the 
    soul, Ephesians 3:19. with 1 Corinthians 13:8, 9, 10. The communication of 
    grace which was before but in part, is then made perfect. For clearing of 
    this purpose, note, that,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The perfection of grace taking place in the souls of 
    believers at death, comes from the same spring as at conversion, and after, 
    until death. It is all communicated to them from Christ their head, with 
    this difference only, that the stream of it that ran small and scanty 
    before, is then made to run full, as when a sluice is fully opened. As, out 
    of his fullness, they got grace for grace in Christ, in some measure, 
    before; so then, out of the same fullness, they get a fullness of grace for 
    grace in him. For they grow to their perfection in him, as members of him, 
    and therefore by communication from him, Ephesians 4:13. The new creature is 
    both formed and perfected the same way.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is the same Spirit who conveys the perfection of 
    grace from Christ to believers at death, that conveyed the first grace, and 
    the supplies thereof: the same Spirit who forms, and nourishes the new 
    creature, in the time of this life, brings it to its perfection and full 
    growth at death, Philip. 1:6; Psalm 138:8. And as to the measure he then 
    communicates.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, It is a full measure, such as wholly renews them in 
    every part, perfecting the image of Christ, and so of God, on them, and 
    utterly abolishes all remains of sin in them, 2 Corinthians 4:16, with 
    Hebrews 12:23; Revelation 7:14, 15. Thus they are washed perfectly clean, no 
    spot is left in them, all being carried off by the full flood of grace 
    conveyed then from Christ to them. And thus they are enabled to serve the 
    Lord in perfection forever, Revelation 22:3, with 1 Corinthians 13:10.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Yet is it not such a measure, as that they never 
    need more: no, but they will always be kept full, by the Spirit's 
    communicating eternally to them full supplies of grace from Christ their 
    head: Revelation 7:17, "For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, 
    shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and 
    God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. Compared with John 16:14, "He 
    shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you." 
    There will be nothing any more to stop or retard the flowing of grace from 
    Christ into them; but the fountain will empty of its fullness into them 
    without interruption. That there shall be such an eternal communication to 
    them from Christ by the Spirit, is evident, in that they continue forever 
    members of Christ; and members cannot act but by continued communications of 
    influences from their head: John 14:16, 17, "And I will pray the Father, and 
    he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; 
    even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him 
    not, neither knows him: but you know him, for he dwells with you, and shall 
    be in you." John 15:4, 5, "Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot 
    bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you, except 
    you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches: He who abides in me, 
    and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do 
    nothing."</p>
<p align="justify">From what is said on this head, we draw these inferences.</p>
<p align="justify">1. They are not washed from their filthiness, that have 
    never had a discovery of the filth of sin made to them by the Spirit. Men 
    may get a sight of the guilt of sin, that will fill them with fear and 
    terror; that yet get no kindly sight of the filth of sin, filling them with 
    shame and self-loathing before the Lord. But without this last, there is no 
    sanctification: Ezekiel 36:31, "Then shall you remember your own evil ways, 
    and your doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own 
    sight, for your iniquities, and for your abominations." Therefore never 
    think you have seen sin aright, until you see it in the monstrous filthiness 
    of it, as opposite to the holiness of God: it is that only will turn one's 
    stomach on it, and cause them to vomit it up by true repentance.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The filthiness of the soul by sin, is never duly seen, 
    until it appear so ingrained as nothing but the blood of Christ can wash it 
    off. They evidence but slight thoughts of the filth of sin, that think it 
    can be carried off by prayers, confessions, tears, and outward reformation: 
    therefore the Spirit carries the elect beyond all these to the laver of 
    Christ's blood. Hence David prayed, Psalm 51:2, "Wash me thoroughly from 
    mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin." There only is there merit and 
    efficacy sufficient to wash out the pollution.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Whoever truly come to Christ by faith, they come to 
    him for sanctification, as well as justification; that they may be washed 
    from the filth of sin by him, as well as freed from the guilt of sin through 
    him. Hence faith is a coming to the waters, Isaiah 55:1, and that to be 
    washed in them, Zechariah 13:1. It is but false faith that looks to Christ 
    for freedom from guilt and the wrath of God, and not for conformity to God 
    in holiness</p>
<p align="justify">4. For to stand off from Christ, and uniting with him by 
    believing on him, until one has made himself clean and fit for Christ, is 
    the work of a false heart, marring the soul's washing; not the work of the 
    Spirit, carrying on the washing of the soul. For it is the work of the 
    Spirit to put the unclean soul in the laver, uniting it to Christ, that it 
    may be made clean. Therefore let no pollution of sin whatever keep you back 
    from Christ; but let the consideration of your pollution drive you forward 
    to him; and the greater it is, you have the more need to make speed, and 
    unite the more closely with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Whoever are united to Christ by the Spirit, are 
    sanctified persons, truly regenerate, new creatures: 2 Corinthians 5:17, "If 
    any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away, 
    behold, all things are become new." In vain do men pretend to be members of 
    Christ, while they remain unsanctified in their nature and life. Can one be 
    united to Christ in whom the fullness of grace is lodged, and yet there be 
    no communication of grace from him to them? or can there be such a 
    communication, and yet they not be renewed after his image? and if a new 
    nature, must there not be a new life?</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, True Christianity is in its own nature a 
    progressive thing, going towards perfection. Hence says the apostle, Philip 
    3:12, "Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: 
    but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am 
    apprehended of Christ Jesus." It is a most dismal sign, where a person 
    having, as he thinks, embraced Christ for salvation, and so secured himself 
    for eternity, is no further careful to advance in practical religion, but 
    continues easy, being at a stand; seeing "the path of the just is as the 
    shining light, that shines more and more unto the perfect day," Proverbs 
    4:18. It is true, a real believer may not only be at a stand for a while, 
    but may be going back: but it is of the nature of grace, as of a seed, or 
    the morning light, to go forward and increase until it come to perfection, 
    John 4:14; Ephesians 4:13. This is the result of the continued application 
    of the blood of Christ to the believer by the Spirit. Therefore observe 
    whether you grow or not.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, Christ washes sinners through faith. Hence the 
    apostle, Acts 15:9, speaks of "purifying the heart by faith;" and 26:18, of 
    being sent to open men's eyes, "and to turn them from darkness to light, and 
    from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, 
    and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in Christ." 
    And faith has that place in the washing of defiled souls, that the hand of 
    the party washed has in the washing of himself, under the management of the 
    principal washer. For faith is the hand of the soul, John 1:12. And in the 
    spiritual washing it is active. The soul being first passively washed by the 
    Spirit, washes itself by faith; being put into the laver by the Spirit, it 
    applies the water by faith, 2 Corinthians 7:1. Yet Christ by his Spirit is 
    still the principal cause of the washing; forasmuch as he both works faith 
    in the soul, and then by new influences puts it in exercise: Philip. 2:13, 
    "For it is God which works in us, both to will and to do of his good 
    pleasure." And so faith is the instrumental cause of our washing from sin, 
    Acts 15:9, forfeited.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, the efficacy of faith in the washing of the soul 
    lies in these following things, under these two heads.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is the eye of the soul in that matter, and so it is 
    an impulsive cause moving the sinner to wash away his sin, Galatians 2:16; 
    and is supposed in such calls, as that Isaiah 1:16, "Wash you, make you 
    clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to do 
    evil, learn to do well." Now, by the eye of faith,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The man discerns his pollution, that he is all over 
    defiled, and unlike God: Isaiah 64:6, "We are all as an unclean thing, and 
    all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags, and we all do fade as a leaf, 
    and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away." He looks into the 
    glass of the word, which is a representation of God's holiness, and so 
    represents the sinner as vile and loathsome. The man believes the 
    representation to be true, and so cries out, as Job 40:4, "Behold, I am 
    vile, what shall I answer you? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth." This 
    glass is held to the eyes of others; but, notwithstanding being unbelievers, 
    they see not their universal pollution. But thus the believer sees the need 
    of washing.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, He discerns the depth of the stain, that it can be 
    washed out by no human are. Faith brings, from the testimony of the word, 
    that report into the soul, Jeremiah 2:22, "For though you wash you with 
    nitre, and take you much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me, says 
    the Lord God." Unbelievers are ruined in their pollution for want of this; 
    they see not how deep their defilement lies; so they think their own nitre 
    and soap will do their business, that Abana and Pharpar may cleanse the 
    leper, as well as any other water, Hosea 5:13. But faith sees them all 
    physicians of no value: and so the believer sees the need of another laver 
    even the blood of Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, He discerns the ill of his pollution on the one 
    hand, and the good of the washing on the other. By faith the man is 
    persuaded of the destructive nature of sin, and its contrariety to God's 
    nature and will: and he is persuaded too of the beauty and excellency of 
    holiness, or purification from sin. The one he sees in the glass of the law, 
    its threatenings and commands; the other in the glass of the gospel, in the 
    face of Jesus. And these are a spur to incite him to seek to be washed, Luke 
    15:17, 18.</p>
<p align="justify">4thly, He discerns the laver, Christ crucified, Isaiah 
    45:22. By the help of the glass of the gospel, he takes up the sea of 
    Christ's blood, as the only laver for unclean souls, Matthew 9:20, 21. And 
    by faith the unclean soul discerns Christ the laver,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) As an efficacious laver in all cases, 1 John 1:7, 
    "The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin." The man believes that 
    Christ is able to wash out the deepest stain, to make the filthiest soul 
    clean, according to the word, Isaiah 1:18, "Come now, and let us reason 
    together, says the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as 
    white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." This 
    is necessary, as appears in the case of the blind men, Matthew 9:28, 29, 
    "Jesus says unto them, Believe you that I am able to do this? they said unto 
    him, Yes, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith, 
    be it unto you."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) As an open laver in its own case, Zechariah 13:1, 
    "In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David, and to 
    the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin, and for impurity." Compared with 
    Hebrews 11:6, "But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he who 
    comes to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them 
    that diligently seek him." This is believing the gospel, one's warrant to 
    come to Christ, without which none can come. For if one should look on the 
    fountain as open to all the world, but only sealed to him, this will 
    effectually mar his access to it, Jeremiah 2:25, "You said, There is no 
    hope. No, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go." But faith 
    says, Psalm 65:3, "Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, 
    you shall purge them away."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Faith is the hand of the soul in that matter, and so 
    it is an instrumental cause of washing away sin. And by the hand of faith,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The soul embraces Christ, and unites with him: John 
    1:12, "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons 
    of God, even to them that believe on his name." Compared with Ephesians 
    3:17, "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith." The soul, at its 
    first union with Christ, being plunged into the laver by the Spirit, does by 
    faith spread out itself therein; as one who haying jumped into the water to 
    swim, does immediately spread out his body in it, and embrace the water as 
    it were. Christ having apprehended the unclean soul by his Spirit, and 
    united it passively to himself; the soul again apprehends him by faith, and 
    actively unites with him. And hereby faith brings in the first application 
    of his blood, the effect of which is habitual sanctification.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The soul cleaves to Christ, and abides in him, all 
    along until death: Hebrews 10:39, "But we are not of them who draw back unto 
    perdition; but of them that believe, to the saving of the soul." It is never 
    extinguished again in the soul; though its gripe may be sometime slacked, 
    yet it never lets it quite go: Luke 22:32, "But I have prayed for you, that 
    your faith fail not." Hereby it brings in the continued application, for 
    progressive sanctification, John 15:5. And the stronger its gripes are at 
    any time, the more plentiful application is there of the blood of Christ to 
    the soul; as the stronger the child sucks, he draws out the more milk, 
    Isaiah 66:11. Hence he who has the strongest faith, has the holiest heart 
    and life.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, The soul cleaves to Christ in death. When the body 
    is falling down, the man still cleaves to and abides in Christ, and so dying 
    in faith, dies in the Lord, Hebrews 11:13; Revelation 14:13. Faith keeps the 
    gripe of Christ, while the soul is losing gripe of the body; and as the body 
    drops off, it brings in a full application of Christ's blood, which perfects 
    sanctification. So the soul drops the remains of sin together with the body.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, the instrumental efficacy of faith for the washing 
    of the soul, lies in trust: and as it trusts, it purifies; for therein lies 
    its nature, and therefore its efficacy comes that way, Psalm 31:19; Psalm 
    37:40. And the object of that trust is twofold.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The object of this trust is real, namely, the word. 
    Faith trusts or believes the word as firm and infallible truth. Hence the 
    apostle, 2 Thessalonians 2:13, speaks of the belief of the truth. Faith 
    trusts or believes particularly the word of the promise of the gospel, 
    holding out to sinners the benefit of sanctification as well as other 
    benefits, 2 Corinthians 7:1; such as that promise, Ezekiel 36:25, "I will 
    sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean: from all your 
    filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you." This trust of the 
    word of the gospel is our original obedience to the truth, 1 Peter 1:22, 
    wherein the soul subjects itself wholly to the truth of God in his word, 
    believing it over the belly of all objections in this point, saying, as 
    Micah 7:19, "He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us: he will 
    subdue our iniquities: and you will cast all their sins into the depths of 
    the sea."</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The object of this trust is personal, namely, Christ 
    himself. The soul trusts on Christ for the washing of it. Hence is that 
    invitation, Isaiah 45:22, "Look unto me, and be you saved, all the ends of 
    the earth: for I am God, and there is none else." And hence is the language 
    of faith, Psalm 65:3, "Iniquities prevail against me: as for our 
    transgressions, you shall purge them away." It is the very nature of faith 
    to renounce all confidence in other things, and to trust in him alone for 
    the washing of the soul. Hence Paul says, Philip 3:3, "We are the 
    circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, 
    and have no confidence in the flesh." In the word of promise he is held 
    forth as "the Lamb of God taking away the sin of the world," as made 
    sanctification to us: and faith is a trust or reliance on him as such to us, 
    John 1:12. But more particularly,</p>
<p align="justify">Faith's trust on Christ is on him as crucified. Hence the 
    apostle says, 1 Corinthians 2:2, "I determined not to know anything, save 
    Jesus Christ, and him crucified." While we look on him simply as God, we see 
    his justice flaming against sin, and barring all sanctifying influences: 
    Hebrews 12:29, "For our God is a consuming fire." But looking on him as 
    God-man, by his obedience and death making satisfaction for sin, we have a 
    fit object of trust for our sanctification; for there we see a fullness of 
    merit for purging away sin, Romans 6:6, "Knowing this, that our old man is 
    crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth 
    we should hot serve sin."</p>
<p align="justify">Hence faith has a particular eye to the blood of Christ, 
    in the point of sanctification, as well as justification. Hence the apostle 
    says, Romans 3:25, "God has set him forth to be a atoning sacrifice , 
    through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission 
    of sins." And again, Hebrews 9:14, "The blood of Christ, who, through the 
    eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, shall purge your 
    conscience from dead works to serve the living God: that being the immediate 
    cause of our washing, as the blood of his sacrifice offered to God for 
    atonement, and sprinkled on us for our purification, Hebrews 12:24.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, this trust for washing, placed oh Christ crucified 
    held forth to us in the word of promise, which is that wherein the efficacy 
    of faith for sanctifying us instrumentally lies, may be taken up in these 
    four things.</p>
<p align="justify">[1.] The soul's turning its eye of expectation of 
    purification, from off all things else, and fixing it on Christ crucified. 
    Hence is the gospel invitation, Isaiah 45:22, "Look unto me, and be you 
    saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else." 
    (Hebrews) Face unto me. Secure sinners, being indifferent about holiness, 
    look no where for it; they desire it not. Awakened sinners look for it to 
    physicians of no value, such as their own endeavors, resolutions, etc. But 
    faith looks off from all creatures, means, &amp;c., unto Christ alone, for it, 
    as the woman with the bloody issue did, Mark 5:25–28, that virtue may come 
    from him for purifying.</p>
<p align="justify">[2.] Applying the promise of spiritual washing to itself: 
    2 Corinthians 7:1, "Having these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from all 
    filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." 
    The word holds forth the promise of cleansing from sin, to sinners 
    indefinitely, saying, as Ezekiel 36:25, "I will sprinkle clean water upon 
    you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your 
    idols will I cleanse you." Faith catches hold of it, and brings it home, 
    saying, as Psalm 65:3, "Iniquities prevail against me: as for our 
    transgressions, you shall purge them away." Micah 7:19, "He will turn again, 
    he will have compassion upon us: he will subdue our iniquities: and you will 
    cast all their sins into the depths of the sea." It pleads the promise, and 
    hangs by it. Particularly, it appropriates the privilege of legal freedom, 
    Romans 6:10, 11, "For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he 
    lives, he lives unto God. Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead 
    indeed unto sin; but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord:" so that 
    thereby the soul looks on itself as dead in point of right and privilege to 
    sin, Romans 6:2, "How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer 
    therein?"</p>
<p align="justify">[3.] Relying on the merit of Christ for the out-making of 
    the promise of sanctification, saying, as Psalm 51:7, "Purge me with hyssop, 
    and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." Compared 
    with 1 John 1:7, "The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin." The 
    soul sees it is a great privilege as well as a duty, and believes that God 
    will make it holy, for Christ's sake, forasmuch as he died for that very 
    end, Titus 2:14. For true faith has the same reliance on Christ for 
    sanctification as for justification, knowing that the one is the purchase of 
    the Redeemer's blood, even as the other.</p>
<p align="justify">[4.] Lastly, Acquiescing in the faithfulness of God in 
    his word, for that effect. Faith receives the word of promise for 
    sanctification; and says, with Mary, Luke 1:38, "Be it unto me according to 
    your word." The purification of the soul from sin has so many difficulties 
    about it, that the sinner truly sensible accounts it impossible in respect 
    of all created power: but since God has said, that he will do it, the soul 
    acquiesces in his word, judging him faithful who has promised, Romans 4:24; 
    Hebrews 11:11.</p>
<p align="justify">This faith or trust purifies from sin, according to the 
    scripture, and the experience of the saints: Acts 15:9, "Purifying their 
    hearts by faith." Hereto agrees the Psalmist's experience, Psalm 28:7, "The 
    Lord is my strength and my shield, my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: 
    therefore my heart greatly rejoices, and with my song will I praise him." 
    And so does that of those to whom Peter wrote, and of whom he says, 1 Peter 
    1:22, "You have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the 
    Spirit." Yes, by this trust, joy is brought into the soul, as verses 8, 9, 
    "Whom having not seen, you love; in whom though now you see him not, yet 
    believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory; receiving 
    the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls." Romans 15:13, "Now 
    the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may 
    abound in hope through the power of the Holy Spirit." And that pre-supposes 
    the purging of the soul from sin, Isaiah 33:24, "The inhabitant shall not 
    say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their 
    iniquity."</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTION. How has that trust that efficacy? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. By the appointment of God. How had the looking to 
    the brazen serpent such efficacy as to cure the stung Israelites, but by 
    God's appointment? So is the case here: John 3:14, 15, 16, "As Moses lifted 
    up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: 
    that whoever believes in him, should not perish, but have eternal life. For 
    God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever 
    believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life." The nature 
    and efficacy of saving faith may be learned in part from that of the faith 
    of miracles, they agreeing in one general kind. Matthew 9:28, 29, 30, "Jesus 
    says unto the blind men, Believe you that I am able to do this? they said 
    unto him, Yes, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your 
    faith, be it unto you. And their eyes were opened." God has made choice of 
    faith or trust for that end, and given it a word of appointment, Mark 16:16, 
    "He who believes shall be saved." And the appointment is, that on the soul's 
    so trusting in Christ, the soul shall be sanctified by the Spirit with the 
    blood, Galatians 3:2. And there is a fitness in the appointment of this as a 
    mean for,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Faith trusts the Word of God, and the faithfulness 
    of God requires that it be accomplished to them that trust it. So it is 
    secured, Romans 9:33, "Whoever believes on him, shall not be ashamed." If 
    you would have a benefit from an honest man, you cannot take a more 
    effectual way to obtain it, than, having got his word for it, to trust it, 
    plead it, and hold him to it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Christ himself with all his benefits, comes to us in 
    the word. Hence the apostle says, Romans 10:6, 7, 8, "The righteousness 
    which is of faith, speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall 
    ascend into Heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above); or, Who 
    shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the 
    dead): but what says it? The word is near you, even in your mouth, and in 
    your heart: that is the word of faith which we preach." Trusting the word is 
    the only effectual way of receiving it farther than into the ears, at least 
    as it is a promise. So receiving the word by faith, we receive Christ, and 
    consequently the purifying virtue of his blood that is in it, with himself. 
    Hence the apostle says of the Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians 2:13, "For this 
    cause also thank we God without ceasing, because when you received the Word 
    of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but 
    (as it is in truth) the Word of God, which effectually works also in you 
    that believe." And then,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) There is nothing so adapted to the end of glorifying 
    free grace, as this trust of faith is; and that is the great end of the 
    gospel: Romans 4:16, "Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; 
    to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed."</p>
<p align="justify">I shall shut up this branch with a few inferences.</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 1. That is not true faith that leaves the soul 
    still unholy, lying in the filth of sin. Unwashed sinners are unbelievers 
    certainly: Titus 1:15, "Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them 
    that are defiled, and unbelieving, is nothing pure; but even their mind and 
    conscience is defiled." In vain will you please yourselves with a conceit of 
    your believing in Christ, while your pretended faith brings in no 
    sanctifying influences into your souls: James 2:14, "What does it profit, 
    though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?" True 
    faith, according to the scripture, has a double effect.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Within, faith purifies the heart, Acts 15:9, and 
    makes it evangelically clean, Psalm 24:3, 4. It breaks the reigning power of 
    lusts within, maintains a combat against their broken forces, sets the soul 
    to approve itself to God in the inner man, where no eye sees, and longs for 
    and presses toward perfection.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Without, faith works by love, in all duties of 
    piety towards God, and justice and mercy towards our neighbor: Galatians 
    5:6, "For in Jesus Christ, neither circumcision avails anything, nor 
    uncircumcision, but faith which works by love." It is a principle within, 
    that casts abroad its cleansing efficacy into the life, purifying men's 
    words and actions.</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 2. Then whoever are really washed from their 
    sins, as they will be sure to use all means of holiness, yet they will be 
    carried beyond them all to Christ for it. They will be conscientious in the 
    practice of holy duties, and so go beyond the profane and careless; and yet 
    they will not rest in them, but quit them all in point of confidence when 
    they have done, and so go beyond hypocrites: "For," says the apostle, 
    Philippians 3:3, "we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, 
    and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh." This is 
    the little further that the spouse went, Canticles 3:4. and so found her 
    beloved.</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 3. Lastly, The only true way to be holy, is to 
    believe in Christ. This is the way that all the members of Christ are 
    sanctified; they are sanctified in him, 1 Corinthians 1:2, through faith, 
    Acts 26:18. And there is no true holiness in subjects capable of faith, 
    without it: for says Christ, John 15:5, "Without me you can do nothing." So 
    if the soul be brought to faith in Christ, it will undoubtedly be made holy: 
    if it be not, all other means of washing of a person will be but washing a 
    black man, who will never become white for them all.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus far of those things which Christ uses more 
    immediately for washing sinners.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, There are other means which Christ uses for 
    that purpose, more mediately: of which briefly.</p>
<p align="justify">First, Christ washes sinners by the word, Ephesians 5:26. 
    Hence Christ says of his disciples, John 15:3, "Now you are clean through 
    the word which I have spoken unto you." And hence he prays to his Father, 
    John 17:17, "Sanctify them through your truth: your word is truth." The word 
    written, read, and preached, is the great external mean of washing sinners; 
    and is effectual for that end by the energy of the Spirit, being received by 
    faith. The use of the word to the washing of the sinner lies in these things 
    following.</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is the glass wherein the filthy sinner discerns his 
    spots and filthiness. The word of the law particularly is that glass: Romans 
    3:20, "For by the law is the knowledge of sin." It represents to men the 
    sinfulness of their nature, hearts, and lives: and when Christ comes to wash 
    a sinner, he holds that glass to his eyes to convince him of sin, by the 
    Spirit. Therefore the Psalmist recommends it to young men, Psalm 119:9, 
    "With which shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto 
    according to your word." And they that look not into the word for this end, 
    care not for washing.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a spur to washing, an external impulsive cause, 
    by the strong motives whereby it presses the sinner to wash. Here the law 
    presses him by its threatenings and curses against the unclean; the gospel 
    presses with the possibility, excellency, and unspeakable advantage of 
    washing.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is the key that sets open the fountain for washing 
    in, Zechariah 13:1, "In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the 
    house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin, and for 
    impurity." It is opened by the preaching of the gospel; which shows sinners, 
    that whatever be their pollution, they are welcome to it. The voice of 
    Christ in the gospel is, "Behold me," Isaiah 65:1, that is, "Here I am." 
    Thereby our Lord unlocks his treasures, laying them open to the view of 
    sinners.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is the vehicle of the blood and Spirit of Christ, 
    whereby sinners may be washed, receiving the word by faith, Romans 10:6, 7, 
    8, forfeited. John 6:63, "It is the spirit that quickens, the flesh profits 
    nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are 
    life." The gospel is therefore called "the ministration of the Spirit, and 
    righteousness," 2 Corinthians 3 inasmuch as thereby Christ communicates his 
    Spirit to sinners, and brings righteousness to them. Hence receiving the 
    word by faith, the soul is cast into the mold of it, Romans 6:17; for it is 
    able to save the soul, James 1:21, and works effectually in it, 1 
    Thessalonians 2:13. to the cleansing of the soul, John 15:3, "Now you are 
    clean through the word which I have spoken unto you."</p>
<p align="justify">I shall shut up this branch also with a few inferences.</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 1. Saints and sinners need the word; forasmuch 
    as they are both defiled, and need washing; the one washing to be begun on 
    them, and the other to be carried on. And they that can live contented 
    without it, are content to lie still in their filthiness; and will need no 
    more to ruin them, but to get their will.</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 2. They have an enmity at the word, appearing 
    in their aversion to dip into it, and neglect of it, are neither washed, nor 
    desire to be washed: Job 21:14, "Therefore they say unto God, Depart from 
    us; for we desire not the knowledge of your ways." The reason of their 
    enmity against it is, their love to their lusts, to which it is an enemy: 
    as, on the contrary, they whose hearts are turned against sin, are turned 
    towards the word, as a mean for purging it away: John 3:20, 21, "For every 
    one that does evil, hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his 
    deeds should be reproved. But he who does truth, comes to the light, that 
    his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God."</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 3. Their soul's case is very hopeless, who get 
    no good of the word: and these are all such who get no conviction by it, or 
    are not stirred up by it to seek to be purged from their filthiness, who are 
    not pointed to Christ as the only laver, and never partake of his blood and 
    Spirit, by it. These are they on whom the great mean of washing from sin is 
    ineffectual; of whom the Lord may justly say, as Ezekiel 24:13, "In your 
    filthiness is lewedness: because I have purged you, and you were not purged, 
    you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more, until I have caused 
    my fury to rest upon you."</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 4. Lastly, They do not believe the word, who 
    are not cleansed in heart and life thereby; for (as the apostle says of the 
    Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians 2:13,) "When you received the Word of God 
    which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it is 
    in truth) the Word of God, which effectually works also in you that 
    believe." If the word were received by faith, it could not miss to be 
    sanctifying: but beholding the unholiness of men, we may cry out, as Isaiah 
    53:1, "Who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord 
    revealed?" The word preached is not truly believed, therefore it brings not 
    forth fruit.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Christ washes sinners by the sacraments, 
    Ephesians 5:26. Hence baptism is said to save us, 1 Peter 3:21. The 
    sacraments are external means of spiritual washing, and are made effectual 
    by the Spirit, being received by faith; but no otherwise in subjects capable 
    of believing; for God has not communicated the virtue of sanctifying to the 
    elements as to natural causes which work necessarily, 1 Peter 3:21.</p>
<p align="justify">The use of the sacraments to the washing of sinners lies 
    here.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The sacraments point out to us the laver wherein we 
    may be washed, as being representing signs of Christ with his sanctifying 
    blood. Hence the apostle says, 1 Corinthians 10:16, "The cup of blessing 
    which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread 
    which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?" They set the 
    laver as it were before our eyes, and call us to think of it, and our need 
    thereof. Therein Christ is as it were crucified before our eye, his blood 
    springing forth for our washing.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The sacraments confirm our right in it, and our 
    welcome to it, as seals. Hence the apostle says concerning Abraham, Romans 
    4:11, "He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of 
    faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of 
    all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness 
    might be imputed unto them also." The blood of Christ is most precious; but 
    there is a grant of it made to us in the word, which is our charter, and the 
    sacraments se al it. The word says, John 3:16, "God so loved the world, that 
    he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him, should not 
    perish, but have everlasting life:" the sacraments seal it, that so we may 
    be excited and encouraged to come boldly, and make use of it for our 
    sanctification.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The sacraments present, exhibit, and apply it to us 
    who believe, 1 Corinthians 11:24. As by earth and stone delivered to a man 
    upon a legal right, he is possessed of the house or land: so, by the 
    sacraments received by faith, Christ and all his benefits are applied to us, 
    for our cleansing.</p>
<p align="justify">An inference shall shut up this branch.</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE. Hence we may try, whether the sacraments be 
    effectual to us, or not; whether we have believingly received them or not. 
    While people are never the more holy, for all the sacraments they receive, 
    the more the worse, their disease is the more confirmed their filthiness is 
    the more fixed on them. But when they stir up the soul to an usemaking of 
    Christ for sanctification, and men get a cubit added to their spiritual 
    stature, it is a good sign.</p>
<p align="justify">Thirdly, and Lastly, Christ washes sinners by 
    afflictions. Hence the prophet says, Isaiah 27:9, "By this therefore shall 
    the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his 
    sin." They also are but external means, in the hand of the Spirit, and 
    cannot of themselves purify. But the Spirit makes use of them for cleansing 
    sinners. There are two ways of purging filthiness, by water, and by fire; as 
    we learn from Isaiah 4:4, "When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of 
    the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the 
    midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning." 
    Afflictions are God's fire for that end. Their use in the washing is 
    six-fold.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Afflictions are memorials of ours in, and so puts us 
    in mind to look back on our defilements; as they were to Joseph's brethren, 
    when they said, as Genesis 42:21, "We are truly guilty concerning our 
    brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us; and we 
    would not hear: therefore is this distress come upon us." The prosperous 
    sinner wallows at ease in his filthiness; but when God lays his afflicting 
    hand on him, the sharper it is, conscience is readily the more awakened out 
    of its sleep. And it will readily read the sin, out of the punishment.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Afflictions are a glass, wherein one sees the 
    loathsomeness of sin in the sight of God. While the sinner prospers in his 
    course, he cannot think that God is sore displeased at it; as the Lord 
    himself says unto the sinner, Psalm 50:21, "These things have you done, and 
    I kept silence: you thought that I was altogether such a one as yourself." 
    But affliction is such a token of God's displeasure against sin, that when 
    it comes, the sinner alters his thoughts; sees its loathsomeness before God, 
    and therefore loathsome in itself; which makes him anxious to be washed.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Afflictions are a fire that melt off the paint, and 
    deface the beauty of the defiling objects in the world. Hence says the Lord 
    unto Israel, Jeremiah 2:36, 37, "Why do you gad about so much to change your 
    way? you also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria. 
    Yes, you shall go forth from him, and your hands upon your head: for the 
    Lord has rejected your confidences, and you shall not prosper in them." 
    Where was the excellency of the thirty pieces when God's hand was lifted up 
    against Judas for them? The beauty of former lusts melts away, when a man is 
    laid on a sick-bed: and the bewitching creature then loses all its charms.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Afflictions are a bridle whereby men are restrained 
    from defiling themselves more, and are brought to a stand in a defiling 
    course. Hence the Lord says unto Israel, Hosea 2:6, "Behold, I will hedge up 
    your way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths." 
    They serve to take off the edge of corrupt affections, and make them to 
    languish; whereby the sinner becomes more considerate, and pliable to 
    counsel from the word.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Afflictions are occasional causes of sinners thinking 
    of and going to the fountain to wash. Hence the Lord says of Israel, Hosea 
    5:15, "I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge their 
    offence, and seek my face: in their afflictions they will seek me early." 
    How many are there to whom afflictions have been the blessed means and 
    occasions of their turning serious? Such a rod they met with, or they had 
    gone on like the wild donkey upon the mountains, snuffing up the wind.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lastly, Afflictions are a sharp wind to blow up the 
    fire of grace where it is, and particularly to excite faith, whereby the 
    soul is washed. Hence the spouse prays, Canticles 4:16, "Awake, O 
    north-wind, and come, you south, blow upon my garden, that the spices 
    thereof may flow out." In prosperity people can fetch in their comfort by 
    sense; but in afflictions, when created streams are dried up, they must 
    fetch it in by faith, or else want it.</p>
<p align="justify">Two inferences shall conclude this branch.</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 1. Let this cause us to take afflictions 
    kindly; since they are means by which Christ washes us. Though the water be 
    cold and piercing, yet we endure it, that we may get our hands made clean. 
    Though medicines sicken us, we blame not the physician, because they are for 
    our health. Why should we be angry at our God afflicting us, since the fruit 
    designed is to purge away sin?</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 2. Let us, in all our afflictions, seek 
    purification from our sin, and know they are not effectual unless they have 
    a sanctifying efficacy on us. They are indeed of the nature of fire, first 
    causing the scum to come above, but next throwing it off. They do discover 
    much of the corruption of the heart, that otherwise would be latent: but 
    then if they humble the soul under a sense of sinfulness, and send it anew 
    to Christ for purging of the nature, they are not in vain.</p>
<p align="justify">I shall now proceed to the second general head proposed, 
    namely,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To consider the unwashed or unsanctified sinner's 
    having no part with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">In discussing this head, I shall show,</p>
<p align="justify">1. What the unwashed sinner's having no part with Christ 
    supposes; and,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Wherein it lies.</p>
<p align="justify">First, We shall show what the unwashed sinner's having no 
    part with Christ supposes. It supposes,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That Christ himself is happy. He is not only happy as 
    he is God, Romans 9:5, who is therefore styled "God blessed forever;" but as 
    he is Mediator, the head of the body, the church. Hence it is said of him, 
    Psalm 72:17, "Men shall be blessed in him, all nations shall call him 
    blessed." All mankind were brought to misery and ruin by Adam's fall: but 
    the man Christ was an exception from that rule. He was happy from the moment 
    of the incarnation, all along, notwithstanding what he suffered: and from 
    his resurrection and ascension his happiness was completed: Philippians 2:9, 
    "Wherefore God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is 
    above every name." Hebrews 10:13, "From henceforth expecting until his 
    enemies be made his footstool." There are two things wherein Christ is 
    completely happy.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, In having fully done the work he undertook to do. 
    Hence he says to his Father, John 17:4, "I have glorified you on the earth: 
    I have finished the work which you gave me to do." He had a great work to 
    do, for the glory of his Father, and the salvation of sinners. It was the 
    hardest work that ever was taken in hand. All hardships from Heaven, earth, 
    and Hell, met together upon him; and his work was to go through them all in 
    a course of perfect obedience. And now it is done; he was born holy, lived 
    righteous, satisfied completely by his death: now he is got to the joy set 
    before him: Romans 6:9, "Christ being raised from the dead, dies no more; 
    death has no more dominion over him." Revelation 3:21, "To him that 
    overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, 
    and am set down with my Father in his throne."</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, In having received the reward of his work. Our 
    Lord, "for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the 
    shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God," Hebrews 
    12:2. Never was there such a reward of work, as Christ has received; it 
    bears proportion to the work, which was of infinite value. All the promises 
    of the covenant, whether respecting himself, or his people, are now in his 
    hand. They are won by him, and he is put in possession of the things 
    promised, which make an inexhaustible treasure. Hence the apostle, 
    (Ephesians 3:8.) speaks of "the unsearchable riches of Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">2. There is enough in him to make others happy too: 
    Colossians 1:19, "For it pleased the Father, that in him should all fullness 
    dwell." There is a fullness of a fountain in him, whereby others may be 
    supplied from him, may have part with him, and yet he have no lack. The 
    first Adam was a spring of ruin to all his posterity: but the gospel points 
    out Christ the second Adam as a spring of happiness for wretched sinners.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Sinners may have part with Christ in his fullness; it 
    is lodged in him to be communicated. Hence our Lord himself says, Matthew 
    11:27, 28, "All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knows 
    the Son but the Father: neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and 
    he to whoever the Son will reveal him. Come unto me, all you that labor, and 
    are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." He is the bowl on the top of the 
    candlestick, (Zechariah 4:2.) the immediate receptacle of the oil, from 
    whence it is conveyed to the seven lamps. Joseph was sent to Egypt, and 
    exalted there, to provide for Jacob's family in the dearth: so Christ is 
    great Steward of Heaven, for the behalf of poor sinners; that he having all 
    in his hand, they may be happy in having part with him.</p>
<p align="justify">4. All that are sanctified are happy in having part with 
    Christ: Colossians 2:9, 10, "For in him dwells all the fullness of the 
    Godhead bodily. And you are complete in him." They have part in his work, by 
    imputation; even as they had part with Adam in his sin: Romans 5:19, "For as 
    by one man's disobedience many were made sinners: so by the obedience of 
    one, shall many be made righteous." They have part in his reward, by a real 
    communication thereof to them; even as they had part with Adam in the 
    corruption of his nature: John 1:16, "And of his fullness have all we 
    received, and grace for grace." 1 Corinthians 15:22, "For as in Adam all 
    die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." This, it is true, is but 
    imperfect as yet; but it is so begun that it will undoubtedly be perfected. 
    But such as it is, their sanctification is not the cause of it, but it is 
    the cause of their sanctification. This appears from 1 John 1:3, 7, "That 
    which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that you also may have 
    fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with 
    his Son Jesus Christ. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we 
    have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son 
    cleanses us from all sin."</p>
<p align="justify">5. Lastly, Unholy sinners are miserable in the want of 
    part with Christ. They are "without Christ, being aliens from the 
    commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having 
    no hope, and without God in the world," Ephesians 2:12. Therefore this 
    struck Peter, when he saw how deep it drew: for he said, Acts 4:12, "Neither 
    is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven 
    given among men whereby we must be saved." It is true, all that hear the 
    gospel are externally called to the fellowship of his Son: but most men love 
    the fellowship of the world lying in wickedness, and will not take part with 
    Christ. So they are without it, though it lies open to them: and to each one 
    of them may be said what Peter said to Simon Magus, Acts 8:21, "You have 
    neither part nor lot in this matter: for your heart is not right in the 
    sight of God." Meanwhile their unholiness is not the thing that bars them 
    from having part with Christ; but their want of part with Christ is that 
    whereby they keep themselves unholy.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, I shall show wherein the unwashed sinner's 
    having no part with Christ does lie or consist. This will appear, with the 
    misery of the case, in taking a view, 1. Of Christ's work; and, 2. Of his 
    reward; in neither of which the unholy have part with him.</p>
<p align="justify">First, Christ is happy, in that he has done out the work 
    he undertook for the salvation of sinners: and all that are his have part 
    with him therein; it is imputed to them, as if they had done it, Galatians 
    2:20. And,</p>
<p align="justify">1. He has been born holy, and answered the demand of the 
    law for holiness of nature, by his bringing a holy human nature into the 
    world with him, as a public person. Hence in Luke 1:35, he is called "that 
    holy thing born." Hebrews 7:26, "For such an high priest became us, who is 
    holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners." So that demand of the 
    law for salvation for all that are his, is answered; for in Colossians 2:10, 
    11, they are said to be complete in him; and to be circumsised in him. The 
    law cannot stop their salvation for want of a perfectly holy nature; for 
    they have part with him, in the holiness of his nature, and that holy nature 
    is communicated to them.</p>
<p align="justify">But unholy sinners have no part with Christ in this 
    matter: the holiness of Christ's nature is not imputed to them, or reckoned 
    theirs. There is a holy birth of the second Adam, to take away the guilt of 
    sin that we are born in: but such as are not washed by Christ from their 
    sin, have no share in it.</p>
<p align="justify">The evidence of this is, that whoever have part in the 
    holiness of Christ's birth by imputation, are really born again in their own 
    persons: because Christ's holy birth is the efficient meritorious cause of 
    the new birth of his members. Hence the apostle says, 2 Corinthians 5:17, 
    "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away, 
    behold, all things are become new." Colossians 2:11, "In whom also you are 
    circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the 
    body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ." Now, the 
    unholy are not born again; therefore they have no part with Christ in his 
    holy birth: and so they have nothing to answer the law's demand for holiness 
    of nature.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ has lived a righteous life, in perfect 
    obedience to the law's commands: Philip. 2:8, "He became obedient unto 
    death." He did it as a public person: and all his have part with him in it; 
    they obeyed in Christ, as they sinned in Adam, Romans 8:3, 4, "For what the 
    law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own 
    Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh; 
    that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not 
    after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Hence are these epithets of the 
    church, undefiled, without spot, complete in him. So the law's demand of 
    obedience, as the condition of life, is answered as to them: their part in 
    Christ's obedience answers it fully.</p>
<p align="justify">But the unholy have no part with Christ in the obedience 
    of his life. For Christ's obedience being meritorious of our sanctification, 
    the want of the latter is a plain evidence of no part in the former; and 
    that upon the ground of justice, which requires the delivering of the thing 
    purchased, upon the application of the price, Romans 8:1–4. If you have 
    obeyed legally in Christ, you obey really in your own persons; for Christ's 
    obedience has a conforming virtue in those to whom it is imputed, Romans 
    8:29, "For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestine to be conformed to 
    the image of his Son." 1 John 2:6, "He who says he abides in him, ought 
    himself also so to walk, even as he walked." Inherent righteousness 
    necessarily follows imputed righteousness. An unholy life argues no part in 
    the holiness of Christ's life: therefore there is a bar between Heaven and 
    the unholy.</p>
<p align="justify">3. He has suffered, to the full satisfaction of the law 
    in its threatening and curse for sin, Philip. 2:8, "He humbled himself, and 
    became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Galatians 3:13, 
    "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for 
    us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree." And Christ 
    suffering as a public person, all that are his suffered in him, having part 
    with him in his sufferings. They were legally crucified with him, Galatians 
    2:20, died with him, Romans 6:10, 11, and were buried with him, Colossians 
    2:12. So the law's demand of satisfaction is answered for them, since they 
    have part with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">But the unholy have no part with Christ in his 
    sufferings. An undeniable evidence whereof is their not being conformed to 
    him in his death, Philip. 3:10. The death of Christ will infallibly prove 
    the death of sin, when one has part with Christ in it; Romans 6:6, "Knowing 
    this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be 
    destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin." Galatians 5:24, "They 
    that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts." 
    As sure as Christ died for the sins of the elect, they will die to sin that 
    have communion with him in it: for as death made its way from the members to 
    the head, until it laid him in the grave; so the merit of his death will 
    make its way from the head to them to their sanctification. So that demand 
    of the law lies on their heads unanswered.</p>
<p align="justify">4. He has brought in everlasting righteousness. In what 
    he was, did, and suffered, he fully satisfied what the law had to demand, 
    coming up, as a public person, to an exact conformity thereto. This is the 
    righteousness he has wrought, sufficient to cover every sinner in the sight 
    of God, and to render him accepted as righteous. All that are his have part 
    with him in it, Psalm 45:13; Canticles 6:10; Revelation 3:18. So they that 
    have a righteousness that is law-biding.</p>
<p align="justify">But the unholy have no part with him in it. For wherever 
    righteousness imputed is on any man, inherent holiness is in him. By the 
    former satisfying the law, the strength of sin is taken away: so that the 
    man cannot be living in sin as formerly. Hence the, apostle says, Romans 
    6:2, "How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, Christ has received the reward of his work; and 
    so he as an inexhaustible treasure; and all that are his have part with him 
    is it.</p>
<p align="justify">Christ is risen again from the dead. By the authority of 
    the Father he is discharged from the grave; death is never to seize him 
    more: Acts 2:24, "God raised him up, having loosed the pains of death: 
    because it was not possible that he should be held of it." And all his have 
    part with him in his Resurrection: Ephesians 2:6, "God has raised us up 
    together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: 
    forasmuch as he rose as a public person. But the unholy have no part with 
    him in his resurrection. For,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, They are still dead in their sins, while they live 
    in them. Where is there part then in Christ's resurrection? They that have 
    part with him are risen with him, risen by virtue of his resurrection; the 
    power of the resurrection of the head raising the members from death in sin, 
    Colossians 2:12; and 3:1. Alas! the grave-clothes of the sins of the flesh, 
    which you are not putting off, but keeping on, and the ties whereof are 
    still as fast upon you as ever, speak you destitute of any part with Christ 
    in this matter.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, They are still members of the congregation of the 
    dead, Ephesians 2:1, 2, 3. When our Lord rose, he left the congregation of 
    the dead in their graves; yes, he conversed not with the world thereafter, 
    as before his death. And so, whenever a soul gets part with Christ, it 
    leaves the world lying in wickedness, comes out from among them, and walks 
    no more according to the course of this world. Hence the apostle says, 
    Romans 6:4, 5, "We are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as 
    Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we 
    also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in 
    the likeness of his death; we shall be also in the likeness of his 
    resurrection." What shadow of ground have they then to pretend to a part 
    with him, that are not walking in newness of life, but just according to the 
    course of the world.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ is now ascended up into glory, where he sits at 
    the Father's right hand, Mark 16:19. He ascended into it, as a public 
    person, to take possession of it for us, Hebrews 6:20. And all his have part 
    with him in it, as the members of the glory of the head: Ephesians 2:6, "God 
    has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in 
    Christ Jesus."</p>
<p align="justify">But the unholy have no part with him in it. For,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, They are yet lying in the filth of their natural 
    state, through original and actual sin, Psalm 14:3; all over defiled, Titus 
    1:15. They may have worldly glory, outside glory, such as arises from 
    bravery, wealth, and honor; yes they may glory in wickedness, that is really 
    their shame. But there is no heavenly glory or any, but by sanctifying 
    grace, 2 Corinthians 3:18; that only makes a glorious inside, Psalm 45:13; 
    in so far as thereby the purity of the divine image is on the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Neither is their heart there, nor are they making 
    forward to it. Our Lord tells us, Matthew 6:21, that "where the treasure is, 
    there will the heart be also." And therefore the apostle urges, Colossians 
    3:1, 2, to "seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the 
    right hand of God; to set our affection on things above, not on things on 
    the earth." What part then have they with Christ in his glory, whose 
    affections are not on things above, but on the earth, Philippians 3:19, "who 
    mind earthly things?" They carry themselves as natives of the world, not as 
    pilgrims in it. Their great aim is, to compass designs of worldly profits 
    and pleasures, but not to be fitted for glory, 1 John 3:3.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Christ has the Spirit of life and holiness dwelling in 
    him, as the head of his body mystical. So the Spirit of life is in him, to 
    be communicated; and it is the purchase of his death, Revelation 3:1, "He 
    has the seven Spirits; seven Spirits answerable to the seven golden 
    candlesticks; enough to quicken and actuate them all. Hence he is said to 
    quicken, John 5:21, 26. And all his have part with him therein, Philip. 2:1. 
    The same Spirit that is in the head, is in the members too, in so much that 
    "the Spirit of God dwells in them; and if any man have not the Spirit of 
    Christ he is none of his."</p>
<p align="justify">But the unholy have no part with him in his Spirit For,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, He is the holy Spirit, "the Spirit of holiness," 
    Romans 1:4; so called not only from the work of sanctification ascribed 
    peculiarly to him, but from the holiness of his nature, in opposition to the 
    unclean spirit, Mark 3:29, 30, to attest all the works of God without 
    himself, whereof he is the immediate worker, to be holy. So that in whoever 
    he dwells, and actuates, they must needs be made holy: Romans 8:2, "For the 
    law of the Spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, has made them free from the law 
    of sin and death." Since then the unholy are under the law of sin as the 
    subjects thereof, and under the law of spiritual death, they have no part 
    with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, They have the spirit of the world in them, 
    conforming them to the world, in their frame of heart, way, and walk, 1 John 
    4:4. It is an unclean, unholy spirit, whereby they cannot relish nor favor 
    the holy things of God: but things that are fleshy, sensual, carnal, and 
    earthly, Jude verse 19; not without a secret enmity at true holiness, Romans 
    8:7, and cannot hold on in the way of God, as Caleb did, Numbers 14:24.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, They live in the state wherein Adam left them, 
    without a saving change. 1 Corinthians 15:45, Adam was made "a living soul," 
    but Christ "a quickening spirit." What men derive from Adam, they have; a 
    natural life, a life of reason, gifts of knowledge, etc. But what men derive 
    from Christ, they have not; they are not quickened by him with the Spirit of 
    life unto God. But if they had part with Christ, they would be spiritually 
    quickened souls; as sure as having part with Adam, they are living souls.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is a fullness of grace in the man Christ: 
    Colossians 1:19, "For it pleased the Father, that in him should all fullness 
    dwell." John 1:14, "The Word was full of grace and truth." Grace is given 
    him without measure, John 3:4; and all that are his partake with him in it, 
    it being in him as in the storehouse; it is so poured on him as the head, 
    that it runs down to the skirts of his garment, John 1:16.</p>
<p align="justify">But the unholy have no part with him in his grace. For,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, They are not partakers of the divine nature, that 
    new nature which is derived from Christ, by the communication of grace from 
    him by the Spirit into his mystical members, whereby they escape the 
    corruption of the world, 2 Peter 1:4. Instead of that, the old nature reigns 
    in them, which is enmity against God, and serious religion. The old man with 
    his deeds is still in his vigor, has not yet got his deadly wound.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Whatever good or grace may seem to be in them, it 
    is but in someone or few particulars. There are still several black buts in 
    their religion; they never make thorough work of it, Psalm 119:6, They have 
    not respect unto all God's commandments. For they are never made new 
    creatures; though some things, yet never are all things become new with 
    them: An evidence that they have no part in the grace of Christ; for then 
    should they have grace for grace.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Hence they do not bear Christ's image: they are not 
    like him, in the set of their spirit, and tenor of their walk: 1 John 2:6, 
    "For he who says he abides in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he 
    walked." They look like the old Adam, sinful, sensual, and averse from God. 
    But O how unlike the holy crucified Jesus, and how quite unconcerned to be 
    like him, their own consciences bear witness. But the having part with 
    Christ makes a person like him.</p>
<p align="justify">5 Lastly, Christ is anointed of the Father with the 
    Spirit to be the Prophet, Priest, and King of his church. Hence he says 
    himself, Isaiah 61:1. "The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the 
    Lord has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek, he has sent me to 
    bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captive, and the 
    opening of the prison to them that are bound." And the apostle Peter says, 
    Acts 10:38, that "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit, and 
    with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed 
    of the devil: for God was with him." This is the honor put on him, to bear 
    these offices, signified by his names Messiah and Christ, that is, anointed. 
    And as he is Christ, all that are his are Christians, anointed with the same 
    Spirit, Psalm 45:7, having part with him in his offices.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Christ is a prophet: and all that are his, have part 
    with him in his prophetic office, are prophets too, Psalm 105:15. They are 
    let into the knowledge of the things of God by the Spirit. Hence the apostle 
    says, 1 John 2:20, 27, "But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you 
    know all things. But the anointing which you have received of him, abides in 
    you: and you need not that any man teach you: But, as the same anointing 
    teaches you of all things, and is truth and is no lie: and even as it has 
    taught you, you shall abide in him." They are on the secret of Heaven: For 
    (Psalm 25:14,) "the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him: and he 
    will show them his covenant," Matthew 11:25. And they teach them to others 
    too, though they cannot make them effectual. Hence David says, Psalm 51:13, 
    "I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners shall be converted unto 
    you." Not only ministers, but every true Christian has this office; the 
    former in a public, the latter in a private captivity, Philippians 2:15, 16.</p>
<p align="justify">But the unholy have no part with him in his prophetic 
    office.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They are not illuminated by the Spirit of holiness, 
    savingly to know the things of God, 1 Corinthians 2:12, 14. They may be 
    taught by men, but are not taught of God: they may know the literal sense of 
    the words of the gospel; but the things thereof in their suitableness to the 
    divine perfections and sinner's case, are are hidden from them, Matthew 
    11:25. They never get into the secret of religion.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Neither do they by the Spirit of holiness enlighten 
    the world. Being dark themselves, they darken the world by their ungodly, 
    profane, or formal lives. Most of them see no tie on them to be their 
    brother's keeper. Such as teach others the things of God, do it by a gift, 
    for their own glory; not by the Spirit, out of love to Christ and his glory. 
    So they have no part with him in his prophetic office.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, He is a Priest: and all his have part with him in 
    that venerable office. They are priests too, 1 Peter 2:9, a royal 
    priesthood: Revelation 1:6, priests unto God. They are consecrated to God to 
    serve him in his spiritual temple, in their robes of Christ's imputed 
    righteousness and inherent holiness. They offer sacrifices of thanksgiving 
    unto God, which are accepted of God through Christ, their only altar. They 
    offer to him themselves, Romans 12:1, their service to him in acts of 
    worship and duty, Hebrews 13:15; Acts 10:4, and in suffering or bearing the 
    cross, Philip. 2:17; 2 Timothy 4:6.</p>
<p align="justify">But the unholy have no part with Christ in his priestly 
    office.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) They are not of the line, not descended from our 
    great High Priest, as born of his Spirit. They were never truly consecrated, 
    or made holy persons; they are destitute of imputed and implanted 
    righteousness: they are wholly polluted and defiled, as being of the world 
    lying in wickedness: so if they pretend to the spiritual priesthood, they 
    will be, as polluted, put from it.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) They do not, nor cannot offer acceptable sacrifices 
    to God. They never offer themselves to God as a sacrifice, but to the world 
    and their lusts. If they offer prayers or other services to him, they never 
    offer them on the right altar, Christ. Hence they, and all they do, even 
    their best things, are an abomination, Proverbs 28:9.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Christ is a King: and all his have part with him 
    in that honorable office. They are kings too, Revelation 1:6, "Kings unto 
    God." They have the right of dominion over their spiritual enemies, the rule 
    of their own spirits governing themselves by the laws of Christ, and the 
    lordship of the world, Romans 4:13; and they are heirs of the kingdom of 
    Heaven. They do not yet peaceably possess their kingdom; the rebels and 
    their open enemies are making constant wars against them; but they do 
    overcome, and are "more than conquerors, through him that loved them," 1 
    John 4:4; Romans 8:37.</p>
<p align="justify">But the unholy have no part with Christ in his kingly 
    office.</p>
<p align="justify">They are servants and slaves to sin and Satan, Romans 
    6:16. They are under the power of Satan, Acts 26:18; led captive at his 
    will, 2 Timothy 2:26. They have no gracious management of their own spirits, 
    Proverbs 25:28. They are the servants of corruption; they can neither think 
    nor do any service acceptable to God.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>THE APPLICATION</b></p>
<p align="justify">I shut up all with some practical inferences.</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 1. Holiness is absolutely necessary to 
    happiness: for (Hebrews 12:14,) "without holiness no man shall see the 
    Lord." You may be either poor or rich, sick or whole, and yet be happy. But 
    if you be not holy, you are miserable; for you have no part with Christ, 
    And, Acts 4:12, "There is no salvation in any other: for there is none other 
    name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved." It is 
    astonishing to think, how easy many that hear the gospel are about holiness; 
    they are in no concern whether they be holy or not. They would not have 
    people to take them for saints; nay, holy people are a jest with them. There 
    is no accounting for this any other way but that holiness is rare in the 
    world, and they have no mind to be singular, nor to distinguish themselves 
    from "the world lying in wickedness."</p>
<p align="justify">But consider these four things.</p>
<p align="justify">1. God is holy. The God that made you is holy by 
    necessity of nature; he is so holy that he cannot be but holy. If God is 
    necessarily holy, he cannot but hate unholiness; because be cannot but love 
    his own image, and hate what is contrary to his nature: therefore he cannot 
    but hate your unholiness, and for it hate you who are unholy. And what we 
    hate as contrary to our nature, we seek to destroy. Now, consider the misery 
    of being objects of God's hatred and aversion, and what makes you so; and 
    you will see the necessity of your being holy, 1 Peter 1:16, "Be you holy," 
    says the Lord, "for I am holy."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ our Savior is holy. As he is God, he is "the 
    holy One of Israel;" as he is man, he is "that holy thing," Luke 1:35. Jesus 
    is called "the holy One;" the very devils owned him to be so, Mark 1:24. The 
    very end of his being Jesus, was to make men holy, Matthew 1:21, "You shall 
    call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins." He came 
    to destroy the works of the devil, he died to redeem sinners from their 
    sins, Titus 2:14. What part then can you possibly imagine yourselves to have 
    in him, while you continue unholy?</p>
<p align="justify">3. The body of Christ is holy; they that belong to him, 
    the company of the saved, Ephesians 5:25, 26. The devil is the God of this 
    world; his subjects are the world lying in wickedness. Out of them Christ 
    raises his kingdom, and his subjects are all holy, Galatians 4:4; Revelation 
    19:14. It is their distinguishing badge from those that belong to Satan, 
    that agrees to them all, and to them only, 2 Timothy 2:19. So that if you 
    are not holy, you belong not to Christ, but to Satan.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Heaven is holy; it is a holy state, a holy place, 
    where no unholy thing can enter, Revelation 21:27. As to the dogs and swine, 
    their place will be without, Revelation 21:15, that is, the unholy, who "go 
    with the dog to the vomit, and with the sow that was washed to the wallowing 
    in the mire," shall be cast out from the supper of the saints in glory into 
    outer darkness, Matthew 8:12.</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 2. There is no true holiness, but in communion 
    with Christ. Men may have a show and semblance of holiness, without union 
    and communion with Christ. But real holiness acceptable to God, no man 
    attains but in Christ, being sanctified only with his blood, by his Spirit, 
    through faith; made new creatures after his image, by participation of the 
    all-fullness of grace in him, as at large declared, 1 Corinthians 1:2; 
    Ephesians 2:10; 1 Peter 1:2; Acts 26:18.</p>
<p align="justify">And therefore holiness is quite another thing, than,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Common civility. A man may be civil, not rude, but 
    courteous, discreet, and obliging in his conversation; and yet be a stranger 
    to holiness. This was the case of the young man, of whom, "when Jesus saw 
    that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, You are not far from the 
    kingdom of God," Mark 12:34. There are some rude persons that bear the 
    devil's mark on their foreheads, who behave themselves neither according to 
    the rules of grace nor good manners: some professors that affect and pride 
    themselves in rudeness, regarding no body, nor their offence, but only to 
    please themselves. Such would do well to consider, whether that be 
    consistent with real holiness or not. The reason of the doubt, is the second 
    great command of the law, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." 
    Howbeit, civility is not holiness, though a part of the matter of it.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Morality, whether we understand by it common honesty 
    in dealings in the world; or a conformity to the letter of the law, which 
    makes a blameless outward conversation, and goes under the name of moral 
    virtue, but has no relation to Christ and his Spirit. Men may have all this, 
    and not be holy; as had the Pharisee, Luke 18:11, who "stood and prayed thus 
    with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, 
    extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican." This was also 
    the case of Paul, Philippians 3:6, "Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; 
    touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless." These fruits are 
    in many like the apples of Sodom, which are fair to look at, but when 
    handled fall to ashes.</p>
<p align="justify">3. A form of godliness, 2 Timothy 3:5. There may be the 
    going the round of the external duties of religion, where there is no 
    holiness: for these may be done by them that are without Christ, Luke 18:12; 
    Matthew 5:20; Isaiah 58:2, 3; though many place all their religion in these 
    things, as if they pray, communicate, etc. to be concerned no more to be 
    holy.</p>
<p align="justify">All these differ from true holiness,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, In the original and spring of them. True holiness 
    springs from union with Christ, the Spirit applying the blood of Christ to 
    the soul, received by faith, improving the word, sacraments, and 
    afflictions. The Spirit is the efficient cause, the blood the meritorious 
    cause, and faith the instrumental cause of true sanctification. But these 
    others have a far lower rise. They are the effect of good education and 
    breeding; of unsanctified consideration of their own circumstances and 
    worldly interest, that oblige many to take up themselves, and live 
    regularly; of fear and hope; of respect to credit and reputation; and in 
    some, of legal convictions.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, In the subject of them. Holiness diffuses itself 
    through the whole man, inward and outward, 2 Corinthians 5:17; 1 
    Thessalonians 5:23. These are mere plasterings of the outward man, while 
    enmity against God, raucour against serious godliness, and reigning power of 
    lusts in the heart, do remain in their native force, and the old man bears 
    full sway within; as appears in the Pharisees. They make a new life, but 
    they leave the old nature unhealed, unrenewed.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, In the extent of them. True holiness extends to all 
    the Lord commands and forbids, Psalm 119:6; for the whole law is written in 
    the heart, Hebrews 8:10; and so they are holy in all manner of conversation. 
    These never take in more than some shreds of the law; such men never set 
    themselves to conform to it in its spirituality. They quite neglect many of 
    the duties thereof; they consider them not, or they despise them: for they 
    have no mind to take more of them, than makes for their purpose.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, In the nature and kind of them. True holiness is 
    a cluster of the fruits of the Spirit, Galatians 5:22, "Love, joy, peace, 
    long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance." They are 
    acts of moral discipline, which have self-love in an unrenewed heart, not 
    the love of God in a renewed heart, for their principle. The reason of them 
    is not the will of God; for reasons of their own they do so, but not because 
    God commands it. They do not their works in faith of the promise of 
    assistance from Heaven, nor of acceptance for Christ's sake; but out of 
    their own stock, little valuing whether they be accepted or no; or if they 
    do, looking for acceptance on their intriusic worth. Their end is not the 
    glory of God, and to express their gratitude; but as they come from self, so 
    they are swallowed up in self.</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 3. Vain are the pretenses of the unholy to part 
    with Christ; for no unwashed sinner has part with the holy Jesus. They do 
    but deceive themselves in their pretending thereto; and the deceit will out 
    on them to their eternal confusion, if they see it not timely. Here 
    consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Who are unwashed sinners; and,</p>
<p align="justify">2. The state of unwashed sinners, as having no part with 
    Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Consider who are unwashed sinners. In the general,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Those who have not yet escaped the pollutions of the 
    world in the outward man, but in the course of their lives are conform to 
    the world lying in wickedness, Psalm 24:3, 4; Galatians 5:19–21. How can 
    they pretend to be washed, on whom the gross filth of sin is still lying 
    visible in their outward life and conversation? Men may escape that, and yet 
    not be truly washed; escape and yet be intangled again by apostasy. Let none 
    such pretend to have part in Christ, 2 Peter 2:20, 21, for Christ will 
    disown them.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, They that have no apparent beauty of holiness on 
    them, 1 Thessalonians 5:5. Men deceive themselves in despising the 
    appearance of holiness, scorning to appear holy. That is but a peace of 
    fashionable contempt of religion, poured on it in compliance to an ungodly 
    world, and a naughty heart: for wherever grace is in the heart, it will 
    shine forth in the life, Matthew 6:22; Philip. 2:15, 16. And though men may 
    appear holy, who are not so; yet no man can be holy that has no appearance 
    of it. If there is any religion at at all in the world, it must be among 
    them that have an appearance of it, and not among those that have not.</p>
<p align="justify">More particularly, they are yet unwashed by Christ,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, Who have never yet had the glass of the law held to 
    their face, in a work of conviction of the sinfulness of their nature, 
    heart, and life, John 16:8. Christ washes none until he has discovered to 
    them their pollution. For until then they will never see their need of 
    washing. He washes by the word, as by its light it convinces of defilement, 
    points out the cleanness to be aimed at, and sets the soul astir anxiously 
    to seek it.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, Who have not yet got a view of the filthiness, 
    loathsomeness, and abominable nature of sin, Ezekiel 36:31. Men's 
    consciences may be fired with a sense of the guilt of sin; so as they may be 
    brought to cast it out as a coal that would burn them; that yet are blind to 
    the filth of sin, and see not how it defiles them. This appears, in that if 
    they could be but safe from wrath, they would never part with sin.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, Who have not yet been made willing to be made 
    clean. None are washed against their will, Jeremiah 13:27. And there is need 
    of a day of power to make willing, Psalm 110:3. Men naturally love to be 
    still in the pollution of their sin, as the sow to wallow in the mire. They 
    are as loath to be brought away, as fishes to come out of the water. Nay, 
    there is in every unregenerate man, a heart enmity against holiness, Romans 
    8:7. The heart spits its venom against it. They are not only not fond of it, 
    but they hate it: A certain indication, that they are void of it.</p>
<p align="justify">4thly, Who have never yet felt an absolute need of 
    Christ, his blood and Spirit, for their sanctification; and so have not yet 
    come to Christ by faith for it, Hosea 5:13; Psalm 51:2; and 65:3. There is 
    no washing but by Christ, and in union with him: therefore they who have not 
    come to Christ for sanctification, whatever pains they have been at to wash 
    themselves, are yet unwashed.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Consider the state of unwashed sinners as having no 
    part with Christ. Having no part with Christ,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, They have no part in the favor of God, Ephesians 
    2:12. They are "without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of 
    Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and 
    without God in the world." They are yet in a state of enmity with God; for 
    he only is our peace, and the only way to the Father. All their sins, 
    original and actual, in the guilt of them, do yet lie upon them: there is 
    not one item blotted out of their account. For God gives no pardons, but to 
    sinners in Christ: they must meet him there who would be pardoned or 
    reconciled, 2 Corinthians 5:19.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, They are loathsome in God's sight; his soul abhors 
    them as abominable, Titus 1:15. No sinner can be savory in God's sight, but 
    by the sweet-smelling savor of Christ's sacrifice upon them. The smell of 
    Jacob was sweet to Isaac, in the goodly clothing of his elder brother: and 
    sinners are savory to God, only in Christ, 2 Corinthians 2:15. While the 
    sinner has no part with Christ, the filth of all his sin, original and 
    actual, lies on him; and there is nothing on him to master the filthy savor 
    arising therefrom.</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, They have no part with the family of God, but with 
    "the world lying in wickedness, 1 John 1:3, and 5:19, "They are aliens from 
    the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, 
    having no hope, and without God in the world," being without Christ, 
    Ephesians 2:12. They have no right to the privileges of God's children; for 
    none can have that but in the right of Christ as his head. What is the state 
    of the world lying in wickedness, is their state. They are under God's 
    wrath, and the curse of the law.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, They shall have no part with the saints in light, 
    but their part will be with sinners in outer darkness, Colossians 1:12, 13; 
    Revelation 22:15. One who has no part with Christ here, will have no part in 
    Heaven hereafter for none can come there, but in and through him. They will 
    have their part in "the lake which burns with fire and brimstone," 
    Revelation 21:8.</p>
<p align="justify">INFERENCE 4, Lastly, The way to be washed from sin, and 
    made holy, is to get part with Christ by faith.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Think not that you must first be holy, before you can 
    have part with Christ: but you must first have that part with Christ, before 
    you can be holy, as appears from what is said. The former is as absurd as to 
    say, the sick must be cured before he come to the physician, and the filthy 
    washed before he come to the waters. Hence,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Your unholiness cannot bar you from getting part 
    with Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The first step to holiness is to believe.</p>
<p align="justify">2. This is a sure way to holiness; it cannot misgive. For 
    hereby the sick are put in the hand of the physician, the filthy in the 
    laver. The sinner united to Christ, most needs partake of his blood and 
    Spirit: as through our relation to Adam we are defiled, so by our relation 
    to Christ we come to be sanctified.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Lastly, This is the only way, as being of God's 
    appointment. The sanctification of a sinner is above the power of nature, 
    not to be reached by natural endeavors; they have not that word of 
    appointment.</p>
