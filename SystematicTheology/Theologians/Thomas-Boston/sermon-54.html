          Ephesians 5:9, "For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and
          righteousness, and truth."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          LIGHT, in religion, without heat and warmth, is so unlike Heaven, that
          it will issue in utter darkness, where there is a scorching heat
          without light. True spiritual light, is like John Baptist, a burning
          and a shining light. When the Spirit was poured out after the
          ascension of Christ, for the enlightening of a dark world, Acts 2:3,
          "there appeared cloven tongues as of fire." For, as upon the
          confounding of tongues at Babel, darkness came upon the world, the
          holy language being left but with a few, and corruption of manners
          came in like a flood upon that darkness; so when the remedy for this
          was given in Zion, there appeared cloven tongues, an emblem of the
          gift of tongues, by which light was to be restored to the dark world.
          And these tongues were of fire, because of the dross and corruption of
          the world, to be burnt up by them; light and purity returning
          together. Thus the saving influences of the Spirit are together
          enlightening and sanctifying: "Walk as children of the light; for the
          fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth."
          That these words are parenthetical, appears from that, the words of
          the 10th verse are so constructed with the 8th, that they make one
          sentence with it; our text being interposed, as in the midst of a
          running sentence. Walk as children of light. Proving what is
          acceptable unto the Lord. For the fruit of the Spirit, etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The scope of the text is to show that there is a necessary connection
          between a gracious state and a holy life; which are so joined by the
          appointment of God, and the nature of the things, that they cannot be
          put asunder. It is true, many do so yoke together a splendid
          profession and an unholy life, as if they had found out the secret of
          conjoining light and darkness, Christ and Belial, hidden from all
          saints. But our text confounds that mystery of iniquity, showing that
          whoever are light in respect of their state, will be so also in
          respect of their conversation. "For the fruit of the Spirit is in all
          goodness, and righteousness, and truth." For clearing the sense of
          these words, let us consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. The connection.</p>
        <p align="justify">II. The words themselves.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. Raise, and illustrate the doctrines contained in the text.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          According then to this customary method, in discourses of this kind, I
          am,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. To consider the connection of the text with the preceding words, in
          the particle for. Some think the particle ãáñ, to be put for äå, as if
          it were merely a note of transition, as it is sometimes used, as in
          Luke 12:58; and read, "Now the fruit of the Spirit," etc; but to this
          I do not accede. It is a rule of interpreting Scripture, worthy to be
          written in letters of gold, namely, that we are never, without
          necessity, to depart from the proper and literal signification of
          words. And although an eager sticking to the literal signification of
          words, where a real necessity of taking them improperly and
          figuratively is sufficiently intimated by the Scripture itself, has
          been of fatal consequence in divinity, yet I nothing doubt, but men's
          taking to themselves a liberty of receding from the proper
          signification of words, without necessity, has, in several cases, cast
          a veil over the true sense of Scripture, and brought in upon the text
          what may be the true sense of, instead of bringing forth out of it,
          what must be so.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now there is no necessity here for taking this particle merely for a
          note of transition. For, is to be taken casually. Though the apostle
          does not here teach distinctly and directly, how, but, wherefore, we
          are to walk as children of the light; yet, by the by, he may, and
          really does teach how we shall walk so, namely, by bringing forth the
          fruit of the Spirit, which is the reason alleged for taking it
          transitively.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          We take it then casually, as our own and other translators for the
          most part do, and this is its most frequent signification; and so the
          words are a reason for something going before. He had shown both the
          condition and the duty of the Ephesians, and inferred the latter from
          the former, and in the text gives the reason of the consequence. May
          not we walk as others, might they say, though we be light in the Lord?
          No, says the apostle, you cannot; for if you be light in the Lord, you
          shall certainly shine, and give light in your conversation. For the
          fruit of the Spirit, abiding and acting on all the children of light,
          is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But here, vain men, who, to exalt free will, trample on free grace,
          may cavil and say, If there be such a necessary connection between
          being light in the Lord, and walking as children of the light, in all
          goodness, &amp;c., then to what purpose are exhortations to the duty
          of walking so? May not one as well say to the sun in the firmament,
          You are the sun, walk as the sun giving light?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. The same God who has appointed the end, has appointed the
          means also, and they are joined together, not to be separated by men.
          Exhortations are means ordained of God for advancing holiness in heart
          and life, in these brought into the state of grace. As there is a
          necessary connection between a foundation of Zion which the Lord has
          laid, and the putting of the copestone on it; so the means of building
          up are by that very thing secured. "Being confident of this very
          thing, that he which has begun a good work in you, will perform it
          until the day of Jesus." It is true, it would be vain to speak to the
          sun at the rate aforesaid. But God did speak so to it, Genesis 1:14,
          15; and it is by virtue of that efficacious word that the sun shines
          to this day, and is not extinguished. And as his Spirit makes the
          saints light in the Lord, so it is by virtue of his efficacious word
          that they walk as children of the light, in all goodness, etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But, before we leave this, we shall remark, that before the apostle
          comes directly to show how they must walk as children of the light, as
          he does in the 10th and 11th verses, he here urges the necessity of
          it. For if the conscience be not first convinced of the necessity of a
          duty, one will but little regard how it is to be done. The good of
          souls is the supreme law of preaching, and all method is so to be
          managed as may be most subservient to it. Let us now go on,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. To consider the words themselves, which are a proposition, in
          which we shall notice,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">1. The subject.</p>
        <p align="justify">2. What is said of it.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The subject which the apostle here treats of is, the fruit of the
          Spirit. And here we must take notice,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Of the reading in some Greek copies, ôïõ öùôïò, instead of ôïõ
          ðíåõìáôïò; "for the fruit of the light is," instead of "the fruit of
          the Spirit." But to confirm the common reading to be genuine, it may
          be observed, that the fruit of the Spirit is an expression used
          elsewhere in the New Testament, namely, Galatians 5:22; to this may be
          added Romans 8:23; but the fruit of the light, nowhere, as I remember.
          Observe also, that the word öùôïò, being in the last part of the
          preceding verse, might, by the inadvertency of the transcriber, more
          naturally be repeated in the text instead of ðíåõìáôïò, than this last
          could be inserted instead of öùôïò. Lastly, the common reading is the
          more forcible, full, and decisive, and therefore to be retained. For
          the fruit of the Spirit comprehends the fruit, but not contrariwise;
          and the fruit of the Spirit here answers the word "in the Lord," light
          in the Lord, in the preceding verse.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. We must next inquire what is meant by the Spirit here? Some, by the
          Spirit, here understand the new creature, or the light of grace
          wrought by the Spirit of God in the heart. Others understand the Holy
          Spirit himself. This last seems to me to be the genuine sense of this
          word in this place, and that because it is most literal and proper one
          of the two; since the new nature, or the light of grace, cannot be so
          called, but as the effect gets the name of the cause; and there is no
          necessity for receding from the more proper signification in this
          text.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But to prove the word Spirit to be taken here for the light of grace,
          not the Holy Spirit himself, besides the different reading already
          considered, two things are alleged; one is, that here there is no
          mention of the Holy Spirit before, but of light.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. There is a virtual, though not express mention of him in the
          phrase, "light in the Lord," since the Spirit is the bond of our union
          with Christ; and that is more than sufficient ground for mentioning
          him here. Another thing more weighty is, that the phrase, the fruit of
          the Spirit, Galatians 5:20, must be so understood, being opposed there
          to the works of the flesh, verse 19. Now as fruit answers to works,
          say they, so Spirit does to flesh, and therefore must be understood of
          the new nature.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. I judge that several learned commentators, who understand by
          the fruit of the Spirit there, the fruit of the Holy Spirit of God,
          are in the right; so that the phrase in both texts signifies the same
          thing. And the variation of the phrases there does not obscurely
          intimate this, namely, the works of the flesh and the fruit of the
          spirit; not the work or works of the spirit, that is of the new
          nature; which the immediate opposition between the old and new nature
          would have required. For these works of the flesh, like wild oats,
          grow of their own accord, from out of the cursed ground of our corrupt
          nature, without toil or pains about them, to bring them forth. But
          these of the new nature do not so; they must be produced by the
          continued influences of the Holy Spirit, even in the trees already
          planted in the house of God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I will not conceal, that what we read in the same 5th chapter of the
          Galatians, of the Spirit lusting against the flesh, as well as the
          flesh against the Spirit, in the same combat, seems to clash with our
          exposition. But I cannot help thinking, that even it also is meant of
          the Holy Spirit himself, in so far as he stirs in the saints holy
          desires and lustings; making the new nature to act and lust, in
          opposition to the old corrupt nature: even as he is said to intercede,
          pray, and groan with groanings which cannot be uttered; in so far as
          he stirs up, and produces these in the saints, Romans 8:26. It seems
          to be reasonable to judge the Spirit that lusts (in that sense)
          against the flesh, verse 17, is the same Spirit by which the saints
          are led, verse 18. But the Spirit by which they are led is the Spirit
          of God, Romans 8:14.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. What is meant by the fruit of the Spirit? From what is said, it
          plainly follows, that the fruit of the Spirit is not the fruit of the
          Spirit as the subject of it, but the fruit of the Spirit as an agent,
          who by his powerful influences produces the same in the trees of
          righteousness, or the branches of his own engrafting into the true
          vine. In a word, it is the product of the Holy Spirit in the children
          of light, which is pleasant and savory before the Lord, therefore
          called fruit, according to that, "My fruit is better than gold, yes,
          than fine gold." What that fruit in particular is, is declared in the
          other part of the text.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It is to be considered, how the apostle's speaking here of the
          fruit of the Spirit, its being in all goodness, &amp;c., concludes
          what was to be proved. The matter lies here. The reasoning is founded
          on that fundamental maxim of practical Christianity, that the Holy
          Spirit, the Spirit of Light, abides, acts, and produces fruit in all
          the children of light, in all those who are light in the Lord. For
          Jesus Christ is by the Father constituted the head of all saving
          influences; and it is by the communion of his Spirit that we receive
          of his influences to make us fruitful. The Spirit uniting the soul to
          Christ, the fountain of light and life, it immediately partakes of the
          light of life, as a candle is lighted by a burning lamp touching it;
          but the candle, separated from the lamp, would continue to burn, as
          having in itself that which feeds the flame. But the creature is empty
          in itself, and therefore must be fed continually from Jesus Christ, by
          the communion of his Spirit maintaining the bond of union between
          Christ and the soul, and taking of Christ and giving to it. So that if
          it were possible that the Spirit should once totally depart from the
          child of light, and the union be broken, that moment he would return
          to his former darkness. Now the fruit of the Spirit, thus abiding and
          acting in the children of light, is in all goodness, righteousness,
          and truth; therefore it necessarily follows, that they that are light
          in the Lord, will walk as children of light. We are now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. To consider what is said of this fruit of the Spirit. "It is in all
          goodness," etc. There is an ellipsis here of the copulating. Our
          translators supply the word, is. Some versions supply the word,
          consists. Whatever be supplied, that seems to be the sense, namely,
          that the fruit of the Spirit consists in all goodness, etc. Thus we
          read, Colossians 1:10, of being fruitful in every good work. Now, here
          we are to show, I. What are the particulars in which the fruit of the
          Spirit, in a child of light, consists. These are goodness,
          righteousness, and truth. Now, forasmuch as all Christian virtues are
          the fruit of the Spirit, they are by the consent of interpreters all
          summed up in these three. And as everything brings forth after its
          kind, so these are agreeable to the nature of the Holy Spirit, who is
          a good and righteous Spirit, and the Spirit of truth; and so they are
          also to the light, as our Lord shows, John 3:20; "He who does evil
          hates the light," and verse 21, "He who does truth comes to the
          light."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Goodness. There is a twofold notion in it: 1. Of loveliness; hence
          the phrase, good in one's eyes. So the subject of goodness, whether
          person or thing, is good in itself; commendable, lovely, desirable.
          Thus goodness comprehends holiness; purity in opposition to all
          impurity and filthiness; meekness, patience, &amp;c., in opposition to
          wrath, bitterness, &amp;c., which the apostle had before condemned;
          and also faith, without which none please God. 2. It has also the
          notion of communication; all good being communicative of itself, as
          philosophers observe. Thus a good person or thing is good to others,
          that is, beneficent or profitable. "Hence," says Paul, "let no corrupt
          communication proceed out of your mouth; but that which is good, to
          the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers. Thus
          it comprehends bounty, mercy; in a word, a disposition to do good to
          others in their souls and bodies: and so it is opposed to
          covetousness, revenge, malice, &amp;c., before condemned. Hence we
          cannot, with some, take goodness as relating only to one's self. For
          though, indeed, the goodness of a child of light cannot extend to God
          in this last sense, yet it may and must to one's neighbor, Psalm 16:2,
          3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Righteousness in the extent of its signification, speaks a
          conformity to the law in all the parts thereof. But being here
          contradistinguished to goodness, it cannot be taken in that large
          sense, but in a more restrained one; namely, as it denotes that
          whereby we are inclined to give every one his due. This is justice in
          all our dealings with men, of whatever sort. Thus the Jews
          distinguished righteous men from good men. The righteous man,
          according to them, says what is mine is mine, what is your is your
          own. But the good man says, what is mine is your, and what is your is
          your own; to which the apostle seems to have an eye, Romans 5:6, 7.
          Now this fruit of the Spirit, righteousness or justice, is opposed to
          that covetousness before condemned.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Truth has a respect to God, ourselves, and our neighbor. There is a
          truth of the heart, in uprightness and sincerity. A truth of things,
          words, and actions. Hence are these words of our Lord, "He who does
          truth comes to the light." That is true things, agreeable to the rule,
          and having the reality of Christian actions, and not a show and
          semblance of them only. A truth of thought and judgment, whereby one
          judges aright of things; and a truth of speech, whether testifying,
          teaching, or promising; all this comes under the name of truth, which
          is opposed here to dissimulation and lies, with respect to God and
          man; and to error, delusion, and vain hopes, whereby a person himself
          is deluded and deceived. It is particularly set against that deceit
          spoken of, verse 6th, which could find no place but under the covert
          of darkness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Let us attend to the extent of the fruit of the Spirit, with
          respect to these particulars. "It is in all goodness," etc. I make no
          question but this note of universality belongs to all the three; the
          phrase itself natively importing it. The fruit of the Spirit is not
          only in some goodness, righteousness, and truth—though many deceive
          themselves with parcels and shreds of these things—but it is in all
          goodness in one's self and to his neighbor; in all righteousness
          towards man; in all truth with respect to God, our neighbor, and
          ourselves. And these things are interwoven one with another, in the
          fruit of the Spirit. The goodness is true, and justles out no sort of
          righteousness or justice, communicative nor distributive, remunerative
          nor punitive. The righteousness is true and good; from right
          principles, motives, and ends. So is the truth, as it is here
          distinguished, proceeding from a good principle. Meanwhile, this
          extent of the fruit of the Spirit is to be understood not in a legal,
          but an evangelical sense; of a perfection of parts, not of degrees.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Let us show how these are the fruit of the Holy Spirit, in the
          children of light. They are so in three respects. 1. He implants them
          in the soul, giving it a good, righteous, and true inclination and
          propensity, agreeable to the holy law, according to that, "I will,"
          says the Lord, "put my law into their minds, and write them in their
          hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a
          people." 2. He preserves these graces when implanted, 1 Peter 1:5,
          without which they would die out. And, 3. He excites, quickens, and
          brings them forth to action, in the heart and life of the children of
          light, Song 4:16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The sum of the whole matter is this. Those who are light in the Lord,
          must needs walk as children of light; because the Spirit of God,
          abiding in them, does produce fruit in them, consisting in all
          righteousness, goodness, and truth, in their hearts and lives, with
          respect to God, themselves, and their neighbors.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE I. The Spirit of Christ abiding in the children of light,
          produces agreeable fruit in their hearts and lives.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE II. Goodness, righteousness, and truth, are the fruits of the
          children of light, produced in them by the Spirit of Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE III. True Christian fruitfulness is universal. A word to each
          of these.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE I. The Spirit of Christ abiding in the children of light,
          produces agreeable fruit in their hearts and lives; even fruit
          suitable to his own nature, and their gracious state. For confirmation
          of this consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The Spirit is an active bond of union between Christ and the
          children of light, these that are in him. By this Spirit, an empty
          creature is united to a full Christ; and by the same made partaker of
          his fullness, to their bringing forth fruit in him. "The Spirit shall
          glorify me," says Christ, "for he shall receive of mine, and shall
          show it unto you." Hence we read "of the supply of the Spirit of Jesus
          Christ." It is by the soul's feeding on Christ that it lives, and
          whoever feed on him, shall live by him, a life of holiness, as well as
          comfort. "He who eats me," says Jesus, "even he shall live by me."
          Meanwhile, our Lord tells us, that this life is by the participation
          of his Spirit. It is the Spirit that quickens.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Consider the end for which the Spirit is given to these that are
          his. It is in a special manner for their sanctification, Ezekiel
          36:26, 27; so that all who are chosen of God to everlasting life, are
          sanctified by the Spirit. "For they are chosen to salvation through
          sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth." It is his work
          to conform them more and more unto the image of Christ, and he effects
          it accordingly. "For they are changed into the same image, from glory
          to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord." And the same Spirit
          being in them which is in Jesus Christ, cannot fail to make them like
          him in their bearing the fruits of holiness; even as in Ezekiel's
          vision, when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the
          wheels were lifted up also, for the spirit of the living creatures was
          in the wheels.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The several designations given to the Holy Spirit evince this. He
          is called the Holy Spirit, not only because he is holy himself; but
          chiefly, because he makes them holy in whom he dwells. He is the
          Spirit of grace; for he implants it, preserves it, excites,
          strengthens it, and at length perfects it. He is the Spirit of life
          who mortifies the old man, and quickens the new. He is the water that
          purges away the filth of sin, and makes the soul fruitful. He is even
          a fountain of living water springing up in the soul. He is the fire
          that burns up corruption, and inflames the heart with the love of God.
          And, to add no more, he is the wind from Heaven, making the spices in
          Christ's garden to flow out.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. 1. Of information. This lets us see, that in vain are the
          pretenses to the Spirit and a gracious state, in those who bring not
          forth the fruits of holiness in their hearts and lives. The trees of
          righteousness bring forth holy fruits. "If God be our Father, where is
          our honor of him; if our Master, where is our fear of him." If the
          Spirit of Christ be in us, where are our love, joy, peace, for these
          are the fruit of the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Those who are so far from the fruits of holiness, that their
          profane lives are filled with the fruits of wickedness, have not the
          Spirit, but are in darkness, Galatians 5:19. To what purpose do men
          pretend faith in Christ, while they go on in a course of sin, and will
          not part with their lusts. They that are Christ's, have Christ's
          Spirit; and that Spirit will give quite a new turn to their hearts and
          lives.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 2. Of exhortation. Unholy sinners, as ever you would be holy,
          labor to get Christ's Spirit in you, to dwell in you, and act in you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 1. Without the Spirit you are undone forever; for without the
          Spirit, without Christ; for if any man have not the Spirit of Christ,
          he is none of his. Without Christ, without God, and without hope. The
          dead corpse may be kept a while; but when there is no hope of the
          return of life to it, it is buried in a grave. So, without the Spirit,
          you may be through the patience of God spared a while; but the end
          will be, to be cast into the pit, and buried out of God's sight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE 2. If you get the Spirit, you are made up forever. When the
          Spirit comes, life comes that shall never fail, John 4:14. He will
          unite you to Christ, quicken, enlighten, and sanctify you. He will
          give you grace, actuate and increase it, and change you from glory to
          glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DIRECTION. Pray earnestly for the Spirit. Your heavenly Father shall
          give the holy Spirit to them that ask him. Look and wait for the
          Spirit in all ordinances. "Blessed are they that sow beside all
          waters." They that would have the wind blow on them, go out into the
          open air; though they cannot raise it, they go where it blows. Give up
          yourselves to the Spirit; say, "Turn me, and I shall be turned; for
          you are the Lord my God." Lay down yourselves at his feet, to be
          enlightened, quickened, and sanctified. Cherish the least spark; it
          may increase into a flame.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Children of light, as you would abound in the fruits of holiness,
          take heed how you entertain the Spirit. Resist him not, but fall in
          with him in his operation. Quench not the Spirit. Beware of casting
          water on the holy fire, by sinning against light, or by indulging in
          sensuality. Withdraw not fuel from it, by neglecting the motions of
          the Spirit. Smother it not, by not giving vent to the motions and
          operations of the Spirit within you.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE II. Goodness, righteousness, and truth, are fruits of the
          Spirit in the children of light, produced in them by the Holy Spirit
          of Christ. For the confirmation of this, I shall only briefly observe,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That God is good, righteous, and true; and they are partakers of
          the divine nature, 2 Peter 1:4; and so, as children, they resemble God
          their Father.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That God has been in a special and gracious manner, good,
          righteous, and true to them. As to the point of righteousness, that
          Scripture may be noted, "He is just to forgive us our sins, and to
          cleanse us from all unrighteousness," namely, for the merits of
          Christ. And it is the nature of God's dispensations of saving grace,
          to impress the same dispositions on the happy subjects of them. They
          are changed into the same image, from glory to glory.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. That the holy law is a law of goodness, righteousness, and truth.
          This law is written on their hearts, Hebrews 8:10.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, That wickedness, unrighteousness, and lies, are the works of
          the devil, and the works of the flesh; to which the fruits produced by
          the Spirit in the new man are directly contrary.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. This writes death on the foreheads of three sorts of persons:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Wicked, ungodly, and ungracious men, who are far from goodness,
          remaining in the evil state and disposition in which they were born;
          in whose mind, will, and affections, the evil of sin yet reigns; and
          are neither graciously good in nor to themselves, nor others. That is
          an evidence that the good Spirit of God has never yet entered into
          that heart to dwell there. Alas! will some say, I see much evil, all
          evil in my heart, but goodness is far from me. ANSWER. It is a piece
          of gracious goodness for one to see the evil of his own heart; but yet
          there is a pearl of goodness in the saints, amidst a dunghill of evil.
          God owns it for goodness though it be so, and it is folly in you to
          deny it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Unrighteous men, who are unjust in their dealings with men, who are
          given to fraud, cheating, and tricking, if they can gain thereby; and
          can go over the belly of conscience and common justice, to advance
          their worldly interest. This is an evidence that the world is your God
          and portion; that there is no fear of God before your eyes; that you
          are children of darkness and not of light. Let me tell you, where you
          win a penny by it, you lose a talent; the gain is the price of blood,
          of your soul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Those who make no conscience of truth. Children in whom there is no
          truth, are not children of light. Such are hypocrites and dissemblers
          with God, who pretend fair, but whose heart is not upright with the
          Lord; who, under the cloak of a profession of religion, indulge
          themselves in sin, in some living reigning lust or other. Ah! whom do
          you mock. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. Such, like the false
          mother, divide the child; by a holy profession, and an unholy
          practice. So shall their doom be to be cut asunder, and have their
          portion with hypocrites. Such are liars, who make no conscience of
          speaking truth; especially such as lie in defense of an unholy life,
          which is a most common sin; there being everywhere agents of the
          devil, who have abundance of vain words to bestow in defense of these
          things. These are of their father the devil, and with him they must
          lodge for evermore, Revelation 21:8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">USE 2. Of exhortation. Let us,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Study goodness. To be good, pleasing, and acceptable in the sight
          of God, and of men also, so far as we may in God's way; namely, by
          meekness, gentleness, readiness to do good; and for this cause, let us
          hate sin as the greatest evil. Let us all endeavor to be beneficial to
          mankind, as we have access; to embrace all occasions offered for the
          advancing of the temporal, but especially the spiritual good of
          others. Let no man say, Am I my brother's keeper? Nor of the ruin of
          others, What is that to us? And let us abridge ourselves of our
          liberty, even in lawful things, to that very end, that we destroy not
          those for whom Christ died.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Be strictly just in all our dealings with men. Moral honesty is not
          the whole of religion, but it is such a necessary part of it, as the
          want of it will declare a man a stranger to real godliness, profess
          what he will, Psalm 15:1–3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Let us study truth and cleave to it. Truth and sincerity of
          heart before the Lord; the doctrine of truth, and truth in all our
          words.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE III. True Christian fruitfulness is universal. On this I have
          not time to enlarge.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. By this we may try our state, and whether our fruit be the fruit
          of the Holy Spirit in us or not. True fruit is universal, Colossians
          1:10; Psalm 119:6. There is a perfection of parts in the fruit of the
          Spirit in believers, though not of degrees. They do sincerely aim at
          all, and endeavor all the parts of goodness and holiness, though in
          none of them they attain to legal perfection. Hypocrites are ever
          partial in their fruits, pretended to be fruits, and never aim at
          universal obedience of heart and life. Amen.
