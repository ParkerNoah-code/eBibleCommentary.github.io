          Proverbs 29 "Where there is no vision the people perish; but he who
          keeps the law, happy is he."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          WE are called this day to give thanks unto God, that the congregation
          is not left desolate, and wanting a settled ministry. The due
          consideration of the evils attending such a case is a proper mean to
          excite unto thankfulness, for averting such a stroke. And where
          thankfulness is to be found in its due latitude, it will extend to a
          suitable improvement of the means of grace. But of these we have in
          the text, where notice,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. What makes a people very unhappy, with respect to the concerns of
          their souls. Where there is no vision the people perish The want of
          vision puts a people in very unhappy circumstances. By vision is
          understood prophecy, 1 Samuel 9:9. "Before time in Israel, when a man
          went to inquire of God, thus he spoke, Come and let us go to the seer;
          for he who is now called a prophet, was before time called a seer."
          And by prophecy is meant the preaching, expounding, and applying the
          Word of God, 1 Corinthians 14:1. "Desire spiritual gifts, but rather
          that you may prophecy." This also is clear from the opposite clause,
          which mentions the law, as the rule by which people are to walk. They
          that are left without this mercy of the word, they perish, their
          spiritual case goes to wreck, they are made naked, stripped of their
          ornaments.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. What makes a people or person happy. He who keeps the law, happy is
          he. Negatively, you may observe, it is not the having of vision, the
          enjoying the ministry of the word that will do it. Though the want of
          it makes a people unhappy, however prosperous they may be otherwise;
          yet the mere having of it will not make them happy. Positively, it is
          the improving of vision among them, to the obeying of the truth, it is
          the keeping of the law which is preached unto them, the falling in
          with the great ends of the revelation of the mind of God made among
          them, by faith and a holy walk. This makes every one happy that does
          it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Doctrine. Though the want of the ministry of the word makes a people
          very unhappy, yet it is not the having of it, but the right improving
          of it that makes them happy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          There are three things which the text presents to us, and which crave
          our serious consideration in our case.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Deplorable is the case of those that are deprived of the ministry
          of the word.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. The mere having of the ministry of the word is not sufficient to
          make a people happy.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. A right improvement of the ministry of the word will make a happy
          people.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">We return to the consideration of the</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Namely, deplorable is the case of those that are deprived of the
          ministry of the word. In speaking to this, I shall first show what
          makes that case so deplorable and heavy; and then confirm the truth of
          this point. Let us then,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Show what makes that case so deplorable and heavy. The text tells
          us the people perish. The original word here used has several
          significations, which different translations give it, and I see no
          reason why each of them that is suitable may not be thought to be
          intended by the Holy Spirit, and the whole make up the just
          explication of what makes that case so deplorable.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Where there is no ministry of the word, the people are made naked,
          they are left in a bare condition, they are uncovered. This is the
          primary condition of the word. Thus the sad condition of the people by
          their idolatry is expressed, Exodus 22:25. Moses saw that the people
          were naked, for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their
          enemies. And,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. They are stripped of their ornaments to their shame. Gospel
          ordinances kept up by a gospel ministry are the ornaments of a house,
          Isaiah 64:11. The ordinances are the beauties of holiness, Psalm
          110:3. Thus the saints have ever considered them, Psalm 84:1. Where
          there is no ministry of the word, there the stars, which Christ holds
          in his right hand to give light to the people, are hidden out of
          sight; the candles that shined in the candlestick are put out, and so
          such a people stripped of their ornaments.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They are stripped of their armor, left naked in the midst of
          danger. The Word of God is the sword of the Spirit. We cannot want it
          in an evil hour, if we mind to strive against the stream. It is true,
          the word read is the sword of the Spirit as well as preached. But the
          preaching of it is the special mean to draw it out of the scabbard,
          and put it into the hand of poor sinners against their enemies. Thus
          the Eunuch, after reading the word, replied to Philip's question, How
          can I understand it, except some man should guide me? And he desired
          that Philip do come up and sit with him for that purpose. The well is
          deep, and there is need of some to draw for the people, that they may
          drink.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. They are stripped of the means of their defense. Sinners are in
          danger of attacks from enemies on all hands. They have need of
          watchmen to stand in the watch-tower, but where there is no ministry
          the watch-tower is empty, none to sound the trumpet to awaken those
          that are asleep, and to encourage those to fight that go out to the
          battle. The wall is then taken down, and what is within will appear
          like the garden of the sluggard.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Hence they are exposed in a special manner to the subtlety and
          violence of their spiritual enemies, without the ordinary means of
          help. They that let their case go as it will, it is much alike to
          them, whether they have the ministry of the word or not. But such as
          are concerned about their souls, will find they need all the help they
          can get from public ordinances: so that they will look upon themselves
          without them, to be exposed as sheep without a shepherd.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Where there is no vision, the people go backward. They leave their
          first love, their first ways in religion, they fall into a spiritual
          decay and apostasy. God has appointed the ministry of the word to set
          people forward in the way of duty, and in that they must strive
          against the stream. No wonder then that as the boat must go down the
          stream, when the rowers are no more; so where there is no vision the
          people go backward. And this is one reason why Satan strives to rob
          the church of her ministers. What is said to the seven churches, is
          said to the angels of them, for a lively minister, is most likely to
          make a lively people; a dead minister, a dead people; and no ministry
          at all, would soon issue in no religion at all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Where there is no vision, the people are drawn away. They are drawn
          away from their God, from their duty, from the right way. They are
          never wanting who will be agents for Satan, to draw people aside into
          the ways of sin and wickedness. We have many such drawers, the devil,
          the world, and the flesh. Now to draw against and oppose all these, a
          gospel ministry is set up in the church. All has enough to do, to draw
          people forward; but how much more easily then would people be drawn
          away, were there none such to hold. Thus are they drawn away and
          scattered as sheep not having a shepherd.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Where there is no vision, the people are idle, they give over their
          work. They are like children who go to their play when they have none
          to call them to their books. They stand idle in the market place,
          while they have none to invite them to go into the vineyard; to tell
          them what to work and how to work. There is a principle of sloth in
          the sons of men; they need monitors to stir them up to their business,
          to deal with their consciences, to put them on.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Where there is no vision, the people perish, they die for lack
          of instruction, are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Good motions once
          raised in them are weakened and extinguished, and the case of their
          souls goes to wreck. Let us now,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">II. Confirm the truth of this point.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. The depriving of a people of the ministry of the word is a stroke
          of the Lord's anger. It is threatened as such, when he says, "I will
          come unto you quickly, and will remove your candlestick out of his
          place, except you repent." It is inflicted as such. "But go you now,
          says he, unto my place which is in Shiloh, where I set my name at the
          first, and see what I did to it, for the wickedness of my people
          Israel." It is a spiritual stroke and therefore the more heavy. It
          concerns men's souls, and therefore makes the case deplorable. It is a
          stroke laid on for a grievous quarrel, namely, the misimproving of the
          gospel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The right notion of the excellency of the ministry of the word will
          evince their case to be sad that want it. Ministers are the light of
          the world, and they are dark places of the earth that want the gospel.
          The ministry of the word is the ordinary means of convincing and
          converting sinners; and when the gospel goes from a place, it is a sad
          sign that that work there is near an end. It is appointed for the
          edifying of the body of Christ, therefore to be continued until the
          temple be finished. The word is the bread of our souls the water to
          quench their thirst, rain to make them fruitful; and it is our
          counselor in doubts and fears.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use 1. Let us pity the case of those that are altogether without the
          light of the gospel, as many places in the world are. What though they
          have many precious things which we want, yet our gospel is better than
          their gold. Whatever they have in this world, where is the solid
          grounds of hope with them of a better? For our text looks sternly on
          the opinion of the salvation of heathens, telling us that where no
          vision is, there the people perish.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Let us pity the case of persecuted Christians and churches. Where
          there is no open vision, where silent Sabbaths are forced upon
          professors by the rage of enemies. As also the case of desolate
          congregations among ourselves, where many are perishing for want of
          vision, being brought up in ignorance of the precepts of religion, and
          have not the means of instruction, direction and comfort, when they
          most need them. Did men consider the sad case into which the want of
          vision brings a people, they dared not raise obstacles in the way of
          planting congregations. Though in the mean time we have reason to
          bless God, that our land is a land of light, and if the ministry of
          the word be wanting in one corner it may be had in another.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. How injurious are they to their own souls, that willfully slight
          the ministry of the word, whom a very little thing will keep back from
          ordinances. How do they wrong themselves that quite turn their backs
          on the ministry, and make it religion to them, not to be present at
          the ordinances dispensed in the congregation. The experience of such
          whose souls are helped thereby in their Christian course, will witness
          their sin, and the injury done to themselves, as well as to the
          ordinances.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Let us be thankful to God, for the late favorable event in
          keeping this congregation from the desolation that was intended. There
          are few places that could have worse borne a desolation; there being
          in our case several things not common to render a desolation heavy.
          The Lord has heard prayer, let us render to him the calves of our
          lips. We proceed now to show,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. That the mere having of the ministry of the word is not sufficient
          to make a people happy. This is evident if we consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. That people may have it, and yet get no saving benefit by it. It
          may be to them like a sounding brass, that reaches no farther than the
          ear. We find people going on in horrible profanity, notwithstanding
          they enjoyed the means of grace, Jeremiah 7:8, 9. Some again sink into
          formality. Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.
          Outward privileges make no man a happy man. What avails the light if
          men will not open their eyes to see: our food will not nourish us,
          unless we eat and digest it; nor clothes warm us, unless we put them
          on; so the word preached did not profit, not being mixed with faith in
          them that heard it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The mere having of the word is so far from saving men, that it will
          aggravate the condemnation of those that have it, and walk not
          answerably to it. It will be more tolerable in the day of judgment for
          Sodom and Gomorrah than for Capernaum; for them that never heard the
          gospel, than for unbelieving ungodly men. The brighter the light
          shines among a people, their works of darkness are the more heinous:
          and their outward privileges will be to them at length like a bag of
          gold on a drowning man.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Use. You my brethren have shown on the late occasion a great concern
          to have the ministry continued among you, and I hope you are convinced
          that the design pursued was very unacceptable to me. Now providence
          has turned this matter according to the desire of us both. But let us
          not sit down upon it, as if that were enough to make all well with us
          in the relation of pastor and people. We need the Lord's hand to it,
          to put efficacy in the mercy for the good of us both. Many have got
          their desire; but it has turned to an empty husk in their hand,
          because they did not look to the Lord, and depend upon him for the
          good of it. "You looked for much, and lo, it came to little; and when
          you brought it home, I did blow upon it: Why? says the Lord of hosts.
          Because of mine house that is waste, and you run every man to his own
          house." If the Lord be not with us to bless us, we may come to be a
          weary burden to one another, for no creature can be more to us than
          God makes it to be. We need the blessing to make the ordinances
          effectual among us; for Paul may plant and Apollos water, but God
          gives the increase. O! pray, pray for the blessing on this
          continuance.â€”Protest before the Lord that you will not be satisfied
          without it. We need the blessing to make the mercy lasting, for an
          unblessed mercy will either be very comfortless, or else it will not
          continue long.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">It remains for us to show,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. That a right improvement of the mercy of the word will make a
          happy people. This improvement consists in two things, which come both
          here, under the notion of keeping the law.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Faith in Jesus Christ. It was to him the ceremonial law pointed the
          sinner, under the Old Testament; and without faith there is no keeping
          of the moral law. For in the eleventh chapter of the Hebrews, the
          apostle shows us, that it was by faith that the Old Testament saints
          did perform duties and bear trials and crosses.â€”This is the great call
          of the gospel; to close with Christ there offered. We are sent to
          espouse you to our Master's Son, and do not come speed, but by gaining
          your consent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Holiness of life. The doctrines of the gospel believed with the
          heart, teach us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
          live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present world. As Christ
          is the end of the law, so I may say, the law is the end of the gospel;
          for it is the great design of the gospel revelation, to bring back
          sinners, to that righteousness and holiness which the law requires.
          The gospel never gains its end among a people, until a strain of piety
          and holiness run through their whole lives.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Now to confirm this point. Consider,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. This improvement will make happy souls here, and hereafter. Here in
          peace with God, pardon of sin, yes, all spiritual blessings in
          heavenly places in Christ Jesus; and hereafter in eternal salvation.
          For he who believes shall be saved.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It bids fair for prosperity in earthly things, and as far as it
          will serve for God's glory and your good, will secure it to you. "For
          godliness is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the
          life that now is, and that which is to come."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It will give happiness under your crosses and trials with which you
          meet in the world. Troubles in the world will make the saints more
          attentive to the word; and they will find the word lighten, yes,
          sweeten their burdens.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, It will put a happiness into the relations in which we stand,
          for religion is the grand cement of society, and makes it most
          comfortable. The corruptions of men make them hurtful to one another,
          and this would cure them; under the enlightening and purifying
          influence of the gospel, "The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the
          leopard shall lie down with the kid: and the calf and the young lion,
          and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them."

          3. Meditate upon what you hear, and converse with one another about
          it.

          4. Set yourselves humbly to obey the truths delivered from the Lord's

          5. Put your hand to the Lord's work in your several stations in your
          families, and among those with whom you converse to prosecute the
          great ends of the gospel.

          Lastly, Let us live in love and unity; and as ever you would see the
          gospel do good in the place, beware of division, for unhappy is that
          minister and people between whom it creeps in, and little success or
          comfort can there be where it prevails. "Now the God of peace, that
          brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the
          sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect
          in every good work, to do his will, working in you that which is well
          pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory forever
          and ever. Amen."
