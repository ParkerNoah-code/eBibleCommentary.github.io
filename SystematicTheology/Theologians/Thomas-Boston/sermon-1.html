<p align="center"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>THE RESURRECTION<br/>

 </b></font></p>
<p align="justify">"Marvel not at this– for the hour is coming, in which <b>

    all</b> who are in the graves shall hear his voice– and shall come forth; 

    those who have done good, unto the <b>resurrection of life</b>; and those 

    who have done evil, unto the <b>resurrection of damnation</b>." John 5:28-29</p>
<p align="justify">These words are part of the defense which our Lord Jesus 

    Christ makes for himself, when persecuted by the Jews, for curing the 

    impotent man and ordering him to carry away his bed on the Sabbath; and for 

    vindicating his conduct, when accused by them of having thereby profaned 

    that day. On this occasion he professes himself not only the Lord of the 

    Sabbath, but also Lord of life and death; declaring, in the words of the 

    text, the resurrection of the dead to be brought to pass by his power. This 

    he introduces with these words, as with a solemn preface, "Marvel not at 

    this,"– at this strange discourse of mine– do not wonder to hear me, whose 

    appearance is so very base in your eyes; for the day is coming, in which the 

    dead shall be raised by my power.</p>
<p align="justify">Observe in this text, </p>
<p align="justify">1. The <b>doctrine</b> of the resurrection asserted, "All 

    that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth." The dead 

    bodies, which are reduced to dust, shall revive, and evidence life by 

    hearing and moving.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The <b>author</b> of it– Jesus Christ, "the Son of 

    man," verse 27. The dead shall hear his voice, and be raised thereby. </p>
<p align="justify">3. The <b>number</b> that shall be raised, "All that are 

    in the graves," that is, all the dead bodies of men, howsoever differently 

    disposed of, in different kinds of graves; or all the dead, good and bad. 

    They are not all buried in graves, properly so called– some are burnt to 

    ashes; some drowned, and buried in the bellies of fish; yes, some devoured 

    by man-eaters, called cannibals; but, wherever the matter or substance of 

    which the body was composed is to be found, thence they shall come forth.

    </p>
<p align="justify">4. The great <b>distinction</b> that shall be made 

    between the godly and the wicked– they shall indeed both rise again in the 

    resurrection. None of the godly shall be missing; though, perhaps, they 

    either had no burial, or a very obscure one; and all the wicked shall come 

    forth; their vaulted tombs shall hold them no longer than the voice is 

    uttered. But the former have a joyful resurrection to life, while the latter 

    have a dreadful resurrection to damnation. </p>
<p align="justify">5. The set <b>time</b> of this great event– there is an 

    hour, or certain fixed period of time, appointed of God for it. We are not 

    told when that hour will be, but that it is coming; for this, among other 

    reasons, that we may always be ready.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Doctrine. There shall be a resurrection of the dead.</p></b>

<p align="justify">In discoursing of this subject, I shall– </p>
<p align="justify">I. Show the <b>certainty</b> of the resurrection. </p>
<p align="justify">II. I shall inquire into the <b>nature</b> of it. </p>
<p align="justify">III. And, Lastly, make some <b>practical improvement</b> 

    of the whole.</p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">I. </p></b></font>In showing <font color="#ff0000"><b>the</b></font>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>CERTAINTY of the resurrection</b></font>, I shall 

    evince, 1. That God <b>can</b> raise the dead. 2. That he <b>will</b> do it; 

    which are the two grounds or topics laid down by Christ himself, when 

    disputing with the Sadducees, Matt. 22:29, "Jesus answered and said unto 

    them, you do err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God."
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Seeing God is almighty, surely he can raise the dead.</p></b></font> 

    We have instances of this powerful work of God, both in the Old and New 

    Testament. The son of the widow in Sarepta was raised from the dead, 1 Kings 

    17:22; the Shunammite's son, 2 Kings 4:35; and the man "cast into the 

    sepulcher of Elisha," chapter 13:21. In which we may observe a gradation, 

    the second of these miraculous events being more illustrious than the first, 

    and the third than the second. The first of these persons was raised when he 

    was but newly dead; the prophet Elijah, who raised him being present at his 

    decease. The second, when he had lain dead a considerable time; namely, 

    while his mother traveled from Shunem, to mount Carmel, reckoned about the 

    distance of sixteen miles, and returned from thence to her house, with 

    Elisha, who raised him. The last, not until they were burying him, and the 

    corpse was cast into the prophet's grave. In like manner, in the New 

    Testament, Jairus's daughter, Mark 5:41, and Dorcas, Acts 9:40, were both 

    raised to life, when lately dead; the widow's son in Nain, when they were 

    carrying him out to bury him, Luke 12:11-15; and Lazarus, when putrid in the 

    grave, John 11:39, 44.
<p align="justify">Can men make curious glasses out of ashes, reduce flowers 

    into ashes, and raise them again out of these ashes, restoring them to their 

    former beauty? And cannot the great Creator, who made all things of nothing, 

    raise man's body, after it is reduced into the dust? If it be objected, "How 

    can men's bodies be raised up again, after they are reduced to dust, and the 

    ashes of many generations are mingled together?" Scripture and reason 

    furnish the answer, "With men it is impossible, but not with God." It is 

    absurd for men to deny that God can do a thing, because they see not how it 

    may be done. How small a portion do we know of his ways! How absolutely 

    incapable are we of conceiving distinctly of the extent of almighty power, 

    and much more of comprehending its actings, and method of procedure! I 

    question not, but many illiterate men are as great unbelievers as to many 

    chemical experiments, as some learned men are to the doctrine of the 

    resurrection– and as these last are ready to deride the former, so, "the 

    Lord will have them in derision." </p>
<p align="justify">What a mystery was it to the Indians, that the Europeans 

    could, by a piece of paper, converse together at the distance of some 

    hundreds of miles! How much were they astonished to see them, with their 

    guns, produce as it were thunder and lightning in a moment, and at pleasure 

    kill men afar off! Shall some men do such things as are wonders in the eyes 

    of others because they cannot comprehend them, and <b>shall men confine the 

    infinite power of God within the narrow boundaries of their own shallow 

    capacities</b>, in a matter no ways contrary to reason! An inferior nature 

    has but a very imperfect conception of the power of a superior. Brutes do 

    not conceive of the actings of reason in men; and men have but imperfect 

    notions of the power of angels– how low and inadequate a conception, then, 

    must a finite nature have of the power of that which is infinite! Though we 

    cannot conceive how God acts, yet we ought to believe he can do above what 

    we can think or conceive.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, let the bodies of men be laid in the grave; 

    let them rot there, and be reduced into the most minute particles– or let 

    them be burnt, and the ashes cast into rivers, or thrown up into the air, to 

    be scattered by the wind– let the dust of a thousand generations be mingled, 

    and the steams of the dead bodies wander to and fro in the air– let birds or 

    wild beasts eat the bodies, or the fish of the sea devour them, so that the 

    parts of human bodies, thus destroyed, pass into substantial parts of birds, 

    beasts or fish; or, what is more that that, let man-eaters, who themselves 

    must die and rise again, devour human bodies, and let others devour them 

    again, and then let our modern Sadducees propose the questions in these 

    cases, as the ancient Sadducees did in the case of the woman who had been 

    married to seven husbands successively, Matt. 22:28. We answer, as our 

    blessed Lord and Savior did, ver. 29, "You do err, not knowing the 

    Scriptures, nor the power of God." We believe God to be omniscient and 

    omnipotent; infinite in knowledge and in power– and hence, agreeably to the 

    dictates of reason, we conclude the possibility of the resurrection, even in 

    the cases supposed.</p>
<p align="justify">Material things may change their forms and shapes, may be 

    reduced to the principles of which they are formed– but they are not 

    annihilated, or reduced to nothing; nor can they be so, by any created 

    power. God is omniscient, his understanding is infinite; therefore he knows 

    all things; what they were at any time, what they are, and where they are to 

    be found. Though the countryman, who comes into the apothecary's shop, 

    cannot find out the drug he wants; yet the apothecary himself knows what he 

    has in his shop, whence it came, and where it is to be found. And, in a 

    mixture of many different seeds, the expert gardener can distinguish between 

    each of them. Why then may not Omniscience distinguish between dust and 

    dust? Can he, who knows all things to perfection, be liable to any mistake 

    about his own creatures? Whoever believes an infinite understanding, must 

    needs own, that no mass of dust is so jumbled together, but God perfectly 

    comprehends, and infallibly knows, how the most minute particle, and every 

    one of them is to be matched. <br/>

 </p>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>
<p align="justify">II. </p></b></font>I shall inquire into <font color="#ff0000">
<b>the NATURE of the resurrection</b></font>, showing, 
<p align="justify">1. <b>Who</b> shall be raised. </p>
<p align="justify">2. <b>What</b> shall be raised. </p>
<p align="justify">3. <b>How</b> the dead shall be raised.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">1. WHO shall be raised?</p></b></font> Our text tells us who 

    they are; namely "all that are in the graves," that is, all mankind who are 

    dead. As for those people who are found alive at the second coming of 

    Christ, they shall not die, and soon after be raised again; but such a <b>

    change</b> shall suddenly pass upon them as shall be to them instead of 

    dying and rising again; so that their bodies shall become like lo those 

    bodies which are raised out of their graves, 1 Cor. 15:51, 52, "We shall not 

    all sleep, but we shall all be changed– in a moment, in the twinkling of an 

    eye." Hence those who are to be judged at the great day, are distinguished 

    into living and dead, Acts 10:42. All the dead shall arise, whether godly or 

    wicked, just or unjust, Acts 24:15, old or young; the whole race of mankind, 

    even those who never saw the sun, but died in their mother's womb– Rev. 

    20:12, "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God." The sea and 

    earth shall give up their dead without reserve, none shall be kept back.
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">2. WHAT shall be raised? </p></b></font>The <b>bodies</b> of 

    mankind. A man is said to die, when the soul is separated from the body, 

    "and returns onto God who gave it," Eccl. 12:7. But it is the body only 

    which is laid in the grave, and can be properly said to be raised– therefore 

    the resurrection, strictly speaking, applies to the body only. Moreover, it 

    is the <b>same</b> body that dies, which shall rise again. At the 

    resurrection, men shall not appear with other bodies, as to substance, than 

    those which they now have, and which are laid down in the grave; but with 

    the self-same bodies, endowed with other qualities. The very notion of a 

    resurrection implies this, since nothing can be said to rise again, but that 

    which falls. 
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">3. HOW shall the dead be raised?</p></b></font> The same 

    Jesus, who was crucified outside the gates of Jerusalem, shall, at the last 

    day, to the conviction of all, be declared both Lord and Christ– appearing 

    as Judge of the world, attended with his mighty angels, 2 Thess. 1:7, "He 

    shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and 

    with the trumpet of God," 1 Thess. 4:16, "The trumpet shall sound, and the 

    dead shall be raised, and those who are alive, changed," 1 Cor. 15:52. 

    Whether this shout, voice, and trumpet, denote some audible voice, or only 

    the workings of Divine power, for the raising of the dead, and other 

    dreadful purposes of that day, though the former seems probable, I will not 

    positively determine. There is no question but this coming of the Judge of 

    the world will be in greater majesty and terror than we can conceive– yet 

    that dreadful grandeur, majesty, and state, which was displayed at the 

    giving of the law, namely, thunders heard, lightnings, and a thick cloud 

    upon the mount seen, the Lord descending in fire, the whole mount quaking 

    greatly, and the voice of the trumpet waxing louder and louder, Exod. 

    19:16-19, may help us to form a becoming thought of it. However, the sound 

    of this trumpet shall be heard all the world over; it shall reach to the 

    depths of the sea, and of the earth. At this loud alarm, bones shall come 

    together, bone to his bone– the scattered dust of all the dead shall be 

    gathered together, dust to his dust; "neither shall one thrust another, they 

    shall walk every one in his path;" and, meeting together again, shall make 

    up that very same body which crumbled into dust in the grave. At the same 

    alarming voice shall every soul come again into its own body, never more to 

    be separated. The dead can stay no longer in their graves, but must bid an 

    eternal farewell to their long homes– they hear His voice, and must come 

    forth, and receive their final sentence.
<p align="justify">Now as there is a great difference between the godly and 

    the wicked, in their life, and in their death; so will there be also in 

    their resurrection.</p>
<p align="justify">The godly shall be raised out of their graves, by virtue 

    of the Spirit of Christ, the blessed bond of their union with him, Rom. 

    8:11, "He that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your 

    mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwells in you." Jesus Christ arose from 

    the dead, as the "first-fruits of those who slept," 1 Cor. 15:20, So those 

    who are Christ's shall follow at his coming, ver. 23. The mystical head 

    having got above the waters of death, he cannot but bring forth the members 

    after him, in due time.</p>
<p align="justify">They shall come forth with inexpressible joy; for then 

    shall that passage of Scripture, which, in its immediate scope, respected 

    the Babylonish captivity, be fully accomplished in its most extensive 

    meaning, Isa. 26:19, "Awake and sing, you that dwell in the dust." As a 

    bride adorned for her husband, goes forth of her bedchamber unto the 

    marriage– so shall the saints go forth of their graves, unto the marriage of 

    the Lamb. Joseph had a joyful coming out from the prison, Daniel from the 

    lion's den, and Jonah from the whale's belly– yet these are but faint 

    representations of the saint's coming forth from the grave, at the 

    resurrection. Then shall they sing the song of Moses and of the Lamb, in 

    highest strains; death being quite swallowed up in victory. They had, while 

    in this life, sometimes sung, by faith the triumphant song over death and 

    the grave, "O death, where is your sting? O grave where is your victory?" 

    But then they sing the same, from sight and sense; the black band of doubts 

    and fears, which frequently disturbed them, and disturbed their minds, is 

    forever dispersed and driven away.</p>
<p align="justify">May we not suppose the soul and body of every saint, as 

    in mutual embraces, to rejoice in each other, and triumph in their happy 

    meeting again; and <b>the BODY to address the soul thus– </b>"O my soul, 

    have we got together again, after so long a separation! are you come back to 

    your old habitation, never more to remove! O joyful meeting! how unlike is 

    our present state to what our case was, when a separation was made between 

    us at death! Now is our mourning turned into joy; the light and gladness 

    sown before, are now sprung up; and there is a perpetual spring in 

    Immanuel's land. Blessed be the day in which I was united to you; whose 

    chief care was to get Christ in us the hope of glory, and to make me a 

    temple for his Holy Spirit. O blessed soul, which in the time of our 

    pilgrimage, kept your eye to the land then afar off, but now near at hand! 

    you took me into secret places, and there made me to bow these knees before 

    the Lord, that I might bear a part in our humiliation before him– and now is 

    the time that I am lifted up. You did employ this tongue in confessions, 

    petitions, and thanksgivings, which henceforth shall be employed in praising 

    for evermore. You made these sometimes weeping eyes, sow that seed of tears, 

    which is now sprung up in joy that shall never end. I was happily beat down 

    by you, and kept in subjection, while others pampered their flesh, and made 

    their bellies their gods, to their own destruction– but now I gloriously 

    arise, to take my place in the mansions of glory, while they are dragged out 

    of their graves to be cast into fiery flames. Now, my soul, you shall 

    complain no more of a sick and pained body; you shall be no more clogged 

    with weak and weary flesh; I shall now keep pace with you in the praises of 

    our God for evermore." </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And may not the SOUL say– </p></b>"O happy day in which I 

    return to dwell in that blessed body, which was, and is, and will be 

    forever, a member of Christ, a temple of the Holy Spirit! Now I shall be 

    eternally knit to you– the silver cord shall never be loosed more– death 

    shall never make another separation between us. Arise then, my body, and 

    come away! And let these eyes, which were used to weep over my sins, behold 

    with joy the face of our glorious Redeemer; lo! this is our God, and we have 

    waited for him. Let these ears, which were used to hear the word of life in 

    the temple below, come and hear the hallelujahs in the temple above. Let 

    these feet, that carried me to the congregation of saints on earth, take 

    their place among those in heaven. And let this tongue, which confessed 

    Christ before men, and used to be still dropping something to his 

    commendation, join the choir of the upper house, in his praises for 

    evermore. You shall fast no more, but keep an everlasting feast; you shall 

    weep no more, neither shall your countenance be overclouded; but you shall 

    shine forever, as a star in the skies. We took part together in the fight; 

    come, let us go together to receive and wear the crown."
<p align="justify">But on the other hand, the WICKED shall be raised by the 

    power of Christ, as a just Judge, who is to render vengeance to his enemies. 

    The same divine power which shut up their souls in hell, and kept their 

    bodies in the grave, as in a prison, shall bring them forth, that soul and 

    body together may receive the dreadful sentence of eternal damnation, and be 

    shut up together in the prison of hell.</p>
<p align="justify">They shall come forth from their graves with unspeakable 

    horror and consternation. They shall be dragged forth, as so many 

    malefactors out of a dungeon, to be led to execution crying to the mountains 

    and to the rocks to fall on them, and hide them from the face of the Lamb. 

    Fearful was the cry in Egypt, that night on which the destroying angel went 

    through, and slew their first-born. Dreadful were the shouts, at the earth 

    opening her mouth, and swallowing up Dathan and Abiram, and all that 

    appertained to them. What hideous crying then must there be, when at the 

    sound of the last trumpet, the earth and sea shall open their mouths, and 

    cast forth all the wicked world, delivering them up to the dreadful Judge! 

    How will they cry, roar, and tear themselves! How will the jovial companions 

    weep and howl, and curse one another! How will the earth be filled with 

    their doleful shrieks and lamentations, while they are pulled out like sheep 

    for the slaughter! </p>
<p align="justify">They who, while they lived in this world, were profane, 

    debauchees, covetous worldlings, or formal hypocrites, shall then, in 

    anguish of mind, wring their hands, beat their breasts, and bitterly lament 

    their case, roaring forth their complaints, and calling themselves beasts, 

    fools, and madmen, for having acted so mad a part in this life, in not 

    believing what they then heard. They were driven away in their wickedness at 

    death– and now all their sins rise with them; and, like so many serpents, 

    twist themselves about their wretched souls, and bodies too, which have a 

    frightful meeting, after a long separation.</p>
<p align="justify">Then we may suppose <b>the miserable BODY thus to accost 

    the soul– </b>"Have you again found me, O mine enemy, my worst enemy, savage 

    soul, more cruel than a thousand tigers. Cursed be the day that ever we met. 

    O that I had remained a lifeless lump, rotted in the womb of my mother, and 

    had never received sense, life, and motion! O that I had rather been the 

    body of a toad, or serpent, than your body; for then had I lain still, and 

    had not seen this terrible day. If I was to be necessarily yours, O that I 

    had been your donkey, or one of your dogs, rather than your body; for then 

    would you have taken more true care of me than you did! O cruel kindness! 

    have you thus hugged me to death, thus nourished me to the slaughter? Is 

    this the effect of your tenderness for me? Is this what I am to reap of your 

    pains and concern about me? What do riches and pleasures avail now, when 

    this fearful reckoning is come! of which you had fair warning? O cruel 

    grave! why did you not close your mouth upon me forever? Why did you not 

    hold fast your prisoner? Why have you shaken me out, while I lay still and 

    was at rest? Cursed soul, wherefore did you not abide in your place, wrapped 

    up in flames of fire? Wherefore are you come back, to take me also down to 

    the bars of the pit? You made me an instrument of unrighteousness; and now I 

    must be thrown into the fire. This tongue was by you employed in mocking at 

    religion, cursing, swearing, lying, backbiting, and boasting; and withheld 

    from glorifying God– and now it must not have so much as a drop of water to 

    cool it in the flames! You withdrew mine ears from hearing the sermons which 

    gave warning of this day. You found ways and means to stop them from 

    attending to seasonable exhortations, admonitions, and reproofs. But why did 

    you not stop them from hearing the sound of this dreadful trumpet? Why do 

    you not rove and fly away on the wings of imagination, thereby, as it were, 

    transporting me during these frightful transactions; as you were used to do, 

    when I was set down at sermons, communions, prayers, and godly conferences; 

    that I might now have as little sense of the one, as I formerly had of the 

    other? But ah! I must burn forever, for your love to your lusts, your 

    profanity, your sensuality, your unbelief, and hypocrisy." </p>
<p align="justify">But may not <b>the SOUL answer–</b> "Wretched and vile 

    carcass! I am now driven back into you. O that you had lain forever in your 

    grave! Had I not torment enough before? Must I be knit to you again, that, 

    being joined together as two dry sticks for the fire, the wrath of God may 

    burn us up? It was by caring for you, that I lost myself. It was your 

    appetites, and the gratifying of your senses, which ruined me. How often was 

    I ensnared by your ears! how often betrayed by your eyes! It was to spare 

    you, that I neglected opportunities of making peace with God, loitered away 

    Sabbaths, lived in the neglect of prayer; went to the house of mirth, rather 

    than to the house of mourning; and that I chose to deny Christ, and forsake 

    his cause and interest in the world; and so am fallen a sacrifice to your 

    cursed ease. When at any time my conscience began to awake, and I was 

    setting myself to think of my sins, and the misery which I have felt since 

    we parted, and now feel, it was you that diverted me from these thoughts, 

    and drew me off to make provision for you. O wretched flesh! by your silken 

    cords of fleshly lusts, I was drawn to destruction, in defiance of my light 

    and conscience– but now they are turned into iron chains, with which I am to 

    be held under wrath for evermore. Ah wretched profits! ah cursed pleasures! 

    for which I must lie forever in utter darkness!"</p>
<p align="justify">But no complaints will then avail. O that men were wise, 

    that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!</p>

    INCORRUPTIBLE.</p></b></font> They are now, as the bodies of others, a mass of 

    corruption, full of the seeds of diseases and death; and, when dead, become 

    so offensive, even to their dearest friends, that they must be buried out of 

    their sight, and cast into the grave, where they are to rot, and be 

    consumed– yes, loathsome sores and diseases make some of them very 

    unsightly, even while alive. But, at the resurrection, they leave all the 

    seeds of corruption behind them in the grave; and rise incorruptible, 

    incapable of the least indisposition, sickness, or sore, and much more, of 

    dying. External violences and inward causes of pain, shall forever cease– 

    they shall feel it no more– yes, they shall have an everlasting youth and 

    vigor, being no more subject to the decays which age produced in this life.
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">2. They shall be GLORIOUS bodies</p></b></font>; not only 

    beautiful, lovely, and well-proportioned, but full of splendor and 

    brightness. The most beautiful face, and best proportioned body, that now 

    appears in the world, is not to be named in comparison with the body of the 

    lowest saint at the resurrection; for "then shall the righteous shine forth 

    as the sun," Matt. 13:43. If there was a dazzling glory on Moses' face, when 

    he came down from the mount; and if Stephen's face was "as it had been the 

    face of an angel," when he stood before the council; how much more shall the 

    faces of the saints be beautiful and glorious, full of sweet agreeable 

    majesty, when they have put off all corruption, and shine as the sun! But 

    observe, this beauty of the saints is not restricted to their faces, but 

    diffuses itself through their whole bodies– for the whole body is raised in 

    glory, and shall be fashioned like unto their Lord and Savior's glorious 

    body, in whose transfiguration, not only did his face shine as the sun, but 

    his clothing also was white as the light, Matt. 17: 2. Whatever defects or 

    deformities the bodies of the saints had when laid in the grave, occasioned 

    by accidents in life, or arising from secret causes in their formation in 

    the womb, they shall rise out of the grave free of all these. 
<p align="justify">But suppose the marks of the Lord Jesus, the scars or 

    prints of the wounds and bruises which some of the saints received while on 

    earth, for his sake, should remain in their bodies after the resurrection; 

    the same as the print of the nails remained in the Lord Jesus' body after 

    his resurrection– these marks will rather be badges of distinction, and add 

    to their glory, than detract from their beauty. But however that be, surely 

    Isaac's eyes shall not then be dim, nor will Jacob halt– Leah shall not be 

    tender-eyed, nor Mephibosheth lame of his legs. For as the goldsmith melts 

    down the old broken vessel, and casts it over again in a new mold, bringing 

    it forth with a new luster; so shall the vile body, which lay dissolved in 

    the grave, come forth at the resurrection, in perfect beauty and lovely 

    proportion.</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">3. They shall be POWERFUL and strong bodies. </p></b></font>

    The strongest men on earth, being frail and mortal, may justly be reckoned 

    weak and feeble; for their strength, however great, is quickly worn out and 

    consumed. Many of the saints now have weaker bodies than others; but "the 

    feeble among them," to allude to Zechariah 12:8, at that day shall be "as 

    David, and the house of David shall be as God." A grave divine says, that 

    one shall be stronger at the resurrection than a hundred, yes, than 

    thousands are now. Certainly great, and vastly great, must the strength of 

    glorified bodies be; for they shall bear up under an exceeding and eternal 

    weight of glory. The mortal body is not at all adapted to such a state. Do 

    transports of joy occasion death, as well as excessive grief, and can it 

    bear up under a weight of glory? Can it exist in union with a soul filled 

    with heaven's rapture? Surely not. The mortal body would sink under that 

    load, and such fullness of joy would make the earthen pitcher to fly all in 

    pieces.
<p align="justify">The Scripture has plainly told us, "That flesh and 

    blood," namely, in their present frail state, though it were the flesh and 

    blood of a giant, "cannot inherit the kingdom of God," 1 Cor. 15:50. How 

    strong must the bodily eyes be, which, to the soul's eternal comfort, shall 

    behold the dazzling glory and splendor of the New Jerusalem; and steadfastly 

    look at the transcendent glory and brightness of the man Christ, the Lamb, 

    who is the light of that city, the inhabitants whereof shall shine as the 

    sun! The Lord of heaven does now in mercy "hold back the face of his throne, 

    and spreads his clouds upon it;" that mortals may not be confounded with the 

    rays of glory which shine forth from it, Job 26:9. But then the veil shall 

    be removed, and they made able to behold it, to their unspeakable joy. How 

    strong must their bodies be, who shall not rest night nor day, but be, 

    without intermission, forever employed in the heavenly temple, to sing and 

    proclaim the praises of God without weariness, which is a weakness incident 

    to the frail mortal, but not to the glorified body!</p>
<font color="#008000"><b>
<p align="justify">4. They shall be SPIRITUAL bodies.</p></b></font> Not that 

    they shall be changed into spirits, but they shall be spiritual as to their 

    spirit-like qualities and endowments. The body shall be absolutely 

    subservient to the soul, subject to it, and influenced by it, and therefore 

    no more a clog to its activity, nor the animal appetites a snare to it. 

    There will be no need to beat it down, nor to drag it to the service of God. 

    The soul, in this life is so much influenced by the body, that, in Scripture 

    style, it is said to be carnal; but then the body shall be spiritual, 

    readily serving the soul in the business of heaven, and in that only, as if 

    it had no more relation to earth than a spirit. It will have no further need 

    of the now necessary supports of life, namely, food, and clothing, and the 

    like. "They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more," Rev. 7:16. "For 

    in the resurrection, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are 

    as the angels of God in heaven." Then shall the saints be strong without 

    food or drink, warm without clothes, ever in perfect health without 

    medicine, and ever fresh and vigorous, though they shall never sleep, but 

    serve him night and day in his temple, Rev. 7:15. They will need none of 

    these things, any more than spirits do. They will be nimble and active as 

    spirits, and of a most refined constitution. The body, that is now lumpish 

    and heavy, shall then be most sprightly. No such thing as melancholy shall 

    be found to make the heart heavy, and the spirits flag and sink. I shall not 

    further dip into this matter– the day will declare it.
<p align="justify">As to <font color="#008000"><b>the qualities of the 

    bodies of the WICKED at the resurrection</b></font>, I find the Scripture 

    speaks but little of them. Whatever they may <b>need</b>, they shall not get 

    a drop of water to cool their tongues, Luke 16:24, 25. Whatever may be said 

    of their weakness, it is certain they will be continued forever in life, 

    that they may be ever dying; they shall bear up, however unwillingly under 

    the load of God's wrath, and shall not faint away under it. "The smoke of 

    their torment ascends up forever and ever. And they have no rest day nor 

    night." Surely they shall not partake of the glory and beauty of the saints. 

    All their glory dies with them, and shall never rise again. Daniel tells us, 

    they shall awake to shame and everlasting contempt, chap. 12:2. Shame 

    follows sin, as the shadow follows the body. </p>
<p align="justify">But the wicked in this world walk in the dark, and often 

    under a disguise– nevertheless, when the Judge comes in flaming fire at the 

    last day, they will be brought to the light; their mask will be taken off, 

    and the <b>shame</b> of their nakedness will clearly appear to themselves 

    and others, and fill their faces with confusion. Their shame will be too 

    deep for blushes– all faces shall gather blackness at that day, when they 

    shall go forth from their graves, as malefactors out of their prisons to 

    execution– for their resurrection is the resurrection of damnation. The 

    greatest beauties, who now pride themselves in their loveliness of body, not 

    regarding their deformed souls, will then appear with a ghastly countenance, 

    a grim and death-like visage. Their looks will be frightful, and they will 

    be horrible spectacles, coming forth from their graves, like infernal furies 

    out of the pit. </p>
<p align="justify">They shall rise also to everlasting <b>contempt</b>. They 

    shall then be the most contemptible creatures, filled with contempt from 

    God, as vessels of dishonor, whatever honorable employments they had in this 

    world; and filled also with contempt from men. They will be most despicable 

    in the eyes of the saints; even of those saints who gave them honor here, 

    either for their high station, the gifts of God in them, or because they 

    were of the same human nature with themselves. But then their bodies shall 

    be as so many loathsome carcasses, which they shall go forth and look upon 

    with abhorrence; yes, "They shall be an abhorring unto all flesh," Isaiah 

    66:24. The word here rendered "an abhorring," is the same which in the other 

    text is rendered "contempt," and Isaiah and Daniel point at one and the same 

    thing, namely, the <b>loathsomeness</b> of the wicked at the resurrection. 

    They will be loathsome in the eyes of one another. The unclean wretches were 

    never so lovely to each other, and then they will be loathsome; dear 

    companions in sin will then abhor each other; and the great and honorable 

    men who were wicked, shall be no more regarded by their wicked subjects, 

    their servants, their slaves, than the mire in the streets.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use I. Of COMFORT to the people of God. </p></b></font>The 

    doctrine of the resurrection is a spring of consolation and joy unto you. 

    Think on it, O believers, when you are in the house of mourning, for the 

    loss of your godly relations or friends, "that you sorrow not, even as 

    others which have no hope;" for you will meet again, 1 Thess. 4:13, 14. They 

    are but laid down to <b>rest</b> in their beds for a little while, Isa. 

    57:2; but in the morning of the resurrection they will awake again, and come 

    forth out of their graves. The vessel of honor was but coarse, it had much 

    alloy of base metal in it; it was too weak, too dim and inglorious, for the 

    upper house, whatever luster it had in the lower one. It was cracked, it was 

    polluted; and therefore it must be melted down, to be refined and fashioned 

    more gloriously. Do but wait a while, and you shall see it come forth out of 

    the furnace of earth, vying with the stars in brightness; no, as the sun 

    when he goes forth in his might. Have you laid your infant children in the 

    grave? You will see them again. Your God calls himself "the God of your 

    seed;" which, according to our Savior's exposition, secures the glorious 

    resurrection of the body. Therefore, let the covenant you embraced for 

    yourselves and your babes now in the dust, comfort your heart, in the joyful 

    expectation, that by virtue thereof, they shall be raised up in glory– and 

    that as being no more infants of days, but brought to a full and perfect 

    stature, as generally supposed. 
<p align="justify">Be not discouraged by reason of a weak and sickly body– 

    there is a day coming, when you shall be entirely whole. At the 

    resurrection, Timothy shall bo no more liable to his often infirmities; his 

    body, that was weak and sickly, even in youth, shall be raised in power. 

    Lazarus shall healthy and sound, his body being raised incorruptible. 

    Although perhaps, your weakness will not allow you now to go one furlong to 

    meet the Lord in public ordinances, yet the day comes, when your body shall 

    be no more a clog to you, but you shall "meet the Lord in the air," 1 Thess. 

    4:17. It will be with the saints coming up from the grave, as with the 

    Israelites when they came out of Egypt– "There was not one feeble person 

    among their tribes." </p>
<p align="justify">Have you an unlovely or deformed body? There is a glory 

    within, which will then set all right without, according to all the desire 

    of your heart. It shall rise a glorious, beautiful, handsome, and 

    well-proportioned body. It's unloveliness or deformities may go with it to 

    the grave, but they shall not come back with it. O that those, who are now 

    so desirous to be beautiful and handsome, would not be too hasty to effect 

    it with their foolish and sinful arts, but wait and study the heavenly art 

    of beautifying the body, by endeavoring now to become all glorious within, 

    with the graces of God's Spirit! This would at length make them admirable 

    and everlasting beauties. You must indeed, O believer, grapple with death, 

    and shall get the first fall– but you shall rise again, and come off 

    victorious at last. You must go down to the grave; but, though it be your <b>

    long</b> home, it will not be your <b>everlasting</b> home. You will not 

    hear the voice of your friends there; but you shall hear the voice of Christ 

    there. You may be carried there with mourning, but you shall come up from it 

    rejoicing. Your friends, indeed, will leave you there, but your God will 

    not. What God said to Jacob, concerning his going down to Egypt, Gen. 46:3, 

    4, he says to you, on your going down to the grave, "Fear not to go down– I 

    will go down with you– and I will also surely bring you up again." O solid 

    comfort! O glorious hopes! "Therefore comfort" yourselves, and "one another 

    with these words," 1 Thess. 4:18.</p>
<font color="#0000ff"><b>
<p align="justify">Use 2. Of TERROR to all unregenerate men.</p></b></font> You 

    who are yet in your natural state, look at this view of the eternal state; 

    and consider what will be your part in it, if you be not in time brought 

    into a state of grace. Think, O sinner, on that day when the trumpet shall 

    sound, at the voice of which the bars of the pit shall be broken asunder, 

    the doors of the grave shall fly open, the devouring depths of the sea shall 

    throw up their dead, the earth cast forth hers; and death every where, in 

    the excess of astonishment, shall let go its prisoners; and your wretched 

    soul and body shall be re-united, to be summoned before the tribunal of God. 

    Then, if you had a thousand worlds at your disposal, you would gladly give 

    them all away, on condition that you might lie still in your grave, with the 

    hundredth part of that ease, with which you have sometimes lain at home on 

    the Lord's day; or, if that cannot be obtained, that you might be but a 

    spectator of the transactions of that day; as you have been at some solemn 

    occasions, and rich gospel feasts; or, if even that is not to be purchased, 

    that a mountain or a rock might fall on you, and cover you from the face of 

    the Lamb. 
<p align="justify">Ah! how are men infatuated, thus to trifle away their 

    precious time of life, in almost as little concern about death, as if they 

    were like the beasts that perish! Some will be telling where their corpse 

    must be laid; while yet they have not seriously considered, whether their 

    graves shall be their <b>beds</b>, where they shall awake with joy, in the 

    morning of the resurrection; or their <b>prisons</b>, out of which they 

    shall be brought to receive the fearful sentence. Remember, now is your 

    seed-time; and as yon sow, so shall you reap. God's seed-time begins at 

    death; and at the resurrection, the bodies of the wicked, that were sown 

    "full of sins, that lie down with them in the dust," Job 20:11, shall spring 

    up again– sinful, wretched, and vile. </p>
<p align="justify">Your bodies, which are now instruments of sin, the Lord 

    will lay aside for fire, at death, and bring them forth for the fire, at the 

    resurrection. That body, which is now employed in God's service, but is 

    abused by uncleanness and lasciviousness, will then be brought forth in all 

    its vileness, thenceforth to lodge with unclean spirits. The body of the 

    drunkard shall then stagger, by reason of the wine of the wrath of God 

    poured out to him, and poured into him, without mixture. Those who now 

    please themselves in their reveling, will reel to and fro and another rate, 

    when, instead of their songs and music, they shall hear the sound of the 

    last trumpet. Many weary their bodies for worldly gain, who will be loath to 

    distress them for the benefit of their souls; by labor, unreasonably hard, 

    they will quite unfit themselves for the service of God; and, when they have 

    done, will reckon it a very good reason for shifting duty, that they are 

    already tired out with other business; but that day comes, when they will be 

    made to abide a yet greater distress. Many will go several miles for food 

    and clothing, who will not go half the way for the good of their immortal 

    souls; many will be sickly and unable on the Lord's day, who will be 

    tolerably well all the rest of the week. </p>
<p align="justify">But when that trumpet sounds, the dead shall find their 

    feet, and none shall be missing in that congregation. When the bodies of the 

    saints shine as the sun; frightful will the looks of their persecutors be. 

    Fearful will their condition be, who shut up the saints in nasty prisons, 

    stigmatized, burnt them to ashes, hanged them, and stuck up their heads and 

    hands in public places, to frighten others from the way of righteousness, 

    which they suffered for. Many faces, now fair, will then gather blackness. 

    They shall be no more admired and caressed for that beauty, which has a worm 

    at the root, that will cause it to issue in loathsomeness and deformity. Ah! 

    what is that beauty, under which there lurks a monstrous, deformed, and 

    graceless heart? What, but a sorry paint, a slight varnish; which will leave 

    the body so much the more ugly, before that flaming fire, in which the Judge 

    shall be "revealed from heaven, taking vengeance on them that know not God, 

    and that obey not the gospel?" 2 Thess. 1:7, 8. They shall be stripped of 

    all their ornaments, and not have a rag to cover their nakedness– their 

    carcasses shall be an abhorrence to all flesh, and serve as a foil to set 

    off the beauty and glory of the righteous, and make it appear the brighter.</p>
<p align="justify">Now is the time to secure, for yourselves, a part in the 

    resurrection of the just– which if you would do, unite with Jesus Christ by 

    faith, rising spiritually from sin, and glorifying God with your bodies. He 

    is the "resurrection and the life," John 11:25. If your bodies be members of 

    Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit, they shall certainly arise in glory. Get 

    into this ark now, and you shall come forth with joy into the new world. 

    Rise from your sins; cast away these grave-clothes, putting off your former 

    lusts. How can anyone imagine, that those who continue dead while they live, 

    shall come forth, at the last day, unto the resurrection of life? But that 

    will be the privilege of all those who, having first consecrated their souls 

    and bodies to the Lord by faith, do glorify him with their bodies, as well 

    as their souls; living and acting to him, and for him, yes, and suffering 

    for him too, when he calls them to it.</p>
