        </p>
        <p align="justify">Psalm 122:6, "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem."</p>
        <p align="justify">
          THIS psalm seems to have been penned when the ark had been newly
          brought to Jerusalem, and set up in the tabernacle which David pitched
          for it. Now it was in a fixed place, after it had been in several
          places. See 2 Samuel 6:7; 1 Chronicles 15:17. In the text we have, 1.
          A duty; namely, prayer. 2. A particular part of the matter of prayer;
          "the piece of Jerusalem." This city was now in peace, and the
          continuance of it is to be desired. In Jerusalem now were the
          tabernacle and the ark, and the solemn assemblies for worship. In this
          respect it was a type of the church.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. It is the duty of all church members, to pray for the peace
          of the church. Let us,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">I. Show what this peace is.</p>
        <p align="justify">II. Give reasons why we should pray for it.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. We are to show what this peace is. It consists in these two:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The removal of evils from the church of Christ. Many are the evils
          to which the church is liable, while here; and therefore she as a
          city, must have her walls, bulwarks, soldiers, and watchmen. It is
          Jerusalem above, only, which is past hazard. "The gates of it shall
          not be shut at all by day, for there shall be no night there."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The enjoyment of positive blessings. Her peace includes her
          prosperity; that she be in a prosperous condition, not standing still,
          not going backward. "Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within
          your palaces." All kingdoms and states have their revolutions. One
          while they prosper, another they are in adversity. Jerusalem's
          prosperity is spiritual. It is produced by the light of God's
          countenance, and by the communications of his grace. When under these,
          the children of Zion grow in knowledge, holiness, and comfort, and
          enjoy all their privileges undisturbed; then Jerusalem has peace.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. We are to give reasons why we are to pray for the peace of
          Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because God commands us not to hold our peace, until we see her
          peace. This command is express in the text. Says God by Isaiah, "I
          have set watchmen upon your walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold
          their peace, day nor night; you that make mention of the Lord, keep
          not silence; and give him no rest, until he establish, and until he
          make Jerusalem a praise in the earth." Therefore the prophet himself,
          is peremptory as to this duty. "For Zion's sake will I not hold my
          peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the
          righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation
          thereof, as a lamp that burns."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because of her relation to the God of peace. This should not only
          engage us to pray, but may encourage us to hope for her peace at
          length. The church is confederate with God, in a covenant of peace.
          She is the house of God. The city of the great King. The object of his
          special providence. "Behold he who keeps Israel, shall neither slumber
          nor sleep."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because of her relation to the Prince of Peace. The church is
          Christ's spouse, his body, she is built on him, she is his special
          charge from the Father; and is it not reasonable that the children be
          concerned for the peace of their mother, and the members for the body
          to which they belong. The nearer relation any of us have to Christ,
          the more should be our concern for the peace of Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Because her peace is purchased at a dear rate, even the blood of
          the Mediator of peace. "We are made near by the blood of Christ, for
          he is our peace." Not only her inward, but her outward peace. Will not
          we pour out a prayer for that, for which Christ poured out his blood?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Because she has many enemies without, ready on all occasions to
          disturb her peace. The enemy watches at her gates, ready on all
          occasions to break in. The devil has an army of wicked men, constantly
          in arms and pay, to fight against the church. The war was begun by
          Cain, but the sword is never yet put up, not will be to the end of the
          world. As one race of wicked men goes off another takes up their
          weapons, and stand in their place.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Because she has disturbers of her peace within. There are
          hypocrites in her bosom, ready to betray the spouse, as Judas did his
          Lord. There are corruptions in the best; so that Jerusalem is often
          made to suffer by earthquakes, by reason of what is enclosed in her
          own affections.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 1. Of reproof to those who are not concerned for the peace of
          Jerusalem. Some pray not at all. Some are longing to see Jerusalem in
          confusion, laid in heaps, and her ways filled with mourning. They are
          so far from praying for the church, that they would gladly make a prey
          of her, Isaiah 59:15. And seeing they are not acquaint with praying,
          they will drink her confusion, of which they have more skill than of
          praying. But if that would have done it, we would have all been
          confounded long since. Some pray, but Oh! they are not concerned for
          the church of Christ that is in hazard at this day. Consider that this
          neglect,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Is a sign that you have little or no love to Jerusalem, when you
          see her hazard, and pray not for her peace. When the dumb son of
          Crœsus, saw his father likely to be killed, his affection to his
          father loosed his tongue, and made him cry out that they might spare
          his father.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. That you have no interest in Jerusalem, in Christ, and ordinances.
          Were your stock in a ship at sea, how would you be concerned for her
          coming safe into the harbor. They that have a lamb in the flock, love
          all the rest the better. Interest makes a man concerned. The
          Christian's all is at stake, when Jerusalem is in hazard.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. You have little or nothing of the Spirit of Christ in you, and they
          that have not his Spirit, are none of his. The chief concern of the
          Lord Jesus, next to the glory of his Father, was the good of his
          church, John 17. He who touches them, touches the apple of his eye.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE 2. Of exhortation. I exhort you all to pray for the peace of our
          Jerusalem at this day. The dispensations of providence call you to it.
          Four things are implied in the exhortation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Be sensible of the danger of Jerusalem. There is no prayer in
          Heaven, because no danger there; and there will be no prayers on
          earth, where people see no danger. If any think that the church of
          Christ is not in danger this day, I will more suspect their honesty
          than admire their wisdom. What sins that ever brought judgments on a
          church, that are not to be found among us? Leaving our first love,
          lukewarmness, men's abhorring the offering of the Lord, dreadful
          profanity, and the like. Matters are at such a pass, that we are like
          the children of Israel at the Red Sea; go we forward or backward,
          there is danger, if God do not wonderfully prevent it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Highly prize the peace of Jerusalem. If people do not value it,
          they will not go to God in earnest with it. We should have such a
          concern for it as would swallow up our concern for other things; for
          if God depart from us, nothing will make up that loss. All the wealth
          of the Indies, is nothing in comparison of the worth of the gospel, or
          the purity of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Pray for it. Wrestle with God in prayer about it. Give it a large
          share in your prayers; nay, make it your very chief business, when you
          go to God. pray,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. For our Jerusalem's peace with God; the church's peace with Heaven
          God has a controversy with Scotland. He is angry with our mother,
          because of her whoredoms. The evidence of it is our spiritual poverty,
          occasioned by a decay of trade with Heaven, whence all the wealth of
          the people of God comes. This says our peace with Heaven is
          interrupted, and the reasons of it are palpable, even the sins of
          former and present times, covenant breaking, unfruitfulness under the
          gospel.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          O! that the nations of Scotland and England were so wise, as to lay to
          heart the avowed breach which they made with God, and that they are
          still making. And O that an uniting with Heaven were set on foot, by
          repentance and reformation, and then they might think to unite among
          themselves on lasting foundations.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Pray for the peace of the protectors of Jerusalem. For the queen,
          under the shadow of whose authority, we have the peaceable enjoyment
          of gospel ordinances in purity and plenty, Isaiah 49:23. When the Lord
          took away our nursing father, he raised up a nursing mother, and
          disappointed the hopes of enemies. Pray for the parliament, their
          peace with God and among themselves, in the Lord, 1 Timothy 2:1–2.
          They have need of prayers, especially while such great things are
          before them, as now are in agitation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem with her protectors; the peace of
          the church with the state, Psalm 72:3. Though we have our church
          privileges from Christ, we have from them the peaceable enjoyment of
          them. And discord between nursing fathers and the child, is a very
          dismal thing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Pray for the peace of the temple in Jerusalem; for the peaceable
          enjoyment of gospel ordinances. They are sad days, when the Lord's
          people are in such a case as to fear the mingling of their blood with
          their sacrifices. It is a promise, though not absolute, "Though the
          Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet
          shall not your teachers be removed into a corner any more, but your
          eyes shall see your teachers." If people have other troubles, yet it
          is a great matter, when they have the comfort of ordinances left them.
          Coarse fare may go better down, when people are permitted to drink at
          the wells of salvation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Pray for the peace of the waters of the sanctuary in Jerusalem; the
          purity of doctrine and worship, discipline and government. When the
          fountains are troubled with error and doctrine, idolatry or
          superstition in worship, corruption in discipline and government, it
          is a dangerous thing. David notes it as a great blessing, that he was
          led by the still waters, where the sheep need not be afraid to drink.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Pray for Jerusalem's peace with herself. Pray that the watchmen,
          the ministers, may be in peace among themselves. The darkness of the
          day, and of the duty of the day, creates hazard here. Bless God for
          what peace and harmony yet appears, and pray against division among
          them, and among professors, the daughters of Jerusalem. O! it is sad,
          when it comes to that, I am of Paul, and I am of Apollos. Division
          eats out the life of religion. When the ship splits, the passengers
          must needs be in hazard. Christ prays for their union, John 17:21; and
          the devil labors to break them, that he may destroy the church.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, Pray for the peace of the nation in which Jerusalem is. Pray
          for the peace of Scotland; for if judgments come upon the land, they
          usually begin at the house of God. I will pray you to comply with
          this.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. For your brethren and companions' sake. Look about you, and as many
          men and women as you see, you have so many motives. Some of them have
          got grace, and they must cleave to Christ, whatever be the hazard. But
          O! it is a sad sight to see Jerusalem laid on heaps, Psalm 79:1–3.
          Some are but weak, and will faint under trials, and wound their
          consciences. Others have no grace, and how will they get it, if the
          doors of the sanctuary be shut. Look on your little ones. Pity
          posterity. What will become of them, if the gospel go away? What came
          of our forefathers, who were born and brought up under popery? What
          were they obliged to their fathers that sinned away the gospel? What
          would have come of ourselves if God had not overturned popery and
          prelacy in this land.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. For Zion's sake, Isaiah 62:1. For the house of God's sake, Psalm
          122:9. Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities. See how your
          hearts could bear to take your leave of it. Ordinances are the glory
          of the land. What a dismal business would it be to see our sermons and
          communions gone; darkness instead of divine light; the children
          fainting, and none to break the bread of life to them. This should
          prevail with us all, for there is none of us but are accessary to the
          disturbing of the peace of Jerusalem. This made it lie near old Eli's
          heart. If you had a friend in hazard of death, would you not be
          concerned for him; especially, if you had a hand in casting him into
          the disease.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Lastly, For God's sake, and for Christ's sake, Psalm 122:4, 5. How can
          you think that God should be robbed of the honor of the assemblies of
          his people; that Christ's throne in the land should be overturned, and
          that enemies should blaspheme his name.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. It imports the use of means, in order to attain the peace of
          Jerusalem. We must not only pray for it, but also live for it. The
          means then are repentance and reformation, Lamentations 3:40, 41. Many
          projects have been, and are set on foot to bring this land out of the
          low state into which it is brought. But alas! the main point of all is
          little regarded, and that is repentance and reformation. Until this
          be, it will be but building on sandy foundations, unless the Lord mind
          to give us meat to our lusts, but leanness to our souls, which God
          forbid.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Let us resolve then with the zealous Israelites in Babylon, "If I
          forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do
          not remember you, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I
          prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy." Amen.
