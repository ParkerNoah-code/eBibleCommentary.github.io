          [As Mr. Boston, has in his writings accurately explained the nature,
          and warmly inculcated the duty and necessity, of personal covenanting,
          or explicit entering into, or renewing covenant with God, by taking
          hold of God's covenant of grace; it will not be improper to subjoin
          the two following specimens of that solemn transaction in his own
          practice: the first, dated August 14, 1699, a little before his
          ordination to the ministry; the other, dated December 2, 1729, about
          two years and five months before his death. Both are printed from the
          original copies.]

          I, MR. THOMAS BOSTON, preacher of the gospel of Christ, being by
          nature an apostate from God, an enemy to the great JEHOVAH, and so an
          heir of Hell and wrath, in myself utterly lost and undone, because of
          my original and actual sins, and misery thereby; and being, in some
          measure, made sensible of this my lost and undone state, and sensible
          of my need, my absolute need of a Savior, without whom I must perish
          eternally; and believing that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son
          of the eternal God, is not only able to save me, by virtue of his
          death and sufferings, but willing also to save me (though most vile
          and ugly, and one who has given him many repulses), both from my sins,
          and from the load of wrath due to me for them, upon condition that I
          believe, come to him for salvation, and cordially receive him in all
          his offices; consenting to the terms of the covenant: therefore, as I
          have at several opportunities before given an express and solemn
          consent to the terms of the covenant, and have entered into a personal
          covenant with Christ; so now, being called to undertake the great and
          weighty work of the ministry of the gospel, for which I am altogether
          insufficient, I do by this declare, That I stand to and own all my
          former engagements, whether sacramental, or any other way whatever;
          and now again do RENEW my covenant with God; and hereby, at this
          present time, do solemnly COVENANT and ENGAGE to be the Lord's and
          MAKE a solemn resignation and upgiving of myself, my soul, body,
          spiritual and temporal concerns, unto the Lord Jesus Christ, without
          any reservation whatever; and do hereby give my voluntary consent to
          the terms of the covenant laid down in the holy scriptures, the word
          of truth; and with my heart and soul I TAKE and RECEIVE Christ in all
          his offices, as my PROPHET to teach me, resolving and engaging in his
          strength to follow, that is, to endeavor to follow his instructions: I
          TAKE him as my PRIEST, to be saved by his death and merits alone; and
          renouncing my own righteousness as filthy rags and menstruous cloths,
          I am content to be clothed with his righteousness alone; and live
          entirely upon free grace; likewise I TAKE him for my ADVOCATE and
          INTERCESSOR with the Father: and finally, I TAKE him as my KING, to
          reign in me, and to rule over me, renouncing all other lords, whether
          sin or self, and in particular my predominant idol; and in the
          strength of the Lord, do resolve and hereby engage, to cleave to
          Christ as my Sovereign Lord and King, in death and in life, in
          prosperity and in adversity, even forever, and to strive and wrestle
          in his strength against all known sin; protesting, that whatever sin
          may be lying hidden in my heart out of my view, I disown it, and abhor
          it, and shall in the Lord's strength, endeavor the mortification of
          it, when the Lord shall be pleased to let me see it. And this solemn
          covenant I make as in the presence of the ever-living, heart-searching
          God, and subscribe it with my hand, in my chamber, at Dunse, about one
          o'clock in the afternoon, the fourteenth day of August, one thousand
          six hundred and ninety-nine years.

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          O LORD, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, I confess from my
          heart, that I am by nature a lost and undone sinner, wholly corrupted,
          and laid under the curse, in Adam, through the breach of the covenant
          of works; and have ruined myself more and more by my innumerable
          actual transactions, whereby my whole life appears in mine eyes this
          day a heap of vanity, sin, and foolishness. I am fully convinced, and
          do from my heart acknowledge, that I am utterly unable to help myself,
          in whole or in part, out of this gulf of sin and misery, into which I
          am plunged; and that it is beyond the reach of the whole creation to
          help me out of it; so that I must inevitably perish forever, if your
          own strong hand do not make help to me. But forasmuch as there is a
          covenant of grace, for life and salvation to lost sinners, established
          between YOU and your own SON, the Lord Jesus Christ, as second Adam;
          wherein, upon condition of his fulfilling all righteousness, which is
          now performed, in his having been born perfectly holy, lived
          altogether righteously, and made perfect satisfaction to justice by
          his death and sufferings, you have promised that you will be their
          God, and they shall be your people, to the making of them holy and
          happy forever; and that this covenant is, in Christ the head thereof,
          offered and exhibited to me in your gospel, and you call me into the
          fellowship thereof, in him: Therefore (adhering to my former
          acceptings, and taking hold of it, declared whether by word or writ
          before you, without willful mistaking of it, or known deceit), upon
          the warrant of, and in obedience to, your command and call, I, in
          myself a poor perishing sinner, and worthy to perish, do now again
          TAKE HOLD of that COVENANT, for life and salvation to ME; believing on
          the name of Christ crucified the head thereof, offered and exhibited
          to me, as the great High Priest, who, by the sacrifice of himself, has
          made atonement, paid the ransom, and brought in everlasting
          righteousness for poor sinners. I CREDIT his word of grace to me, and
          accordingly TRUST on him, that he with his righteousness will be mine,
          and that, in and through him, God will be my God, and I shall be one
          of his people, to the making of me holy and happy forever. O my God, I
          do by your grace acquiesce in that covenant, as all my salvation, and
          all my desire. With my whole heart and soul, the Son incarnate is my
          only PRIEST, my surety, my Intercessor, and my Redeemer; and, in him,
          the FATHER my FATHER, the HOLY SPIRIT my SANCTIFIER; GOD in CHRIST my
          God. I resign my self, soul and body, to him, to be saved by his blood
          alone; renouncing all confidence in mine own righteousness, doings,
          and sufferings. With my whole heart and soul he is my HEAD and
          HUSBAND: and I am his only, wholly, and forever; to live by him, to
          him, and for him. I take him for my alone PROPHET, Oracle, and Guide;
          give up myself wholly to him, to be taught, guided, and directed, in
          all things, by his word and Spirit; and renounce mine own wisdom, and
          the wisdom of this world. He is, with my heart's content, my alone
          KING and Lord. And I resign myself wholly, soul and body, unto him, to
          be rescued, by the strength of his mighty hand, from sin, death, the
          devil, and this present evil world, for to serve him forever, and to
          be ruled by the will of his command as my duty, and the will of his
          providence as to my lot. I am, with my whole heart, content (Lord, you
          know) to part with, and do renounce, every known sin, lust, or idol,
          and particularly that sin which most easily besets me; together with
          my own foolish will, and other lords besides him; without reservation,
          and without exception against his cross: Protesting in your sight, O
          Lord, that I am, through grace, willing to have discovered unto me,
          and upon discovery to part with, every sin in me that I know not: and
          that the doubtings and averseness of heart, mixed with this my
          accepting of your covenant, are what I allow not: and that,
          notwithstanding thereof, I look to be accepted of you herein, in the
          Beloved, your only Son and my Savior, purging away these, with all my
          other sins, by his precious blood. Let it be recorded in Heaven, O
          Lord, and let the bed on which I leaned, the timber, and the stones,
          and all other things about me here, in my closet, bear witness, That
          I, though most unworthy, have this second day of December, One
          thousand seven hundred and twenty-nine years, here taken hold of, and
          come into your covenant of grace, offered and exhibited to me in your
          gospel, for time and eternity; and that you are my God in the tenor of
          that covenant, and I am one of your people, from henceforth and
          forever.
