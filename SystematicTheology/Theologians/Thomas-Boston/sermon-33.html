    Isaiah 32:2, "And a <i>man</i> shall be as the shadow of a great rock in a 
    weary land."</p>
<p align="justify">THIS prophecy relates to Hezekiah, to his happy and pious 
    government; but doubtless a greater than Hezekiah is here, and that is Jesus 
    Christ, the king of saints. This world, before sin entered into it, had 
    always a clear sky; there was not an air of pestilential wind to blow upon 
    them that were traveling through it to Immanuel's land. But since sin 
    entered, the case is quite altered; strong winds of trouble blow, tempests 
    of heavy rain fall; there are inundations in the world, as the word is; it 
    is a dry place; in respect of comfort, it is a weary land; but though a 
    weary land, it is not altogether without some comforting prospect. A shadow 
    and shelter is prepared for the weary traveler; for it is promised in the 
    text, "And a man shall be—as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land." In 
    which words, there is observable,</p>
<p align="justify">1. What the world is spiritually to Christ's subjects, 
    the people of God, a "weary land;" that is, a thirsty land, a scorching 
    country, a stormy place, with many inconveniences, which make travelers 
    weary and faint. It is a wilderness, wherein there is no water, but a 
    vehement heat, which makes people weary, and long for shelter and 
    refreshment.—Observe,</p>
<p align="justify">2. What Christ is to them there, "as the shadow of a 
    great rock." How pleasant is a shelter in such a place to the weary 
    traveler! Such is Christ to his people in the world. There are many 
    shelters, there is even the shadow of created comforts; but, alas! they are 
    unsubstantial shades; they are as the shade of a tree, through which the 
    sun, wind, or rain beats. But Christ is as the shadow of a rock, which none 
    of these can pierce; and as a great rock, which gives a large shelter; so 
    that there they have a perfect repose, blow what weather will.—The text 
    affords us this</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE, That Christ is a suitable shade, and a 
    refreshing shelter, for those to whom the world is a weary land.</p>
<p align="justify">For illustrating this doctrine, it is proposed,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show what is implied in the text.</p>
<p align="justify">II. To inquire in what respects the world is a weary land 
    to the saints.</p>
<p align="justify">III. To point out in what respects Jesus Christ is a 
    suitable and refreshful shade and shelter to them in a weary land.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. Conclude with a practical improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">We are, then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show what is implied in the text,—It imports,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That the world is not our dwelling-place, but the 
    place through which we are traveling. This world is but a thoroughfare to 
    another, where we come in at our birth, walk through in our life, and go out 
    again at death. Many imagine but two fixed points in the universe, the 
    higher and the lower, and that bodies are revolving in continual motion 
    towards one or other of these, Heaven and Hell. The godly are going out of 
    the world in affection, Song 4:8; the wicked, in action, though not in 
    affection; none are abiding.—It imports,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That there is no correcting of the ill air of the 
    world; a shade and shelter may be had in it, but to reduce it to its first 
    temperature, that it may indeed be a pleasant land, is not promised, and 
    therefore cannot be expected. The winds of trouble must blow in it while 
    there are such treasures of sin in it to bring them forth. While our 
    provocations against Heaven gather into clouds, there will be tempestuous 
    rains of calamities in it. The godly may lay their account with this: John 
    16:33, "In the world you shall have tribulation." And the carnal world need 
    not lay their account by it: Job. 5:7, "Yet man is born unto trouble, as the 
    sparks fly upwards."—It imports,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That, foul or fair weather, we must set out our heads, 
    and through the weary land we must go; there is no other way but to take our 
    share of what may be going on in it. He who would stop until the sky clear, 
    may with as good reason sit down and wait until the water run out, that he 
    may get through the river dry shod; the last may be sooner expected than the 
    first.—It imports,</p>
<p align="justify">4. That the traveling through it will try our strength; 
    take what way we will, we cannot miss sometimes to be entangled in the 
    wilderness, and to be wearied in it, though the heart were so glued to it, 
    as never to be wearied of it. The winds, the rains, and the storms, that 
    blow there, will bear heavy on us, so as that we will need a resting, a 
    refreshing place.—It imports,</p>
<p align="justify">5. That nothing less than the great rock will be a 
    sufficient shelter in this weary land; no solid peace or repose out of 
    Christ, more than there was out of the ark when the deluge came on. The 
    winds and storms will blow down, or blow through, all other shades which men 
    make to themselves in the weary land: Isaiah 28:17, "And the hail shall 
    sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the 
    hiding-place." Flying from one mischief, while they flee not to the great 
    rock, they shall fall into another: Amos 5:19, "As if a man did flee from a 
    lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the 
    wall, and a serpent bit him."—It imports,</p>
<p align="justify">6. That Christ is a sufficient shelter, however weary a 
    land the world he: John 16:33, "These things I have spoken unto you, that in 
    me you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation; but be of 
    good cheer, I have overcome the world." Be the storms or heats as great as 
    they will, he is as a great rock; and from him, though the troubles may be 
    great, yet they may expect a great salvation. They will always be safe who 
    are under the shade of the great rock, through which neither heats nor 
    storms can pierce: Psalm 93:4, "The Lord on high is mightier than the noise 
    of many waters; yes, than the mighty waves of the sea." It is impossible 
    they can be greater than they have been; nay, they can never be so great as 
    once they were, when from Heaven, earth, and Hell, at once they blew upon 
    Christ. Yet he bore them, bore up under them, bore them off his people; even 
    as the heats and rains fall on the rock, while those under its shade are 
    kept safe.—It imports,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, That the weary world makes Christ more precious 
    to sinners than otherwise he would be. If the traveler were not scorched 
    with heat, or tossed with tempests, he would never look near the rock. Ease 
    in the world, is the neck-break of many. But it is well for the church and 
    people of God, that the world is a step-dame to them; were they better 
    entertained in the world's house, they would more seldom knock at God's 
    door.—We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To show in what respects the world to the people of 
    God is a weary land.—It is so, because,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The wind blowing in the traveler's face makes any land 
    a weary land to him; and in this world, there is a wind of ordinary trouble, 
    that is seldom if ever down, but blowing especially in the face of the 
    travelers to Zion; Matthew 6:34, "Sufficient unto the day is the evil 
    thereof." Sometimes it blows away the man's ease, blasts his reputation, 
    blows away his worldly goods, his health, his relations, etc. It blows so 
    that he is sure of nothing he has, unless it be Christ in him, the hope of 
    glory. And the travelers must lay their account with this. This cannot fail 
    but make the world a weary land. But the soul may find a calm under Christ's 
    shadow, as Hannah did, when she poured out her soul before the Lord, 1 
    Samuel 1:16. Praying in faith is a great ease to a heart uneasy under 
    trouble: Matthew 7:7, "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall 
    And; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." Christ is an anchor that can 
    keep the soul sure and steadfast amidst all the tempests of a weary world. 
    He has an open ear to their just complaints, and a soft hand, under which 
    the uneasy heart and head may repose themselves.—It is a weary land,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Because sometimes there are terrible tempests of 
    common calamity, threatening to sweep all away before them, blowing in this 
    world, which makes it a weary land. There are no tempests in the upper 
    region, but in the lower region, where we are, they are very frequent, 
    whereby nations, churches, and families, are thrown into the utmost 
    confusion. David speaks of such, Psalm 55:8, "I would," says he, "hasten my 
    escape from the windy storm and tempest." These often make a most miserable 
    face on the places where they blow, and make the land a weary land indeed. 
    But even in this case, there is found peace under Christ's shadow: John 
    16:33, "These things I have spoken unto you, that you might have peace; in 
    the world you shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome 
    the world." In him believers have a peace the world cannot rob them of. He 
    has hiding-places for his people, where he will hide them, if not from 
    trouble, yet from the evil, the sting, and hurt of it: 1 Peter 3:13, "And 
    who is he who will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?" He 
    will hide them, if not under Heaven, yet in Heaven; and they have no reason 
    to complain who get there, though in a fiery chariot. Our Lord holds the 
    winds in his hand, and they can blow no more terribly than he permits them; 
    so that in the worst of times it is good news; Isaiah 52:7, "How beautiful 
    upon the mountains are the feet of him that brings good tidings, that 
    publishes peace, that brings good tidings of good, that says unto Zion, Your 
    God reigns!" And these that make Christ their friend, may bid defiance to 
    all their enemies.—The world is a weary land,</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because the wild beasts in it make it a weary land. 
    The scripture calls wicked men so, especially in their opposition to, and 
    treatment of the people of God, and the world is the place of their abode: 
    Song 4:8, "Come with me, my spouse, from the lions' dens, from the mountains 
    of the leopards." And therefore, while they are traveling through the 
    wilderness, they are often put to that prayer, Psalm 74:19, 20, "O deliver 
    not the soul of your turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked, forget not 
    the congregation of your poor forever, have respect unto the covenant, for 
    the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty." No 
    wonder the world be a weary land to the people of God; for the wild beasts 
    are often heard roaring there; Psalm 74:4, "Your enemies roar in the midst 
    of your congregation, they set up their ensigns for signs;" threatening to 
    devour, and to swallow up, and to make the name of Israel no more to be 
    remembered; as the Egyptian beast did, Exodus 15:9. But while these roarings 
    make the hearts of God's people to tremble, the voice of the Lion of the 
    tribe of Judah, terrible to his enemies, is comfortable to his friends: 
    Psalm 93:4, "The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, 
    yes, than the mighty waves of the sea." This moderated the roarings of the 
    Assyrian in Hezekiah's days, Isaiah 37:22. These beasts are often heard 
    yelling in the world: Jeremiah 2:15, "The young lions roared upon him, and 
    yelled, and they made his land waste." Dreadful is that yelling they make 
    when they are got together, uttering their blasphemies, curses, and 
    reproaches, against God, his people, and his cause in the world, as if Hell 
    was opened, which is the den of the great lion. This makes the world a weary 
    land, and it is most heavy and distressing to the people of God: Psalm 
    74:10, "O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy 
    blaspheme your name forever?" But there is refreshment and shelter under 
    Christ's shadow in this case, while the soul sees that he will close up at 
    length the blasphemous mouths, and bring them to the city above, where they 
    shall hear no more of any such thing. But again, these beasts are often seen 
    tearing and devouring in the world the men that are more righteous than 
    they: Habakkuk 1:13, "Wherefore look you upon them that deal treacherously, 
    and hold your tongue when the wicked devours the man that is more righteous 
    than he?" God has his times wherein he lets them loose, to make havoc of the 
    church, and shed the blood of his saints. But under Christ's shadow there is 
    refreshing in this case. He can break out the teeth of the great lions with 
    a touch; and while they are at the worst, he says to his people, "Fear not 
    them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul," Matthew 10:28. 
    It was the way they treated Christ himself when in the world, but he rose 
    upon them to their confusion; and so shall the church in like manner, and 
    according to their measure, Psalm 22:12, 13.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Darkness causes weariness, and a dark land will always 
    be a weary land to the children of light. The world at best is but a dark 
    land, in comparison with Heaven: 1 Corinthians 13:12, "For now we see 
    through a glass darkly, but then face to face." But sometimes the darkness 
    increases mightily. We have had a long sunshine of gospel-light, but men 
    have loved darkness rather than light. And now God is rising up to plead 
    with the generation; and we may say, with Jeremiah, "Woe unto us, for the 
    day goes away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out." Do you not 
    see the darkness come, and coming on the land more and more? There is a dark 
    cloud already cast over the ministers and professors of Scotland; so that 
    they have now been like a company of travelers in a mist; some crying this, 
    and others that is the way; while many are at a stand, not knowing what hand 
    to turn to. Hence there are an alienation of affection, divisions, and 
    separations, among those who all profess that they are traveling to the same 
    place, but cannot agree about the way. Terrible this at all times, but now 
    especially, when the common enemy is at our gates, which should make us 
    cease from these fends, as it is said the beasts did, have, dog, sheep, cat 
    and rat, in the inundation of the Severn. Some pride themselves in these, 
    but they will make the world a weary land to those that are led by the 
    Spirit of truth and peace: Judges 5:16, "Why abide you among the 
    sheep-folds, to hear the bleating of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben 
    there were great searchings of heart."</p>
<p align="justify">What shall we do in such a case? Get in under Christ's 
    shadow, by faith, renouncing our own understanding, passions, and 
    prejudices, and giving up ourselves singly to his guiding, and his shadow 
    will be as the shadow on the dial, pointing to the hour of the day: Psalm 
    25:9, "The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his 
    way." In the greatest darkness of the world, there is a light, even "a more 
    sure word of prophecy, whereunto we do well that we take heed, as unto a 
    light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star 
    arise in our hearts," 2 Peter 1:19. This oracle of Heaven is never struck 
    dumb; but at any time men's corruptions may make them both blind and deaf to 
    its warnings. But again, the bushel is preparing to put the candle under, 
    which God has lighted to give light to his church, if mercy prevent it not; 
    and then people that have made themselves so many silent Sabbaths, will get 
    them made to their hands; and they that have been wearying for the day, may 
    come to get a weary fill of it. Preachers driven into corners, closed 
    church-doors, and the songs of the temple turned into howlings, will make a 
    dark day. And now, if God do not mercifully interpose, we cannot miss it. 
    But Christ's shadow will be refreshing in this case to those that get under 
    it. Though the enemy should get leave to tread down the outer court, and 
    these that worship in it, they that are farther in shall be well seen to: 
    Revelation 11:1, 2. Though they should burn up all the synagogues of God 
    within the land, yet there is a little sanctuary they cannot hinder you to 
    carry about with you: Ezekiel 11:16, "Therefore say, Thus says the Lord God, 
    Although I have cast them afar off among the Heathen, and although I have 
    scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little 
    sanctuary in the countries where they shall come." And though the stars 
    should be stamped down to the earth, and no star-light shine in the church, 
    you shall not want light while the Sun of righteousness continues to shine.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, The bottomless pit is already opened, the smoke 
    is arising in our land, and the locusts are coming out of the smoke upon it: 
    Revelation 9:1–3. The Popish party are now begun to make head, with their 
    brethren the malignants who carry on the war with Antichrist, and to set a 
    limb of Antichrist upon the throne: and if they succeed, what can be 
    expected, but that the smoke of Anti-Christian errors, superstition, and 
    idolatry, will overspread these nations again? So that we must resolve 
    either to take on the Beast's mark or Christ's fire-mark, either burn or 
    turn. It will be weary work to get through the smoke, which it is to be 
    feared will stifle most of us, and blacken many. But get under Christ's 
    shadow now; seek now to believe, and feel the power of truth. An empty 
    profession will not do here; lamps without oil will go out in the smoke. But 
    be it ever so gross, it will hurt none but the profane and hypocritical 
    professor: Revelation 9:4, "And it was commanded them, that they should not 
    hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but 
    only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads." They that 
    have Christ's mark of true piety, shall be kept from receiving the mark of 
    the beast. Under Christ's shadow they will be as the Israelites in Goshen; 
    when darkness is over all the land, they shall have light in their 
    dwellings.—The world is a weary land,</p>
<p align="justify">5. For blood and death going through it, make it a weary 
    land. In Heaven there are none of these things, it is the pleasant land, 
    Revelation 21:4. But in the world they are very frequent; which often makes 
    the weary sons of Zion to cry, "Woe is me now, for my soul is wearied 
    because of murderers," Jeremiah 4:31. The people that delight in war is a 
    black character in the scriptures, Psalm 68:30. The confused noise of the 
    warriors is no pleasant sound, nor are garments rolled in blood a pleasant 
    sight. The constant disquiet and terror that attends the sword's raging in a 
    land, is a wearisome case, as it is described, Deuteronomy 28:67, "In the 
    morning you shall say, Would to God it were even! and at even you shall say, 
    Would God it were morning; for the fear of your heart with which you shall 
    fear, and for the sight of your eyes which you shall see."</p>
<p align="justify">The white horse of the gospel has for many years made a 
    pleasant parade through the land. But alas! neither it, nor the crowned 
    head, the Son of God, that sits upon it, has been much regarded; nay; both 
    he, and his bow, which is the word, have been despised; few, very few, have 
    given him a crown, Song 3:11, by closing with him in the gospel-offers. And 
    now the red, black, and pale horses, mentioned Revelation 6:4, 5, 8, seem to 
    be ready to begin their march, to avenge the affronts offered to the white 
    horse; though the Popish and malignant riders mean not so, but to banish the 
    white horse out of the land. What shall we do in this case? get in under 
    Christ's shadow, that is the only safe retreat in such a case: Micah 5:5," 
    And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our 
    land." This should be our work this day; we should sit down under his 
    shadow, believing in him, and depending upon him, Canticles 2:3. When public 
    calamity comes upon a land, every person will run to that place where they 
    expect the greatest safety; but run where they will for shelter, if they run 
    not to Christ, their shelters will fall down about their ears at length: 
    Isaiah 28:17, "And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the 
    water shall overflow the hiding-place." But the way of safety is to run to 
    Jesus Christ: Proverbs 18:10, "The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the 
    righteous runs into it, and is safe." You must sit down under his shadow, by 
    closing with him in the offers of the gospel, taking him for all, and 
    instead of all, for time and eternity: giving yourselves away to him, 
    renouncing the devil, the world, and the flesh, embarking in his interests 
    and cause at this day, whoever be against it. This is a loud knock Christ is 
    giving to gospel-despisers to open to him, after the slighting of many a 
    still small voice, whereby he lets thorn know, that if they will not open to 
    him as a Lord and Savior, he will arise on them as a Judge with a vengeance, 
    whether they will or not. Come, then, you despisers of Christ, and sit down 
    under his shadow, before the scorching heat of the weary land burn you up.</p>
<p align="justify">We must sit still under his shadow, by cleaving to him, 
    and depending upon him: Isaiah 30:7, "For the Egyptian shall help in vain, 
    and to no purpose; therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is 
    to sit still." Though the scourge reach all, the greatest safety will be 
    there. Cleave to him and his cause, come what will come; for if you go off 
    his way to seek safety, you cast yourselves out of his promised protection. 
    Piety will be the best policy in the accustomed of times: Proverbs 10:9, "He 
    who walks uprightly, walks surely; but he who perverts his way, shall be 
    known." And depend on him by believing his promises, both for your personal 
    case, and the church's case; for whoever be in the field, victory is in his 
    hand alone, and he gives it to whom he will; he does what he will in the 
    armies of Heaven and earth; whom he will he strengthens, whom he will he 
    weakens, for he is the Lord of hosts; and he has engaged that at length it 
    shall be ill with his enemies, and well with his friends: Isaiah 54:17, "No 
    weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every tongue that shall 
    rise against you in judgment, you shall condemn; this is the heritage of the 
    servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, says the Lord."—But 
    again,</p>
<p align="justify">We must lie down under his shadow, in holy resignation, 
    to Buffer whatever he may call us to, Isaiah 51:23. The dispensations of the 
    day call aloud to us to prepare for suffering; if the malignant party 
    prevail, doubt not but their little finger will be heavier than their 
    father's loins. Our Lord has given many love-tokens to the generation, which 
    have been lightly esteemed; howbeit, there are many that profess love to him 
    and his truths; and it would seem, he will try what tokens we have to bestow 
    on him and his cause. It is likely he will have a portion of someone's 
    goods, relations, liberty, yes, and of their blood too, before all be done; 
    and it is to be feared, the tokens of his displeasure draw so deep, that 
    many will give up with him on this account. But if you be wise, lie down 
    under his shadow; for a thorny bed under Christ's shadow will at the last 
    prove more easy than the beds of ivory on which his enemies may stretch 
    themselves for a little; Job 20:5, "The triumphing of the wicked is short, 
    and the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment." The hour and power of 
    darkness will not last; and though God should suffer that party to carry all 
    before them a while, there is no ground to doubt but God will be even with 
    them, for all their enmity, and opposition to his work; yes, and render home 
    their father's opposition to it into their bosom, and give them blood to 
    drink, for the blood their fathers shed in fields, and on scaffolds, when 
    they have filled up the measure of their iniquity by what they may now do: 
    Revelation 16:5, 6, "And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are 
    righteous, O Lord, which are, and were, and shall be, because you have 
    judged thus. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you 
    have given them blood to drink, for they are worthy."</p>
<p align="justify">But we must also stand up under Christ's shadow, and act 
    for him. Certainly, as the quarrel is now stated between Christ and his 
    enemies in Britain and Ireland, he calls his people now to act for him and 
    his cause. If they have a standard to be displayed for Popery and slavery, 
    God has given us a standard to be displayed for religion and liberty: Psalm 
    60:4, "You has given a banner to them that feared you, that it might be 
    displayed because of the truth." And people are called, by this 
    dispensation, to put themselves in a posture to defend their religion and 
    liberties, their Protestant King, country and families, and not to leave 
    themselves a naked prey for murderers. And in such a time, people consulting 
    their own ease, more than the honor of God, the welfare of his cause, and 
    their neighbor's safety, may easily slip themselves in under Meroz's curse, 
    which, when incurred, will not be got so easily off persons: Judges 5:23, 
    "Curse you Meroz, (said the angel of the Lord), curse you bitterly the 
    inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the 
    help of the Lord against the mighty."</p>
<p align="justify">Never was the cause more clear in Britain. The word, to 
    spirit the soldiery under the enemies' standard, should be, The great red 
    dragon, Revelation 12:3, and the motto corresponding with this, as in Psalm 
    2:3, "Let us break their bands, and cast their cords from us." This is the 
    design of the attempt, and, I am persuaded, is looked upon so by Him that 
    sits in the heavens. What else is the design of the Papists and malignants 
    this day? Our holy religion must go, and idolatry and superstition come in 
    its room; we and our families must be murdered, or renounce our religion, 
    though denying of Christ will never altogether please them, for they will 
    especially never trust Scotch Presbyterians, so that that would be the way 
    to die a double death. Our Protestant King must go, and a Papist ascend the 
    throne, and the covenanted work of Reformation be rooted out, unless that 
    people act for their defense against the Anti-christian party. I know no 
    middle ground this day, but that every one must be on Christ's side, or on 
    Antichrist's. This cause will bear no neutrality: Matthew 12:30, "He who is 
    not with me, is against me; and he that gathers not with me, scatters 
    abroad."</p>
<p align="justify">Never was the cause more favorable; for while our 
    intruders and enemies cannot appear in the field but as rebels and traitors, 
    laying themselves open to all the pains of treason and rebellion, we have, 
    by the mercy of God, the law on our side. No doubt, masses will be said at 
    Rome for them, and in other parts of the Pope's territory; but the prayers 
    of all the Protestant churches abroad will be for us and our righteous 
    cause; and the prayers of all the godly in the land will also be in our 
    favor. It is true, indeed, our God is angry with us; but sure I am, he is 
    not well-pleased with them, he never was nor will be pleased with the cause 
    they have in hand; and therefore, seeing the cause is the Lord's, we may be 
    sure that "though he cause grief, yet he will have compassion;" and when he 
    has done his work with his furnace on Mount Zion, he will bring off his 
    cause and people victorious at length, Isaiah 54:17. And we have ground to 
    hope, that if the noise of enemies go on, it will raise up at length a 
    Spirit upon the Popish and malignant interest in these nations, that shall 
    affright them, and rain it more than ever; I mean, the Spirit of the buried 
    covenants.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</b></p>
<p align="justify">HAVING, in the preceding discourse, offered several 
    reasons why this world is to the saints a weary land, I go on now farther to 
    observe, that the world is to them a weary land: For,</p>
<p align="justify">6. An ill way makes a weary land to travelers. There is 
    much ill way in the world, that wearies sore them that are traveling 
    Zion-ward. It is true, the way of holiness is a good way, in so far as it 
    leads to the heavenly Jerusalem; and though it be strewed with thorns and 
    briars, it is better to walk in it, than in the way to destruction strewed 
    with roses. But an uneasy way we call an ill way; and such is the way 
    through the weary land of the world. It is all up-hill, which scars the most 
    part of the world. The way to Hell is down the hill, but the way to Heaven 
    is up the hill: Psalm 24:3, "Who shall ascend into the hill of God?" They 
    that would sit at ease, and sleep through the world, are not meet for 
    Heaven; the way will try people's strength, and an easy way to Heaven no man 
    shall find. There are strong lusts, and temptations, and troubles, which 
    people have to climb over. But under Christ's shadow, the traveler will 
    recover his breath again, and be invigorated for new difficulties, until he 
    come to the top of the hill: Isaiah 40:29, "He gives power to the faint; and 
    to them that have no might, he increases strength." Verse 31, "They that 
    wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with 
    wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not 
    faint."</p>
<p align="justify">It is a narrow way: "Strait is the gate, and narrow is 
    the way, that leads unto life," Matthew 7:14. Multitudes walk in the broad 
    way, and there they get room enough; but in the narrow way there are few 
    travelers, and they that are on it must take good heed to their feet, or 
    they are apt to catch a fall. And considering how rash we naturally are, and 
    how weak-headed and false-hearted we are, and how narrow the road is, and 
    how loose the ground about it is, it is no wonder, that with the Psalmist we 
    complain of broken bones, Psalm 51:8. These make a weary way. But under 
    Christ's shadow there is light for the blind, strength for them that go even 
    on, and medicine to cure them that are bruised by their falls, if they 
    intend not to lie still, but to get up and walk on.</p>
<p align="justify">It is a hard and rugged way, and therefore they must have 
    leg-harness, as soldiers have, to preserve their feet from stones and 
    roughness in the way of their march: Ephesians 6:15, "And their feet shod 
    with the preparation of the gospel of peace." There are many difficulties to 
    go through that will need resolution and undaunted courage. The spies saw 
    such difficulties in the way to Canaan, that they brought up an ill report 
    of the land. But Caleb and Joshua had another spirit, that fitted them to 
    face all these difficulties, Numbers 14:24. The fearful are not for Heaven, 
    Revelation 21:8. But under Christ's shadow there is sweet refreshment in the 
    hardest piece of the way, and nothing is too hard for them whom he bears up: 
    Philippians 4:13, "I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me."</p>
<p align="justify">It is a way wherein many snares are laid. The snares of 
    the world make it a weary land. The way is beset with thorns, and lies 
    through thickets, where on every side there is something to catch a man. 
    There are snares in every lot, in every condition, in the most innocent 
    things in the world; and there is need of great caution to get through them. 
    How often are men in the snare before ever they are aware! Like the poor 
    bird they find the snare laid where they were not looking for it. But under 
    Christ's shadow, there is a shelter where they may be safe. It is he who 
    leads them through the wilderness to that place where they will be in no 
    more hazard. Yes, casting themselves by faith on him, they are in no danger 
    from any quarter whatever.—It may be further observed,</p>
<p align="justify">7. That the country-disease often makes it a weary land; 
    and that, in the world, is sin. No sooner do any set their foot in that 
    land, than are they infected with it: Psalm 51:5, "Behold I was shaped in 
    iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me." Though the power of this 
    disease be broken in the saints at their conversion, yet it hangs about them 
    as long as they are in the land. What wonder, then, that it be to them a 
    weary land?—And there are five things that make it so.</p>
<p align="justify">(I.) The heaviness of the disease. It is called a body of 
    death, Romans 7:24, "O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the 
    body of this death?" Death is heavy in any part of it, how much more 
    burdensome must a body of it be? It bears down the man continually; it is a 
    burden to the back, that makes him stoop, and so makes a weary land.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The universality of the disease. It affects and 
    indisposes the whole man, so that we may say, Isaiah 1:5, 6, that "the whole 
    head is sick, and the whole heart faint; from the sole of the foot to the 
    crown of the head, there is no soundness in it, but wounds, and bruises, and 
    putrefying sores." It spreads itself like a leprosy, through all the 
    faculties of the soul, and leaves no part of the man unaffected. It has 
    smitten the understanding with blindness, and the heart with hardness, and 
    filled the mind with enmity against God. Job's life was a heavy life when he 
    was full of boils all over; and so is the life of those who are universally 
    affected with the disease of sin.—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The frequent relapses that take place in this 
    disease. How often do they fall back again when they seem to be in a fair 
    way of recovery! This makes a weary world to a heaven-born soul, that would 
    gladly be like God in holiness; ever wrestling, and ever falling into the 
    mire again, makes weary work. This makes that longing to be away for which 
    the saint is distinguished.—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) The malignant influence these things have on the 
    saints' journey through the weary land. By these means they are very much 
    unfitted for it, they walk very slowly. It is a weary journey to them; and 
    oftentimes they are so laid by, that they are not able to move forward at 
    all, and they are driven back, instead of going forward.</p>
<p align="justify">(5.) It is not their case alone, but of all that are 
    there, the being affected by this disease. The world is an hospital of souls 
    sick with sin. Some of them are sensible of their disease, others are not. 
    The godly have not only their own plague-sores running on, but they also see 
    those of others running on: and that makes a weary land: Jeremiah 9:2, "O 
    that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of a wayfaring man, that I 
    might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an 
    assembly of treacherous men." But under Christ's shadow, there is medicine 
    for the sore. There is balm in Gilead, and a physician there. His blood 
    takes away the guilt, his Spirit takes away the power of sin; and in his 
    holy promises they see their freedom and complete cure.—I observe,</p>
<p align="justify">8. That the scorching heats in the world make it a weary 
    land. And there are these four kinds of scorching heat.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) There is the flery heat of desertion, from Heaven. 
    This the captain of our salvation met with in the weary land, Psalm 22:1–14; 
    and this has often been the lot of the people of God in the weary land; they 
    have lost sight of their guide, and have been left in darkness, and gone 
    mourning many days, without the sun, with many a weary groan, Psalm 6:6. 
    Nay, there have been many positive outgoings of wrath against their souls, 
    sparks of Hell flying in on heaven-born souls, while they have been pressed 
    under a sense of the Lord's anger, living, as it were, in the smoke of a 
    furnace: Psalm 102:3, "For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are 
    burned as an hearth."—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The fiery heat of temptation from Hell: Ephesians 
    6:12, "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against 
    principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this 
    world, against spiritual wickednesses in high places." When the Israelites 
    were in the wilderness they met with flery serpents that bit them, Numbers 
    21:6; and while we are in the wilderness of this world, we cannot miss the 
    inflaming bites of the old serpent the devil. Satan is within bow-shot of us 
    while here; and the tosses of temptation from him make it a weary land. 
    Ordinary temptations are never wanting, but are coming through the weary 
    land like midges in a hot summer-day. Sometimes there are extraordinary 
    temptations, fiery darts, where the poor soul will be as much put to it, to 
    defend itself, as one to defend a thatch-house against one casting 
    fire-balls, as it were, without intermission.—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) The fiery trial from the men of the world, 
    persecution. This is such an ordinary inheritance of the people of God in 
    the weary land, that an apostle says, 1 Peter 4:12, "Beloved, think it not 
    strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some 
    strange thing happened unto you." There is much dross, together with the 
    good metal, which gathers together in Zion, and therefore God will have a 
    furnace there, and the wicked of the world to set it on, and blow it up, and 
    professors must be cast into it to try them, some to be consumed, some to be 
    refined in it: Zechariah 13:9, "And I will bring the third part through the 
    fire, and refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is 
    tried; they shall call on my name, and I will hear them; I will say, it is 
    my people, and they shall say, the Lord is my God."—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) The fiery heat of contention and division from the 
    altar, mentioned Revelation 8:5. These have a sort of malignant influence on 
    the church; they scorch and blacken her exceedingly: Song 1:6, "Look not 
    upon me, because I am black, because the sun has looked upon me: my mother's 
    children were angry with me." Hence you may see the dreadful mischief which 
    it does, Revelation 8:7, 8, "There followed hail and fire, mingled with 
    blood, and they were cast upon the earth, and the third part of trees was 
    burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up." Though the way be long and 
    sore, the travelers may be hearty, and they may go pleasantly on, while they 
    are comfortable to one another; but when they grow a burden to one another, 
    when their unity and love among themselves are gone, that makes a weary way 
    to travelers. But never was the shadow of a great rock more suitable to the 
    scorched traveler, than Christ is to his people in all these cases.—For,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) He is their great plight-anchor in desertion, their 
    hope, and the support of their souls. His blood is the great fence, under 
    which they shelter themselves from the fire of the law, and brings them into 
    hope, when they are next door to desponding. An absolute God is a terrible, 
    but God in Christ is a refreshing, sight.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) He is their protector in temptation. Faith in Christ 
    is a shield which quenches all the fiery darts of the wicked, Ephesians 
    6:16. He is stronger than the strong man, and a present help in time of 
    temptation, either to repel the tempter, or else to bear up the tempted. He 
    says to them," My grace is sufficient for you, and my strength is made 
    perfect in your weakness," 2 Corinthians 12:9.</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) He is their strong tower in persecution, where they 
    abide, and stand out against all the storms of an enraged world. He gives 
    them peace, when their enemies are carrying on the war. "Peace" says he, "I 
    leave with you; my peace I give unto you." He makes their bow to abide in 
    its strength when the archers shoot at them, Genesis 49:24; and makes them 
    more than conquerors, Romans 8:37; and so lines the thorny crown with his 
    love, that it sits very soft on their heads.</p>
<p align="justify">(4.) He is their peace in time of contention and 
    division. With whoever they have war and strife, through him they have 
    peace, peace with God, peace with conscience, and a hopeful prospect of 
    getting thither,—where light shall be perfect, and where therefore there can 
    be no difference of judgment;—where love is perfect, and therefore no 
    alienation of affections among the inhabitants shall prevail.</p>
<p align="justify">9. Scarcity of provisions makes this world a weary land. 
    What else can be expected in the waste howling wilderness of this world, 
    where, though there is enough to raise the appetite of lusts, and a 
    sufficiency of husks for swine to feed on; yet provision suitable for the 
    soul is very scarce; and this is what makes the world to the saints a weary 
    land. For oftentimes their table is overturned; the table of public 
    ordinances is removed, which brings a famine of the word by which their 
    souls should live, Amos 8:11, 12. Then they may be sent to seek bread for 
    their souls with the peril of their lives; and this makes a weary land to 
    these that know the spiritual sweetness of gospel ordinances.—Again, many 
    times when they come to the table of ordinances, they get nothing at all, 
    not a mess from the King's hand, less or more. How often are prayers, 
    sermons, communions, like the empty chair of state, the king not filling it; 
    like the empty grave, where the grave clothes lie, but the Lord himself is 
    gone; so that there is nothing substantial with which to satisfy the hungry 
    soul.—Finally, at their best entertainment in the weary land, they 
    ordinarily rise hungry, and with an appetite. They are held short by the 
    head, and it is but drops and sips that are got in this world; the full 
    feast, where they shall hunger no more, is reserved to the pleasant land, 
    where there is fullness of joy, and pleasures evermore. But in this respect 
    Christ is a suitable shadow, he keeps the soul from fainting; rather than 
    they should want, bread shall be sent from Heaven, and water shall flow out 
    of the flinty rock: "Open your mouth wide," says he, "and I will fill it," 
    Psalm 81:10. He has the keys of Heaven, and is the great steward of the 
    Father's treasures, who, in the greatest scarcity, has enough amply to 
    furnish those who by faith come to him.</p>
<p align="justify">10. Little company in the road to Zion makes it a weary 
    land to the traveler thitherward. The multitude go all the other way; few 
    take the narrow road. Christ's flock is but a little flock; in Elijah's days 
    there were so very few upon the road, that he thought he had been all alone; 
    he had so little help of the seven thousand, that he knew not of them. See 
    how Micah longed for company on the road, but they were hidden out of his 
    view, Micah 7:1, and downwards. Now, this circumstance makes it a weary 
    land; for at this rate the traveler has few to take a lift of his burden, 
    and bear it with him. The apostle says, "Bear you one another's burdens, and 
    so fulfill the law of Christ." But alas! we are in a strange land, and there 
    are many to lay a load above a burden, but few to take a lift of it. But 
    people must even creep under their own burdens as they can, and keep to it 
    themselves. This is what makes a weary world. But they are not to be moaned 
    in this case, who get in under Christ's shadow; he can bear them, and their 
    burden also. The Lord even reduces his people to this case, that they may 
    depend the more upon himself. When we have created props standing about us, 
    we are ready to lay over much weight on them, and therefore the Lord suffers 
    people to find their own weight, that they may be constrained to employ 
    himself, to put the work in his own hand.—Again, the traveler has few to 
    consult with, when he comes to a difficult and dark step. There are such 
    steps which Christians meet with in their way to Zion, and it is no small 
    mercy to have those who will help by their sympathy, advice, and prayers. 
    But, alas! the unfeeling world affords few such; and this is what makes it a 
    weary land. But Christ lives, and he lives to be a counselor, an 
    interpreter, one among a thousand. Therefore, let us not complain in this 
    case: Micah 4:9, "Now, why do you cry out aloud? is there no king in you? is 
    your counselor perished?" They are well-guided whom Jesus guides; and if he 
    do not guide us, we may blame ourselves," for, "the meek he will guide in 
    judgment, and the meek will he teach his way," Psalm 25:9. Let us go to the 
    oracle, and improve his prophetic office.—Finally, they have few to keep 
    them out of languor by the way. It would be a great comfort to the weary 
    traveler, to have the benefit of conference about the holy city, the New 
    Jerusalem, to which the travelers are going, and of the glory, ease, and 
    rest, that are to be enjoyed there; it would tend to comfort and stir them 
    up to vigorous walking. But they are not alone, who have Christ with them; 
    he can bear the soul company by his word and Spirit, he can keep them from 
    languishing in the weary land.—We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To show in what respects Christ is a suitable and 
    refreshful shade or shelter. The truth is, there is nothing in Christ but 
    what affords a refreshful shade to the believer in the weary land: Song 
    5:16, "Yes, he is altogether lovely." But the breaking of the spices will 
    make them the more fragrant to those that have their senses spiritually 
    exercised. Therefore observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That his very name affords a broad shade for the 
    refreshment of the traveler in the weary land, sufficient to recover the 
    soul that is swooning away: Song 1:3, "Because of the savor of your good 
    ointments, your name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins 
    love you." When Moses would see the glory of God, the Lord proclaimed his 
    name before him: Exodus 34:6, "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and 
    gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy 
    for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin, and that will by 
    no means clear the guilty." His name is more glorious than if it were 
    written in letters of gold; it is written to us in letters of his precious 
    blood. The truth is, all things in the world are rather names than things, 
    the most desirable things in it are the name of nothing: Proverbs 23:5, 
    "Will you set your eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make 
    themselves wings, they fly away as an eagle toward Heaven." The terrible 
    things of it are but frightful names, 2 Corinthians 6:9, 10; but here is a 
    name "that is above every name," Philippians 2:9. I shall mention only three 
    instances.—His name is,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Jesus, a Savior: Matthew 1:21, "His name shall be 
    called Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins." How sweet must 
    this name be to a sensible lost sinner! in the world we hear of Adam the 
    destroyer, who mined himself and all his posterity; of sinners, his 
    children, self-destroyers, Hosea 13:9; of Abaddon, the great destroyer, who 
    goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. But to all these 
    we may comfortably oppose Jesus the Savior; stronger than Adam, saving those 
    that he destroyed; stronger than sinners, helping those that have destroyed 
    themselves; stronger than Satan, whom he spoils of his prey: Isaiah 49:25, 
    "Thus says the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, 
    and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him 
    that contends with you, and I will save your children."—His name is,</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Messiah, or Christ, the anointed of the Father, 
    pointing at his three offices. For under the Old Testament, prophets, 
    priests, and kings were anointed; it signified their call to the office: so 
    that in this name we see him in all his offices, called to the Mediatory 
    office by the Father, and fully furnished for it; and so there is enough in 
    him for all our needs, to be drawn forth by faith in his name. And we have 
    it in Greek, as well as in Hebrew, showing that the Gentiles, as well as the 
    Jews have access to him: John 1:41, "We have found the Messiah, which is, 
    being interpreted, the Christ."—His name is,</p>
<p align="justify">(3.) Immanuel, God with us, Matthew 1:23. If we press 
    this name by faith, the sap of it will come forth to the believer in three 
    things.—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, God in our nature: John 1:14, "And the word was made 
    flesh." God made man; Satan having withdrawn man from his allegiance, the 
    whole human nature was corrupted, and set at enmity with God. But, behold in 
    Christ the divine and human natures united, Heaven and earth joined together 
    in him, under the shade of which sinners may, with comfort and confidence, 
    approach to God.—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, God reconciled to us in Christ: John 1:14, "And 
    dwelt among us;" (Gr. tabernacled.) Christ is the tabernacle of meeting, 
    wherein God and sinners meet in peace: Revelation 21:3, "Behold, the 
    tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall 
    be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God." There 
    the weapons fall out of the hand of justice, and there the arms of mercy 
    embrace the sinner. When the sinner comes there, he is out of the dark and 
    black region, where death, wrath, and the curse reign; he comes into a place 
    of light, the light of the Lord's countenance, that shines on sinners in the 
    face of Jesus, our Immanuel. O what a blessed shade is here!—There is,</p>
<p align="justify">3dly, God on our side: Psalm 46:7, "The Lord of hosts is 
    with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge." Under this shade, believers may 
    bid defiance to all their enemies, the united powers of earth and Hell: 
    Romans 8:31, "If God be for us, who can be against us." This is the best 
    shade the Lord's people can betake themselves to in a time of confusion and 
    danger. Before the wars of Canaan began, the Lord brought Joshua under it, 
    Joshua 5:13, 14. And if people could be got awakened out of their sleep upon 
    these pillows which their enemies have laid under their heads, the directing 
    them to this shadow by the word would be both reckoned sweet and seasonable, 
    as Exodus 9:20. This was the shadow Isaiah directed the people to, when the 
    news came that the malignant Ephraimites, and the idolatrous Syrians, were 
    confederated to war against Judah, and to set up a king of their own stamp 
    over Judah: Isaiah 7:2–6, "And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria 
    is confederate with Ephraim; and his heart was moved, and the hearts of his 
    people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind. Then said the Lord 
    unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shear-jashub your son, at 
    the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's 
    field, and say unto him, take heed, and be quiet, fear not, neither be 
    faint-hearted, for the two. tails of these smoking firebrands, for the 
    fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the Son of Remaliah. Because Syria, 
    Ephraim, and the Son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against you, 
    saying let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach 
    therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal." 
    The prophet labors to draw them to this shadow, as a complete defense 
    against the scorching heat of these two smoking firebrands; for he says, 
    Isaiah 8:10, "Take counsel together, and it shall come to nothing, speak the 
    word, and it shall not stand, for God is with us," (Hebrews Immanuel is with 
    us.)</p>
<p align="justify">2. His natures afford a broad shade to the traveler in 
    the weary land; he is both God and man. Jesus, he is man, and as such he has 
    a sympathy, as one that has had experience of the troubles his people meet 
    with in the weary land: Hebrews 4:15, "For we have not an high priest, which 
    cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points 
    tempted like as we are, yet without sin." As he is God, he is able to give 
    them all protection in all cases and all conditions. However low they be, 
    his power, being infinite, is able to raise them up. So that, however 
    unequally they be matched with devils and men, they may say, as 2 Kings 
    6:16, "Fear not, for they that be with us are more than they that be with 
    them." When Christ sent out his apostles into the world, and knew that they 
    would be opposed by the authority of the great ones, by the power, the 
    learning, the prejudice, and superstitions of the world, over against all 
    these he sets these emphatic words, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the 
    end of the world," Matthew 28:20.</p>
<p align="justify">3. His offices are a shade to the traveler in a weary 
    land. These are suited to all the cases his people can possibly be in, in 
    the weary land.</p>
<p align="justify">He is a Prophet, to teach them, to lead and guide them: 
    Isaiah 55:4, "Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a Leader 
    and Commander to the people." If darkness arise, he is light to them that 
    sit in darkness. There is no case so perplexed, but he can resolve it; and 
    faith can begin where sight ends; and his direction will ever be ready to 
    his own in the time of need: "It shall be given them in that hour, what they 
    shall speak," Matthew 10:19.</p>
<p align="justify">He is a Priest to purge away sin, and manage his people's 
    cause in the court of Heaven. If guilt sting the conscience, and make a sick 
    soul, his blood removes the sting: it purges the conscience from dead works, 
    Hebrews 9:14: it heals all their wounds: Isaiah 33:24, "And the inhabitant 
    shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven 
    their iniquity." If they have a petition to present before the Lord, while 
    Jesus lives, they know of a proper hand in the court of Heaven, into which 
    they can put it. For he makes intercession for us; he is our Advocate with 
    the Father. This is no small comfort in the weary land.</p>
<p align="justify">He is a King, to protect and defend them, to conquer and 
    restrain all his and their enemies. If Satan be too strong and subtle for 
    them, yet Jesus is stronger than he, and can outwit him, and even outshoot 
    him in his own bow. His grace is sufficient against the greatest 
    temptations. If the world, the men or things of the world, be too hard for 
    them, Jesus has overcome both. And though they may be ready to cry out for 
    fear of these, that one day they will perish by their hands, yet their great 
    Captain being on their head they shall surely come off victorious at last, 
    saying, "Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory, through our Lord Jesus 
    Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">4. His purchase affords shelter in the weary land. The 
    price he paid was his own precious blood; the purchase then must needs be 
    great, seeing the price was of infinite value. He has purchased for his 
    people all that is necessary to make them happy. What Adam lost, Christ has 
    purchased again, and that with advantage; so that all their losses are made 
    up in him. Would you have the inventory of Christ's purchase? you have it, 1 
    Corinthians 3:22, "Whether Paul or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or 
    life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all are yours." The 
    best things for their enjoyment in time or through eternity. The worst 
    things, through him, work for your good. What a refreshing shade, then, is 
    this in the worst of times!</p>
<p align="justify">5. His relations afford shelter in a weary land. He 
    stands in many near relations to his people: he is the foundation on which 
    they are built, and therefore, as the house built on the rock stands 
    unshaken, so he will support them under all pressures. He is their Father, 
    and will allow them their provision, he will afford them protection, an 
    inheritance, and everything that children may expect from a father. He is 
    their Husband, and therefore will be their defense: yes, their Head, and 
    therefore he will guide them, and every way tenderly care for them, as the 
    head does for the several members of the body.</p>
<p align="justify">6. His covenant and promises afford shelter in a weary 
    land. The covenant is offensive and defensive, therefore the believer has 
    common friends and enemies with the Lord himself: Zechariah 2:8. He who 
    touches his people touches the apple of his eye. Hence, said Jesus, "Saul, 
    Saul, why persecute you me?" Who would not venture to sea in that ship in 
    which Christ himself, his interest, and his glory, are embarked; for though 
    the ship in that case be beset with waves, it will not sink. Caesar, when 
    embarking on board a ship to pursue his enemy, to encourage the pilot, who 
    was afraid of the storm, cried out, You have Caesar and his fortune embarked 
    with you. How much more may the Christian not be afraid in the greatest 
    storm, when Christ, his interest, and his honor, are with him. There are 
    promises in the covenant suited to every case. The Lord has secured to his 
    people protection and provision in the worst of times: "He shall dwell on 
    high, his place of defense shall be the munition of rocks; bread shall be 
    given him, his water shall be sure."</p>
<p align="justify">He has secured them against apostasy: John 10:29, "No man 
    (says he) shall pluck them out of my Father's hand." He has promised 
    strength to the weak and fearful, Isaiah 40:29–31; he has promised his 
    presence to be with them forever, Hebrews 13:5; Isaiah 43:2, he has promised 
    that all things shall work together for their good, Romans 8:28; and 
    finally, there is nothing whatever which can befall them in the weary land, 
    bat there is something in the covenant and the promise suited to it, 
    peculiarly calculated to comfort and support them under every pressure.</p>
<p align="justify">It remains that, as was proposed,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. I make some practical improvement, which I shall do,</p>
<p align="justify">1st, In an use of information, and,</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, In an use of exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">For an use of information we may see,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That it is a black mark of a soul, that has no more to 
    look for as a portion but the world; when they take so well with the world's 
    entertainment, that they never seek after Christ. The world is not the weary 
    land to them, and so they care not for Christ Are there not many who would 
    desire no better portion than the world, if they could get it kept? They 
    could well renounce their pretensions to Canaan, if they could get their 
    tents to stand always on this side Jordan: they would never desire a better 
    Heaven than their lordships, their farms, or what else they can work for 
    with their own hands. While these things prosper with them, they have 
    nothing to make the world a weary land to them; the country's disease never 
    wearies them; and if they be crossed in one worldly thing, they do not go to 
    Christ to get comfort under it, but to some other worldly thing. This 
    speaks, that they are at home in the world, and are not traveling towards 
    Zion. Others may be pilgrims in it, but they are not; they are just where 
    they would be, and have no other choice, Psalm 4:6. It shows also that they 
    would never look near Christ, if death did not make sure of their being 
    turned out of the earth. They have no love to Christ for himself, they could 
    fend well enough without him, if he would but let them alone in the world.</p>
<p align="justify">2. See here the mystery of the Christian life. Why do 
    true Christians so condemn the world? It is a weary land to all such. What 
    keeps them all under the tribulation of the world, while others faint, so 
    that they have had a joy in tribulation, took joyfully the spoiling of their 
    goods, yes, and even death itself? Why, under the shadow of the great Rock, 
    they got meat to eat the world knew not of.</p>
<p align="justify">3. See the transcendent excellence of Christ. What a 
    precious one must he be in whom there is enough to balance all the miseries 
    of the weary land! There are some of these that nothing under the sun can 
    balance; what avails all the riches and honors under the sun, to a person 
    under extreme bodily distress, or exposed to the arrest of death. But in the 
    most wearisome step of the weary land, Christ is a refreshing shade.</p>
<p align="justify">4. This lets as see, where there is a shelter to be found 
    in the worst of times, against the stormy tempest of public or private 
    calamity: John 16:33, "These things (says Jesus) I have spoken unto you, 
    that in me you might have peace; in the world you shall have tribulation, 
    but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world." In Jesus Christ our safety 
    lies, and without him there is no safety. Here is the rock that is higher 
    than we, and higher too than the highest of our enemies, whether devils or 
    men.</p>
<p align="justify">I have only now to add an use of exhortation. I would 
    exhort you to come to Christ, and put yourselves under his shadow this day. 
    And that you may understand what you are called to, take it in the following 
    advices.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Lay aside your security, and see that you stand in 
    need of a shade for refreshment and for protection in the weary land. 
    However lightly people look on the confusions of our day, I think we have no 
    reason to be secure; security is dangerous, seeing the sins of the 
    generation are crying sins, crying for a stroke. Whatever has brought a 
    stroke on a church or people, that is not wanting in Scotland this day. Did 
    universal corruption among all ranks bring the deluge on the old world? that 
    is visibly the plague of this generation. Did the despising of the gospel 
    bring the Roman armies on the Jews? Matthew 22:7, the monstrous profanity 
    among some, and loathsome formality among others, says we cannot escape, 
    though God bear long with us.—The many deliverances we have met with when at 
    the brink of ruin, and yet the generation not bettered by them, says that 
    the axe, which has been lying so long at the root of the tree, will be 
    wielded against us at the last: Amos 4:11, 12, "I have overthrown some of 
    you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand 
    plucked out of the burning; yet have you not returned unto me, says the 
    Lord. Therefore thus will I do unto you, O Israel! and because I will do 
    this unto you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel!" We are manifestly pining 
    away under spiritual plagues at this day, many given up to vile affections, 
    the generation generally plagued with hardness of heart and deadness, men 
    are turned hateful, and left to hate one another, biting and devouring one 
    another, all which is an evidence, that there is an evil spirit among 
    us.—Finally, our security in the face of alarming dispensations, is a 
    terrible token, according to that in 1 Thessalonians 5:3, "For when they 
    shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes upon them, as 
    travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape."—I would exhort 
    you,</p>
<p align="justify">2. To embrace Jesus Christ, and lay hold on the 
    everlasting covenant. You that are strangers to Christ, come in at length. 
    Let the state of your perishing souls come into your minds in earnest, and 
    lay a sure foundation for eternity. You who have already come, come nearer 
    and nearer, renew your acceptance of Christ, and stir up the grace of faith, 
    that for the present is lying in such a weak state.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Repent of your sins, and turn from them. Amend your 
    ways and your doings, and let not iniquity be your eternal ruin. Answer the 
    call of God at length, that there may be no standing controversy between God 
    and you. Many delays have been in this matter, bring it now to a point, and 
    halt no more between two opinions, whether to be for God or for your 
    lusts.—In a word, I exhort you,</p>
<p align="justify">4. To lay the weight of your through-bearing through the 
    weary land over on Jesus Christ.—Look before you to the difficult steps that 
    may be yet between you and the grave, and solemnly take him for all you need 
    or may need. Be concerned to depend upon him, and to trust in him, that he 
    will not cease caring for you, and working in you, until he completely 
    accomplish all that good word upon which he has caused you to hope.—To 
    prompt you to this good work, I would propose the following motives—</p>
<p align="justify">1. This is the shade God the Father has provided for you. 
    "I have (says he) laid help upon one that is mighty," Psalm 89:19; and you 
    hear what he says to you in the text. Therefore, honor the Father by coming 
    to his Son, and putting yourselves under his shadow. He knew sinners would 
    need a shelter in the weary land. O neglect not the offered 
    salvation!—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. That all other shadows are and will be but vain and 
    vanishing ones; they will not be able to defend you from the ills to which 
    you are exposed in the weary land; they will be like a hut built within the 
    sea-mark, which will be carried away, together with the inhabitant, when the 
    waters begin to flow: Isaiah 28:17, "The hail shall sweep away the refuge of 
    lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place." Then your own wisdom 
    will be but folly, your strength weakness, your carnal schemes shall not 
    profit you.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">3. That the wrath of God will pursue all who are not 
    under this shadow. O Christless sinners! what will you do when God rises up? 
    and when he visits, what will you answer him? He is a consuming fire, all 
    else you can put between him and you will be but as stubble, or at best but 
    a partition-wall of dry boards, that will quickly be consumed in that 
    devouring fire.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">4. That whatever weary steps you meet with in the weary 
    land, these will be doubly heavy by your not coming in under Christ's 
    shadow; for the curse will be in them; and though they were very light in 
    themselves, that will make them heavy. You will get all your burden to bear 
    alone, as Saul did. And, O what a sad case it is to have Heaven and earth 
    dark both at once! Isaiah 8:21, 22.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">5. That all the travelers to Zion have made this shade 
    their shelter. It is a tried shade in all ages of the church, Psalm 90:1; 
    whoever pursues them, this is the refuge of all the people of God in all 
    times: Proverbs 18:10, "The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the 
    righteous runs into it, and is safe." The spouse of Christ looks for this 
    shade, Song 1:7, 8, and 2:3: and many a good word they have spoken of it to 
    recommend it to others.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, That under Christ's shadow there will be safety 
    in the most wearisome parts of the weary land. He is the Savior, and there 
    is none besides him. Under his shadow there is safety from troubles, when 
    they are flying very thick in the weary land. He can hide his people in the 
    hollow of his hand in the midst of danger, Psalm 91:7. For he has all things 
    at his command; men and devils are under the check of his providence. There 
    is oftentimes a moderation of troubles.—Under this shadow people find, that 
    though they be not quite freed from them, yet they are made very moderate to 
    them: Jeremiah 15:11, "The Lord said, Truly, it shall be well with your 
    remnant, truly I will cause the enemy to entreat you well in the time of 
    evil, and in the time of affliction." And sometimes it is much better for 
    his people to meet with this moderation, Jeremiah 45:5. The life for a prey 
    is no small mercy. While his people rest under this shadow, there is always 
    a spiritual salvation from the sting of evil; thus the nature of afflictions 
    is altered, and the sharpest and heaviest stones thrown at them become 
    precious stones, which do them no hurt, but rather good; for "who is he who 
    will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?" 1 Peter 3:13.—To 
    sum up all in a word,</p>
<p align="justify">There is never missed here an eternal salvation. However 
    they be treated in the weary land, none go to Hell from under Christ's 
    shadow; but though they should go through fire and water, they will land at 
    last in Abraham's bosom, and be brought unto the wealthy place. Amen.</p>
