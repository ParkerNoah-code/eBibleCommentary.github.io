    ROMANS 6:6, "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the 
    body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin."</p>
<p align="justify">THE sanctification of sinners is no less a mystery than 
    their justification: the former springing out of the cross of Christ unto 
    them, through the intervention of faith knitting the sinner to a crucified 
    Christ, as well as the latter. Hence the apostle—having asserted the 
    insurance, of the sanctification of believers, that they shall certainly 
    walk in "newness of life," verse 4; in "the likeness of Christ's 
    resurrection," verse 5, that is, as Christ, during the forty days after his 
    resurrection, lived in the world after a new manner, very different from his 
    manner of life in it before his death—brings the ground of it from the cross 
    of Christ, in the words of the text. In which we have,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The ground insuring holiness of life in believers 
    united to Christ, "Our old man is crucified with him." This secures their 
    holiness of life, in such manner as the drying up of the fountain does the 
    drying up of the streams.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) The state the fountain of sin is in believers, "Our 
    old man is crucified with him." This supposes that Christ was crucified; 
    that in believers there is a twofold man, a new man, and an old; for while 
    he says, "our old man," he intimates that the old man is not the whole man, 
    as in the unregenerate. The new man is the new creature of grace in the 
    believer, or he as renewed. The old man is the corruption of nature, or he 
    as unrenewed. This old man is the fountain of sin in his heart and life.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, the state it is in is a state of crucifixion; it is 
    nailed to the cross, which is a state of death. And its crucifixion is a 
    con-crucifixion with Christ, Galatians 2:20. "I am crucified with Christ." 
    In so far as the believer is by faith united to Christ, his old man is 
    nailed to the cross of Christ, to fare here as Christ fared: and that was 
    heavy fare.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The issue of this state of the fountain of sin in 
    believers. It is twofold.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, The final issue, "That the body of sin might be 
    destroyed." The old man is the body of sin, being a complication of the 
    several sinful lusts opposite to the holy law, as the body is of members 
    competent to the human frame. Now, the final issue of this state of the old 
    man, the body of sin, is its destruction and utter ruin. Crucifixion is not 
    present death indeed, but it is sure and certain death. Pilate would have 
    "chastised Christ, and released him," Luke 23:16. but the Jews would have 
    him crucified, for that would carry him quite away from among them: even so 
    the old man is not to be corrected and amended, but destroyed quite and 
    clean.</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, The intermediate issue, "That henceforth we should 
    not serve sin;" that from the moment of our union with Christ we should not 
    serve sin any more, voluntarily living in it, and giving up ourselves to it 
    as its servants, to live and act for satisfying it, as we did before. The 
    old man may live long on the cross before he be destroyed: but then his 
    hands and feet cannot serve him as they did before, there are nails driven 
    through them; he may move them indeed, but then it is with pain and 
    difficulty. So was it with Christ; he behooved to recommend his mother to 
    the care of his beloved disciple John, for that his own hands and feet were 
    not at liberty to act and go for her as formerly.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The certainty concerning this ground, "Knowing this." 
    It is not a matter of uncertain hope, but known for truth. It could not be 
    known by sense; no bodily eye could discern our old man on the cross with 
    Christ: nor yet by rational deduction from natural principles; for the whole 
    mystery of Christ is supernatural. Therefore it is known by faith upon 
    divine testimony; it is a conclusion of faith to be laid down for 
    invigorating us in all our endeavors after holiness of life, and to be 
    firmly held and stuck by in all our struggles with the old man, as ever we 
    would desire to make head against him.</p>
<p align="justify">That I may touch the several purposes of this text, I 
    shall offer them in several doctrines to be briefly handled.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE I. "There is in believers united to Christ a new 
    man, a holy principle; and an old man, a fountain of sin.</p>
<p align="justify">I. Why the holy principle and the corrupt nature in 
    believers are called the new and old man?</p>
<p align="justify">1. They are called men, because each of them possesses 
    the whole man, though not wholly. There are by their means two I's in every 
    believer, Romans 7:15. "For that which I do, I allow not: for what I would, 
    that do I not; but what I hate that do I." There is not one part of the man 
    that is in Christ, but grace has a part of it, and corruption has a part of 
    it: as in the twilight there is light over all, and darkness over all too, 
    the darkness being mixed in every part with the light. So my renewed part is 
    I, a man having an understanding enlightened, a will renewed, affections 
    spiritualized, using my body conformably: but my unrenewed part is I too, 
    having an understanding darkened, a will rebellious, affections corrupted, 
    and using my body accordingly.</p>
<p align="justify">2. They are called the new and old man, for two reasons.</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) Because the new nature is brought in upon the 
    corrupt principle, which was the first possessor. The corrupt nature is of 
    the same standing with ourselves from the conception and birth, and 
    possessed us alone until our union with Christ by faith. And then only came 
    in the new nature, and that made the former old.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) Because of their different originals; the one being 
    in us from the corrupt first Adam, the other from the holy second Adam. So 
    the believer, looking on the corruption of his nature, may call fallen Adam 
    father; and on the new creature in him, he may call Christ father. The 
    second Adam coming after the first, made the first old: so the produce of 
    them in us is the old and new man accordingly.</p>
<p align="justify">II. How the believer comes to be thus split in two, two 
    men. This is done by virtue of his union with Christ, from whence arises a 
    communication of grace to him from Christ, 1 Corinthians 1:30. "But of him 
    are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and 
    righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption." Concerning which two 
    things are to be noted.</p>
<p align="justify">1. That in the moment of one's union with Christ by 
    faith, there is communicated to him, out of the fullness of grace in the man 
    Christ, a measure of every grace in him, as the wax impressed receives every 
    point in the seal, John 1:16. "And of his fullness have all we received, and 
    grace for grace." Ephesians 4:13. "Until we all come—unto the measure of the 
    stature of the fullness of Christ." And thus is the new creature formed, 
    being a new man perfect in parts, entire or having all its members, no grace 
    totally wanting.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence it is that the new man is formed immediately after 
    Christ's image, so that it is the very picture of the man Christ, as Eve was 
    of Adam. Therefore the forming of it is said to be the forming of Christ in 
    the believer, Galatians 4:19.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That yet there is not then, nor during this life, 
    communicated to the believer a full measure of any grace, 1 Corinthians 
    13:9. "For we know in part." So all the graces being imperfect, though they 
    remove sin as far as they go, they cannot fill up the room in any part, 
    mind, will, or affections. And thus is there an old man left in the believer 
    still, Romans 7:14. which is the image of the first Adam, from whom the 
    corruption composing it is derived.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Hence see, that the believer's life while here 
    cannot miss to be a struggling life, Galatians 5:17. "For the flesh lusts 
    against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary 
    the one to the other; so that you cannot do the things that you would." The 
    believer is like. Rebekah in another case, the two men struggle in him; and 
    like the two armies in the Shulamite.</p>
<p align="justify">2. See here the rise of the peace and easy life of it 
    most men have. The flesh in them has no competitor. In the state of glory, 
    grace has all, so there is a perfect peace: in the state of nature, 
    corruption has all; so there is peace too; except what is marred by the 
    struggle between the flesh in one part lusting, and the flesh in another 
    part fearing, as in Balaam, 2 Peter 2:15. "who loved the wages of 
    unrighteousness." Compared with Numbers 22:18. "If Balak would give me his 
    house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my 
    God, to do less or more." Whereas the struggle in the believer is between 
    the flesh and Spirit in the same part willing, and willing the same thing of 
    their proper motion, Romans 7:15, 16. forfeited.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. II. The old man in believers is a body of sin, 
    an entire body, lacking none of its members, Romans 7:24. "O wretched man 
    that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" This appears 
    from the account of it already given. As we derive every grace from the 
    second Adam in our regeneration, so every corruption from the first Adam in 
    our natural generation.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. This may serve to humble believers, when they are 
    at their best. There is an entire body of sin in them while they are here. 
    Do they excel in any grace? yet there is in them a member of the old man 
    opposite to it, as passion in meek Moses. Have they every grace in them? 
    They have every corruption too, though every one does not appear, more than 
    every grace. Therefore they have need to watch against all sin whatever; for 
    there is never a snare in the ill world but there is a member of the old man 
    ready to fall in with it, Colossians 3:5. "Mortify therefore your members 
    which are upon the earth; fornication, impurity," etc.</p>
<p align="justify">2. No wonder the believer groans being burdened, having a 
    whole body of sin carrying about with him. And they that groan not under it 
    are certainly all flesh; no new man in them. If you belong to Christ you 
    cannot want an errand to him for sanctification. You have a body of sin to 
    lay before him, which he alone can destroy.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE. III. The old man in believers is crucified with 
    Christ. This bears two things.</p>
<p align="justify">I. Christ was crucified. He not only died for us, but 
    died for as the cursed, painful, shameful, lingering death on the tree of 
    the cross; which we are met to commemorate. Christ was put to this death for 
    us, rather than another kind of death.</p>
<p align="justify">1st, That the first sin that let in all sin into the 
    world might be the more clearly read in the punishment. When you consider 
    the awful and tremendous dispensation of the Son of God, the second Adam, 
    hanging naked on a tree, and dying there at great leisure in exquisite pain, 
    can you miss to see the fiery wrath of God against the sin of that naked 
    pair in paradise, pleasuring themselves in the fruit of the forbidden tree, 
    and in an instant defacing the image of God in them?</p>
<p align="justify">2dly, That the whole world might see what a low and hard 
    state Christ took on him, putting himself in our room. We were bond-men 
    under the curse, and Christ took on him our state of servitude, and that 
    under the curse becoming a bond-man for us under the curse, Philip. 2:7. "He 
    took upon him the form of a servant." Hereof the death on the cross was the 
    sign and badge, being the punishment of slaves, and accursed in the law. And 
    to make way for this circumstance, the Jews were subjected to the Romans.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Remember a crucified Christ, enter this night deep 
    into the thought of the Son of God hanging, groaning, dying on a cross for 
    us. Admire the matchless love in it. Behold the severity of divine justice 
    against sin in it. Prize the salvation so dearly bought, and receive it with 
    thankfulness.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Think not strange, if you have a crucified life in the 
    world. If you are Christians, followers of Jesus, why should you think 
    strange of it, to be thus conformed to your head?</p>
<p align="justify">II. The old man in believers is crucified together with 
    him. Here we are to inquire how it is crucified with him; which take in the 
    following particulars.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Christ hung on the cross as a public person, a 
    representative of his spiritual seed. For he was the second Adam suffering, 
    as the other the first Adam sinning. So that as they sinned in Adam, they 
    suffered in Christ; the law having them all on the cross in Christ their 
    representative, Galatians 2:20. "I am crucified with Christ."</p>
<p align="justify">2. Christ hanging on the cross had the body of all their 
    sins upon him, your old man, and my old man. They were on him by the 
    imputation of the guilt of them, though not inherent in him, 2 Corinthians 
    5:21. "For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might 
    be made the righteousness of God in him." Therefore our old man is said to 
    be crucified, not in him, but with him.</p>
<p align="justify">3. While he was hanging on the cross, he was 
    meritoriously doing away the guilt of them, and consequently the power, 
    pollution, and very being thereof; inasmuch as the guilt being removed, 
    these must cease of course. For the strength of sin is the law, whereby it 
    stakes down the sinner under the curse, 1 Corinthians 15:56.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The sinner being united to Christ by faith, the merit 
    and virtue of Christ's suffering on the cross is actually applied to him. So 
    that, his guilt being removed, there is a reigning principle of grace 
    planted in him, going through the whole man, whereby the dominion of sin is 
    broken, Romans 6:14. and the pollution removed so far as that new man goes, 
    Titus 3:5. So that the believer is an image of Christ on the cross, full of 
    grace in him, and of sin on him; but the former working off the latter.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. See then, O communicants, that the crucifying of 
    the old man, the body of sin in you, depends entirely on your uniting with 
    Christ by faith. The sacrament is appointed to seal and strengthen that 
    union. Therefore your great business at the table should be, closely to knit 
    with a crucified Christ. The more of that, the more will the death of sin be 
    hastened on. And they that aim not at the destruction of sin in their 
    communicating, while they pretend to remember a crucified Savior, forget the 
    end of his crucifixion, namely, that the body of sin, being crucified with 
    him, might be destroyed.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The old man in believers is in a state of death, 
    though not dead outright. It is crucified with Christ. It may move and stir 
    in them, and vehement struggles it may make, as a dying man struggling with 
    the mortal disease: but whatever efforts it make, it is on the cross, whence 
    it shall not come down until it breathe out its last.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The practice of religion is painful work; and 
    Christians must not think it strange, that oft-times they are pained to the 
    heart in it. The saints in glory have no pain in their work; for the old man 
    is destroyed in them: but the saints here have an unrenewed part; and that 
    is on the cross, and cannot but pain them. There are right eyes in them to 
    be plucked out; the man has a painful struggle in denying himself, crossing 
    his own inclinations, wrestling against his own flesh and blood. Providence 
    thrusts a spear into the old man's side, by piercing trials and troubles; it 
    breaks his legs by cutting disappointments from many airths, to forward his 
    death. This cannot be but painful.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The old man is long a-dying out; for crucifying is a 
    lingering death. There must be an exercise of patience in the Christian 
    course; for there may be many a battle before the complete victory be got. 
    Many a wound the old man will take before he fall; and after he is worsted 
    again and again, he will get up and renew the battle, until he get the final 
    stroke from the Lord's immediate hand.</p>
<p align="justify">It is a grave question, Why does the Lord suffer the old 
    man of sin to dwell in his people after their conversion? Why is not sin 
    quite expelled at the first entry of grace? Our text affords one weighty 
    reason for it, namely, that the members may be conformed to the head. Christ 
    did not put off the body of our sins, that by imputation lay on him, at his 
    very first encounter with it: nay, he had a grievous struggle with it for 
    the space of three hours on the cross, until he himself got the first fall, 
    dying by its hand on the cross. Nay, if we reckon rightly, it lay heavy on 
    him the space of thirty-three years; only upon the cross was the heat of the 
    battle, which ended in his death and burial, whereby he put it off quite and 
    clean. So, since imputed sin was on Christ the head all his life, inherent 
    sin is left in believers, the members, all their life. The old man is 
    crucified with him.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE IV. By virtue of the cross of Christ, the old 
    man in believers shall certainly be destroyed quite and clean at length. 
    Here we may inquire,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What destruction is that that is certainly abiding the 
    old man in believers? It is an utter destruction of it, with all effects of 
    it, all marks and vestiges of it, all belonging with it to the old Adam.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The old man himself shall be destroyed, utterly 
    destroyed, out of all that are Christ's; so that though he has many a time 
    trod them like a field of battle, there shall not be in them the least print 
    of his feet to be discerned, Hebrews 12:23. "The spirits of just men made 
    perfect." The day will come, when there shall not be the least guilt of it 
    on them, to draw a frown from their Father's face against them, (Is. 33. 
    "The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity"); when it 
    shall have no power to prevail over them in the least: nay, when it shall no 
    more have an indwelling in them, Hebrews 12:23. forfeited; but shall be 
    utterly east forth as an abominable branch. So the new man shall possess all 
    alone, without a competitor forever.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The sinful vile body derived from old Adam, which 
    brought him down from Adam to us, Psalm 51:5. and continues to the end the 
    best friend he has in believers, shall be destroyed for his sake. The soul 
    shall leave the sinful flesh to be carried into the grave, where it shall 
    rot and consume, until it return to the dust again, so as not the least 
    lineament of old Adam's image or likeness shall be discerned on it. And 
    Christ will take the same dust thus purified, and form it anew after his own 
    likeness as second Adam, Philippians 3:21.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The visible heavens that covered him, and this earth 
    that bore him, and furnished fuel to his lasts, shall for his sake be set on 
    flames, and reduced to ashes, 2 Peter 3:10. "But the day of the Lord will 
    come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens shall pass away with 
    a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also 
    and the works that are therein shall be burnt up." Compare Genesis 3:17. 
    "Cursed is the ground for your sake." So that it shall no more forever be to 
    be said, There is the earth where the old man some time lived, and there the 
    heavens that gave him light and air. But Christ will make new heavens and a 
    new earth for the new man, 2 Peter 3:13. "Nevertheless we, according to his 
    promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells 
    righteousness."</p>
<p align="justify">4. Lastly, All that shall remain of him shall be buried 
    in Hell, Revelation 20:14. "And death and Hell were cast into the lake of 
    fire." Old Adam brought in the old man into the world, and he spread his 
    poisonous efficacy over all: so that look where you will, you shall not see 
    in all this world that in which there is not sin, or some effect of sin. But 
    then all shall be gathered from off believers, and from off the now groaning 
    creatures, and cast into the lake of fire; so that there shall not be the 
    least sin, nor effect of sin, without the boundaries of Hell.</p>
<p align="justify">II. When will the old man be thus destroyed? You will 
    easily conceive, from what is said, that destruction will have two periods.</p>
<p align="justify">1. At the death of the believer, and not until then. 
    Until then the child of God must wrestle on with it; for so did Christ with 
    it as imputed to him, until death set him free. It is a grave question, how 
    come believers to die being freed from the curse of the covenant of works?
    </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. They die in conformity to Christ their head; that 
    as death came in by sin, sin may go off by death. It is not dying that does 
    it indeed; for sin goes through death in them that are out of Christ, not 
    moved from off them for all that death can do. But at death, Christ gives 
    the ridding stroke between the new and old man, kills the old man outright, 
    as 2 Samuel 1:10. And he does it, by letting in a full measure of every 
    grace from himself into the believer, which takes up the whole man wholly; 
    and so the old man is gone in a moment, as the darkness upon the sun's 
    displaying his beams over all.</p>
<p align="justify">2. At the end of the world. Then comes the utter 
    abolition of all vestiges of it out of Hell.</p>
<p align="justify">III. The certainty of it. It is even as sure as the death 
    of Christ could merit its destruction, and as the end of his death cannot be 
    frustrated, and as he rose again from the dead free from the imputed guilt 
    of it, and sits in Heaven today without sin so much as imputed to him.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. Let the saints then take courage, and renew the 
    battle vigorously with the old man; for the victory will undoubtedly fall to 
    their side. And as for you that are still for keeping the old man's head and 
    heart hale; as you do interpretatively desire none of Christ's cross, it is 
    an argument you have as little saving interest in it.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE V. In the meantime, until the, old man be 
    destroyed quite and clean by virtue of the cross of Christ, by virtue of the 
    same cross the believer shall not be a servant to the old man more. That is 
    the present piece of freedom from it the believer has.</p>
<p align="justify">1. The believer has heartily given up with him for a 
    master. Some time he said, as Exodus 21:5. "I love my master,—I will not go 
    out free." But now he hates him mortally, and would gladly be altogether 
    free at any rate, Romans 7:24. "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver 
    me from the body of this death?" The very being in the house with the old 
    man is a burden.</p>
<p align="justify">2. He will get no work, but forced work, off his hand 
    more, Romans 7:15. "For that which I do, I allow not," etc. He will not 
    yield his members to the old man voluntarily, as before, chapter 6:13. 
    "Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin." 
    He will never get work with whole good will at his hand more, but half will 
    at most.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. This writes death to such as have given their hand 
    to Christ at his table, and are ready to go back into the service of their 
    lusts. If from henceforth you enter not into a struggling life against sin, 
    you have not felt the virtue of Christ's cross.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE VI.. Believers should go out against the old man 
    in Acts of holiness, in the faith that he is a crucified man; that is, 
    Believe your old man is crucified with Christ, and in this belief bestir 
    yourself against him in the use of appointed means. If you believe it not, 
    how can your hands be strong, having all to do yourself alone? But believe 
    it firmly, and it will make you as a giant refreshed with wine.</p>
