    Isaiah 25:6, "And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all 
    people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things 
    full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined."</p>
<p align="justify">THE prophets of old prophesied of the grace of Christ 
    which should come unto us, 1 Peter 1:10; and of these none more than our 
    evangelical prophet, who, in the verse before us, foretells a rich spiritual 
    entertainment which should be made by the Savior Jesus Christ unto a 
    starving world of prodigal sinners, reduced by their extravagance into 
    extreme want. Here there is to be observed,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The Maker and Master of the feast, the Lord himself; 
    it is a royal feast, with which the King of Zion entertains his own 
    subjects. Particularly, it is the Lord Christ, the Son of God, who, pitying 
    the famished condition of poor sinners, was at the expense of this costly 
    feast for them; for the maker of it is the same who swallows up death and 
    victory, verse 8. A warlike title is ascribed to him, the "Lord of hosts," 
    for there is a banner in Christ's banqueting-house; and this feast looks 
    both backward and forward to a war. You will observe,</p>
<p align="justify">2. The guests for whom this feast is provided: it is made 
    for "all people." Not that every person does actually partake of it, nor 
    that every person without exception is invited to it; the event shows the 
    contrary, there being many to whom the sound of the gospel never comes; but 
    intimating, that the invitation is given to all who come in its way, without 
    distinction, or exception of any sort of persons; Matthew 22:9, "Go you 
    therefore into the highways, and as many as you shall find, bid to the 
    marriage." The invitation is to the Gentiles, as well as to the Jews, to 
    those in the highways and hedges, as well as those in the city. All who will 
    come are welcome. You may observe,</p>
<p align="justify">3. The guest-chamber where this feast is held; "In this 
    mountain," namely, mount Zion, that is, the church. To that society all must 
    join who would partake of this feast. And as mount Zion represents both the 
    church militant and the church triumphant, so these are one church, one 
    body; and it is one feast, as to its substance, Hebrews 12:22–24. You will 
    observe,</p>
<p align="justify">4. The matter of the feast: a feast imports abundance and 
    variety of good entertainment; and here nothing is wanting which is suitable 
    for hungry souls. This is held forth under the notion of the best meat and 
    drink, because what these are to the body, the same is the gospel-feast to 
    the soul. In this valley of the world lying in wickedness, there is nothing 
    for the soul to feed on but carrion, nothing but what would be loathed, 
    except by those who were never used to better: but in this mountain, there 
    is a "feast of fat things," things most relishing to those who taste them, 
    most nourishing to those who feed on them; and these are "full of marrow," 
    most satisfying to the soul.—In this valley of the world, there is nothing 
    but muddy waters, which can never quench the thirst of the soul, but must 
    ruin it with the dregs ever cleaving to them; but I here, on this mountain, 
    are "wines on the lees," that is, the best of wines, which having been kept 
    long upon the lees, are therefore strong and nourishing. And these wines are 
    well refined, being carefully drawn off, and quite separated from the lees 
    or dregs, and therefore clear and fine. They are undreggy comforts; they 
    afford the most refined satisfaction and delight. From this subject we take 
    the following</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE, That Jesus Christ has prepared a most rich and 
    delicious feast for the souls of all those who will come to him, and partake 
    of it as presented to them.</p>
<p align="justify">In speaking upon this pleasant and interesting subject, 
    it is intended,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show the absolute need that there is of this 
    provision.</p>
<p align="justify">II. To explain what the provision is which Christ has 
    prepared for the souls of a famished world.</p>
<p align="justify">III. To consider what sort of a feast it is.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To confirm, that all people who will come, may come, 
    and partake of this feast. And then,</p>
<p align="justify">V. Conclude with a practical improvement of the subject.</p>
<p align="justify">We are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show the absolute need that there is of this 
    provision.</p>
<p align="justify">The distinguishing need for this provision was the 
    extreme necessity of a lost world, which, by Adam's fall, the great 
    prodigal, was reduced to a starving and famishing condition. The King of 
    Heaven set down Adam, and his posterity in him, to a well-covered table in 
    paradise, in this lower world, making a covenant of friendship with him, and 
    with them in him. Man consists of an earthly part and a heavenly part, a 
    body, and a soul: and as everything must have nourishment suitable to its 
    nature, so, although the body might, yet the soul could never be nourished 
    by the best produce of the earth. Therefore, by virtue of that covenant, it 
    was concluded, that, upon condition of perfect obedience to it, they should 
    have provision for their souls from the King's country. But man being drawn 
    into rebellion against God, this prospect was lost, and their table is 
    drawn; Adam and all his posterity in his loins were driven out of the 
    guest-chamber, the family was ruined, broken, and scattered, having nothing 
    left them.—To impress this the more upon us, let us view how our first 
    father left us.</p>
<p align="justify">1. In point of need, he left us with hungry hearts, like 
    the prodigal; Luke 15:16, "And he would gladly have filled his belly with 
    the husks which the swine did eat; and no man gave unto him." Every man and 
    woman naturally has a gnawing appetite after happiness and satisfaction. 
    This is so interwoven with man's nature, that it never leaves him in any 
    state whatever, and so will make a part of the torment of the damned: Isaiah 
    8:21, "And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry; and it 
    shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret 
    themselves, and curse their King and their God, and look upward." Every one 
    finds himself not self-sufficient, and therefore his soul cleaves to 
    something without itself to satisfy it. Listen, O Christless sinner! who are 
    destitute of holy desires, and you shall hear a voice within your own 
    breast, saying, Give, give, a continual noise. Look into your own heart, and 
    you will see it, in respect of desires, like a nest of young birds, all 
    gaping for a fill, but never satisfied, still gaping, after all that is put 
    in their months.—He left us also with thirsty consciences, scorched and 
    burned up with heat, so that most of them are in the dead-thraw, and many of 
    them quite seared. Hence the gospel-invitation is, Isaiah 55:1, "Ho! every 
    one that thirsts, come you to the waters." In a natural state there can be 
    no conscience but an evil conscience, the thorn of guilt is not pulled out 
    of it; it is a defiled conscience which needs to be sprinkled, Hebrews 
    10:22. And though a sleeping conscience in many, yet such is the thirst of 
    it in all the sons of Adam, that, when awakened, they cry out, We die, we 
    perish, we all perish, Luke 15:17.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In point of supply, he left us without any prospect, 
    for all communication with Heaven was stopped. War was declared against the 
    rebels, so that there could be no transportation of provisions from thence, 
    Genesis 3:24. Truth had said, Genesis 2:17, "But of the tree of knowledge of 
    good and evil, you shall not eat of it; for in the day you eat thereof, you 
    shall surely die." And therefore, though mercy might incline to supply a 
    starving world, justice interposes, and pleads that there could be no 
    communication between God and the sinners, without a satisfaction, which 
    they nor angels could not make; and therefore, without satisfaction, they 
    must be famished forever. Thus heaven's doors were closed on a starving 
    world.—Now, there was a mighty famine upon the earth, such as was with the 
    prodigal, Luke 15:14, "And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty 
    famine in that land; and he began to be in want." Adam's sons, abandoned of 
    Heaven, fell a-begging at the world's door, if so be they might find rest 
    and satisfaction in the creature. They go after a law-righteousness, if so 
    be they might find a rest to their consciences. But it fares with them in 
    this search, as with the unclean spirit gone out of a man. He goes through 
    dry places seeking rest, and finding none returns disappointed. When they 
    have traversed all the mountains of vanity for something to satisfy their 
    hungry hearts, they find nothing but husks to feed on with the swine; which 
    are the empty and unsatisfying things of the world, that can never feed 
    their souls, Luke 15:16. The poor sinner out of Christ, is like the hungry 
    infant, which sucks at everything to which its mouth comes near, and 
    shifting about, and getting nothing, falls a-weeping; but the appetite 
    continuing, the infant falls a-sucking again, where formerly it was 
    disappointed. Such is the life of every natural man, a continued tract of 
    lustings after, and disappointments from the creature. So that he is born 
    weeping, lives seeking, and will die disappointed, if not brought to the 
    feast of fat things. Again, they find but dust to feed on with the serpent; 
    Isaiah 65:25, "And dust shall be the serpent's meat;" that is, they suck at 
    the defiled breasts of their lusts, which can never satisfy, but poison the 
    soul. They cannot find their satisfaction in lawful worldly comforts; and 
    therefore, like hungry beasts, they break over into forbidden ground, and 
    all to satisfy a gnawing appetite after happiness. But there they are as far 
    from their mark as ever. For, though the enjoyment of a lust may please them 
    for a while; yet it is but like a man, eating or drinking in a dream, he 
    awakes, and behold he is faint, and his soul has appetite, Isaiah 24:8. 
    There is a bitter dreg remaining behind. Striking at this rock for water, 
    they cause fire to flash out on their faces; and sucking at these breasts, 
    draw out blood instead of milk. Traveling through the barren region of the 
    law for something to satisfy their scorched consciences, they can find 
    nothing but muddy and salt waters, which can give no ease truly satisfying, 
    but raises the thirst again. For the purging of the conscience is what the 
    law cannot do, Romans 6:3; compared with Hebrews 9:14. What can duties do to 
    the purging of the conscience; Isaiah 64:6, "But we are all as an unclean 
    thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as 
    a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away." Will mud 
    wash out mud? What can tears do for this end? Without shedding of blood, 
    there is no remission of sins. Even our tears must be washed in the 
    Mediator's blood, or they will defile the conscience, and leave a new stain 
    in it. What can trusting to uncovenanted mercy do? and such is the mercy of 
    God in respect of all who are not in Christ, Acts 4:12; 2 Corinthians 5:19. 
    They may make a plaster for their wounded consciences of these, they may lay 
    it on, but all their are can never make it stick, it will fall off before 
    the wound heal.</p>
<p align="justify">We come now,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To explain what the provision is which Christ has 
    prepared for the souls of such a famished world.—This, in a word, is his 
    precious self; the Maker of the feast is the matter of it, even Christ 
    crucified; his body broken for us, is that feast to which hungry souls are 
    called, and which they are to feed upon: "Take, eat, this is my body broken 
    for you." Galatians 2:20, "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; 
    yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the 
    flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself 
    for me." We have heard of mothers who have eaten their own children, but who 
    ever gave themselves to be meat unto them? But Jesus died that we might 
    live, gave himself to enliven and nourish our souls.—Let us consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The meat which is served up in this feast for the 
    hungry heart. This is Christ's body; John 6:55, "For my flesh is meat 
    indeed, and my blood is drink indeed." Never was there such a costly feast 
    in the world as this, Christ's body broken and bruised by justice, that it 
    might be food to us. This is the provision offered to you all in the word, 
    exhibited to you, O believers! in the sacrament. And you may eat, and must 
    eat of it, or you will perish: John 6:53, "Then Jesus said unto them, Truly, 
    truly, I say unto you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink 
    his blood, you have no life in you." Take him by faith, receive him with a 
    faith of application, and unite with him in the covenant; relish the 
    sweetness of Christ, improve every part of Christ, his low birth, his 
    sorrowful life, his bitter death, his burial, resurrection, and ascension to 
    heaven.—Christ's body is the fat things of this feast, which will completely 
    satisfy the hungry heart; so that your soul feeding upon it by faith, shall 
    be filled and satisfied, like the hungry infant, when it is set to its 
    mother's full breasts: Psalm 81:10, "Open your mouth wide, and I will fill 
    it." How can these things be? will an unbelieving world say. We answer, in 
    two things,</p>
<p align="justify">(1.) There is a fullness of the spirit of sanctification 
    in him, which is communicated unto all who receive him: John 1:16, "And of 
    his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace." And the more 
    eagerly that the soul feeds on him, the more of that spirit they receive. 
    The first entering of his spirit into the soul gives life; the further 
    measure of the spirit, gives life more abundantly. And there is a double 
    effect of the spirit of sanctification received from Christ.—[1.] The spirit 
    of Christ in the soul dries up the devouring deeps of unmortified desires 
    after the world of lusts, stops their mouths by stabbing them to the heart, 
    that the soul may live spiritually: John 4:14, "But whoever drinks of the 
    water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall 
    give him, shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting 
    life." Never thirst, that is, at the rate he did in his natural state. Gasp 
    they may, as a thief upon the cross, but they shall never gape so wide and 
    so incessantly as before, the soul being determined to starve them.—[2.] The 
    spirit of Christ in the soul stirs up holy desires in the heart, which are 
    the predominant motions and affections there: Psalm 27:4, "One thing have I 
    desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house 
    of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and 
    to inquire in his temple." The man's choice is altered, his desires run in 
    another channel. Sometimes it was, Who will show us any good? but now it is, 
    Lord, lift upon us the light of your countenance, Psalm 4:6. Now his 
    longings are after the Lord, Psalm 42:1, and 63:1. His sorrowings are for 
    the want of his presence; his comfort is enjoying the light of his 
    countenance. If he has a God in Christ to be his God, you may take from him 
    what you will; Psalm 73:25, "Whom have I in Heaven but you? and there is 
    none in all the earth that I desire besides you." Let these desires be 
    satisfied, and he is filled as with marrow and fatness.</p>
<p align="justify">(2.) The fullness of the Godhead is in Christ: Colossians 
    2:9, "For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." The 
    tabernacle of meeting between God and the sinner is the flesh of Christ; in 
    him they have the enjoyment of God as their God. Taking Christ by faith, God 
    is theirs, for he and the Father are one: thus in Christ they are complete, 
    Colossians 2:10. They are at the utmost stretch of their desires as to the 
    substance of them; for having God to be their God, they have all. And thus 
    the soul may feed on all the perfections of God: on his power, as theirs to 
    protect them; his wisdom, as theirs to guide, etc; on his word and all the 
    promises of it, which are theirs. Here there is both plenty and variety.—Let 
    us consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. The drink which is afforded at this feast for the 
    thirsty conscience. This is the precious blood of Christ: John 6:55, "My 
    blood is drink indeed." This is that spiritual drink which is offered in the 
    word, and exhibited in the sacrament: "This cup is the New Testament in my 
    blood." If ever you would have life, you must all drink of this blood, by a 
    believing application of it to your own souls: Romans 3:25, "Whom God has 
    set forth to be a atoning sacrifice , through faith in his blood, to declare 
    his righteousness, for the remission of sins that are past, through the 
    forbearance of God."—This is "wines on the lees, well refined," effectual 
    for purging the conscience of the most guilty creature, when it is 
    believingly applied to the soul: Hebrews 9:14, "How much more shall the 
    blood of Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without 
    spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" 
    This blood is sin-atoning blood, it answers all the demands of justice, 
    affords a covert under which a guilty creature may stand before God, and not 
    be condemned: Romans 8:1, "There is therefore now no condemnation to them 
    who are in Christ Jesus."—It is sin-expiating blood, "shed for remission of 
    sins unto many." Lay all your guilt over on this blood. It will blot out all 
    the items out of the debt-book of justice; it will draw the sting out of 
    your conscience, for which all other persons and things have been physicians 
    of no value.—It is peace-making blood. Lay the weight of your peace with God 
    on it: "Christ is our peace," Ephesians 2:14.—It is justifying blood; by it 
    is brought in an everlasting righteousness.—It is heaven-opening blood, for 
    time, in access to God and communion with him on earth; and for eternity, 
    that believers in it may be ever with the Lord, Hebrews 10:19, 20. How can 
    these things be? Why, in one word, this wine is the juice of the choice vine 
    of Heaven, it is the blood of the Son of God, and therefore of infinite 
    value, 1 John 1:6. When the blood of bulls and of goats could avail nothing 
    to cool the heat of scorched consciences, when rivers of oil, and the fruit 
    of one's body, could avail nothing for the sin of the soul; the Son of God 
    took on him man's nature, and in that nature died, shed his precious blood, 
    to be a ransom for elect sinners, to deliver them from the pit, Job 
    33:22–30.</p>
<p align="justify">We are now,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To consider what sort of a feast it is.—Upon this we 
    observe,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That it is a feast upon a sacrifice: 1 Corinthians 
    5:7, 8, "For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us: therefore, let 
    us keep the feast." Justice was provoked by the conduct of self-destroying 
    sinners. God's anger was incensed against us, and the fire of his wrath has 
    burned up many. And when wrath was gone out against the world, the great 
    High Priest stepped in, and offered up himself a sacrifice to atone for sin, 
    and turn away divine wrath. Here we are called to a feast on that sacrifice, 
    to partake of its virtue and efficacy.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a covenant-feast, Hebrews 13:20, 21. When Jacob 
    made the covenant with Laban, they feasted together on the mount, Genesis 
    31:44–54. There is no partaking of this feast, but by the way of the 
    covenant. All the guests must be covenanters, and they who are not pleased 
    with the covenant of friendship and peace with God, as held forth in the 
    gospel, cannot taste of this supper. But those who are well pleased with it, 
    and sincerely consent to it, Christ says to them, "Eat, O friends! drink, 
    yes, drink abundantly, O beloved!"</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is a marriage-feast, a marriage-supper, Matthew 
    22:1–4. The Lord Christ is the Bridegroom, and the captive daughter of Zion 
    the bride. He offers himself to each of you to whom the gospel comes, to be 
    yours in a marriage-relation. Consent then to the match, and you shall eat 
    of this bread, and drink of this wine which he has mingled. He is yours, and 
    you have all, which he has purchased, to feed on for time and for eternity.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is a feast which has a respect to war. The Lord of 
    hosts made it. It looks backward to that terrible encounter which Christ had 
    with the law, with death, with Hell, and the grave, upon the account of his 
    ransomed ones, and that glorious victory which he obtained over them, by 
    which he wrought the deliverance of his people. The gospel-feast is a feast 
    upon the back of that victory, and the Lord's supper is particularly a feast 
    in commemoration of that battle and victory. It looks forward to a war: Song 
    2:4, "He brought me to the banqueting-house, and his banner over me was 
    love." It is provided for and presented to his people to animate and 
    strengthen them for the spiritual warfare against the devil, the world, and 
    the flesh; and none can truly partake of it, but those who are resolved on 
    that battle, and are determined to pursue it, until they obtain the complete 
    victory at death.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, It is a weaning feast, Genesis 23:8. There is a 
    time prefixed in the decree of God, at which all who are his shall, by 
    converting grace, be weaned from their natural food. And with this their 
    sitting down to this feast agrees. Where is the soul which is now weaned 
    from their sucking so long at the dry breasts of the world? that soul shall 
    have the sweet enjoyment of this feast; and the more that they feed, the 
    more they will be weaned.</p>
<p align="justify">We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To confirm, that all people who will come, may come, 
    and partake of this feast. Not that all may immediately partake of the 
    sacrament, but that all may and should receive Christ, with his benefits, 
    offered to them in the gospel; they are made most heartily welcome.—To make 
    this appear, consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Christ invites all without distinction, even the worst 
    of sinners, to this spiritual feast: Isaiah 55:1, "Ho every one that 
    thirsts, come you to the waters." John 7:37, "If any man thirst," said 
    Jesus, "let him come to me and drink," Revelation 22:17, "And whoever will, 
    let him take of the water of life freely." These are gospel-invitations, 
    clogged with no conditions, comprehending all who are willing to receive 
    Christ, whatever their case is or has been.—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">2. For what end does Jesus send out his messengers with a 
    commission to invite all to come, if they were not welcome? Matthew 22:9, 
    "Go you, therefore, into the highways, and as many as you shall find, bid to 
    the marriage." Nay, the Lord is very express in the welcome given to the 
    worst of sinners, Jeremiah 3:1; Isaiah 1:18; and directs his messengers to 
    invite the most unworthy and unsightly persons to this feast: Luke 14:21–33, 
    "Go out quickly," says he, "into the streets and lanes of the city, and 
    bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. Go 
    out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house 
    may be filled."—Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, That he takes it heinously amiss when any refuse 
    to come: Luke 14:21, "He was angry;" angry, because those who were invited 
    would not come. He not only invites you, but you are commanded on your peril 
    to comply with the invitation: 1 John 3:23, "And this is his commandment, 
    that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ." And do what you 
    will, if you slight the offer, you cannot please him; for without faith it 
    is impossible to please God.—It only remains, that,</p>
<p align="justify">V. We make some practical improvement; and this shall be 
    confined for the present to a use of exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">1. We would exhort all hungry hearts who are suing for 
    satisfaction in the world and their lusts, and whose consciences have no 
    solid resting-place, O! come to Jesus Christ in his covenant, and sit down 
    to this feast prepared for you and the like of you.—To prevail with you, I 
    would mention the following MOTIVES—</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 1. While you come not to Christ, you have nothing 
    commensurable nor suitable to the cravings of an immortal soul. All other 
    things are but as stones or ashes, they are not bread; Isaiah 55:2, "Where 
    fore do you spend money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that 
    which satisfies not?" The man was a fool, who bid his soul take ease from 
    what he had in his barns. Nothing less than a God in Christ can ever satisfy 
    the cravings of an immortal soul, a soul which was created capable of 
    enjoying an infinite good. And nothing but the blood of the Redeemer will 
    ever give solid peace to your consciences.</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 2. Should not the continued tract of disappointments 
    you have met with at other doors, engage you to come to Christ's 
    banqueting-house? Jeremiah 3:23, "Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from 
    the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the Lord our God is 
    the salvation of Israel." Have you not always found creature-comforts 
    greater in expectation than in fruition? How often have you looked for much 
    comfort, where you got little? And has not your greatest crosses arisen 
    sometimes from those quarters whence you expected your greatest comfort?</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 3. In what you are now pursuing, consider that there 
    is not only vanity and emptiness, which will disappoint you, but there is 
    death in the pot, which will destroy your souls. There needs no more to ruin 
    you, but that you be left to your own heart's lusts, and take your swing. 
    Fearful will the reckoning be, when so much time, pains, and labor, are laid 
    out on the pursuit of the world, and the immortal soul is quite neglected as 
    to its eternal welfare, Ecclesiastes 11:9.</p>
<p align="justify">MOT. 4. If you will come to Christ, you shall get true 
    rest; rest to your hearts, rest to your consciences, Matthew 11:28. Whatever 
    your wants be, there is a suitable fullness in him; a fullness of merit, to 
    carry off your guilt; a fountain, even the depth of the sea, to wash it 
    away; a fullness of the Spirit to kill your corruptions; of righteousness to 
    cover your unrighteousness; of light for your darkness; of strength for your 
    weakness.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Consider, if you will come, you shall be happy 
    for time and eternity. When the lower table is drawn, you shall sit down at 
    the upper. If not, you shall never know satisfaction, nor find rest to your 
    souls.—I would exhort,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Communicants to feed on Christ at his table. Let not 
    the feast be in vain to you. Dead sinners, those destitute of spiritual 
    life, are not fit guests for the Lord's table, for they cannot feed. Such 
    will eat and drink judgment to themselves, not discerning the Lord's 
    body.—Here it may be inquired, How may one know if he has any spiritual 
    life? To this we answer, Whoever has spiritual life will be sincerely 
    longing to be rid of the grave-clothes of sin; Matthew 5:6, "Blessed are 
    they which hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled." 
    They will be content to part with all sin, and resolved henceforth to oppose 
    every lust, as a limb of the body of death; not only sin in general, but the 
    iniquity which is in their hearts, and with which they are most easily 
    beset. They are willing also to lay aside the grave-clothes of self; Matthew 
    5:3, "Blessed are the poor in spirit." They will look on the rags of their 
    own righteousness but as grave-clothes also, and set themselves against all 
    motions of this tendency. In a word, they are for doing all as if they were 
    to win Heaven this way; at the same time, overlooking all as if they were 
    doing nothing.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, to you living and believing communicants, we 
    acquaint you with Christ's welcome: Song 5:1, "Eat, O friends! drink, yes, 
    drink abundantly, O beloved!" Take it and use freedom in his house. Eat, 
    drink abundantly. Let your souls feast indeed at this gospel-feast, and miss 
    not the opportunity.—I will only say to you, as the angel to Elijah, 1 Kings 
    19:7, "And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched 
    him, and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you." you 
    have a great journey to go, and it is a question if you get such another 
    meal set before you, before you be at the end of it. You have a twofold 
    journey, each of which requires you to eat.—You have,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Your journey through the world, towards the Canaan 
    above. It is difficult at all times; so as that many never dare venture on 
    it others never make it out, for it lies through many difficulties. The 
    devil, the world, and the flesh, will struggle with you, to give over this 
    journey, of living well through the world. It is like to be more than 
    ordinarily difficult in our times. A spirit of delusion threatens a dark and 
    misty day. Labor to taste the power of truth, if you would be established in 
    it. A Popish and malignant spirit threatens with darkness, blood, and 
    confusion. This is evident, if we consider the apostasy in these nations 
    from the once covenanted work of reformation, the blood of the saints yet 
    lying at their doors, with the profanity and irreligion which is abounding 
    among all rauks. As we have reason to think the Popish and malignant party 
    in these nations, setting up for a Popish pretender, are infatuated of God 
    to their own ruin, that they may get blood to drink; so we have ground to 
    fear God may make them a scourge to the nations, and perhaps by them he may 
    drive them to reformation. Whatever, then, the clouds may turn to, eat for a 
    wilderness-journey.—You have,</p>
<p align="justify">2. Your journey out of the world, that is, to die well. 
    It is a weighty journey from time to eternity. Eat for it this day, and do 
    as you will wish to have done when you come to a dying-hour. It may be some 
    will not have as much time to think on it when it comes, as they will have 
    this day at a communion table. And that at a communion-table you may 
    eat,—labor to have your appetite after Christ sharpened. Open your mouths 
    wide, and he will fill them. Consider well your own needs, and his 
    fullness.—Adore the wonderful condescension of the great God. Reverence his 
    greatness; but beware of slavish fear and amazement. Look to God through the 
    veil of Christ's flesh.—In a word, beware of unbelief. Rest not in a general 
    faith, but exercise a faith of application: Galatians 2:20 "I am crucified 
    with Christ; nevertheless I live; and yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and 
    the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith of the Son of God, 
    who loved me and gave himself for me. Amen.</p>
