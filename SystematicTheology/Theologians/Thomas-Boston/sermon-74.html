<p align="justify"><br/>
    John 16:33, "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me you might have 
    peace. In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have 
    overcome the world."</p>
<p align="justify">THIS is a dark and gloomy day, in which there seems to be 
    a black cloud of wrath hanging over our heads; which if mercy prevent not, 
    is like to fall heavy upon us; yet the storm never blows so hard, but the 
    children of God may have peace; being, though upon a sea, yet in a ship that 
    cannot sink. Our text is the conclusion of our Lord's farewell sermon to his 
    disciples, in which we have the use and end of the whole, namely, that they 
    might have peace. While he discoursed to them, he had in view their peace; 
    that is inward peace and prosperity, contentment and quietness of mind in 
    the midst of trouble. All this they might have in him; being united to him 
    by faith, they might have peace in him, as Noah had in the ark, while the 
    deluge was on the earth. His own word was the mean by which they were thus 
    to obtain peace in him. This word leads the soul to Christ, where it may get 
    peace, and teaches how to employ Christ for peace. "Unless your law," says 
    David, "had been my delight, I should then have perished in mine 
    affliction."</p>
<p align="justify">We have next the necessity of his speaking these things 
    to them for that end. "In the world you shall have tribulation." In this 
    world they must lay their account to meet with tribulation. In Heaven there 
    is no trouble, in earth no rest. They shall have trouble in and from the 
    world, as they have peace in and from Christ. Observe the certainty of all 
    this; it is not, you may have, but, "you shall have tribulation." They have 
    no reason to be surprised with trouble. He warns them of it. There is no 
    escaping of it. It is the common way to Heaven, no going there otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify">We have also the duty of the Lord's people in 
    tribulation, or under the fears of it, "Be of good cheer." (Greek), Be 
    confident, over the belly of all you may meet with in the world. Keep up 
    your hearts, faint not. The comfort is, Christ has overcome the world, and 
    therefore though it may wound you, it shall not destroy you; and as surely 
    as Christ himself has overcome, so surely shall you overcome.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE 1. Jesus Christ freely forewarns his people of 
    the trouble with which they are to meet in his way.</p>
<p align="justify">Here we shall show First, how; and Secondly, why he 
    forewarns them.</p>
<p align="justify">I. We are to show how the Lord forewarns his people.</p>
<p align="justify">1. He forewarns them by his word. So he does here in the 
    text. Now Christ speaks to us by his written word, and by his ministers, 
    whom he has set as watchmen, to blow the trumpet and give warning. In the 
    glass of the word they may discern troubles coming on. The Scriptures are 
    like a weather-glass, in which the people of God may discern by parallel 
    cases, what may be expected in such and such circumstances.</p>
<p align="justify">2. By the dispensations of providence. There are signs of 
    the times, Matthew 16:3. These are, 1. Ordinary; when a people is brought to 
    such circumstances as naturally tend to some heavy judgment. Thus our Lord 
    said, "every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and 
    every city or house divided against itself shall not stand." This seems to 
    be our case at present. The divisions among our rulers in the important 
    matter now in hand, and divisions among others on the same point, say that 
    if God do not interpose by a miracle of providence for our help, we may be 
    in a sad case before long, 2 Kings 6:27. Surely there is a sad infatuation 
    on some side; while some look upon it as the way to make us happy, and 
    others as the way to make us and our posterity miserable. 2. Extraordinary. 
    Extraordinary operations in natural things, Luke 21:25. By such means the 
    Lord has warned us, and these extraordinary rains may possibly have a voice 
    to stir us up. Sometimes the Lord writes the fate of a nation upon the walls 
    of the great house of the world, as he did Belshazzar's on the walls of his 
    palace.</p>
<p align="justify">II. We are to show why Christ forewarns his people.</p>
<p align="justify">1. To take away the scandal of the cross. Often did our 
    Lord tell his disciples what he was, and what they were to suffer, that when 
    these things came to pass they might not be offended. These that give up 
    their names to Christ, and do not lay their accounts with trouble, they will 
    prove like those, "who when tribulation or persecution arises because of the 
    word, by and by they are offended." It is hard not to stumble when people 
    meet with an unexpected block in their way.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That his people may be forewarned. "Therefore, thus 
    will I do unto you, O Israel; and because I will do this unto you, prepare 
    to meet your God, O Israel." God's people are not always meet for a storm. 
    Lot may linger in Sodom; Baruch seek great things for himself; the wise 
    virgins slumber while the bridegroom is on the way. It is hard to stand in 
    an evil day, but most hard when we are surprised with it. Job had an 
    advantage; "I was not," says he, "in safety, neither had I rest, neither was 
    I quiet; yet trouble came."</p>
<p align="justify">3. Because he would have his people choose his way 
    resolutely; so as when they engage with him, they may be resolute to cleave 
    to him, come what will. He would have men either not to build, or else to 
    count the cost; either never to venture the sea, or else to be resolute to 
    ride out the storm. The devil flatters men into his way, lets them see the 
    bait, but not the hook. Christ holds the crown in the one hand, and the 
    cross in the other, and the cross nearest the sinner, Luke 14:26.</p>
<p align="justify">4. To stir up his people to come to him, renew their 
    acceptance, and get matters of controversy removed. Christ loves to have his 
    people about his hand, but in a time of peace, they are ready to wander, 
    then he will make fears to bring them back again. When the weather is clear, 
    they go abroad; but when the clouds grow black, they return to their 
    chambers, Isaiah 26:20.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of information. 1. Christ loves not to take his 
    people at an unawares, though he often does so with his enemies, Matthew 
    24:50. The news of the axe being laid to the root of the tree, comes to be 
    heard commonly, before the noise of its hewing. Sometimes he surprises his 
    people with kindness, Song 2:8; Psalm 126:1; but as for judgments, if people 
    are not aware of their coming, it is not for want of warning.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The way of the Lord is well worth the keeping, 
    notwithstanding the trouble we may meet with in it. If there were not enough 
    in it to counterbalance the trouble, why would he forewarn his people. But 
    there is that sweet in the crown, that may well make us digest the cross. 
    Moses puts the treasures of Egypt and the reproach of Christ into a balance, 
    and counts this reproach the greatest riches.</p>
<p align="justify">3. God's people cannot justly pretend that they are 
    surprised with trouble. It becomes not a Christian to say, I had not thought 
    of them. We may indeed be surprised with prosperity—wonder to see streams in 
    the south—to meet with kindness, when abroad from our country; and therefore 
    they are inexcusable, that are unprovided for an evil day. What! not to 
    provide in summer for the winter, when we know surely it will come.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Let not the world say God's people serve an ill 
    master. If he chastise, he tells his people beforehand, that they may 
    provide for a storm. The devil leads his blindfold to the pit, but Christ 
    warns his people of every dangerous step, he deals ingeniously with them, 
    telling them what they may expect in his service.</p>
<p align="justify">DOCTRINE II. That the church and people of God must lay 
    their accounts with trouble in the world. Here we shall show,</p>
<p align="justify">I. What is imported in this, that, "in the world you 
    shall have tribulation."</p>
<p align="justify">II. What these tribulations are, with which they may lay 
    their account.</p>
<p align="justify">III. To confirm the doctrine,</p>
<p align="justify">IV. How, and in what manner, the Lord dispenses 
    tribulations.</p>
<p align="justify">V. Give the reasons why they shall have tribulation. We 
    are then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To show what is imported in this, that, "in the world 
    you shall have tribulation." It imports,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That this world is not the place of our rest. Heaven 
    is our home; earth our pilgrimage. To whom earth is a rest, Hell will be a 
    place of trouble. As long as we are here, we are on the sea, where deep 
    calls unto deep. If there be a fair blink for a while, a storm is brewing; 
    and so will it be until we reach the shore, where a rest remains for the 
    people of God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. That the saints shall have trouble from the men of the 
    world. This I take to be included in the text. There are Canaanites in the 
    land, that will be thorns in our eyes. As the Israelites were in Egypt, so 
    is the church of God in the world. They are two distinct kingdoms that will 
    never unite, as belonging to two so different masters, the God of Heaven, 
    and the God of this world.</p>
<p align="justify">3. That the troubles of the Lord's people shall go no 
    farther with them than this world; when they have passed the sea of death, 
    they shall see them no more. The world is the only stage for acting this 
    tragedy, and when that is taken down, no other shall be erected. Devils and 
    men, can pursue the Lord's people no farther than a grave. God shall then 
    wipe away all tears from their eyes. Heaven is the place of the crown; the 
    world of the cross.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The certainty of their meeting with tribulation. It is 
    no doubtful or uncertain thing. It is beyond all perhaps. There is no 
    escaping of it; the world one way or another, will be about with the people 
    of God. No corn comes to heaven's granery, but what is winnowed here below. 
    As long as the seed of the serpent is within bowshot of the seed of the 
    woman, they cannot be secure.</p>
<p align="justify">II. We are to show what these tribulations are, which the 
    people of God may lay their account with in the world. I shall name some, 
    not knowing but some or all of them may be our case; but there is no hazard 
    of laying our account with the worst.</p>
<p align="justify">1. We find sometimes the enemies of the Lord's people 
    rule over them. So it was in Egypt, Babylon, and other places. It is a sad 
    threatening, "the stranger that is within you, shall get up above you very 
    high, and you shall come down very low." So we find it often in the book of 
    Judges, their neighbors ruling over them. Sometimes a professing people cast 
    off God's yoke, no wonder that he wreath the yoke of strangers about their 
    necks. It is much the same whether it be violently put on, or they stoop 
    tamely and receive it; but always the church of God is brought to a sad 
    state, when the wolf gets Christ's sheep to keep, and they are subjected to 
    professed enemies of the work of reformation. O pray that God may direct the 
    parliament in the matter of the union. They and we have to do with potent 
    neighbors. Our rulers are wiser than we, to know what will be best for this 
    poor land, unless the sins of the nation provoke God to make them blind. But 
    surely these hundred years bypast, the poverty this poor land has groaned 
    under, and the troubles the church of Scotland has had, were much owing to 
    the influence of our neighbors, and it will be next to a miracle, if our 
    prosperity come from that quarter.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Cruel mockings, Hebrews 11:36. This was the 
    persecution which Ishmael set on foot against Isaac. The seed of the serpent 
    are accustomed to spit their venom from under their tongues. Seldom are 
    Christians free from these, for the tongues of enemies are not always 
    restrained, when their hands are bound. O but it is sad when the enemy have 
    the Lord's people under their feet, then their tongues are as sharp swords, 
    Psalm 137:3; Lamentations 1:7.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Loss of their goods, Hebrews 10:34. If God let loose 
    the sword upon the nation, or if persecution arise, losses cannot be 
    prevented. When there are loaves to be had by following Christ, he will have 
    a large retinue; but when Christ and the world parts, then must we either 
    part with Christ or with the world. O! for the spirit of Moses, to choose 
    rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the 
    pleasures of sin for a season. To have the world's goods about us like 
    Joseph's mantle, that stripped off easily in a time of temptation. Let their 
    money perish with themselves, who esteem all the gold in the world worth a 
    day's society with Jesus Christ, said the Marquis of Vicy.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Loss of liberty. Often those that now follow the Lamb, 
    have been in bonds and prisons, banished from their native country, deprived 
    of the society of their relations, hunted as partridges on the mountains, 
    and what has been, may be.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Want of pure ordinances. Often the gates of Zion have 
    mourned, because none were allowed to enter them. The people of God have 
    sought the food of their souls with the peril of their lives; their teachers 
    being removed into corners, and dumb dogs set up in their stead, who have 
    hardened the hearts of the wicked, and discouraged the godly. Alas! our 
    contempt of the gospel, may bring a famine of it. The word of the Lord is 
    more precious, when there is no open vision.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Bodily torments even to death, Luke 14:26. All 
    God's people must be martyrs in action or affection. Those that love not 
    Christ better than their own lives, love him not all sincerely. Sometimes 
    Christ calls his people to resist even unto blood. Such days have been, and 
    Cain's club is still carried up and down the world, stained with the blood 
    of Abel. A generation of blood-suckers yet exists to make the scaffolds 
    smoke with the blood of the saints. In a word, whatever the wit of devils 
    can invent, and men practice, and God will permit, the people of God may lay 
    their account with. Yet we must remark it is tribulation, not destruction, 
    the church of God is to expect. She may be in tribulation, and yet come out 
    of many tribulations; and therefore for the comfort of the Lord's people, I 
    will say five things:</p>
<p align="justify">1. Enemies may be a wind to toss this ark up and down the 
    waters of affliction, yet not a rock to split her. "We are troubled," says 
    Paul, "on every side; yet not dismayed! we are perplexed, but not in 
    despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down but not destroyed." Nay, 
    the church shall be a rock, on which her enemies shall split, Zechariah 
    12:2, 3, 4. Men will be meddling with her to hurt her, if they can better 
    their estate by it; but if they prosper it will be a wonder, for never did 
    any meddle with the church but to their cost. The same power still exists 
    that drowned Pharaoh, and brought Haman to the gallows which he had set up 
    for Mordecai.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The bush may be set on fire, but it shall not be 
    consumed, Exodus 3:2. The church shall lose nothing by it but her dross, 
    Zechariah 13:9; but that shall at length burst out on the enemies, like the 
    fiery furnace into which the three children were cast.</p>
<p align="justify">3. They may drive here into the wilderness, but she shall 
    be fed there, Revelation 12:6; as it was in the days of Elijah. What will we 
    do, you may say, if ordinances be taken away; why, if there be nothing in 
    the wilderness, God will open the windows of Heaven. The doors of Heaven are 
    not always closed, when the doors of the church are closed. God is in 
    Heaven, yes Christ is there, and he shall be for a sanctuary.</p>
<p align="justify">4. They may hew down her branches, but the root shall 
    remain fast in the earth, and shall bud again. It is a sad sight to see men 
    go to with axes and hammers, and cut down the carved work of Zion. But let 
    it be never so low, it will rise like a terrible Spirit to enemies.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Enemies may carry the church of God to the brow 
    of the hill, and leave her on the very brink of ruin, and yet she shall 
    escape singing, "Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the 
    fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped." How did Pharaoh think he 
    had them all in his net, but the children of Israel went out with an high 
    hand. We now proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">III. To confirm this, that in the world the saints shall 
    have tribulation.</p>
<p align="justify">1. God has expressly told us of it. What can be more 
    peremptory than the text, "Through much tribulation we must enter into the 
    kingdom;" and all who live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution. 
    It is one of the articles of the Christian's indenture, to take up the cross 
    and follow Christ. The way to the crown is by the cross, by virtue of God's 
    appointment. It is true, the Lord does not call every one to be a martyr, 
    but every one that honestly engages with Christ, engages in these terms, 
    that if they should die for him, they shall not leave him.</p>
<p align="justify">2. This has been the lot of the church in all ages. There 
    was a Cain in Adam's family, an Ishmael in Abraham's, and an Esau in 
    Isaac's. Christ's flock has always had their noon, as well as their morning. 
    Silence in Heaven, is but for half an hour.</p>
<p align="justify">3. This was the lot of our Lord and Captain. He endured 
    the cross, despising the shame; and they that will reign with him, must 
    resolve to suffer with him also. It is vain to expect other treatment in the 
    world than he got. The servant is not greater than the Lord. If they have 
    persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, 
    they will keep yours also.</p>
<p align="justify">4. There is so much corruption in the best, that they 
    cannot long carry a full cup even, but when they stand they gather mud. They 
    have need of affliction to keep them from, or awaken them out of security.</p>
<p align="justify">5. They live among ill neighbors, even the wicked of the 
    world, who have influence on their calamities several ways. They are ever 
    ready to do them a mischief when they have an opportunity. We have had long 
    peace, but not because enemies were idle, not because they had no plots and 
    contrivances to injure the work of God, but because providence defeated, and 
    may even defeat them yet. Besides their wickedness provokes God against the 
    nation, to bring on national judgments, in which the Lord's people must 
    needs share, especially considering, that the godly themselves are, someone 
    way or another, often involved in their guilt; as by growing lukewarm when 
    iniquity abounds, not mourning over the sins of others. No wonder God send 
    an earthquake into Scotland, for the profane principles and practices of 
    some, and the deadness of others.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The devil is a restless enemy. He goes about like 
    a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour; and he is not to blame, if the 
    church of God has a moment's rest. He wants neither will, power, nor 
    instruments, to vex the church, if he could but get permission.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. We are to show how, and in what manner the Lord 
    dispenses tribulation to his church and people. I will say these four things 
    respecting it:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The church and people of God frequently meet with 
    tribulations in the world. It is seldom that this ark meets not with 
    tossing, until it come to rest on the mount of God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Sometimes the church of God has tribulation, while 
    enemies have no such thing, Zechariah 1:11, 12. Often it is so, as that when 
    the one goes up, the other goes down; yet sometimes both are in the furnace 
    of common calamity. Thus, both Jacob's family, and his neighbors the 
    Canaanites, were visited with famine at the same time. When it is thus, the 
    good metal is to be refined, and the dross consumed. The Lord can punish his 
    people for their sins, and yet enemies have no cause to triumph over them, 2 
    Chronicles 15:3–5.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Sometimes the tribulation of the Lord's people is 
    greater, sometimes less; it is not always alike hot, nor the clouds alike 
    full. They may suffer much, and not be brought to resist unto blood. The 
    Lord can bind up man's wrath, and say to it as to the sea, hitherto shall 
    you come, and no farther. Devils and men are bound with the chain of 
    providence. The tribulation ordinarily is hottest, when it is to last but a 
    short time. When the devil's time is short, his wrath is great, Exodus 5:10, 
    11. Again, it is hottest when the Lord has a mind to do great things for his 
    people and cause, but there is a generation whom he will have out of the way 
    beforehand. This was the case with the Israelites in the wilderness, because 
    they had tempted the Lord ten times, and had not hearkened to his voice: 
    they were not permitted to see the land which he swore unto their fathers, 
    but were all taken away before he accomplished the promise, Numbers 14:22; 
    for this cause, sore shaking commonly goes before God's great appearances 
    for his people, Hag. 2:7. O! that this may not be the generation which God 
    intends to shovel out of the way, before he revive his work. Once more, 
    tribulation is hottest when people through long ease have settled in 
    security, and defection has come to a great height. When a people thus leave 
    their first love, unless they repent, God threatens to come quickly and to 
    remove their candlestick out of his place. It is a dreadful case to provoke 
    God to unchurch a people. The longer the disease has grown, the more 
    difficult is the cure. A stubborn heart requires a violent wound. It is hard 
    to say, if ever there was so much profanity in principle and practice under 
    such light, as at this day. And it is too like the Lord is about to work 
    that work, that may, by the hearing of it, make the securest and profanest 
    heart to tremble.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Ordinarily, all goes not together with the people of 
    God; if they be under heavy troubles, yet they may get the gospel preserved. 
    "Though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of 
    affliction, yet shall not your teachers be removed into a corner any more, 
    but your eyes shall see your teachers." Though there may be darkness through 
    most of the land, yet there may be a Goshen where light is. Though they seek 
    it with the peril of their lives, yet they may obtain it. God's chamber 
    doors of protection are not commonly all shut together. When you are 
    persecuted in one city, flee to another. We have often seen it thus in 
    Europe, when persecution was hot in one country, Christians have found an 
    asylum in another. But, if all should fail together, God himself remains, 
    and the saints may encourage themselves in him. "In the fear of the Lord is 
    strong confidence, and his children shall have a place of refuge." "God is 
    our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble." We proceed,</p>
<p align="justify">V. To give reason why the saints shall have tribulations. 
    The church and people of God meet with tribulations in the world for good 
    reasons. They may say to those who are their scourges, as Joseph did to his 
    brethren, "But, as for you, you thought evil against me; but God meant it 
    unto good." God in such dispensations, has an eye,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To his own glory.</p>
<p align="justify">II. His people's good.</p>
<p align="justify">III. To hypocrites.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. To open enemies.</p>
<p align="justify">I. To his own glory. This is the end of all providences, 
    and of this in a special manner, which should make the yoke light to those 
    to whom his honor is dear. What if God should demolish the whole fabric of 
    the creation for his own glory, who could quarrel him in point of justice. 
    Surely we ought in that case, in our last prayers, say, "Hallowed be your 
    name." Now there is a large revenue of glory to God, rising from the 
    tribulations of his people, though they were watered with their blood.</p>
<p align="justify">1. There is a large revenue of glory arises to him from 
    his bringing them into tribulations. Hence he has the glory of his holiness 
    before the world. "I will," says he, "be sanctified in them that come near 
    me, and before all the people, I will be glorified." The people of God by 
    their sins, darken the glory of his holiness; but in their tribulations, 
    they are blind that may not read that, Habakkuk 1:13. David made enemies to 
    blaspheme, therefore David must smart to retrieve the glory of God, 2 Samuel 
    12:14. The sins of the people of God raise such a mist, that the holy nature 
    of God is not well perceived, but a violent stormy wind, will scatter that 
    mist. God gets also the glory of his impartiality in his judgments, Isaiah 
    42:24; Amos 3:2. The Lord thereby shows that his own shall not get away with 
    their sins and defections, more than others. He spared not his own Son, nor 
    will he spare his sons. He is a Father that loves his children, and 
    therefore spares not the rod. The heaviest weight in the ship of the church 
    that threatens her sinking, is the sins of sons and daughters, Deuteronomy 
    32:18, 19. One sleeping Jonah here, will do more evil than a whole crew of 
    pagan mariners.</p>
<p align="justify">2. He gets glory from his keeping them up under them. 
    Should his people sink under them, then his glory is lost, but the 
    everlasting arms are underneath them; hence they are kept up, and carried 
    through, though they go through fire and water; and hence God has the glory 
    of his all-sufficiency. The devil said, Job served not God for nothing. The 
    world says, the Lord's people speak much of Christ's fullness; but it is 
    easy swimming while the head is borne above; they even need the world to 
    complete their satisfaction, as well as others. Well, tribulation comes, and 
    the world sees then, that the godly can rejoice in God when all is gone; and 
    that they look as well as they that feed on the portion of the king's meat. 
    O! how do they live? Why, they live by faith on an all-sufficient God. "I 
    will also leave in the midst of you an afflicted and poor people, and they 
    shall trust in the name of the Lord." "Godliness with contentment is great 
    gain." God has also the glory of his power, 2 Corinthians 12:9, 10. The 
    saints living in the midst of deaths, says that Christ lives. The life of 
    Jesus is made manifest in the mortal flesh. The three children walking in 
    the midst of the fiery furnace, says there is a powerful one with them. The 
    church of God, is often in the world, like a spark of fire in a sea. It is 
    infinite power that keeps it unextinguished. Here also, he gets the glory of 
    his unchangeable love to his people: this explains these words, "Be content 
    with such things as you have; for he has said, I will never leave you, nor 
    forsake you." Do they not fear in the valley of the shadow of death, it is 
    because God is with them. What must spectators say, when they see them 
    casten at all hands, and yet taken up by him, but behold how he loves them. 
    Conscience will say it, though corruptions talk otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify">3. He gets glory, from his making them better by them. 
    Tribulations rub sore upon the Lord's people, but by that means they are 
    made clear vessels fit for the master's use, and so his house is made to 
    shine; and thus he has the glory of his wisdom. O! what wisdom must be 
    there, to bring life out of death, to cure by killing, and heal by wounding. 
    This is to bring a Heaven out of a Hell. Here wisdom attains many precious 
    ends, and all by one mean that the world would think destructive. He has 
    also the glory of his goodness he intends them good, and does them good even 
    in the worst cases. He gets the glory of his own grace in them. The heat of 
    the fire hardens clay, but softens wax; because of the different temper of 
    the objects. The grace of God in a soul, never so readily appears, either to 
    others or to the person himself, as in a time of affliction. Then they are 
    like a sick man rising out of his bed and running for his bare life.</p>
<p align="justify">4. He gets glory from his bringing them out of them. This 
    he will do. "For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the 
    righteous, lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.' If he 
    bring his people into the fire, he will bring them out also; for he says, "I 
    will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver 
    is refined, and will try them as gold is tried." Though they be sifted among 
    all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least 
    grain fall upon the earth. Though enemies may say, as to the tribulation, 
    the Lord has not done all this; yet as to the deliverance, when the Lord 
    turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. Hence the 
    Lord has the glory: 1. Of his wisdom, in bringing it about in such a manner 
    as is often unexpected. What wisdom appeared in his delivering Jacob's 
    family from the famine, by sending Joseph to Egypt; and the Jews from 
    Haman's conspiracy. The glory also of his power: For God's time of appearing 
    is often when there is least hope, and the case is most desperate, 
    Deuteronomy 22:3–6. He raises Christ mystical, when the gravestone is laid 
    on and sealed, when it comes to that, Can these dead bodies live? and none 
    can answer the question but himself. "Your dead men," says he "shall live; 
    together with my dead body, shall they arise."</p>
<p align="justify">The glory also of his faithfulness. The Lord will bring 
    his people to that with it, that they shall have a very strong faith, that 
    lays not down that conclusion: "I said my strength and my hope is perished 
    from the Lord." The providence and the promise of God seemed so to run 
    counter to one another, that Jeremiah upon that was brought to the borders 
    of blasphemy: "Why," said he, "is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, 
    which refuses to be healed? Will you be altogether unto me as as a liar; and 
    as waters that fail?" And enemies may be brought to say, there is no help 
    for the afflicted saint in God. But the deliverance confounds the one, and 
    makes the other blush; and writes his faithfulness in great characters. Thus 
    he magnifies his word; above all his name.</p>
<p align="justify">II. In such dispensations God has an eye to his people's 
    good. It is their happiness that his glory and their good are linked 
    together. As all work for his glory, so all shall work for their good, 
    Romans 8:28. I shall pitch on a few things here. It is,</p>
<p align="justify">1. to purge away their sin, Isaiah 27:9. Tribulation to 
    the Lord's people, is as the furnace to the gold; not to consume, but refine 
    them. It is not to purge them away meritoriously, but they are the means 
    which the Spirit of God makes use of to weaken our corruptions. Now they 
    contribute to this three ways: 1. As they convince of sin. They are as the 
    fire under the pot, that brings the scum up, and so it falls off. It is 
    difficult to convince men of prosperous wickedness, Jeremiah 22:21, 22. 
    Solomon tells us, "that oppression makes a wise man mad;" but a greater than 
    Solomon tells us, tribulation makes a mad man wise, Luke 15:17; Genesis 
    42:21. Misery will open the eyes which prosperity has closed. If the gospel 
    be taken away, it will not be so difficult to convince you of mis-improvement, 
    as it is now. Again, they make sin bitter. As Abner said to Joab of the war, 
    so is it with sin: "It will be bitterness in the end." It is like Ezekiel's 
    roll, sweet in the mouth, but bitter in the belly; thus it makes the man 
    vomit up with loathing, what with delight he swallowed down. The wormwood 
    and the gall being laid on the breast, weans the child at length. Once more, 
    they do it as they lead to repentance, Hosea 2:7. Repentance is the native 
    product of a blessed tribulation. Let us search and try our ways, and turn 
    again to the Lord. Waters of affliction make the head of the gracious soul 
    waters, and his eyes a fountain of tears for sin. Some now, they cannot get 
    mourned for sin; but if a sword come, if the glory depart, the hard rock 
    will stream out in the wilderness.</p>
<p align="justify">2. To prevent further sin, and more dreadful plagues. 
    Tribulation is a hedge in people's way, meeting them as the angel did 
    Balaam. Well may the children of God salute the cross, as David did Abigail: 
    "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent you this day to meet me." By 
    this, much mischief was prevented. It was a weary way which the Israelites 
    had in the wilderness. But wherefore did God lead them that way? It was to 
    keep them from drawing back, Exodus 13:17, 18. When a church takes a 
    backsliding, they would go very far back before they halted, if God did not 
    turn them with affliction. Thus it prevents more dreadful plagues, 1 
    Corinthians 11:32. It was a tribulation to Lot to go out of Sodom, but had 
    he not met with that, he had met with much worse. Many a time God drags 
    people out of harm's way, as he did a godly man, who broke his leg going 
    into a ship, which made him return. This saved him, for the ship was cast 
    away. So God may cast a church or person into trouble, to prevent the 
    casting them off.</p>
<p align="justify">To promote the spiritual growth of the Lord's people. The 
    plants in God's vineyard, grow best in the winter. The church is like 
    camomile, the pressing it down makes it thrive best; so it was with Israel 
    in Egypt. The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church. The church has 
    more professors in prosperity than in tribulation, but more true Christians 
    probably in an evil day. In such a time the graces of the Lord's people are 
    stronger. Sometimes they have run with the footmen, and they have wearied 
    them; yet have they afterwards contended with horses. So Peter, who at one 
    time by cowardice denied his Master, at another astonished his enemies with 
    his boldness. So it was also with Nicodemus. The graces of the Lord's people 
    are like the waters of the sun mentioned by Curtius, which are cold at noon 
    when the air is hottest, and hot at midnight when the air is coldest.</p>
<p align="justify">The Lord's people have most experiences at such a time, 
    Romans 5:3, 4. They gain a stock of experiences in the school of 
    tribulation, Hosea 2:14. We have many professed Christians at this day, but 
    few experienced Christians. Who knows but the Lord may lead them to the 
    wilderness, and speak to their hearts there, that when they come back they 
    may be able to say, "Come and hear, all you that fear God, and I will 
    declare what he has done for my soul." Now, it is highly reasonable that 
    these things be so, because they have more than ordinary to do in such a 
    time, and God suits people's strength to their burdens. They could not stand 
    without more experience of religion; and the glory of God is at the stake, 
    which would be wounded if they fell away. Besides, tribulation leads the 
    soul to more than ordinary seriousness, self-denial, and going out of itself 
    to Christ. In such a time also, they are feasted with a greater variety of 
    providences than at other times.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The humiliation of his people, Deuteronomy 8:2. I take 
    special notice of this, because it is the great design of the gospel, to 
    make the sinner nothing in his own eyes, that the Lord's grace may get all 
    the glory. This is the end of ordinances and providences, and is remarkably 
    carried on by tribulation.</p>
<p align="justify">Tribulation serves this purpose, as it discovers the 
    corruption of the heart that lurked before. Asaph's tribulation brought his 
    heart atheism to light, Psalm 73:13. See how that humbles him, verse 22; it 
    will discover that particular corruption, which of all others, the man 
    seemed to be most above. Thus, the impatience of Job, and the passion of 
    Moses were discovered, though the one was the most patient, and the other 
    the meekest man on earth.</p>
<p align="justify">It humbles the person also, as it makes him feel the need 
    of daily supplies and support from above. When a man gets a burden to bear, 
    for which he finds he has not strength enough, this sends him to God out of 
    himself. The greatness of it affrights him. Hence may we see the reason why 
    some people are helped to bear great troubles, while they sink under less 
    ones.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, The weaning their hearts from the world, and 
    making them desirous to be in Heaven. If they were not so harshly 
    entertained abroad, they might forget their home. But the more perplexities 
    they meet with in the wilderness, the more desireable will Canaan be to 
    them. No wonder they long to be ashore, who are tossed with the wind and 
    wave upon the sea. But blow what storms will, against the church and people 
    of God, the Lord does all things well; for the more the waters increase, the 
    nearer Heaven is the ark.</p>
<p align="justify">III. The Lord has an eye to hypocrites, in bringing 
    tribulation on the church, to try and discover them. Times of tribulation 
    are winnowing and sifting times, Matthew 3:10, 12; Amos 9:9.</p>
<p align="justify">The summer of the church's prosperity breeds much vermin, 
    which the winter dispatches. Many follow Christ for loaves, and are like 
    those that go to sea for pleasure. They flame a while; but as the candle, go 
    out with a bad smell, when the wind blows. Now they are cast out, for likely 
    they did not count the cost before they began to build, hence they are 
    surprised with tribulation. The cross is placed in the dark to them, 
    therefore they fall over it, Matthew 8:19, 20. What is undeliberately 
    attempted, seldom succeeds where difficulties are in the way.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, hypocrites want the root of grace in them, hence a 
    storm blows them over, Matthew 13:21. How can a house built on sand endure a 
    storm? Lamps without oil may do much in a fair day, but nothing in a dark 
    night. The real spring will hold out in a time of scorching heat but the 
    pools will be dried up.</p>
<p align="justify">In tribulation, people must either live on Christ alone, 
    or not at all. Hypocrites cannot do this, more than a bird can fly without 
    wings. The hypocrite is the man with the heart and the heart; therefore, 
    like the pidgeon, he changes his nest, according to the blowing of the north 
    and south wind. His lusts are his limbs, therefore he must cut his shoe 
    answerable to his foot.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. The Lord has an eye to open enemies, to bring 
    vengeance to them. The Israelites were in a great strait at the Red sea, but 
    it was that Pharaoh and his host might be drowned, see also Daniel 3:22. The 
    Lord allows enemies to fill up their cup, and then he punishes them, and the 
    punishment comes heaped and running over, Matthew 22:35, 36. The tribulation 
    of the Lord's people, is a certain forerunner of the destruction of enemies, 
    Micah 4:11–13; the rod having done its work, is for the fire.</p>
<p align="justify">USE. Prepare then for tribulation. Lay your account with 
    it, and make ready for it. This is a day in which we should be about Noah's 
    work, even preparing an ark. Consider these three things:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The Lord has a controversy with the land, and he seems 
    to be about to plead it; and when God's anger has set the nation in a flame, 
    it will be hard for the Lord's people to escape tribulation. There are 
    several things, for which the Lord seems to be about to pursue Scotland this 
    day; such as the sins of late times, and here we find covenant breaking the 
    mother evil, Ezekiel 17:15. This land lies under a double guilt here. The 
    breach of the national covenant, which was first made early after our 
    reformation from popery, and afterwards several times renewed, and much 
    countenanced of God. The solemn league and covenant now buried in England, 
    and now much forgotten in Scotland, in both which, prelacy was abjured. But 
    alas! the nation soon forgot his covenant. Prelacy, like the accursed walls 
    of Jericho, was rebuilt; the Lord's people that adhered to the oath of God 
    and covenanted work of reformation, were persecuted for the same; fined, 
    imprisoned, banished, carried into remote corners of the world, and many of 
    the in murdered under color of law. The covenant itself burned. God has not 
    forgotten these things yet. The late fire in Edinburgh, which set on flames 
    his vast buildings that burnt the covenant, was a visible token of the 
    Lord's minding that quarrel: and now I think the Lord is saying, as he did 
    to Israel, I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of 
    ray covenant.</p>
<p align="justify">There is also the contempt of the gospel now abounding. 
    How little is Christ cared for in our land; his offers are slighted, his 
    reproofs undervalued. We have begun to weary of God, and our souls loathe 
    the manna.</p>
<p align="justify">There is, moreover, much profanity in principles and 
    practices. It is with us as with the Jews, both the poor and the rich have 
    erred, Jeremiah 5:4, 5. Who could have thought, that in such a day, deism 
    and atheism could have so abounded. Many ridicule the scriptures, and the 
    doctrine of salvation by Jesus Christ; and so give themselves up to work all 
    impurity with greediness. Pagan countries produce not such monsters. The 
    matter is, men are given up to their lusts, the word galls them, and 
    therefore they endeavor to extinguish all sense of religion, that they may 
    sin without remorse.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The Lord has a controversy with his own people. How 
    little sense have we of God's mighty works? In what security have we been of 
    a long time? Little care to walk with God. Carnality, formality, worldly 
    mindedness, lukewarmness in the things of God, presage a storm of 
    tribulation.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The present state of affairs says a cloud is 
    gathering. They that have but half an eye may see it.</p>
<p align="justify">DIRECTIONS. 1. Make sure work as to your interest in 
    Christ, Matthew 7:24–27. The months of tribulation are trying to 
    hypocritical professors. If you be in Christ you shall not be removed. The 
    temptations and dangers to which people are exposed in tribulations, speak 
    loudly to them to turn to their strong hold, Zechariah 9:12. O that they 
    would now come that have hitherto refused him. A man out of Christ in 
    tribulation, is a sad spectacle.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Keep grace in exercise. Take that advice, "Remember, 
    therefore, from whence you are fallen, and repent, and do your first work." 
    See there be no standing controversy between God and you. "If we regard 
    iniquity in our hearts, the Lord will not hear us." Outward trouble, and the 
    frowns of an angry God, are sad companions. These months are trying to them 
    that are under a spiritual consumption; it will be difficult for them to 
    stand.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Prudently forecast what may befall you, and lay your 
    accounts that way. "A prudent man foresees the evil, and hides himself: but 
    the simple pass on and are punished." A warned man is half armed. Men 
    surprised seldom resist. A man newly awakened out of his dream, may be 
    easily overcome.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Be temperate in all things, and live above the world, 
    its frowns, and smiles. Be moderate in your affections and cares about any 
    worldly enjoyments. Use the world as if you used it not. Let it hang loose 
    about you, like Joseph's mantle.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Labor to be concerned about your relations now. 
    Solemnly give them away to God with respect to an evil day. In a troublesome 
    time, people use to carry their precious things to any place where they may 
    be safe. Husbands, wives, children, cannot be so safe as in Christ. Commit 
    them to him, and trust him with them without anxiety. Strive also to get 
    them possessed with real love to Christ and his truths, that they may be 
    more afraid of sinning, than of suffering, for their influence may do you 
    good or evil, as they are disposed.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Labor to have a feeling of the truth and power of 
    religion on your souls. A mere form of godliness will not help in 
    tribulation. If religion be not in the heart, but only in the head, it will 
    melt away like snow before the sun. He who sees Christ by an eye of faith, 
    and sees Heaven afar off, has the trial of the efficacy and power of the 
    truth on his soul, will be able to endure a blast. Therefore closely study 
    practical godliness.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Be much in prayer. Prayer opens the windows of 
    Heaven, James 5:18. Pray for yourselves, for the nation, for posterity, for 
    the church, and for the world. It is a sad symptom a man has no part of the 
    ship, when he is not concerned whether she sink or swim. Prayer has opened 
    prison doors, Acts 16:26; and held off wrath, Exodus 32:10. And who knows 
    what the prayers of the Lord's people may do yet. It is a mercy that we may 
    pray, Micah 7:3–7.</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 1. There will always be safety on some side, 
    and I will fall in with them that are uppermost. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. If the Bible be the Word of God, this is not the 
    way to be safe. "Whose walks uprightly, shall be saved; but he who is 
    perverse in his ways, shall fall at once." If you shift so, you will not be 
    on God's side; and often men by seeking safety out of God's way, hasten 
    their own destruction, as the Jews crucified Christ to please the Romans. 
    "He who finds his life shall lose it; and he who loses his life for my 
    sake," says Jesus, "shall find it."</p>
<p align="justify">OBJECTION 2. I fear I never shall be able to stand in an 
    evil day. </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Deal you honestly with Christ. Tell him sincerely 
    you are content to go through fire and water with him, if he will but bear 
    you up, that you sink not; and trust him for through bearing, and then it 
    lies upon his honor to carry you through, and he will do it, Isaiah 40:30, 
    31; 2 Corinthians 12:9.</p>
<p align="justify">But is there no way to be sure of temporal safety when 
    tribulation comes? </p>
<p align="justify">ANSWER. Without more than ordinary, neither you nor I can 
    promise that to ourselves. We may promise inward peace, but not outward. Yet 
    some may even get much outward safety. I will tell you the way that bids 
    fairest for it. Mourn now for the sins of the land; that has the promise, 
    Ezekiel 9:4. Keep close to the way of duty, whatever be the hazard, Proverbs 
    28:18. To be best when others are worst bids fair for it. This was the case 
    with Noah, who was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah 
    walked with God. But all outward things are uncertain; only in the general, 
    if you be his, he will do what will be best.</p>
<p align="justify">But behold, our text opens up a magazine of comfort in 
    the worst of times: "That in me you might have peace." From whence observe 
    this doctrine,</p>
<p align="justify">Whatever storms blow in the world, in Jesus Christ we may 
    have peace, in the midst of outward troubles. Here I shall speak first of 
    the nature of this peace. Secondly, of the enjoyment of it. Thirdly, of the 
    way of conveyance. Fourthly, of its kind; and fifthly, confirm the point. I 
    am then,</p>
<p align="justify">I. To speak of the nature of the peace to be enjoyed in 
    Christ. It is an inward peace, being opposed to outward trouble. The trouble 
    is bodily, and on the outward state; the peace is spiritual. It is the peace 
    of mind. Inward trouble is the native consequence of outward trouble. But 
    here is a sort of miracle, the godly in the fire, yet walking at ease; the 
    ship among rocks and waves, yet secure. Taking this inward peace of mind in 
    its full latitude, it comprehends,</p>
<p align="justify">1. A holy calm in the soul, a serenity and tranquility of 
    mind in the midst of trouble. Trouble naturally produces inward confusion 
    and disturbance; but the soul has in Christ a calm instead of that, Psalm 
    3:1–5. The believer is like a vessel of water tossed upon the sea, yet not 
    jumbled. In the fiery furnace, the three children had more peace than the 
    king in his palace, Daniel 3:24.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Content of mind, in opposition to discontent and 
    murmuring, which are the native effects of trouble in a soul out of Christ. 
    Contentment is not only the duty but the privilege of believers, 2 Samuel 
    15:25, 26. To be content with a full cup is nothing; but grace can make a 
    man content with an empty house and empty coffers. And what does a man want, 
    whose spirit is brought down to his lot? Many a man has been so well content 
    with the cross, that he would not have exchanged with them that were at 
    ease, for the crown.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Courage and holy boldness, instead of discouragement, 
    Acts 4:13. Christ raises the hearts of his people in trouble. He who is 
    feeble among them at that day shall be as David, and the house of David 
    shall be as God, as the angel of the Lord before them. When he says fear 
    not, their fears are dispelled; their spirits raised to do and to suffer 
    great things for him without fear. And never is the believer so acquainted 
    with Christ's comforts, as in a day when fears are on every side. He loves 
    to make them experience that his grace is sufficient for them.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Confidence as to the event, in opposition to anxiety 
    and despair. "For the which cause," says Paul, "I also suffer these things; 
    nevertheless, I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and I am 
    persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him 
    against that day." Trouble stirs up the godly to wait on the Lord, and roll 
    their concerns on him, and lay down all their cares in his bosom. This has 
    the promise, for he has said, "Delight yourself also in the Lord, and he 
    shall give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way unto the Lord, and 
    he shall bring it to pass." There is light in Goshen, when there is darkness 
    over all the rest of the land. When providences are a dark cloud, which they 
    cannot see through, faith goes to the promises, and there they get a sight 
    of a blessed vision, and will say, he has done, and will do all things well.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Joy in trouble instead of sorrow. They have a sweet 
    feast. Our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience. They are not 
    stocks, to stand unmoved at the loss of goods, liberty, and the like; but 
    their sorrow is only as it were a quashed sorrow, it is so drowned in 
    spiritual joy. They are as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing. Paul and Silas 
    sang praises at midnight in the prison, and the Hebrews took joyfully the 
    spoiling of their goods. Strengthening grace will bear them out in their 
    singing, as long as the enemy's malice will bear them in their raging. The 
    saints are strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, 
    unto all patience, and long suffering, with joyfulness.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Prosperity of soul. The suffering Christian is by 
    Christ made like Gains, to prosper, and be in health in his soul. This Paul 
    felt, for says he, though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is 
    renewed day by day. The world is a very rugged physician to the godly; but 
    the truth is, they never thrive better than when under its hand. We are now,</p>
<p align="justify">II. To speak of the enjoyment of this peace in peace. The 
    text says, In me you might, rather may have peace. This lets us see that 
    something must be done, in order to get it. There is a twofold enjoyment of 
    this peace in trouble.</p>
<p align="justify">1. An enjoyment of it in the root and seed of it. In this 
    respect believers always have this peace in trouble. For the meek shall 
    inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. 
    They are like the heir while a minor, having a right to an estate, though 
    there be not a farthing in his pocket.</p>
<p align="justify">2. An enjoyment of it by actual tasting thereof, when the 
    troubled mind is really pacified, the winds rebuked, and God creates a calm 
    in the soul, giving them all these sure, whereby they are made happy. Here I 
    lay down these two conclusions, imported in this phrase:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The believer is liable to a want of inward peace in a 
    time of outward trouble. This is manifest in Job, Heman, and others. 
    Sometimes the wind blows upon them from all quarters at once. And thus it is 
    ordinarily with them in such cases as these—1. When the disease to be cured 
    is grown inveterate. Every puff of wind will not rend rocks, nor blow up 
    oaks by the roots. Samson for three several times had seen Delilah's deceit, 
    yet would not take warning. Hence often it is thus with the Lord's people 
    when the storm rises first, where the inward trouble continues until they 
    renew their repentance. 2. When to allay their outward trouble, they step 
    aside out of God's way, yielding to the temptation to get the trouble 
    lessened, it is made greater by the accession of the want of inward peace. 
    Whoever breaks an hedge, a serpent shall bite him. This makes a molehill a 
    mountain, for there is no safety but in an upright way. 3. When they grow 
    impatient under trouble. The Lord will have them see where the sting of 
    trouble is; and by making them feel the smart of a wounded spirit, will 
    teach them what they would not believe, namely, that a man may bear his 
    infirmities, but a wounded spirit who can bear. 4. When the Lord intends to 
    appear with a more than ordinary measure of his peace and comfort. The 
    saddest conflicts commonly go before the greatest victory. It is God's way 
    to kill before he cure.</p>
<p align="justify">2. As there is a seed of inward peace in the believer's 
    soul amidst the greatest trouble, so it shall surely spring up at length, 
    Micah 7:8, 9. There is a Heaven in their hottest Hell, which will break 
    forth in due time. Their light shall rise, and their seed of joy spring. 
    They have great security for this. I shall only point at one thing in the 
    text, that is Christ's designing it for them. He is God, his counsel shall 
    stand. What he designs for them they shall surely get, especially 
    considering he has purchased peace at so dear a rate to bestow on them. What 
    though their case be low and almost desperate, yet he can give them peace, 
    and speak peace to them, even as he spoke light into being, when darkness 
    was on the face of the world. Though the mouth be filled only with 
    complaints, yet creating power can make praises come from the same lips. "I 
    create," says the Lord, "the fruit of the lips, peace; peace to him that is 
    afar off and to him that is near and I will heal him." Wherefore, it being 
    God's design that they may have it, they shall have it in the worst of 
    times.</p>
<p align="justify">III. We are to consider the way of conveyance of this 
    peace. It is in Christ. This imports,</p>
<p align="justify">1. That we must be in him before we can have this true 
    peace. All out of this ark are out of the true peace. Men may have the 
    devil's peace, while they sleep in his chains. But God's peace is only to 
    them that lay hold on God's peace-maker. Let him, says God, take hold of my 
    strength, that he may make peace with me. What have you to do with peace, O 
    sinner, so long as you are out of Christ? For God is their enemy who are not 
    in Christ, for by him only are we reconciled to God. Who can have true peace 
    while God is their enemy, whose attributes do speak terror to them. He is 
    just, holy, everywhere present, and almighty. He is merciful indeed, but 
    only in Christ. Conscience also is their enemy. It is God's deputy, who 
    fails not sometimes to say to the wicked, that it shall be ill with him. And 
    though it may be laid asleep a while, yet that will only make its awakening 
    more terrible, and it is only Christ's blood that sprinkles from an evil 
    conscience. All the creatures are likewise their enemies. Christ is the bond 
    of the creatures, who were set one against another by Adam's sin; and 
    therefore it is a benefit of the new covenant, peace with the creatures. Men 
    out of Christ have no more security in the use of the creatures, than an 
    usurper in his throne, against whom the subjects will arm themselves, as 
    soon as they can dispatch him and shake off his yoke.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is by him, and from him, they have this peace; 
    therefore he is called our peace, Ephesians 2:14, and the peace, Micah 5:5. 
    Christ is the procurer and purchaser of his people's peace. Their peace was 
    bought not stolen nor usurped, bought by his own blood. No peace could have 
    been to men, had he not stooped and received the blow of the sword of 
    justice. He denied himself to peace, that we might enjoy it. He is the maker 
    of the peace, being the great peace-maker, and the Mediator of the covenant 
    between God and man, which is a covenant of peace. Peace on earth was sung 
    at his birth; and when he is formed in a soul, peace is made between God and 
    that soul; and by his Spirit, peace is created in the soul.</p>
<p align="justify">He is the maintainer of the peace. "You will keep him in 
    perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on you; because he trusts in you." So 
    much guilt is found in the best, that they could not keep their peace a 
    moment, were there not a continuance of it by the prince of peace. But by 
    the continuance of his intercession, and efficacy of his Spirit, he 
    maintains it.</p>
<p align="justify">He is the restorer of their peace. "I have seen his ways, 
    and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and 
    to his mourners. Sometimes this peace is beat down very low by the 
    corruption of the hearts of his people, and the malice of the devil. But he 
    brings it up again, and the howling wilderness is as the fruitful field. 
    Thus it comes to pass that at evening time it shall be light.</p>
<p align="justify">He is the perfecter of their peace. Their peace is but a 
    twilight peace, while here, Zechariah 14:6, 7; but he who has begun it, will 
    not leave it off, until he have perfected it. The Lord will perfect that 
    which concerns them, and God himself will wipe away all tears from their 
    eyes. As he left not his people until he had seated them in the earthly 
    Jerusalem, the city of peace, so he will bring his people to the city of 
    peace above.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, He is the storehouse of their peace, from which 
    they may bring their peace in the worst of times; for which reason he seems 
    to be called our peace. As every drop of water in a cup, is refreshing to a 
    thirsty man; so everything in Christ, is peace to the believer. Some seek 
    for peace by their friends, beg it or buy it from their enemies, but the 
    believer fetched all from Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. We are to show what sort of peace it is, which we may 
    have in Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">1. A solid peace. The peace of the wicked is not solid 
    peace. It is rather the name than the thing. It will not abide a trial, and, 
    like a thief, it runs away before the searchers. But the godly man's peace 
    in Christ will abide the trial, and the more it be examined the surer it 
    proves.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a tender peace. It is easily marred by sin. 
    Consciousness of guilt interrupts this peace. David's heart smote him for 
    his sin in numbering the people. It is a tender bud of Heaven, that cannot 
    endure with sin, especially sin against light. Yet,</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is a strong peace in respect of troubles. This 
    peace made a holy man say, I fear nothing but sin. Many assaults are made 
    against the soul, to take away its peace; but it will stand against 
    tribulation, scourging, a prison and stocks, spoiling of goods, yes, death 
    itself cannot take it away.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is a governing peace. "Let the peace of God rule in 
    your hearts," says the apostle, "to the which also you are called in one 
    body; and be you thankful." The passions and affections of the soul, when 
    they would mutiny, this peace of God stills them, and guards the heart of 
    the believer, which is sadly exposed to danger, when without this peace. But 
    the peace of God which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and 
    minds, through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">5. A lasting peace. "Peace," said Jesus, "I leave with 
    you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world gives, give I unto you. Let 
    not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid." How soon is the candle 
    of the wicked put out, and their peace gone; but this peace is everlasting. 
    Though it may run under ground a while, yet it breaks up again, and never 
    sees an end, as streaming from the eternal fountain of peace. It now 
    remains,</p>
<p align="justify">V. To confirm the point. Well may we have peace in 
    Christ, though the world should be turned upside down, and all should go 
    unto confusion; for,</p>
<p align="justify">1. If we look to him, we may see God reconciled to us in 
    him, Ephesians 2:15, 16, God testified of him, that in him he was well 
    pleased, namely, with all that were in him. The believer beholding his 
    wounds may say, these have procured my peace, his blood has pacified God's 
    anger against me. What then though the world rage, God is well pleased; 
    though the earth be covered with blackness, Heaven is no more lowering. Is 
    not this enough. Paul triumphed here, Romans 8:31–39. Though the world 
    proclaim war against me, Christ proclaims God is at peace with me. Two 
    things here, may give a man peace in the midst of trouble. 1. The 
    preciousness, and excellency of this peace with God. What angel or man can 
    tell the worth of it. When it was bought, it cost an infinite price. Souls 
    under apprehensions of wrath know something of its value that it is better 
    than ten thousand worlds. Then no thanks to the Christian, though he digest 
    some petty losses in the world peaceably, while this jewel is in his 
    possession. 2. The durableness of this peace. It is everlasting. Let men 
    rage and devils too, they may take away outward peace, but this they cannot 
    carry away. If an army were coming to burn and slay all in their way, and 
    you were persuaded that they should destroy nothing of yours but that which 
    is very little worth, might not you have peace; so may the Christian.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In Christ we see God upon our side. He is not only 
    reconciled in him, but he is entered into covenant with us. His friends, are 
    our friends, and our enemies are his. This made David fearless in the midst 
    of troubles, Psalm 23 and 128:6. Hence the apostle bids defiance to all who 
    could attack him, Romans 8:31. May we not say then, greater is he who is in 
    us, than he that is in the world. Here all the attributes of God stream 
    forth peace to the believer, so that he may sing that song, "Spring up O 
    well, sing you unto it." Enemies shall not prevail nor escape, for he is 
    just, wise, powerful, and true. Two things here, should be observed. 1. He 
    is a present help, Psalm 46:1. Many a one perishes because help is far off. 
    But be the believer where he will, his help is at hand. He is ever within a 
    cry of him. Yes, he is in him, dwelling in him by his Spirit. 2. He is a 
    powerful help. Men may be near at hand to their friends, and not be able to 
    help them in an evil day; but nothing is too hard for him. He is also a 
    skillful helper. Men may be both near and able, yet for want of skill may 
    spoil the work; but he is wise in heart. The believer may peaceably leave 
    the time, way, and manner of deliverance on him.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In Christ we see God in our nature; God made man; 
    Immanuel, God with us. This is a noble subject of meditation, the wonder of 
    angels and saints in glory; an employment which might give us peace in the 
    midst of trouble, if it were no other way, but by driving our thoughts, and 
    powerfully fixing our affections on this admirable object. This gave Stephen 
    peace. But besides, when men as incarnate devils, are terrible to us, we may 
    look on Christ, and there with comfort see God incarnate; see him through 
    the veil of the flesh of Christ. When a wicked man is in tribulation, he is 
    a most miserable creature. Man is terrible to him, and God is terrible to 
    him, because he cannot behold him in a mediator. But it is not so with a 
    believer. May he not then have peace in trouble. Again, as Christ is a man, 
    he has a sympathy with his people, and as God he is able to help them. Yes, 
    in all their afflictions he is afflicted well then may the believer roll all 
    upon him.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Christ suffered from the world and overcame it. "I," 
    said he, "have overcome the world." While he was in it, he had no easy life. 
    His life was a life of tribulation, and at length they nailed him to the 
    cross. Here the believer may find peace. May it not create peace, amidst 
    tribulation in the world, to think that the way of tribulation in the world, 
    was the way by which Christ went through it to his glory. Shall we not 
    follow him courageously and contentedly. Did they treat the master so, and 
    will not the servant be content with his master's entertainmet. Will we 
    follow him grudgingly, who went through so cheerfully. Again, may it not 
    give peace, to think that he suffered to redeem us from the wrath of God. 
    Truly, this will make the gracious soul joyful, to have but an occasion of 
    bearing the wrath of the world for his sake and cause. It must be 
    comfortable, also, to think that the bitter dregs are taken out of the cup. 
    Afflictions and death are unstinged. There is no poison in the cup, this may 
    well make you quietly drink it. Your Master bids you ride no ford, but what 
    he went through before you. If the world mock and reproach you, so did it do 
    to him; if it put you to death itself, as traitors and rebels, so did it do 
    to him.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The believer may have peace in Christ, in the midst of 
    outward trouble, because he guides all himself, Isaiah 52:7. The Lord 
    reigns, let the earth be glad. Christ has fought through his enemies, and 
    has reached the throne. He sways the mediatory scepter for the good of the 
    church. Many things here, speak peace to those that are in him, in the worst 
    of times; for Christ as a king is engaged to protect his church and people, 
    Ephesians 1:22. His subjects are the Father's gift to him, of which he is to 
    make account, John 17:12. He is their shepherd, Psalm 23:1. Enemies can 
    never be able to make him a king without subjects, a head without a body. 
    The bush burning not consumed, why? God is in the midst of it. He wants 
    neither wisdom, will, nor power to help his people.</p>
<p align="justify">Whatever they meet with, comes from him. The Father 
    judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son. The most bitter 
    cross comes through his hands to them. God sent Joseph to Egypt. Assyria is 
    but God's rod and axe. Why should believers fear, when Christ lets blood of 
    them. Though he borrow the lance from the enemy, yet it is in a friend's 
    hand. It shall not go one hair-breadth deeper than he sees necessary.</p>
<p align="justify">He overrules enemies. He has a bridle on their jaws, and 
    the remainder of their wrath he will restrain. He has a negative vote on 
    them. "Who is he who says and it comes to pass, when the Lord commands it 
    not?" The devil cannot enter swine, without his permission. They cannot put 
    one drop more into his people's cup than he allows, Revelation 2:10. Hence, 
    when enemies are consulting the ruin of his church, God is said to laugh, 
    Psalm 2. He makes the devil's servants run his errands. The Philistines' 
    kine bring home the ark. Joseph must be exalted. His envious brethren must 
    post him on to it. The gospel must go through the world, and therefore 
    persecutors must scatter the preachers. Many a time the church rises, just 
    when enemies are laying on the gravestone, as it was when the service dook 
    was pressed upon us. Jesus must reign until he has put all enemies under his 
    feet. Behold the assurance of it, Psalm 110:1. Never weapon prospered 
    against his people. The day will come, they shall all stand on the field as 
    conquerors, and share of his throne.</p>
<p align="justify">In him they have divine promises suited to any case in 
    which they can be. These are the silken cords let down from Heaven, by which 
    the believer may well venture to be drawn through a sea of blood, 2 Peter 
    1:4, Psalm 119:49. The word of a general will animate soldiers, and Christ's 
    promise may well animate his people. What are you afraid of? Is it of your 
    own weakness, which may make you sin and yield to the temptation, that may 
    make you shrink, and leap back from the cross. Mind his promise, Isaiah 
    40:30, 31; 2 Corinthians 12:9. Are you afraid of the apostasy? Truly they 
    who are built on the sand shall fall, but not those who are built on a rock, 
    Matthew 21:18; 2 Timothy 2:18, 19. Will a man who can prevent it, suffer a 
    limb to be drawn from him, though it be very weak? No, surely; John 
    10:27–29. Are you afraid of his forsaking you? Fear it not; Hebrews 13:5; 
    Isaiah 43:2. Is he with you, then he shall be with you. Mark David's 
    reasoning, "Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I 
    will fear no evil; for you are with me; your rod and staff they comfort me. 
    Why did he take you by the hand, if he thought ever to forsake you on any 
    emergency. He knew all your faults from eternity. Do you fear that he 
    intends evil to you. Perhaps you think that it is your untenderness, 
    barrenness, or the like, that is like to raise the storm. God will have your 
    sin to find you out. Be it so; yet consider that all things shall work 
    together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called 
    according to his purpose. In the evening it shall be light. Let the web of 
    Providence be once woven out, and though there be many black threads in it, 
    it shall appear a goodly mixture.</p>
<p align="justify">In him we may have whatever is necessary for 
    throughbearing in an evil day. He is able and willing to bear our expenses, 
    why then should we be disturbed at the sight of the journey. There is light 
    to be had in him. He is the light of the world. No case so perplexed, but he 
    can resolve it, Micah 7:7–9. He is the counselor, one whose advice is ready 
    in time of need. There is strength in him. He is the storehouse of the 
    Christian's strength, open at all times, but especially in time of trouble, 
    2 Timothy 4:16, 17. He is the friend best known in adversity.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, Consider the Scriptures hold out Christ as one in 
    whom peace is to be enjoyed, and that is confirmed by the experience of the 
    saints. He is the Savior both for temporal and eternal salvation. The ark 
    was a type of Christ, the sanctuary, the cities of refuge, Isaiah 8:14; 
    Hebrews 6:18; Isaiah 32:2. The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the 
    righteous flee unto it and are safe. He is the peace; they that are in him 
    dwell in peace, Micah 5:5; Psalm 6:2–4. He has chambers of protection for 
    his own, into which he invites them to enter, Isaiah 26:20; Psalm 27:5.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 1. Of information.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Here see the superlative excellence of Jesus Christ. 
    To recommend him to your souls, may we not say, "Who is like unto you, O 
    Lord?" and conclude, that all the things that may be desired, are not to be 
    compared to him. Such days may come, as that we can have no peace in the 
    world. Our means may fail us, our own wisdom can find no outgate, no comfort 
    in friends and relations; nay, but in the worst of times, in Christ we may 
    have peace.</p>
<p align="justify">2. See here Christ's all-sufficiency. If we may have 
    peace in him when we can have it no where else, then he can be to us instead 
    of all, better than all, and is commensurable to the desires of the soul. 
    Nothing can be wanting in him, in whom alone the soul may rejoice when 
    striped naked of all comforts.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The mystery of a Christian's life in tribulation. Many 
    have taken joyfully the spoiling of their goods; have gone to death as to 
    their marriage. What! were they stupied, and without natural affection? No, 
    they had peace in him. They had meat to eat, which the world knew not of.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The best furniture for an evil day is faith in Christ, 
    uniting us to him. Would you know how to be safe, prepare an ark; flee to 
    the Lord Jesus, and then you may defy the world, devil, death and Hell.</p>
<p align="justify">USE 2. Of exhortation.</p>
<p align="justify">1. To you that are out of Christ. O come to Christ, that 
    in him you may have peace in a time of trouble. Here is a sanctuary opened 
    to you. Consider,</p>
<p align="justify">1. While you are out of Christ, tribulation may turn you 
    out of a profession too, as it did the stony ground hearers; and dreadful is 
    the case of apostates, they pierce themselves through with many sorrows. 
    Tribulation will discover your naughtiness, John 15:2–6.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Turn you what way you will, the Lord will wind a yoke 
    of tribulation about your neck. When national judgments come, you must lay 
    your account with a share of them, Matthew 3:10; Amos 9:9, 10. Your trouble 
    will be very heavy, because the curse of God will be in it, and because you 
    will get it all to bear. The Lord is not with you, you are alone as Saul 
    was. O it is sad to have darkness covering both the face of the earth and 
    heavens. Death is coming, and then the Lord shall trouble you. Your false 
    peace will then be at an end. No peace with God, but through Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">2. To the godly that are in Christ, we would say, labor 
    you to be in such a frame, as that you may have the actual enjoyment of that 
    peace which you may have in Christ in tribulation. That you may attain it, 
    take these advices,</p>
<p align="justify">1. Labor to get a sight of your interest in Christ. Give 
    alt diligence to make your calling and election sure. This makes a man bold 
    as a lion, 2 Timothy 1:12. This carried the martyrs through death; they knew 
    in whom they had believed. This inflames love, which is of mighty influence 
    to carry persons through tribulation. To a person in trouble, and under 
    doubts, it is like the ship which carried Paul and his companions, when it 
    stuck fast, and remained immoveable. This is a spring of joy, and will make 
    the soul abhor sinful capitulations for deliverance.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Labor to get yourselves enrapt up in a promise for a 
    time of tribulation, Genesis 32:12. When the waters of trouble are coming 
    on, he is a wise man who cleaves to a branch of the tree of life. A promise 
    has been meet and drink, and all to a Christian; even a song to them in 
    distress. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time, and in the days of 
    famine they shall be satisfied.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Acquaint yourselves well with the Scriptures. 
    "Unless," says David, "Your law had been my delights, I should then have 
    perished in mine affliction." The Scriptures are written for this end, for 
    our learning: that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might 
    have hope. A good Scripture student, a good Christian in an evil day: only 
    you must study to experience the power of them on your hearts.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Let there be no standing controversy between God and 
    you. If you regard iniquity in your heart, the Lord will not hear you. A 
    guilty conscience in an evil day, is a sad companion, as it was with 
    Joseph's brethren. It puts a sting in the outward trouble. Therefore renew 
    your repentance, and mourn over your backslidings, and apply to the blood of 
    Jesus.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Study the practice of mortification. Labor to be 
    mortified to your wordily goods, Jeremiah 45:5. The poor man must have grace 
    to be mortified to his cottage, as well as the rich to their mansions. You 
    must also labor to be mortified to your ease, Hebrews 11:25. It were not 
    unreasonable for people at such a time, to ask themselves how they could 
    take with Jacob's bed, Genesis 28:11. Micaiah's food, 1 Kings 22:27. Peter's 
    attendants, John 21:18; and the three children's lodging, Daniel 3. You must 
    be mortified to your life, Luke 14:26. Die to your life now, if you would 
    have that peace. Be familiar with Job's acquaintance, Job 17:14. Amen.</p>
