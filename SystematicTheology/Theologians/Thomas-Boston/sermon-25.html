          Song 8:5, "Who is this that comes up from the wilderness, leaning upon
          her Beloved?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          WE have been solemnizing our souls' espousals to Jesus Christ, and our
          consent to the gospel-call, saying in effect to us, "Will you go with
          this man?" Leave your father's house, and your own people, and cleave
          to the King of Zion. We have before angels and men answered, We will
          go with him, for he is our Beloved. Here we have an account of the
          Christian life, which must be our life, if we will deal honestly with
          him; it is a "coming up out of the wilderness, leaning on our
          Beloved." These are the words of the daughters of Jerusalem,
          containing,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. An inquiry about a party, whom they took particular notice of,
          namely, the church of believers, the spouse of Christ; "Who is this?"
          It intimates a kind of surprise, Who's that! The wilderness uses not
          to afford such a sight as this. It imports an admiration as of some
          hidden thing, a mystery; Who is this? This is a strange kind of
          personage whom we see.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. A character of the party inquired about. It is a woman, one of the
          weak gender, as the church of believers is represented in scripture.
          She is not one of the dwellers in the wilderness. She appears not to
          have built her house there. She is but a traveler through it, and her
          head is away from it; and she is set for another country. That is she
          whom we mean, who is coming up from the wilderness. I make no question
          but by the wilderness here is meant the world, as Canticles 3:6; and
          4:8; with a plain eye to the Israelites coming through the wilderness
          to Canaan; the last of which, as it was typical of Heaven, so the
          former is of the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But for the further understanding of these words, it is necessary to
          take notice of a custom among the Jews at their marriages, to which
          there is here a manifest allusion, namely, The bridegroom used to take
          his bride, and carry her out of the city into the fields, and there
          they had their nuptial-songs; and afterward he brought her back again,
          leaning on him, into the city, to his father's house, and there the
          marriage was solemnized. Now we may be sure, however, that these
          fields were not a wilderness or moorlands, no fit place for a
          bridegroom and bride's walk together. This, then, increases the
          wonder, What a bride is this that is coming up out of the wilderness
          with her Bridegroom, leaning on him? Others use to be entertained more
          softly and delicately; what a bride and Bridegroom are these! However,
          here is represented the Christian life, the life of the church of
          believers espoused to Christ. In which observe two things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1st, Her exercise; she is traveling upon her road away with her
          espoused husband, namely, Christ. The place she is going from is the
          wilderness-world; the place she is going to appears, from what is
          said, to be her Bridegroom's Father's house. Her way is upward, her
          motion an ascending, as the word imports; and here should rather be
          read "going up," than "coming up," as Judg. 20:21, since the decency
          of the parable requires it, she being rather going from the place
          where the daughters of Jerusalem were, than to the place where they
          were.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2dly, Her posture, her traveling posture; "leaning on her Beloved."
          This is what in New Testament language is called the life of faith;
          for that is the spiritual leaning of the soul, and imports a fiducial
          persuasion. It bears,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Her having her Bridegroom's company through the wilderness. He
          leaves her not there alone; he bids her go nowhere but where he
          himself will go with her.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Her having his help through the wilderness. She leans on him, as
          a weak woman on a journey leans upon her husband.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Three doctrines offer themselves from the words.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. I. True believers, espoused to Christ, turning their back on
          the world, and walking heavenward with him, are a mystery, a strange
          sight in the world. Who is this!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. II. The life of believers, as espoused to Christ, is a going
          up from the wilderness of this world, with him, to his Father's house
          in the heavenly Canaan.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. III. The way to get up from the wilderness-world to the
          heavenly Canaan, is to go all along leaning on Jesus Christ by faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I shall illustrate and apply the first two of these doctrines
          distinctly, and consider the third in a word of direction in the
          application of the second.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. I. True believers, espoused to Christ, turning their back on
          the world, and walking heavenward with him, are a mystery, a strange
          sight in the world. Who is this!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In discoursing this subject I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. Premise some things for right understanding the doctrine.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Show in what respects believers are a mystery, a strange sight in
          the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. Give the reasons of the point.</p>
        <p align="justify">IV. Apply.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall premise some things for right understanding the doctrine.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Sin turned this world into an enemy's country in respect of Heaven,
          and so into a wilderness. It was originally the seat of the friend of
          God, the confederate of Heaven, innocent Adam; and then it was a
          pleasant land. But sin entering, it changed masters, so that the devil
          is become the God of this world, 2 Corinthians 4:4, and it a
          wilderness because the primitive communication between Heaven and it
          is stopped, and a new one settled between Hell and this world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. All men by their first birth are natives of this world; their
          father's house is in it, the people of it are the people that are
          theirs, Psalm 45:10. And home is home, be it never so homely; they
          love the wilderness, they desire not to change, they know no better
          country, and they seek none better. They are pleased with the place,
          the company, and the manner of living; for they are all natural to
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The Lord from eternity having set his love upon some of the
          natives, in due time comes in the gospel into the wilderness-world,
          and making love to them, gains their consent, and is espoused to them
          in the everlasting marriage-covenant, according to Hosea 2:19, "I will
          betroth you unto me forever, yes, I will betroth you unto me in
          righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in
          mercies." Isaiah 44:5, "One shall say, I am the Lord's." Thus he
          becomes theirs, and they his, and they are engaged to follow him
          wherever he goes. Not only are they obliged by their contract of
          espousals to go with him, but their hearts are so set upon him, that
          they cannot think of parting with him again, or staying behind him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Though the espousals and the feasts of espousals are held in the
          wilderness, yet the place set for the consummating of the marriage is
          Christ's Father's house in Canaan above, to which he begins
          immediately to carry his bride. She must no longer be a resident in
          the world, a dweller in the wilderness, but must lift her heart and
          affections off her own people, and her father's house, and be going
          away homeward to Christ's Father's house, that the marriage may be
          consummated.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. This her going away up from the wilderness with her espoused
          Husband, is a going away in heart and affections; it is the soul's
          motion heavenwards in this life, the last step of which is made at
          death. It is a gracious frame of heart shining forth in a holy,
          tender, and heavenly walk. Every step in the way of holiness, in
          mortification, vivification, and contempt of the world, is a step
          homeward to Christ's Father's house.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly. Christ's bride at her way going, and ongoing with him thus,
          is a mystery, a strange sight in the world. Her own country-people
          gaze at her, to see her undertaking such a strange journey, turning
          her back on the beloved world, and setting out for a strange country.
          Sometimes believers fall out of the exercise of grace, become untender
          in their walk, and grow so like the world, that they do not appear to
          be going up out of the wilderness, but rather pitching their tents
          there. But when they are in the exercise of grace, holy and heavenly
          in their walk, then do the spectators make the question, "Who is
          this?" Like the Jewish rulers, who "seeing the boldness of Peter and
          John, and perceiving that they were ignorant and unlearned men,
          marveled, and took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus;"
          Acts 4:13.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. I shall show in what respects believers are a mystery, a strange
          sight in the world; the power of godliness appearing in their walk at
          this rate, so that it is said of them, "Who is this?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. There is something very amiable about them, as we are told of the
          primitive Christians; Acts 2:46, 47, that "they continuing daily with
          one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did
          eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God,
          and having favor with all the people." There is a conscience within
          worldly men, as well as corruption; and what their corruptions will
          condemn, their conscience will approve as lovely; 2 Corinthians 4:2.
          Men's corruptions may get the management of their tongue, hands, and
          their whole external behavior, and may set the man to run down piety,
          and the party in whom it appears; yet in the meantime conscience
          within their breasts will be applauding and admiring the godly man, as
          one who has something very lovely about him, as Balaam did in the case
          of the Israelites; Numbers 23:9, 10.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. There is something very awful about them to beholders. Paul stands
          at the bar and reasons, and Felix sitting on the bench trembles; Acts
          24:25. John Baptist lies in his grave beheaded at Herod's command, and
          yet there he is a terror to Herod; Matthew 14:1, 2. The remains of
          God's image on man in point of dominion, has an awe and majesty with
          it, that affects the brutes; Genesis 9:2. How much more has the
          restored image of God in righteousness and holiness shining forth in a
          Christian's life, a majesty with it, procuring an internal reverence
          to them from beholders! They are to them like men of another world,
          and every view they take of such writes death to them; Hebrews 11:7.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. There is something very mysterious about them; Zechariah 3:8 They
          are like foreigners in a country, apt to become a gazing-stock, a
          wonder, about which the natives cannot satisfy themselves. A believer
          marching heavenward, away from this wilderness-world, is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1) A mystery to the men of the world, whether professors or profane.
          They cannot comprehend them, for they are God's "hidden ones;" Psalm
          83:3, not hidden from their bodily eyes; verse 4, but from the eyes of
          their minds. What a mystery is that man to them, who sets his feet and
          treads on that, which they set their hearts on and adore? who values,
          pursues eagerly, and by no means can be brought to part with, that
          which they can see no beauty in? whose principles, aims, and actions
          are diametrically opposite to those of theirs? They are to them like
          men of another mold and make, which they cannot understand. Nay, they
          are,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) A mystery to themselves, ay, so great many times, that they know
          not what to make of themselves, what class to rank themselves in,
          whether of saints or sinners; Psalm 139:23, 24. A true Christian is
          indeed a bundle of mysteries; he on earth, and his head in Heaven, yet
          really and truly united 1 John 15:5; crucified with Christ, yet
          living; living, yet not he, but Christ living in him, Galatians 2:20;
          not loitering, but laboring, yet not he, but "the grace of God with
          him;" 1 Corinthians 15:10. He is a man of two leading contrary
          principles, having a will and not a will to one and the same thing; he
          sins, and yet it is not he; Romans 7:17. He has many spots and stains
          on him, yet is all fair; Canticles 4:7; "black, yet lovely, as the
          tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon;" chapter 1:5; wanting many
          things, yet complete; Colossians 2:10. What wonder that such a one
          should be in way of admiration inquired about, "Who is this?"
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          III. I shall give the reasons of the point, That true believer are a
          mystery, a strange sight in the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Because they are so unlike the world, they are like speckled birds
          among the rest, 1 Peter 4:4. They are cast into the new mold of
          regeneration, and are come forth nonconformists to the world, Romans
          12:2. They have got another spirit, than the spirit which all their
          people and their father's house are acted by, which casts their whole
          conversation into quite another shape than theirs, Numbers 14:24. So
          the unlikeness between them makes them a strange sight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Because they are so unlike themselves in former times. Saul among
          the prophets was a strange sight, 1 Samuel 10:11. But the grace of God
          makes a more wonderful change in a man from what he was before, as
          appears in Saul among the apostles, 1 Timothy 1:12, 13. What an
          observable change was there, that he which persecuted the saints in
          times past, now preaches the faith which once he destroyed! Galatians
          1:23. Grace makes lambs of lions, casts out the dumb devil, that they
          who cared not for praying, preaching, etc. but all these things were a
          burden to them, they cannot for the world live without them. It makes
          a new heart, a new life, a new man, all things new, 2 Corinthians
          5:17.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Because they are very rare in the world; they are but here and
          there one for a marvel, Jeremiah 3:14. The multitude in the world
          prefer the wilderness to Zion, and sit still in their native land, and
          will not go away with Christ. They have the gospel-call, they are
          courted to match with Christ; but they think gospel-invitations but
          idle tales, and they have beloveds of their own in the wilderness,
          which they will not part with for him. Some say with the mouth they
          will take him, and subscribe with the hand at solemn ordinances; but
          it is not a match, for their hearts were never truly for it; so they
          sit still too, and go not up with him out of the wilderness, but their
          carcases fall there. So that they who are going up out of the
          wilderness, being so rare, are a strange sight.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">USE I. of information. It informs us, that,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Serious souls need not think it strange, if they become a wonder to
          many, Psalm 71:7. They are not meet to go up with Christ from the
          wilderness, that are not content to become a world's wonder for him.
          They must be fools for Christ that will be wise; Mark 8., "Whoever
          shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful
          generation, of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes
          in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels." Worldly men wonder
          at seriousness now, what makes the saints so nice in points of truth
          and holiness; but that wonder will not last long, the world will soon
          see they had good reason for it all.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The world is no idle spectator of those who have given themselves
          to Christ, and profess to follow him. They take notice of them, and
          have their questions about them. Communicants, take heed to
          yourselves; many eyes are on you, as to your after-walk; God's eye is
          on you; the world's eyes will be upon you, they will take notice
          whether you turn your back on the world, the ways and; manners of it,
          or even sit still with themselves as before.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Those who shall still walk after the course of the world, continue
          sons of earth, not making away heavenward in the tenor of their life
          and conversation, are not espoused to Christ; though they have given
          him the hand, they have not given him the heart. The sincerity of your
          covenanting with God is now to be proved by your after-walk. If God be
          your Father, be setting homeward to his house. If Christ be your
          espoused husband, make away with him through the wilderness, and stay
          not behind. The friendship of the, world is enmity with God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly. This world must be little worth, wherein, among such
          multitudes, there are so few such travelers, that they are a strange
          sight. There are many sad sights to be seen in the world, even after
          communions, but few of this sort of persons turning their backs on the
          world, and resolutely walking heavenwards. Take heed, Christians and
          communicants, that one of these three questions be not put concerning

          USE II. Of exhortation. O Christians, communicants, walk so as the
          world may bear witness, that you are going up out of the wilderness,
          leaning on your beloved; that your faces and hearts are heavenward;
          that you have set off from them, and are no more theirs.

          This would be much to the honor of Christ and religion, Acts. 4:13. It
          would be a great kindness to the world lying in wickedness, as an apt
          mean to bring others away with you, Zechariah 8. It would be the
          safety and comfort of your own souls, Canticles 8:4.

          You will walk so, if you be habitually heavenly in the frame of you

          dealings in the world to a niceness, counting it always safer to lose
          a pound, than unjustly gain a small penny. And further, if you be
          clothed with humility and with humanity, meek, ruling your own spirit,
          doing good to all, even to those that wrong you; and are patient under

          DOCTRINE. II. The life of believers as espoused to Christ, is a going
          up from the wilderness of this world, with him, to his Father's house
          in the heavenly Canaan.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">In discoursing from this doctrine, I shall,</p>
        <p align="justify">I. Take notice of some things supposed in it.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. Unfold the believer's life, as a going up from the wilderness of
          this world, typified by the Israelites going up from the wilderness to
          Canaan.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">III. Make application.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall take notice of some things supposed in this doctrine. It
          supposes, that,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. As soon as a soul is espoused to Christ, it is loosed from the
          world. Its taking of him is a letting this world go, Matthew 13:44.
          The unbeliever hugs and embraces this world as his portion, and
          pursues it as the main thing; but when he closes with Christ he says,
          "You are my portion," and the esteem of the world sinks, Philippians
          3:8. Those that are espoused to Christ, are,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) A loosed people. The bands with which the world held them are
          loosed; they gripe not it, nor it them, at the rate they formerly
          grasped one the other, Galatians 6:14. While the sinner was without
          Christ, the profits and pleasures of the world were strong bands,
          which they could not get shaken off; but in the day of the power of
          converting grace, these give way, as tow does when touched with the
          fire. Then Christ says, "Loose him and let him go;" all is nothing in
          comparison of Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) A separated people. Though before they made one body with the
          world lying in wickedness, and were possessed with the same spirit of
          the world; yet in the day of their espousals to Christ, they are
          fairly separated from them, 2 Corinthians 6:17, even as a married
          woman ceases to be any more a member of her father's family, but
          becomes a member of her husband's, Psalm 45:10.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) A new people. They are no more men of the world, though in it,
          Psalm 17:14, but heavenly men, 1 Corinthians 15:48. They have another
          spirit, Numbers 14:24, a new principle, ends, motives, and manner of
          life.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The soul espoused to Christ, being loosed from the world, is set in
          motion heavenwards, away from the world, Psalm 84:5â€“7. That soul has
          begun a new journey, is set off in the Christian race, that it may
          obtain the crown. Those that are in Heaven have come to a fixed point
          of happiness; those in Hell have come to a fixed point in misery; as
          to those that are in the wilderness of this world some of them are
          sitting still as in Sodom, until the fire of God fall on them and
          consume them; others, even true believers, are making away, as Lot out
          of Sodom, and as the Israelites out of the wilderness into Canaan.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. The believer's journeying heavenwards is attended with many
          difficulties. It is an up-going, and that through a wilderness. They
          that mind for Heaven must forego their own ease, and lay their account
          with troubles and trials of many sorts. The way to destruction is
          broad and easy; if men will but sit still, they will be carried
          quickly down the stream into the ocean of an eternity of woe. But if
          one minds for Heaven, he must force his way, through many
          difficulties, Matthew 7:13, 14, and 11:12.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The believer's passage to Heaven is also a work of time. It is not
          a leaping out of the wilderness into Canaan, but a going up out of it
          by degrees. It cost Israel long forty years in the wilderness. And the
          believer is longer or shorter kept in the wilderness, as seems meet to
          his God. Some are not long set upon the way, when they are at their
          journey's end; others it costs many a weary look to be at home.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Christ is with the believer in the journey. It is a weary land they
          have to go through, but they are not alone in it, Canticles 4:8. In
          the day the soul is espoused to Christ, he is united to him
          spiritually, and that union once made is never broken again. So that
          wherever it is the believer's lot to go, Christ is with him, if it
          were through fire and water, Isaiah 43:2. He is never so far from him,
          but that his faith may get hold of him, and be may lean on him.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly. The end of this journey is a most comfortable one. Though
          the traveling be uneasy, the designed place of rest is most desirable,
          being Christ's Father's house, where the marriage is to be solemnized
          forever, John 14:2. This is sufficient to bear up the heart of
          Christ's spouse through all the difficulties of the road, Hebrews
          11:26, especially considering that Christ himself goes all along with
          her, Hebrews 13:5.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. I shall unfold the believer's life, as a going up from the
          wilderness of this world, typified by the Israelites going up from the
          wilderness to Canaan. And here I shall show,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">1. How they are brought unto the wilderness.</p>
        <p align="justify">2. How the believer is set into it.</p>
        <p align="justify">3. How he is going up from it.</p>
        <p align="justify">4. The hardships and inconveniences of the road.</p>
        <p align="justify">5. The advantages and conveniences of it.</p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, I shall show you how believers are brought unto the wilderness.
          The world is not a wilderness to them and in their esteem, until they
          be brought out of the Egyptian bondage of their natural state. Then,
          and not until then, they enter into their wilderness-state, And here
          one may remark these six things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. As the Israelites who came out of Egypt, went down into it in the
          loins of their fathers; so the elect of God were brought into their
          sinful and miserable state in the loins of our first father Adam,
          Romans 5:12. And we are all born in that condition, and draw our first
          breath in that unhappy region.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The natural state of the elect is a state of bondage and slavery.
          Satan, as Pharaoh, is their prince there, and holds them fast at their
          drudgery, Ephesians 2:2, 3. They have many taskmasters there; as many
          reigning lusts as there are in their hearts, so many taskmasters are
          there holding them to their work.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. As God, by the hand of Moses the lawgiver, and Aaron the
          high-priest, wrought the deliverance of the Israelites; so, by the law
          and the gospel, he carries on the deliverance of the elect out of
          their state of bondage. The law serves to awaken the sinner, and show
          him his danger; the gospel discovers the remedy; and the Spirit of God
          makes both effectual.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. There is no less opposition made by Satan to the sinner's
          deliverance from his spiritual bondage, than was by Pharaoh to the
          deliverance of the Israelites. He is loath to lose his subjects, loath
          to let his prisoners go. How often does the field seem to be won, and
          a fair appearance that the poor sinners shall be let go? and yet there
          are new attacks to be made before he will surrender.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Ordinarily, whenever the deliverance is set a-foot, the bondage
          becomes harder than ever before, Romans 7:9. Satan then musters up all
          his forces, and rages more than ever, that he may make the soul
          despair of a delivery. Now is the soul hard bestead, duties are bound
          on by the law laid to the conscience, under the pain of the curse, but
          no strength afforded; so the soul sees it must make brick while no
          straw is given. And by this means their corruptions are irritated,
          that they appear more vigorously than ever before, Romans 7:5.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly. But at the set time, over the belly of all opposition, God
          brings his elect out of their spiritual bondage into the wilderness.
          There is a set time in the purpose of God for the delivery of every
          elect soul; and as at the appointed time precisely Israel was
          delivered, Exodus 12:41, so are they, Jeremiah 2:24. And no sooner do
          they comply with the gospel-call, and leave the spiritual Egypt, but
          as soon this world turns a wilderness unto them. And young converts
          may lay their account with a hot pursuit from Satan to bring them back
          again, even as sure as the Israelites met with it from Pharaoh. But
          they may be assured that they shall get such a deliverance as the
          Israelites at the Red Sea, which shall make them sing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, I shall show how the believer is set into the wilderness.
          When once converting grace has made a fair separation between the
          sinner and the world, presently he enters into a wilderness-state.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. He cares not for the world as he was accustomed, Galatians 6:14.
          Grace opening the eyes the world appears in its own colors, no more a
          fruitful field but a barren wilderness. The most pleasant spots in it
          appear lions' dens and mountains of leopards. Its best fruits appear
          as the apples of Sodom, fair to look at, but being handled fall to
          ashes, Psalm 4:6, 7. He sees there is no rest for his heart in it, and
          therefore must look above and beyond it. The men of the world are no
          more his choice; their way and manner of life he can no more away
          with.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. The world cares not for him as before, Galatians 6:14. No sooner
          does a soul begin to look heavenward, but presently the world turns a
          strange world to him, John 15:19. He must be content to dwell alone,
          and not to be reckoned among the nations. He bears the image which
          they hate, he is entered on a course opposite to theirs; and so the
          friendship breaks up. And he may lay his account with all the
          opposition they can make him with tongue and hand.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Then it becomes, by God's appointment, the place of trial for him,
          as the wilderness was to the Israelites, Deuteronomy 8:2. God could
          have taken his people a nearer way to Canaan than the way he led them;
          but for their trial he led them so long in the wilderness. So he could
          carry each believer immediately to Heaven after their conversion; but
          he will have them pass their trials before they come there; so they
          must be content to take up their cross and follow him, and so long
          stand candidates for glory, while one trial is put to them after
          another; trials that will prove the reality and strength of their
          graces, the multiplicity of their corruptions and remaining vigor of
          them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly. It is no more his home or his rest; but the place of his
          pilgrimage, of his sojourning, the place he must travel through in his
          way home to his eternal rest, Hebrews 11:13. He must look on himself
          as upon a journey, one that is not to stay here, but must be going
          forward to the heavenly country.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thirdly, I shall show how the believer is going up from the
          wilderness; he is going up from it,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. By the course of nature, which is swift as a post, a ship, and as
          an eagle's flight. It is but a little time, and believers will be at
          their Journey's end. Every day sets them a good way nearer their
          eternal rest, Romans 13:11. If the days be evil, they are but few, and
          will soon be over. It is true that by this way the wicked are going
          out from the world too, but they are not going up, but down into
          destruction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. In the habitual bent of his heart and affections. Believers' hearts
          are turned off the world, and set on things above. Their face is
          homeward, their heart is there before them; for Christ is there, their
          treasure is there. Hence they are said to be those who love Christ's
          appearing, 2 Timothy 4:8; and look for him, Hebrews 9:28. So when the
          carnal man is glued to this world, and desires no better Heaven than
          what is here, they are going away from it in affection and desire.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But it may be the case of some gracious souls, that they cannot say
          they are thus going up from the world, nay, it is a terror to them to
          think of going out of it. I answer, there is a twofold desire to be
          away from the world, and to be with Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) There is an explicit desire, like a rose full spread. Such was
          that of Paul; Philippians 1:23, "I desire to depart, and to be with
          Christ." This is found in believers, when they are not only in the
          exercise of grace, but have a full assurance of their eternal
          salvation. This makes the soul go up with full sail out of the world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) An implicit desire which is like a rose-bud, where the leaves are
          to be found, if it be opened, though in the meantime they are covered,
          not being yet so ripe as to spread. This is found in believers, if
          they be at all in the exercise of grace, although they be in the dark
          as to their state. It is found in the groaning believer, who is
          groaning under the remains of sin, and would gladly be free from them,
          groaning under want of communion with God, and would gladly have it,
          and that so as not to be interrupted any more, Romans 7:24. The Lord
          reads the language of these groans so, and there wants only a full
          assurance of eternal happiness to make it plain language to the soul
          itself. See 2 Corinthians 5:4. And thus the believer is going up from
          the wilderness, though with the wind in his face.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. In progressive sanctification; Proverbs 4:18. By faith the soul is
          set on the way to Immanuel's land; it knits him to Christ the personal
          way, it sets him to holiness of heart and life, the real way, or the
          walking in the way; Colossians 2:6. And the believer goes on while he
          goes forward in holiness, especially when he is growing, adding a
          cubit to his spiritual stature; 2 Peter 3. This going up appears,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) In mortification, when the believer is dying to sin, getting his
          former lusts weakened; Romans 8:13. Mortification is the daily task of
          a believer; the weeds of corruption in the heart are never so plucked
          up, but they will be ready to sprout again. These Canaanites are left
          in the land, that the believer may never be idle, but watch their
          motions and bear them down.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) In vivification, in living to righteousness, when the soul holds
          forward in the way of duty over the belly of all opposition,
          especially in a holy and heavenly frame, going on in them with vigor,
          whether it be doing-work or suffering-work; Canticles 3:6. The soul
          married to Christ is to be for him, according to the law of marriage,
          Hosea 3:3. As we live by him, so we must live to him. This was Paul's
          practice; Philippians 1:21, "To me to live is Christ." More
          particularly,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. In obtaining victory over the world; 1 John 5:4. The world is an
          enemy to all that are set to go up from it. And many times it prevails
          to retard their course; they are in it traveling in a stony, yes and
          thorny way, where there are many things to take hold of them, and hold
          them still; so that they are in hazard of being entangled in the
          wilderness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In this respect a believer goes up from the wilderness. And O but the
          picture of a believer thus going up from the wilderness is a beautiful
          one; Canticles 3:6, "Who is this that comes out of the wilderness like
          pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all
          powders of the merchant?" I shall essay to draw it in a few
          particulars. A believer espoused to Christ, and thus going up from the
          wilderness-world, is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. One who is keeping off from mixing with the men of the world, the
          natives of the weary land. Converting grace plucks them out from among
          them, and sets them over to Christ's side; and establishing grace
          keeps them from mixing again; Psalm 12:7. There is a generation of
          God's wrath in the world, and they are laboring to save themselves
          from them; Acts 2:40. They are deserters of their company, shunning
          unnecessary fellowship with them; for they know, that "a companion of
          fools shall be destroyed;" Proverbs 13:20. And they consort with those
          who are followers of the Lamb, companions of those that fear God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. He is holding off from the ways of the world; Psalm 17:4. In the
          wilderness-world there are many ways, all of them leading to and
          terminating in some part of the wilderness; some to the world's
          wealth, honors, peace, etc. But there is one way that leads out of it,
          terminates in the heavenly Canaan. The throng of the world goes in
          these many ways; but the believers, and they only, take the pilgrim's
          way, which does but lie through it, neither beginning nor ending in
          the country; and the grass may grow on it for the natives, and they
          never set a foot on it; Isaiah 35:8. The men of the world ply them to
          turn them aside, and take their way; and if they catch them napping,
          they readily get them off; but the traveler towards Zion says as
          Israel to the king of Edom, "We will go by the king's highway, we will
          not turn to the right hand nor to the left;" Numbers 20:17.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. He has a low estimate of the world's wisdom, and holds off from it
          as from a false light that would lead the traveler into a quagmire; 1
          Corinthians 3:18, 19. Carnal wisdom has often been the ruin of
          Christ's interests in the church, and in the private case of
          Christians; leading into a betraying of truth and purity; procuring
          outward peace, but wounding one's conscience, and dishonoring God. But
          they that are going up from the wilderness, will be no admirers of the
          world's judgment in the matter of truth and error, sin and duty; for
          the generality of men have ever been, and will be, in that case, blind
          men judging of colors. And it is a dangerous thing to be carried away
          with the stream; Ephesians 2:2. A man that has no heart to keep off a
          way, because it is a way that is in vogue in the world, and will
          always row with the stream, is not going up from the wilderness. The
          fear of the world's putting the fool's cap on one's head, makes many a
          carcass fall in the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. He is keeping up a holy contempt of the world's good things;
          Hebrews 11:24, 25. Its profits and pleasures are sinking in their
          value with him; he "counts them but loss and dung, that he may win
          Christ;" Philippians 3:8. To a gracious soul going up from the
          wilderness, the best things the world can afford, are so lightly
          esteemed, that he will not think them worth pains to go off the King's
          highway for them; Numbers 20:17, "We will not pass through the fields,
          or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the
          wells;" while others allured with these baits, fall into one mire
          after another, and quit the traveling company, as Demas did Paul.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. He is resolute to make his way through the world's ill things, to
          follow the way of God through good and bad report, Revelation 14:4. He
          is neither to be bribed nor boasted by the world out of the way of his
          duty; Canticles 8:7, "Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the
          floods drown it; if a man would give all the substance of his house
          for love, it would utterly be contemned." His feet are shod with the
          preparation of the gospel of peace, and blow what weather it will, he
          must hold on until he be at his journey's end.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly. His eyes are upon the other world; they are fixed on the
          prize, and running that they may obtain it, Hebrews 11:26. Their
          conversation is in Heaven; they are habitually minding heavenly
          things; their affections are set not on things on the earth, but on
          the things that are above. But I proceed to consider,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Fourthly, The hardships and inconveniences of the wilderness-road,
          which the believer must lay his account with, while he goes up from
          the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It is a weary land which the traveler has to go through, while he
          is going up from the wilderness, Isaiah 32:2. David calls the whole of
          it, the house of his pilgrimage. However lightly the natives, the men
          of the earth, may live in it, there is never one born from above that
          is traveling through it, but it is a weary land to them. It was a
          weary time the Israelites had of it in the wilderness; their patience
          soon began to wear out. And there is never a child of God, but
          sometime or other he has his fill of it, and being wearied, longs to
          be at home. The Son of God himself, we find, wearied here, John 4:6.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. It is a road that lies through a waste, affording no provision,
          Deuteronomy 32:10. When sin entered into the world, a withering curse
          followed on the back of sin, and turned the pleasant land into a
          waste, barren place. There was a blessing in everything in it before,
          but now everything is embittered in it. There is enough to raise the
          appetite of lusts, there are husks enough for them to feed on; but
          there is nothing in it to fill the soul, that is the produce of the
          country; and therefore the natives, though they are always feeding,
          they are never full. The Israelites would have starved in the
          wilderness, if they had not been furnished from another quarter; for
          there was neither meat nor drink there for them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. It is an howling wilderness which they have to go through,
          Deuteronomy 32:10, because of the wild beasts that haunt there,
          Canticles 4:8, devils, and wicked men influenced by the devil.
          Sometimes the traveler must hear them roaring, Psalm 74:4, threatening
          to devour and swallow them up, and to make the name of Israel no more
          to be remembered, as the Egyptian wild beast did, Exodus 15:9, "I will
          pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil: my lust shall be
          satisfied upon them, I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy
          them." Sometimes he is entertained with their yellings, Jeremiah 2:15.
          Their blasphemies, reproaches against God and his cause, their
          contradicting of the truths of religion, what are they but yellings of
          the wilderness, as ungrateful to holy ears as the yellings of beasts
          in the night? Sometimes he must find them tearing him, his name,
          reputation, substance, yes and his flesh sometimes, Psalm 35:15, 16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. They must lay their account with scorching heats in it. Such was
          the wilderness to Israel, for which a cloud covered them by day. While
          they are upon the road through the wilderness, they are liable to
          fiery heats of desertion from Heaven; to fiery heats of temptation
          from Hell, Ephesians 6:16, fiery trials of persecution from men, 1
          Peter 4:12, and fiery heats of contention and division, the fire
          coming from the altar, Revelation 8:5. All which make traveling
          Zionward to be very hard; and the more hard, the greater these heats
          are; which puts the spouse of Christ to that prayer, Canticles 1:7,
          "Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, where you feed, where you make
          your flock to rest at noon."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. It is a sickly place through which their way lies. Many a groan was
          in the wilderness while Israel was in it; sometimes there were fiery
          serpents biting them, and sometimes a plague consuming them, so as
          many carcases fell in the wilderness. No less sickly a place is this
          world to the spiritual travelers. It is a heavy disease that is on
          them there, even a whole body of death, Romans 7:24. It affects and
          indisposes the whole man. They are liable to frequent relapses; and O
          the malignant influence it has on their journey, unfitting them for
          it, and at best causing them to go up but very slowly!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. It is a difficult way through the wilderness. The road the
          travelers must go will try their patience, their strength, etc. They
          that must needs have an easy way through the wilderness, must take the
          way that leads down to the pit, not the way that leads up to
          Immanuel's land.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) It is all upward, which scares most men at it, Psalm 24:3, "Who
          shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? The way to Heaven is up the
          hill, the way to Hell down the hill.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) It is a narrow way, Matthew 7:14. Multitudes walk in the broad
          way, and there they get room enough, life-room, heart-room,
          conscience-room. But the King's highway has no such room in it, which
          obliges the travelers to take good heed to their feet, Ephesians 5:15.
          And considering how rash we are naturally, how weak-headed,
          false-hearted, how narrow the road is, how loose the ground about it
          is, it is no great wonder that many of the travelers catch such falls,
          as make them go halting to the grave, Psalm 51:8.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) It is a hard and rugged way; and therefore they must have
          leg-hardness, as soldiers had to preserve their feet from stones and
          roughness in the way of their march; Ephesians 6:15. There are many
          difficulties to go through, which will need resolution and undaunted
          courage.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) It is a way wherein many snares are laid for them. In every lot
          in the world, and in the most innocent things, there are snares with
          which we may be caught. And sometimes men are busy making snares for
          us in the way wherein we walk.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          7. It is a very solitary road, there is not much company to be got in
          it; Matthew 7:14. Israel traveled alone through the wilderness, save
          that a mixed multitude joined with them, that they were much the worse
          of, and whose carcases fell in the wilderness. See how Miciah
          complains for want of company on the road, "Woe is me? for I am as
          when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape-gleanings of
          the vintage; there is no cluster to eat; my soul desired the first
          ripe-fruit;" Micah 7:1. In Elijah's days there were so very few upon
          the road, that he thought he had been alone upon it; he had so little
          help of the seven thousand, that he knew not of them; Romans 11:3, 4.
          At this rate the spiritual traveler has few.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) To take a lift of his burden; Galatians 6:2. Alas! we are in a
          strange world, where there are many to lay a load above the burden,
          but few to take a lift of it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) To consult with when he comes to a difficult step. There are many
          such steps that Christians will meet with in their way to Zion,
          especially when a mist rises in the wilderness. And it is no small
          mercy to have honest and tender men to advise with, and to have their
          sympathy and prayers. But of all these there is great scarcity in the
          wilderness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          8. Lastly, It is a road, wherein they must meet with armed enemies
          come forth to attack them, and ruin them. Pharaoh and his army pursued
          the Israelites in the wilderness; Exodus 14:3. Amalek fought them,
          chapter 17:8, both types of the devil and his agents. The Christian
          life is a fighting life; 2 Timothy 4:7. All is not done when they are
          converted, they must fight their way through the wilderness to Canaan,
          and so fight as to overcome; Revelation 3:21. The concluding of their
          peace with God in Christ, is proclaiming of war against the devil, the
          world, and the flesh; so they must put on their armor, if they would
          make their way through the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Fifthly, I now come to show the advantages and conveniences of the
          wilderness-road. The people of God, while in the wilderness-world,
          have as much allowed them from Heaven as may balance the hardships of
          the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The pillar of cloud to go before them in the wilderness; of which
          we have an account; Exodus 13:20, 21, 22, "And they took their journey
          from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
          And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead
          them the way: and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to
          go by day and night. He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day
          nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people." It was a
          type of Christ. He leaves them not alone in the wilderness-world. Our
          Lord Christ is upon the head of the traveling company, Canticles 4:8;
          and will be so until he have them all home. And this is sufficient to
          compensate the solitariness of the way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The pillar seems to bare been a fiery cloud, Exodus 14:20; the cloud
          representing Christ's human nature, the fire his divine nature; and to
          have been but one pillar; Numbers 9:15, 16; Christ one person in two
          distinct natures. A God veiled with flesh, is the believer's company
          in the wilderness at all times; and even the man Christ traveled the
          wilderness-road himself too.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          It had a dark side to their enemies, but a light side to the
          Israelites, Exodus 14:20. Believers see a glory in Christ which the
          blind world sees nothing of, and therefore will not go up with him
          from the wilderness. The carnal world wonders at the believer's
          waygoing from the wilderness; alas! they see not what he sees, the
          light side of the cloud goes before.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Now the cloudy pillar had a fourfold use to the Israelites in the
          wilderness, in a spiritual sense made good by Christ to his people in
          the wilderness-world.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) They had the signal for marching or halting from it, Numbers
          9:17, etc. Their motions were directed by its motions. Thus the
          travelers from the wilderness-world are directed by Jesus Christ their
          Lord and Head, on whom the trust of bringing them safe to glory is
          devolved; Isaiah 55:4, "Behold, I have given him forâ€”a leader and
          commander to the people." They must not stir until be give them the
          sign, though all the world, friends or foes, should cry, March; if
          they presume to do it, the cloud of glory will stay behind them, and
          they will find themselves entangled in the wilderness. They must not
          sit still when he gives them the sign to march, though all the world,
          friends or enemies, should cry, Halt; if they do, they will find the
          glory of the Lord will leave them, and their rest be blasted. Here
          lies their safety in the wilderness, in observing the word from
          Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) It led them in the way, Exodus 13:21. They would soon have missed
          their way in the pathless wilderness. So our Lord Christ leads his
          people in their way through the wilderness-world, Isaiah 55:4. In the
          wilderness there are many by-ways, many to lead the travelers off the
          way, besides a wandering disposition in their own nature. They will
          never get through safe, who take the guiding of themselves; but they
          who keep their eye on the cloud of glory before them, shall get
          through the most difficult steps of the wilderness-road, Proverbs 3:5,
          6.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">He leads his people through the wilderness,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) By his word, which they must take good heed to, as that which
          determines the way, Isaiah 30:21. By his word he chalks out the path
          through the wilderness, and whatever agrees not therewith is but a
          by-way, it is not the King's highway, Isaiah 8:20, "To the law and to
          the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because
          there is no light in them."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) By his example, which is the marks of his own feet upon the way,
          1 Peter 2:21. These we should narrowly observe, that we may follow
          them; hence says our Lord himself; Matthew 11:29, "Learn of me, for I
          am meek and lowly in heart." We are apt to follow example; whose
          example should be so dear to us as his, who is our Father, Master,
          Husband? etc. That we might know how to walk through the wilderness,
          God himself came down from Heaven, and in our nature walked through
          it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) By his providence, which, duly compared with the word,
          contributes much to clear the way; Psalm 32:8, "I will instruct you
          and teach you in the way which you shall go; I will guide you with
          mine eye." You are to be then careful observers of providences, which
          are really waymarks in the wilderness, Psalm 107.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) By his Spirit, which renders all the rest effectual; John 16:13,
          "When he the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all
          truth." He illuminates and causes to shine, the word, Christ's
          example, and providences. He illuminates the traveler too, as well as
          the way; disposes, moves, and efficaciously leads the traveler on his
          way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) It was a shelter to them from the heat of the sun by day; Psalm
          105:39. And so Christ shelters his people from the scorching heats in
          the wilderness; Isaiah 22:2, and 4:6. Let the heat of desertion,
          temptation, contention with men, and persecution, be never so great;
          Christ looked to by faith will be a sufficient sconce; Canticles 1:7.
          Many a time the gourds of created comforts are withered when the sun
          is hottest in the wilderness. Sons of men are found vanity and a lie.
          But Christ's shadow is ever broad and refreshing; Canticles 2:3, and
          the traveler can never come amiss to it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (4.) It was a light to them by night, Exodus 13:21. There is many a
          dark night in the wilderness; and it is sometimes the lot of the
          people of God to travel in the night, as well as it was that of
          Israel, Numbers 9:21. But Christ is a light to them in the darkest
          hour of the night; hence David could say, Psalm 23:4, "yes, | though I
          walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil:
          for you are with me, your rod and your staff they comfort me."
          Sometimes the sun shines fair, and then there is no debate about the
          way: at other times a mist and darkness sits down in the wilderness,
          and then many are put to a stand; then is a time of wandering,
          stumbling, falling over this and the other precipice in the
          wilderness. Many are lying fallen, and others come up and fall over
          them; and all because of the darkness. What way can one get through in
          such a time? Why, let them keep their eye on Christ the pillar of
          fire, and they shall have light in the midst of darkness, Job 29:3.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They have provision allowed them from Heaven in the waste
          wilderness. And that must balance the scarcity and want there. The
          King's country affords them provision for their journey. Israel in the
          wilderness were provided both with meat and drink; and so are they
          that are going up from the wilderness of this world. In the wilderness
          there is,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Manna for them to eat, even Jesus Christ, to be fed on
          spiritually, John 6:48â€“51, the only bread that can satisfy a soul.
          When the Egyptian provision is spent, the soul can no longer feed on
          the husks of the world, then the manna falls, the soul tastes the
          sweetness of Christ, in his person, offices, and benefits. It falls
          down about their tent-doors in the word of the everlasting gospel,
          exhibiting Christ with all his benefits to the soul; and it is
          gathered and ate by the application of saving faith, believing Christ
          to be offered, and taking Christ to itself, believing that it shall
          have life and salvation by him. And the more close, confident, and
          assured this application is, and the less mixed with doubting, the
          more the soul is fed.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Water out of the rock for them to drink, Exodus 17:6. This Rock
          is Christ, 1 Corinthians 10:4. The Israelites might have perished in
          the wilderness for want of water, had it not been brought out of the
          rock; so had sinners perished, but that the blood of Christ was shed
          for their life. Behold Christ smitten by the law, before he could be
          drink to our souls.â€”Costly provision for the travelers! this is their
          provision until they come to Canaan's land.

        <p align="justify">
          3. Sometimes they are allowed a song in the weary land, for their
          comfort and recreation by the way, Psalm 119:54, "Your statutes have
          been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage." We find Israel in the
          wilderness often complaining, groaning, and mourning; that is the
          ordinary in the wilderness-world; but seldom singing, that is reserved
          for the exercise in the promised land. Yet I find Israel singing in
          the wilderness three times.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) At their entry into the wilderness, just after they came out from
          the Red Sea, Exodus 15. So young converts frequently have a parcel of
          pleasant days at their first setting off in the wilderness-journey,
          Hosea 2:14. Religion is new to them; they are like men newly brought
          out of a dark dungeon, to whom the light has a double sweetness; and
          the Lord even so deals with them, as fathers with their children who
          are learning to go, holding out an apple to them, which they are not
          to expect when they are more confirmed; and further, it is even to fit
          them for the hardships which they are afterwards to meet with.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) When they were far on in the wilderness, and had been long in it,
          they sang upon the occasion of God's giving them a well without their
          complaining, or so much as asking for it, Numbers 21:17, "Then Israel
          sang this song, Spring up, O well, sing you unto it."! Many a heavy
          day had gone over their head between that and the last song they had
          had, (I reckon not their song at the idolatry of the golden calf,
          Exodus 32:18, which ended in sorrow.) The fiery serpents had been
          among them a little before. Yet God made then sing again. Thus
          sometimes God surprises the travelers with mercy after many a heavy
          day, that they think they will never sing more, and their souls have
          forgotten joy; yet he causes them to take down their harps from the
          willows, and puts a new song in their mouth; while he causes the wells
          of salvation to spring up to them.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) In their last station in the wilderness, when they were encamping
          by Jordan, before they passed it, Deuteronomy 31:22, and chapter 32.
          It was forty years between this and their first song. Thus they may
          have a weary time of it through the wilderness, who yet, when they
          come to the Jordan of death, shall be made to sing there the sweetest
          song that ever they sang, like the swan singing sweetest when a-dying.
          The nearer the rivers come to the sea, they are the sooner met by the
          tide. Motions in nature are so much the swifter as they come nearer
          the center. And it may be a very cloudy day in which the sun shall
          shine brightest at its setting, Zechariah 14:6, 7.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. The Lord is their banner in the wilderness, and so they may be sure
          of victory, they shall be conquerors in the war, Exodus 17:15. Though
          they must fight, yet Christ the true Joshua is upon their head; he
          sits in Heaven, who has the balance of victory in his hand; and he is
          their friend, and the cause is his own. Nay, they shall be more than
          conquerors. Israel was armed with the spoils of the Egyptian army, and
          Sihon and Og's lands they got possession of. Though the believer's
          battle with the world, the devil, and his own corruptions be sore; yet
          the spoils thereby gained are sweet, Psalm 74:14. They produce sweet
          experience of the Lord's goodness, Romans 5:3, 4. Jacob was a man
          whose life had more trials than any of the Patriarchs; but as true as
          it was, it had more signal experiences too.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. There is healing in the wilderness for them, for the wounds got
          there. There are fiery flying serpents to bite the people there, and
          they cannot miss the bites of the old serpent now and then. But there
          is the brazen serpent to look to and be healed; the ordinance relative
          thereto, we have, Numbers 21:8, 9, "And the Lord said unto Moses, Make
          you a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to
          pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looks upon it, shall
          live. And Motes made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole; and
          it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld
          the serpent of brass, he lived." This wilderness-world is the haunt of
          the old serpent, his prevailing temptations are his bites, the guilt
          remaining stings and galls the conscience; but Jesus Christ lifted up
          on the cross, and on the pole of the gospel, being looked to by faith,
          they are healed, Isaiah 45:22. So Isaiah 33., "The inhabitant shall
          not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven
          their iniquity." And how often soever they be bitten, still the look
          of faith will be a healing look.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly. We must not forget the tabernacle in the wilderness, which
          was the comfort of the godly Israelites there. There they had their
          stated meetings, and when anything more than ordinary ailed them in
          the wilderness, they used to draw towards the tabernacle. The
          tabernacle of gospel-ordinances is the great comfort of the travelers
          towards Zion. I shall only observe, that,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) It was the place of meeting, namely, with God. The cloud of glory
          rested on it, and thence God spoke. Gospel-ordinances are the place of
          meeting between the Lord and his people in this wilderness-world,
          Proverbs 8:34, 35, and therefore they are even the pleasantest things
          in the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) It was coarse without, but rich and fine within. There was the
          golden candlestick, the showbread table, incense-altar, ark, etc. All
          which believers have in Christ enjoyed in the ordinances.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Lastly. It was a moveable and slender thing. The tabernacle of
          gospel-ordinances is so. But wherever the Israelites went in the
          wilderness, they took the tabernacle with them. And the travelers to
          Zion, go where they will, dare not leave their religion, or their
          duties behind them. The tabernacle was often removed in the
          wilderness; but where it went, they went; none have a tack of the
          gospel; but wherever it goes, the travelers will go after it, cost
          what it will. Coarse fare and hard lodging with the gospel, will be by
          them preferred to the world's advantages without it. The tabernacle
          was suited to the wilderness, they had no temple there, that was
          reserved for the promised land of rest; but in Heaven they shall have
          it, Revelation 3:12.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I proceed now to the practical improvement of this subject.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE I. Of information. From what is said we may draw the following
          inferences.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The people of God need not be surprised, that they meet with many
          hardships and trials in the world, and that it is a strange world to
          them, John 16. While they are in it, they are in a wilderness. How
          then can they expect other than a wilderness-life! That the desert is
          to be turned into a paradise, nobody expects; why then look we to see
          the world other than a wilderness, if we mind for Heaven? These things
          are useful.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) To keep believers from sitting down in it, as their
          dwelling-place, Canticles 4:8; or resting-place. A smiling world hugs
          many to death in its embraces; and the ease many find in it so charms
          the carnal heart, that the promised land is forgot, Matthew 17:4.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) To quicken their pace out of it, and so work together for good to
          them, Romans 8:28. As a boisterous wind blowing on the back of the
          traveler, makes him sometimes run, while otherwise he would walk; so
          afflictions and trials put the believer to his duty, when he would not
          otherwise apply to it, and wean his heart more from the world; Micah
          7:7, "Therefore I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of
          my salvation; my God will hear me."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) To make Heaven more desirable, 2 Corinthians 5:4. The tossing
          they meet with on the sea of this world, makes them long for the
          shore, Job. 7:2. And as rest is not so sweet to any as to the weary,
          nor meat as to the hungry; so Heaven must be the more sweet in the
          enjoyment, that the believer has a weary life here.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. They have good reason to bear all the hardships of their
          wilderness-lot patiently, and with Christian fortitude and
          cheerfulness. And that
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Because they will not last, they will be over before long; they
          are going up from the wilderness. What inconveniences are upon the
          road, the traveler matters not much, because he is not to stay with
          them. He may wonder indeed bow people can dwell in a place to him so
          unpleasant; but it is but a light thing to him, because he is only a
          passenger. Indeed it is no wonder that the world's hardships be
          intolerable to them, who have no other portion but the things of the
          world; but they cannot be intolerable to the believer, who has a
          better portion, even one in Heaven.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Because the heavenly Canaan which the wilderness-road leads to,
          will make amends for all; "God shall then wipe away all tears from
          their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
          crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things
          are passed away," Revelation 21:4. Though the way be a rugged one, it
          leads to a paradise. Christ's espoused bride will forget all the
          wilderness-hardships, when she comes home to the marriage chamber in
          the Bridegroom's Father's house.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) Their lot is a wise mixture, take it at the worst. There are
          advantages allowed to balance the hardships, as you have heard. There
          is no strait they can be in, in the wilderness, but there is help for
          it in the provision made for them there. If the wilderness be a weary
          land, there are statutes that may be songs to them there, etc.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. They are not Israelites indeed, nor espoused to Christ, who are not
          going up from this world as a wilderness, in heart and affection, in
          life and conversation. And such may lay their account, that their
          carcases will fall in the wilderness, and they shall not see Canaan's
          land. And such are,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) Those whose hearts were never yet loosed from this world, and
          married to Christ, Matthew 13:44, 45. When man fell off from God, he
          fell to the creature, and his heart was wedded to it as the spring of
          his content and satisfaction. All the crosses in the world will not
          loose this knot; only efficacious grace discovering Christ in his
          surpassing glory to the sinner will do it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) Those who are walking according to the course of this world,
          Ephesians 2:2, framing their lives by worldly principles, being
          actuated by worldly motives, and acting for worldly ends as their
          chief design. Thus they are conformed to the world, which speaks them
          natives of the wilderness-world, not pilgrims in it. These, however
          their voice may be Jacob's, their hands are Esau's; though they
          pretend to be going heavenward, they are in the way to destruction.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">The characters of them that walk are,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) To do as the most do, not regarding how the best do; contrary to
          that plain injunction, Exodus 23:2, "You shall not follow a multitude
          to do evil." Thus the world is like a dunghill, where one part
          corrupts another, men fearlessly venturing on those courses and ways
          on which they see many before them. This is the downright reverse of
          going up from the wilderness, being a going along with the world, from
          which the apostle dehorts, Romans 12:2, "Be not conformed to this
          world."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) To make the world one's business, and religion the by-hand work
          at best; not remembering what our Lord says, Matthew 6:24, "No man can
          serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the
          other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You
          cannot serve God and mammon." This is the way of the world, who look
          on their carnal interests as their chief interests, which therefore
          get the flower and strength of their affections. Whereas gracious
          souls go quite the contrary way, counting all things but loss, yes but
          dung that they may win Christ, Philippians 3:8. And so our Lord
          directs us, Matthew 6:33, to "seek first the kingdom of God, and his
          righteousness."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (3.) To step over conscience deliberately, to gratify lusts.
          Conscience among the men of the world is a very weak thing; and all
          its dictates, and the consideration of God's word as our rule, and
          God's honor as concerned in men's actions, go very short way with
          them. Let the unjust man see gain within his reach, and the sensual
          man what may please his sensual lust; though God's command, honor, and
          conscience be between him and them, he can step over these, tread on
          them all, and gratify his lust, Hosea 12:7, 8, and 13:6.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE II. Of caution. While you are in the wilderness, beware of
          wilderness sins and snares. And beware of,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Unbelief. That was a wilderness-sin of Israel's, Psalm. 78:22,
          "They believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation." Yes, it
          was the sin that kept the whole generation that came out of Egypt, out
          of Canaan, Hebrews 3:18, 19. Many that seem to have been set fair on
          the way to the heavenly Canaan, come short of it this way. They
          believe not the record that God has given concerning his Son, and so
          they never embrace Christ but perish. And the unbelief of saints while
          they are in the wilderness, does them much harm. It plucks away from
          their strength, and leaves them most unfit for their journey.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Murmuring, 1 Corinthians 10:10. Many times God's anger was kindled
          against Israel for their murmurings in the wilderness. And it is
          incident to us in this wilderness-world, through the trials, crosses,
          and troubles that must be met with there. They had need of mortified
          affections that travel the wilderness-way, else they cannot is
          patience possess their souls. And when people have lost their
          patience, and their spirits are on the fret, everything ruffles them,
          and the hard way becomes harder.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Lusting, 1 Corinthians 10:6. Let not the loose be given to your
          hearts, to fix on anything which providence sees meet to withhold from
          you, so that you must have it, and cannot be satisfied without it.
          Thus the Israelites lusted for flesh, and they got it with a
          vengeance, Numbers 11, Psalm. 78:30, 31. And it is ordinary that what
          people pull off the tree of providence before it be ripe for them,
          sets their teeth on edge, and proves a snare to them. There is nothing
          better than a weaned heart to fit one for the wilderness-way.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Looking back to Egypt, Numbers 14:4. There is a root of apostasy in
          every one's heart, though broken in the sincere, yet reigning in
          others; hence it comes to pass, that many go far back, and lose what
          they have attained in religion, making themselves new work, with
          difficulty to recover what they threw away; and many fall away for
          good and all, and never recover. We had much need to take heed to the
          first rising of these evil motions in the heart; Psalm 45:10,
          "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; forget also
          your own people, and your father's house."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Fawning and flattering enemies, Numbers 25:17, 18. Pharaoh's
          pursuit with his chariots and horses, Amalek's sword and bow, did not
          the mischief to Israel in the wilderness, that the daughters of Moab
          did, Numbers 25. Balaam tried all his are to curse them, but could do
          them no harm by all his enchantments; but the Midianitish women ruined
          them with theirs, verse 9. The church of God has often weathered out
          the storm of persecution, and came off victorious; while she has been
          ruined with the soft methods of the enemy. And many have stood out
          against the frowning world, that have been cast down with the smiling
          world. They have been drawn to destruction with silken cords of
          temptation, who could not be driven to it with iron rods.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          6. Lastly. The mixed multitude, Exodus 12:38. They were a black sight
          to Israel in the wilderness, a sad snare to them, Numbers 11:4. They
          came in among them from a carnal principle of worldly interest, and
          were a snare to them, and their carcases fell in the wilderness. When
          God brings his church out of the house of bondage, and gives her
          peace, a company of carnal men driving their own worldly interest,
          join them like a swarm of insects in a summer-day, (Exodus 12:38, a
          great mixture, Hebrews); and the more their number increases, the more
          mischief they do to her true interests, sacrificing them to their own.
          It is not a little owing to the influence of that mixed multitude both
          of ministers and professors, that religion and its interests are at so
          low an ebb this day; and therefore we have ground to expect a stroke,
          come from what quarter it will, that will make a dispersion among us,
          and lessen our numbers, Ezekiel 20:37, 38. In the meantime beware of
          those who have a name to live, and are dead; formal professors often
          hurt a Christian more than the profane.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">USE III. Of exhortation. And,</p>
        <p align="justify">
          First, You who profess to be espoused to Christ, evidence the reality
          of it by your going up from the wilderness-world with him in heart and
          affection, in the progress of sanctification, and contempt of the
          world, holding off from the ways of it. To press this, I offer the
          following motives.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOT. 1. Without this you cannot evidence your sincerity, 1 John 2:15.
          If your treasure be in Heaven, your heart will be there. If Christ be
          indeed your espoused Husband, you will forsake your father's house for
          him, and follow him. But many give him the hand and not the heart; and
          therefore though called by his name, dwell at their father's house
          still.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Without this you will bring a reproach on religion, which suffers
          extremely by those who profess Christ, and yet follow the way of the
          world, Romans 2:24. Alas! for the wounds thus given to religion by the
          worldly disposition of the professors of it, whose untender lives, and
          covetous practices, proclaim them sons of earth.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Lastly. You may be very useful for Christ in the world this way, by
          commending religion practically at this rate to the consciences of
          carnal men. "Who is this that goes up from the wilderness, leaning
          upon her Beloved?" say the daughters of Jerusalem. What can have more
          influence upon them, than to see men dead to the world, heavenly in
          their disposition, walking as pilgrims on the earth? It is a noble
          testimony for God.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (1.) To the vanity of the world, while men in their practice tread on
          that which carnal men set their hearts upon. What avails it for a man
          to talk of the world's vanity, while he is still griping it as his
          life, cannot part with it at God's call, for God's honor and service;
          but, on the contrary, is dishonoring God, and wounding his own soul,
          to gain it? That is building with the one hand, and destroying with
          the other.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          (2.) To the reality and excellency of religion, and heavenly things, 1
          Peter 4:4; Canticles 3:6. It speaks a power in religion that can carry
          men above these perishing things, and that they must be fed from some
          other quarter, that so little value the streams of earthly things.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Secondly, Strangers to Christ, be espoused to him, that you may go up
          with him from this wilderness-world, to his Father's house in the
          heavenly Canaan, believe that Christ is offered in an everlasting
          marriage-covenant to you. Embrace you and accept, and so close with
          him as your head and husband, for time and eternity. I offer the
          following motives to enforce this exhortation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          MOTIVE I. Jesus Christ is really and truly in suit of your souls. This
          is the gospel-offer; Hosea 2:19, "I will betroth you unto me forever,
          yes, I will betroth you unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and
          in loving-kindness, and in mercies;" and nothing will hinder but the
          want of your consent; Matthew 22:4, "All things are ready; come unto
          the marriage." He has with his precious blood bought a bride to
          himself, and he comes in the gospel to gain her heart to himself. And
          he is come to you this day; O then slight not the offer.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. If you accept of Christ, he will carry you up from this
          wilderness-world to his Father's house, where the marriage will be
          solemnized forever. He will leave none of his behind him. There may be
          a time between the espousals and marriage; but in that time he is
          carrying them to the marriage-chamber.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. There is no loosing of the heart from the world without engaging it
          to Jesus Christ, Matthew 13:45, 46. It is the discovery of the one
          pearl that makes one give over seeking the many. The heart of man is
          like a child that will not let the knife go out of its hand, until
          something that pleases it better is put into it. Though the devil go
          out, if the house be empty, he will return again, Matthew 12:44, 45.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. Lastly, If you are not espoused to Christ, you will fall in the
          wilderness, and never see the heavenly Canaan, Hebrews 4:12. They will
          have no access to the marriage above, that are not espoused to Christ
          here below. Nor will they be transplanted into the paradise above, who
          are not first planted in the nursery of grace below.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Thirdly. I invite, and sound an alarm to you all, to go up from this
          wilderness world with Christ. Rise, you that are espoused to him, and
          come away. Rise, you dwellers in the wilderness. Take him as your head
          and husband, and go along with him towards the I heavenly Canaan,
          leaving this world in heart and affection.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Question How shall I get up from the wilderness world, how will I get
          through it to the heavenly Canaan, while the journey is so hard and
          difficult for a poor weak creature?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          ANSWER. I give you your directions and advice in a third doctrine from
          the text.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DOCTRINE. The way to get up from the wilderness-world to the heavenly
          Canaan, is to go all along leaning on Jesus Christ by faith. The way
          to live well in this world, until we come to Heaven, is to live by
          faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here I shall briefly show what it is to go leaning, or to live by
          faith; and that we are allowed to go thus.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          I. I shall show briefly what it is to go leaning, or to live by faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. It supposes the soul's taking, receiving, and embracing Christ for
          its head and husband, John 1:12. In the gospel Jesus Christ is
          offered, presented, and exhibited to every one that hears it, as the
          Father's gift to them, Isaiah 9:6; John 4:10. He says in effect, "Poor
          souls, you can never of yourselves make your way up through the
          wilderness; but I freely give you a strong one to lean upon. Take him
          and welcome." Hereupon the soul takes its hold of Christ for that end,
          the soul believes the gospel offer or promise as made to itself,
          saying in effect, "Then he is mine by the free offer made to me;"
          which implies the heart's consent to take him, and so the espousals
          are made, 1 John 5:11. It bears a going,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Cleaving to him, Acts 11:23. Faith joins the soul to the Lord, so
          as to be one with him; and so holds the gripe, and will not quit it.
          The believer hangs by Christ, by the word of the gospel; and as the
          weak woman dares not lean to her own strength, but cleaves to her
          husband on the journey, so does the believer to Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. A going on under a sense of weakness, 2 Corinthians 3:5. There are
          two causes of one's going leaning upon another. One is love, the other
          weakness; both concur here. The believer loves Christ as his Lord and
          Husband, and therefore will lean on him; he is sensible of utter
          weakness and inability to make the journey in his own strength, and
          therefore must lean on him. Faith is a self-emptying grace, and
          therefore is chosen to be the mean of communication on our part
          between the Lord and us, Romans 4:16.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          4. A going on, laying our weight on the Lord Jesus for the whole of
          the journey, Psalm 55:22. When the believer sets out with Christ, he
          says to him, "All your wants be on me." "So be it," says the believing
          soul, and so rolls itself upon him for all. Hence faith is called a
          staying, Isaiah 50:10, as an old man stays himself upon his staff; a
          believing on Christ, as a chief corner-stone, that is, laying the
          weight on him, as the foundation, 1 Peter 2:6.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          5. Lastly. A going on, with a persuasion that we shall be borne up and
          borne through by him, 2 Timothy 1:12. This is the plain import of
          leaning on Christ; for none will ever lean on that for help,
          concerning which they have no manner of persuasion that they shall be
          helped by it. Thus faith is called trusting in God, relying on him,
          both which bear this persuasion. And they that would remove this from
          the nature of faith, would destroy it, and leave as a mere wavering
          opinion in its stead.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          But as one may lean trembling, so faith may be accompanied with
          doubting. But as trembling belongs not to the nature of leaning, but
          is opposite to it; so doubting belongs not to the nature of faith, but
          is opposite to it. And the more trembling the less leaning, so the
          more doubting the less faith.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          This going up from the wilderness, leaning, is walking in Christ Jesus
          as we have received him, Colossians 2:6, which is the only true
          holiness competent to fallen man.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          II. I shall show, that we are allowed to go thus leaning. Consider,
          that,
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. The Father has appointed the Mediator for this very end, that so he
          may bring many sons to glory, Psalm 89:19, "I have laid help upon one
          that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people." The
          first man, with all his children in his loins, set off alone through
          the world, on his own stock; and fell, being unable to make the
          journey. Wherefore now the strength for all the heirs of glory is
          lodged in Christ, and they are allowed to live and lean on him; 1
          Corinthians 1:30, "But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is
          made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
          redemption." 2 Timothy 2:1, "You therefore, my son, be strong in the
          grace that is in Christ Jesus."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. We are called and commanded to lean on him; Psalm 55:22, "Cast your
          harden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain you." Proverbs 3:5, 6,
          "Trust in the Lord with all your heart; and lean not into your own
          understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct
          your paths." Psalm 37:5, "Commit your way unto the Lord; trust also in
          him, and he shall bring it to pass." Isaiah 26:3, 4, "You will keep
          him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on you; because he trusts
          in you. Trust you in the Lord forever: for in the Lord Jehovah is
          everlasting strength." It is the great duty called for in the Old and
          New Testament. We honor the Father and the Son, by doing this through
          the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. To pretend to go another way, is an abomination to the Lord,
          Proverbs 3:9. We know no holiness of Adam's fallen children, but what
          is a walking in Jesus Christ. Men may call the obedience given to the
          law otherwise, holiness; but a holy God will never own it as such,
          when it savors not of union with his Son.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          USE. Then if you would go up from the wilderness of this world to the
          heavenly Canaan, go leaning on Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          1. Go leaning on him for light to know your duty, Proverbs 3:5. You
          are in the wilderness; let him be eyes to you there; look to him, as
          the Israelites did to the motions of the cloud, for your direction. He
          is the great Prophet and Teacher; close your own eyes that you may be
          guided by his word and Spirit.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          2. Go leaning on him for strength to perform your duty, Philippians
          4:13. It will not be your weak hands that will work the work, nor your
          feeble knees that will perform the journey. The strength must come
          from him who is the Head. And you must go on borrowed legs.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          3. Lastly. Go leaning on him for acceptance, and the happy issue of
          your journey, Ephesians 1:6. It is through him alone that any step in
          the Lord's way can be accepted, and by him alone we can be brought
          into the eternal rest.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In all this you are to believe the word of promise, and on the credit
          of it to set about your duty, renouncing yourselves, and believing and
          applying the sufficiency treasured up in Christ.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Great is your need of leaning; you have great work to do, a great
          journey to go, much weakness hangs about you, much opposition you must
          encounter; yet forward you must be out of the wilderness to the
          heavenly Canaan, else you perish.
