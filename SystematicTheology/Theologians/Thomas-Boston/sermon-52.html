<p align="justify">Ettrick, June, 1712<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">Ezekiel 18:29, "Are not your ways unequal?"</p>
<p align="justify">MEN may be under the deepest affliction, and yet far from 
    true humiliation. A stone broken in a thousand pieces, each piece is a 
    stone. A hard heart, untouched by the grace of God, will be an unhumbled 
    heart, under the severest affliction. Here is a people, some of them 
    captives in Babylon, some of them in hard circumstances in their own land; 
    both groaning under affliction, but not to God, but against God. Let not 
    people wish the evil day, upon the assurance that it will humble the 
    generation. If Hell were opened to flash out on the faces of a graceless 
    generation; if the fire of the Spirit do not withal melt their hearts, "the 
    bellows are burnt, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melts in 
    vain; for the wicked are not plucked away." They will quarrel God's ways as 
    unequal, as if they deserved not the punishments inflicted upon them; while 
    in the meantime it may be justly retorted on them, as in the text, "Are not 
    your ways unequal?"</p>
<p align="justify">The words are a solemn appeal made by God himself to this 
    people themselves, touching their way and manner of life. Consider here,</p>
<p align="justify">1. The antagonists, even God, and his own people, on whom 
    he had heaped benefits and privileges, and who had made to him repeated 
    professions of duty; and here God being the complainer, and they defenders, 
    there is no doubt they must lose the cause.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The crime libeled against them; the inequality of 
    their ways. They had the impudence to charge God with unequalness in his 
    ways; as if he had punished them for that of which they were not guilty. The 
    Lord clears himself, verses 26–28; then he retorts the charge upon 
    themselves, that their ways were unequal. The word signifies such an 
    inequality as there is between two things that are weighed; but the one 
    cannot balance the other, there is no proportion or equality between them; 
    so their ways in which they walked with God, their carriage and behavior to 
    him, was most unequal and unevenly. Unequal among themselves, unequal in 
    respect of his ways towards them; so that bring the balance from Heaven or 
    from earth by which their actions should be weighed, they would be found 
    light, unequal, disagreeable and disproportionate. Well then might he say, 
    "talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your 
    mouth; for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed." 
    And this charge is made on all and every one of their ways, as is the import 
    of the singular number joined with the plural, in the Hebrew text; as if he 
    had said, take every one of them, weigh them one by one, with my dealings 
    with you, or with one another, you shall find them a confused disorderly 
    mass; the whole thread of your life nothing but outs and ins, the whole of 
    your conversation a rabble of inequalities.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The bar to which God brings this plea: it is that of 
    their own consciences, whose tribunal was within their own breasts. Here God 
    condescends to plead his cause against the criminals, where they themselves 
    should be both judge and parties; being assured that though their 
    corruptions did pass sentence in their favors, yet their consciences would 
    reverse that sentence, and oblige them, out of their own mouths, to 
    pronounce themselves guilty. In such a matter, where conscience is made 
    judge, the sinner must lose the cause.</p>
<p align="justify">This is a day in which conscience should be set on a 
    tribunal, and each of us should sist ourselves before it, to have our cause 
    there judged. There are two things call for this, this day.</p>
<p align="justify">I. God seems to be mounting his throne for judgment this 
    day; and the dispensations of the day towards us, and our Protestant 
    churches, seem to sound that alarm of the judge's coming. "For, behold, the 
    Lord comes out of his place, to punish the inhabitants of the earth for 
    their iniquity: the earth also shall discover her blood, and shall no more 
    cover her slain." Providence appears to be whetting the glittering sword, 
    and his arm to take hold on vengeance. It is time for us now to be going 
    inward into our own breasts, as Isaiah 6:1–5. We have three sad tokens of 
    God's mounting his throne:</p>
<p align="justify">1. The posts of the temple door with us are moved, as 
    Isaiah 6:4. By this was signified the pulling down of the door, and exposing 
    the temple to the profane, Amos 9:1. And is not that this day fulfilled 
    before our eyes, by that most unbounded toleration now set on foot in this 
    Church, under the shadow of which the vilest errors and blasphemies may set 
    up their heads; and men on whom the door of our temple was most justly shut, 
    may now come in with their profane lives, erroneous preaching, and 
    superstitious worship; and others must come in by the door of a patron's 
    presentation, a door of which there was no pattern shown in the mount; while 
    that which Christ himself appointed, the call of the Church, is broken down; 
    and it is just with God that it should be so, seeing, in the best times of 
    this Church, it was never freely opened.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Our house is also filled with smoke, which is a token 
    of anger, Psalm 18:8. Some have been long looking for the mountain of the 
    ministry to fall a burning, though former experience has shown that to be a 
    forerunner of all being cast into the sea. And some have been, like Samson's 
    foxes, going through this Church with their firebrands, to set all in a 
    flame; but now, alas! that spark is cast in which has already filled the 
    house with such smoke of contention as will break forth at length into a 
    flame of division, to the rending of this poor Church, if God in mercy 
    prevent not.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Our prophets mostly seem to be sent out with a heavy 
    message, as Isaiah 6:9, 10. The generation, in spite of gospel light, is 
    still growing worse and worse; and the more our wounds are handled, the more 
    they corrupt and stink. And, truly, the preaching of the word seems, for 
    this long time, to have been followed with a judicial obduration; as if 
    their meat had been laid before them, to fit them for the slaughter.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore set conscience on the tribunal beforehand, and 
    let it impartially judge your hearts and lives, that you may get wrongs 
    righted before the decree bring forth.</p>
<p align="justify">II. God is ascending a throne of mercy among us. We are 
    to see in this place, in a solemn manner, God in Christ reconciling the 
    world to himself; and possibly it may be the last which we may have of that 
    sort, until from the throne of judgment there come forth thunderings, 
    lightnings and voices, which may rend the hearts of those whom the still 
    small voice from the mercy-seat cannot make to relent. Therefore set 
    conscience beforehand on the tribunal, and let it make an impartial judgment 
    of your state and case; for,</p>
<p align="justify">1. It is a day of pardons, and sealed pardons. But the 
    malefactor must come with a sense of his crimes in his heart, a confession 
    in his mouth, and the rope about his neck of self-condemnation.</p>
<p align="justify">2. It is a solemn marriage-day. But the bride must be 
    taking farewell of her father's house, and her own people. She must be 
    casting off her filthy rags, and putting on the wedding-garment. She must be 
    considering what will please, and what will displease her husband; whether 
    her heart be gained from all others or not; and whether or not she is every 
    way pleased with the match; content to take him for better and worse, and to 
    follow him wherever he goes; otherwise her heart will leap back, and the 
    marriage be marred.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It is to be an exaltation day to sinners, in which 
    they are to be exalted to sit at Christ's table, to eat his flesh and drink 
    his blood, and to have the covenant sealed; and therefore this must be a 
    humiliation day, for it is the humble that are exalted indeed, and the soul 
    that is most humble bids fairest for the highest seat at the feast. The soul 
    that has most of gospel heaviness for sin, is likely to receive most of the 
    oil of gladness. They that now lie most deep in the dust, and have the most 
    profound sense of their follies and vileness, are the most likely to be 
    admitted, as the beloved disciple, to lean on Christ's bosom. Now, as we are 
    to be helpers of your joy, we would also be helpers of your shame and sorrow 
    this day.</p>
<p align="justify">Sinners, what think you of your ways? "Are not your ways 
    unequal?" Throw away the false balances of a corrupt judgment, and of your 
    self-conceit. You have weighed too long with them. Let us weigh our ways in 
    the balance of the sanctuary.</p>
<p align="justify">I. Weigh your ways in the balance of your Christian 
    privileges. God has exalted this land to Heaven that way. He has made our 
    poor corner of the world a lightsome corner, with Bibles, sermons, Sabbaths, 
    sacraments, and other ordinances. But do we look like a people thus 
    privileged? "Are not our ways unequal?"</p>
<p align="justify">1. How unsuitable to the gospel are our conversations. 
    "Only," says the apostle, "let your conversation be as it becomes the 
    gospel." Do we look like the citizens of the New Jerusalem? Nay, instead of 
    adorning the doctrines of the gospel by holy and heavenly lives, our 
    unholiness and carnality, our irregular and ungospel-like walk, leaves a 
    stain on the ways of God.</p>
<p align="justify">2. How little are our privileges valued and improved? It 
    is seldom our case sends us to our Bibles. The treasure lies there by us, 
    but we slight it, do not dig into it, but are poor, formal, lifeless 
    creatures, in our reading, hearing, and other exercises. The preaching of 
    the word is very little prized, Sabbaths by many are miserably misspent, and 
    sacraments disregarded.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Where is the fruit of these things? There is no growth 
    proportionable to our means of grace. The showers of gospel waterings have 
    as little fruit following them in many, as the rain that falls on the rocks 
    and sands, and at best, "the seed of an homer does but yield an ephah." And 
    "are not our ways unequal?" No wonder the kingdom of God should be taken 
    from us, and given to others, that would bring forth the fruits of it, and 
    that that land should be left unploughed that does so ill requite the pains 
    of the gardener.</p>
<p align="justify">II. Weigh our ways in the balance of our mercies, that 
    should lead us to repentance. He is a good God to us. Good to our land, good 
    to every one of us in particular. But how unequal are our returns to our 
    receipts? A shameful confounding disproportion may be found there.</p>
<p align="justify">1. How unequal are they to the sparing mercy God is 
    giving us? He has spared our land, ourselves in particular, as a man spares 
    his own son that serves him. But we have been to him as a snake hidden in a 
    man's bosom, that sets itself to gnaw out his affections. "Because sentence 
    against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the 
    sons of men is fully set in them to do evil." The more he spares, the more 
    does sin grow, the higher do we run on in our accounts; which is like to 
    bring it to that, that his eye will not pity, nor his hand spare us any 
    more.</p>
<p align="justify">2. How unequal are our ways to the preventing mercies 
    with which we have met. How often has the Lord prevented us, held us up by 
    his hand when we were on the brink of ruin, falling into sin? But has that 
    made us more watchful? Have we not been ready to cast ourselves again into 
    the same snare? Have we duly acknowledged our debt to God in that matter? He 
    has prevented our danger by seasonable deliverances, general and particular: 
    but though for the present it might have some impression on us, yet have we 
    not, many of us, behaved as if we had been delivered to work iniquity?</p>
<p align="justify">3. How unequal to enriching mercies. "Blessed be the 
    Lord, who daily loads us with his benefits, even the God of our salvation." 
    Every day we rise, providence bids us stoop, and take on our day's load of 
    benefits. But if conscience be allowed to speak, it will tell us, that every 
    day the Spirit of the Lord gets on a new load of provocations from us. God 
    is drawing us to him by cords of love, and we drive him from us by our daily 
    follies.</p>
<p align="justify">III. In the balance of our afflictions, by which God has 
    been at so much pains with us. These are the means made use of to cut off 
    our luxuriant branches, that we may bring forth fruit; to wean us from the 
    world, and to make us heavenly. They are the brisk gale that should cause us 
    make speedy way towards Immanuel's land. But alas!</p>
<p align="justify">I. Are not many made worse and worse by their 
    afflictions. Instead of the peaceable fruits of righteousness, showers of 
    troubles and crosses, falling on the cursed ground of an ill heart, bring 
    forth the briars and thorns of murmuring, fretting against God. Such trials 
    often put men on ill courses. The poverty of many often roots up their 
    honesty. Trade decays, the land is impoverished, and the effect of it on 
    many is, their spirits are embittered, that they can get no good of the 
    gospel. They are like the children of Israel, "who hearkened not unto Moses 
    for anguish of spirit, and cruel bondage in Egypt." Are not your ways then 
    unequal?</p>
<p align="justify">2. Do we not cleave to that from which God is trying to 
    separate us by the wedge of affliction. God sees such a thing would ruin a 
    person, if they should get their will, and therefore God drives the wedge to 
    make a separation; but the more God pulls these from us, we draw the more 
    violently. Gall and wormwood are laid on the world's breast, but the child 
    sucks the more greedily. The cup of poision is put out of our reach, and yet 
    we search for it the more diligently.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Where is the contempt of the world, the 
    heavenly-mindedness, the soul's taking up its rest in God, delighting in 
    him, taking him for all, and instead of all, rejoicing in him in all cases 
    and conditions—the native fruits of sanctified afflictions? Nay, the 
    bewitching world has invaded the professors of this day, taken us captive; 
    so that when we are sought to a kingdom, we are lying hidden among the 
    stuff.</p>
<p align="justify">IV. In the balance of our engagements, purposes, and 
    resolutions. The vows of God are upon us, the land is under covenants; each 
    of us are under baptismal vows, many of us are under communion vows. 
    Purposes and resolutions have been taken up under convictions and 
    afflictions. Our vows have been very extensive, to the whole of the 
    Christian life. They have been aimed at particulars in our way. But are our 
    ways equal? Have not our engagements been like the green withes, our 
    purposes as the corn on the housetop? Are we what we engaged and resolved to 
    be? No, no.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Have we not returned to our vomit, and after vows made 
    inquiry. These very particular lusts, of which we seemed once and again to 
    have taken farewell, invite us to return, and we have been found again on 
    the forbidden ground.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Does our unwatchful, careless walking, look like our 
    engagements and purposes. Were we resolved to give all that scope to our 
    hearts, lips and lives, that they have actually gotten? Did we purpose to be 
    at so little pains to beware of temptation, as indeed we have been? No, but 
    our ways are unequal. Our purposes high, our performances very far below 
    them.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Does our omission of duties, prayer, reading the word, 
    meditation, self-examination look like them? How easily are we put off these 
    things?</p>
<p align="justify">V. In the balance of our profession. Alas! how wide are 
    our practices from our principles. No man could gather from what we do, what 
    we believe, there is such an inequality between them.</p>
<p align="justify">1. How unequal are our ways to our profession of the 
    great fundamental principles of religion, that we are all lost by nature, 
    and must be renewed by grace. Are our ways equal? how is it, then, that men 
    live without dipping into the thoughts of that state, and inquiring whether 
    they are converted or not. A Heaven and Hell. What means the profanity of 
    many, the coldness and formality of others, in the duties of religion.</p>
<p align="justify">2. How unequal to our professions of love to God and 
    Christ. How comes this love of the world, so little care to please him, so 
    little being affected with the dishonor done to him.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Our concern for his interest. If it be so, how comes 
    it that there is so little sympathy with this bleeding, groaning Church? How 
    is it there is so little wrestling at the throne of grace at this time?</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, In the balance of your attainments, which you 
    have sometimes had, if ever you knew ought of seriousness. Let us look on 
    ourselves as we have been in some golden spots of our time. O! how unlike 
    ourselves will we appear, unstable as water.</p>
<p align="justify">To conclude. Take this night a view of your ways. Behold 
    them, how unequal they are to what God has done for you, and what you 
    yourselves have done. And sure I am, you will see your hearts and lives a 
    mass of monstrous deformities, which will be the way to true humiliation, 
    which will prepare you for a communion day. Amen.</p>
