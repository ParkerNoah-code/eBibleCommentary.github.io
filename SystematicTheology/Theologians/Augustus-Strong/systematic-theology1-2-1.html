        <h2>I. Sources of Theology.</h2>
        <p>
          God himself, in the last analysis, must be the only source of
          knowledge with regard to his own being and relations. Theology is
          therefore a summary and explanation of the content of God&#x27;s
          self-revelations. These are, first, the revelation of God in nature;
          secondly and supremely, the revelation of God in the Scriptures.

          Ambrose: “To whom shall I give greater credit concerning God than to
          God himself?”Von Baader: “To know God without God is impossible; there
          is no knowledge without him who is the prime source of knowledge.” C.
          A. Briggs, Whither, 8—“God reveals truth in several spheres: in
          universal nature, in the constitution of mankind, in the history of
          our race, in the Sacred Scriptures, but above all in the person of
          Jesus Christ our Lord.” F. H. Johnson, What is Reality? 399—“The
          teacher intervenes when needed. Revelation helps reason and
          conscience, but is not a substitute for them. But Catholicism affirms
          this substitution for the church, and Protestantism for the Bible. The
          Bible, like nature, gives many free gifts, but more in the germ.
          Growing ethical ideals must interpret the Bible.” A. J. F. Behrends:
          “The Bible is only a telescope, not the eye which sees, nor the stars
          which the telescope brings to view. It is your business and mine to
          see the stars with our own eyes.” Schurman, Agnosticism, 178—“The
          Bible is a glass through which to see the living God. But it is
          useless when you put your eyes out.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We can know God only so far as he has revealed himself. The immanent
          God is known, but the transcendent God we do not know any more than we
          know the side of the moon that is turned away from us. A. H. Strong,
          Christ in Creation, 118—“The word ‘authority’ is derived from auctor,
          augeo, ‘to add.’ Authority adds something to the truth communicated.
          The thing added is the personal element of witness. This is needed
          wherever there is ignorance which cannot be removed by our own effort,
          or unwillingness which results from our own sin. In religion I need to
          add to my own knowledge that which God imparts. Reason, conscience,
          church, Scripture, are all delegated and subordinate authorities; the
          only original and supreme authority is God himself, or Christ, who is
          only God revealed and made comprehensible by us.” Gore, Incarnation,
          181—“All legitimate authority represents the reason of God, educating
          the reason of man and communicating itself to it.... Man is made in
          God&#x27;s image: he is, in his fundamental capacity, a son of God,
          and he becomes so in fact, and fully, through union with Christ.
          Therefore in the truth of God, as Christ presents it to him, he can
          recognize his own better reason,—to use Plato&#x27;s beautiful
          expression, he can salute it by force of instinct as something akin to
          himself, before he can give intellectual account of it.”

          Balfour, Foundations of Belief, 332-337, holds that there is no such
          thing as unassisted reason, and that, even if there were, natural
          religion is not one of its products. Behind all evolution of our own
          reason, he says, stands the Supreme Reason. “Conscience, ethical
          ideals, capacity for admiration, sympathy, repentance, righteous
          indignation, as well as our delight in beauty and truth, are all
          derived from God.” Kaftan, in Am. Jour. Theology, 1900; 718, 719,
          maintains that there is no other principle for dogmatics than Holy
          Scripture. Yet he holds that knowledge never comes directly from
          Scripture, but from faith. The order is not: Scripture, doctrine,
          faith; but rather, Scripture, faith, doctrine. Scripture is no more a
          direct authority than is the church. Revelation is addressed to the
          whole man, that is, to the will of the man, and it claims obedience
          from him. Since all Christian knowledge is mediated through faith, it
          rests on obedience to the authority of revelation, and revelation is
          self-manifestation on the part of God. Kaftan should have recognized
          more fully that not simply Scripture, but all knowable truth, is a
          revelation from God, and that Christ is “the light which lighteth
          every man” (John 1:9). Revelation is an organic whole, which begins in
          nature, but finds its climax and key in the historical Christ whom
          Scripture presents to us. See H. C. Minton&#x27;s review of
          Martineau&#x27;s Seat of Authority, in Presb. and Ref. Rev., Apr.
          1900:203 sq.
