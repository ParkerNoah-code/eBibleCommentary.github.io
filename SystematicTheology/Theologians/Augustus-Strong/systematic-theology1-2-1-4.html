        <h2>4. Scripture and Romanism.</h2>
        <p>
          While the history of doctrine, as showing the progressive apprehension
          and unfolding by the church of the truth contained in nature and
          Scripture, is a subordinate source of theology, Protestantism
          recognizes the Bible as under Christ the primary and final authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Romanism, on the other hand, commits the two-fold error (a) Of making
          the church, and not the Scriptures, the immediate and sufficient
          source of religious knowledge; and (b) Of making the relation of the
          individual to Christ depend upon his relation to the church, instead
          of making his relation to the church depend upon, follow, and express
          his relation to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Roman Catholicism there is a mystical element. The Scriptures are
          not the complete or final standard of belief and practice. God gives
          to the world from time to time, through popes and councils, new
          communications of truth. Cyprian: “He who has not the church for his
          mother, has not God for his Father.” Augustine: “I would not believe
          the Scripture, unless the authority of the church also influenced
          me.”Francis of Assisi and Ignatius Loyola both represented the truly
          obedient person as one dead, moving only as moved by his superior; the
          true Christian has no life of his own, but is the blind instrument of
          the church. John Henry Newman, Tracts, Theol. and Eccl., 287—“The
          Christian dogmas were in the church from the time of the
          apostles,—they were ever in their substance what they are now.” But
          this is demonstrably untrue of the immaculate conception of the Virgin
          Mary; of the treasury of merits to be distributed in indulgences; of
          the infallibility of the pope (see Gore, Incarnation, 186). In place
          of the true doctrine, “Ubi Spiritus, ibi ecclesia,” Romanism
          substitutes her maxim, “Ubi ecclesia, ibi Spiritus.” Luther saw in
          this the principle of mysticism, when he said: “Papatus est merus
          enthusiasmus.” See Hodge, Syst. Theol., 1:61-69.
        </p>
        <p>
          In reply to the Romanist argument that the church was before the
          Bible, and that the same body that gave the truth at the first can
          make additions to that truth, we say that the unwritten word was
          before the church and made the church possible. The word of God
          existed before it was written down, and by that word the first
          disciples as well as the latest were begotten (1 Pet. 1:23—“begotten
          again ... through the word of God”). The grain of truth in Roman
          Catholic doctrine is expressed in 1 Tim. 3:15—“the church of the
          living God, the pillar and ground of the truth” = the church is
          God&#x27;s appointed proclaimer of truth; cf. Phil. 2:16—“holding
          forth the word of life.” But the church can proclaim the truth, only
          as it is built upon the truth. So we may say that the American
          Republic is the pillar and ground of liberty in the world; but this is
          true only so far as the Republic is built upon the principle of
          liberty as its foundation. When the Romanist asks: “Where was your
          church before Luther?” the Protestant may reply: “Where yours is not
          now—in the word of God. Where was your face before it was washed?
          Where was the fine flour before the wheat went to the mill?” Lady Jane
          Grey, three days before her execution, February 12, 1554, said: “I
          ground my faith on God&#x27;s word, and not upon the church; for, if
          the church be a good church, the faith of the church must be tried by
          God&#x27;s word, and not God&#x27;s word by the church, nor yet my
          faith.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Roman church would keep men in perpetual childhood—coming to her
          for truth instead of going directly to the Bible; “like the foolish
          mother who keeps her boy pining in the house lest he stub his toe, and
          would love best to have him remain a babe forever, that she might
          mother him still.” Martensen, Christian Dogmatics, 30—“Romanism is so
          busy in building up a system of guarantees, that she forgets the truth
          of Christ which she would guarantee.” George Herbert: “What
          wretchedness can give him any room, Whose house is foul while he
          adores his broom!” It is a semi-parasitic doctrine of safety without
          intelligence or spirituality. Romanism says: “Man for the
          machine!”Protestantism: “The machine for man!” Catholicism strangles,
          Protestantism restores, individuality. Yet the Romanist principle
          sometimes appears in so-called Protestant churches. The Catechism
          published by the League of the Holy Cross, in the Anglican Church,
          contains the following: “It is to the priest only that the child must
          acknowledge his sins, if he desires that God should forgive him. Do
          you know why? It is because God, when on earth, gave to his priests
          and to them alone the power of forgiving sins. Go to the priest, who
          is the doctor of your soul, and who cures you in the name of God.” But
          this contradicts John 10:7—where Christ says “I am the door”; and 1
          Cor. 3:11—“other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid,
          which is Jesus Christ” = Salvation is attained by immediate access to
          Christ, and there is no door between the soul and him. See Dorner,
          Gesch. prot. Theol., 227; Schleiermacher, Glaubenslehre, 1:24;
          Robinson, in Mad. Av. Lectures, 387; Fisher, Nat. and Method of
          Revelation, 10; Watkins, Bampton Lect. for 1890:149; Drummond, Nat.
          Law in Spir. World, 327.
