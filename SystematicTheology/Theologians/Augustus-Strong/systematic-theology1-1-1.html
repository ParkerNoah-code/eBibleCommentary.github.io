        <h2>I. Definition of Theology.</h2>
        <p>
          Theology is the science of God and of the relations between God and
          the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the word “theology” is sometimes employed in dogmatic writings
          to designate that single department of the science which treats of the
          divine nature and attributes, prevailing usage, since Abelard (A. D.
          1079-1142) entitled his general treatise “Theologia Christiana,” has
          included under that term the whole range of Christian doctrine.
          Theology, therefore, gives account, not only of God, but of those
          relations between God and the universe in view of which we speak of
          Creation, Providence and Redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          John the Evangelist is called by the Fathers “the theologian,” because
          he most fully treats of the internal relations of the persons of the
          Trinity. Gregory Nazianzen (328) received this designation because he
          defended the deity of Christ against the Arians. For a modern instance
          of this use of the term “theology” in the narrow sense, see the title
          of Dr. Hodge&#x27;s first volume: “Systematic Theology, Vol. I:
          Theology.”But theology is not simply “the science of God,” nor even
          “the science of God and man.” It also gives account of the relations
          between God and the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the universe were God, theology would be the only science. Since
          the universe is but a manifestation of God and is distinct from God,
          there are sciences of nature and of mind. Theology is “the science of
          the sciences,” not in the sense of including all these sciences, but
          in the sense of using their results and of showing their underlying
          ground; (see Wardlaw, Theology, 1:1, 2). Physical science is not a
          part of theology. As a mere physicist, Humboldt did not need to
          mention the name of God in his “Cosmos” (but see Cosmos, 2:418, where
          Humboldt says: “Psalm 104 presents an image of the whole Cosmos”).
          Bishop of Carlisle: “Science is atheous, and therefore cannot be
          atheistic.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Only when we consider the relations of finite things to God, does the
          study of them furnish material for theology. Anthropology is a part of
          theology, because man&#x27;s nature is the work of God and because
          God&#x27;s dealings with man throw light upon the character of God.
          God is known through his works and his activities. Theology therefore
          gives account of these works and activities so far as they come within
          our knowledge. All other sciences require theology for their complete
          explanation. Proudhon: “If you go very deeply into politics, you are
          sure to get into theology.” On the definition of theology, see
          Luthardt, Compendium der Dogmatik, 1:2; Blunt, Dict. Doct. and Hist.
          Theol., art.: Theology; H. B. Smith, Introd. to Christ. Theol., 44;
          cf. Aristotle, Metaph., 10, 7, 4; 11, 6, 4; and Lactantius, De Ira
          Dei, 11.
