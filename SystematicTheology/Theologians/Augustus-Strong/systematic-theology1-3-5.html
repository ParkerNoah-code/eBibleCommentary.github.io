          An attempt has been made, in the list of text-books given above, to
          put first in each class the book best worth purchasing by the average
          theological student, and to arrange the books that follow this first
          one in the order of their value. German books, however, when they are
          not yet accessible in an English translation, are put last, simply
          because they are less likely to be used as books of reference by the
          average student.
