        <h2>1. The existence of a God.</h2>
        <p>
          In the existence of a God who has relations to the universe.—It has
          been objected, indeed, that since God and these relations are objects
          apprehended only by faith, they are not proper objects of knowledge or
          subjects for science. We reply:
        </p>
        <p>
          A. Faith is knowledge, and a higher sort of knowledge.—Physical
          science also rests upon faith—faith in our own existence, in the
          existence of a world objective and external to us, and in the
          existence of other persons than ourselves; faith in our primitive
          convictions, such as space, time, cause, substance, design, right;
          faith in the trustworthiness of our faculties and in the testimony of
          our fellow men. But physical science is not thereby invalidated,
          because this faith, though unlike sense-perception or logical
          demonstration, is yet a cognitive act of the reason, and may be
          defined as certitude with respect to matters in which verification is
          unattainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objection to theology thus mentioned and answered is expressed in
          the words of Sir William Hamilton, Metaphysics, 44,
          531—“Faith—belief—is the organ by which we apprehend what is beyond
          our knowledge.” But science is knowledge, and what is beyond our
          knowledge cannot be matter for science. Pres. E. G. Robinson says
          well, that knowledge and faith cannot be severed from one another,
          like bulkheads in a ship, the first of which may be crushed in, while
          the second still keeps the vessel afloat. The mind is one,—“it cannot
          be cut in two with a hatchet.” Faith is not antithetical to
          knowledge,—it is rather a larger and more fundamental sort of
          knowledge. It is never opposed to reason, but only to sight. Tennyson
          was wrong when he wrote: “We have but faith: we cannot know; For
          knowledge is of things we see” (In Memoriam, Introduction). This would
          make sensuous phenomena the only objects of knowledge. Faith in
          supersensible realities, on the contrary, is the highest exercise of
          reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sir William Hamilton consistently declares that the highest
          achievement of science is the erection of an altar “To the Unknown
          God.” This, however, is not the representation of Scripture. Cf. John
          17:3—“this is life eternal, that they should know thee, the only true
          God”; and Jer. 9:24—“let him that glorieth glory in that he hath
          understanding and knoweth me.” For criticism of Hamilton, see H. B.
          Smith, Faith and Philosophy, 297-336. Fichte: “We are born in faith.”
          Even Goethe called himself a believer in the five senses. Balfour,
          Defence of Philosophic Doubt, 277-295, shows that intuitive beliefs in
          space, time, cause, substance, right, are presupposed in the
          acquisition of all other knowledge. Dove, Logic of the Christian
          Faith, 14—“If theology is to be overthrown because it starts from some
          primary terms and propositions, then all other sciences are overthrown
          with it.” Mozley, Miracles, defines faith as “unverified reason.” See
          A. H. Strong, Philosophy and Religion, 19-30.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. Faith is a knowledge conditioned by holy affection.—The faith which
          apprehends God&#x27;s being and working is not opinion or imagination.
          It is certitude with regard to spiritual realities, upon the testimony
          of our rational nature and upon the testimony of God. Its only
          peculiarity as a cognitive act of the reason is that it is conditioned
          by holy affection. As the science of æsthetics is a product of reason
          as including a power of recognizing beauty practically inseparable
          from a love for beauty, and as the science of ethics is a product of
          reason as including a power of recognizing the morally right
          practically inseparable from a love for the morally right, so the
          science of theology is a product of reason, but of reason as including
          a power of recognizing God which is practically inseparable from a
          love for God.
        </p>
        <p>
          We here use the term “reason” to signify the mind&#x27;s whole power
          of knowing. Reason in this sense includes states of the sensibility,
          so far as they are indispensable to knowledge. We cannot know an
          orange by the eye alone; to the understanding of it, taste is as
          necessary as sight. The mathematics of sound cannot give us an
          understanding of music; we need also a musical ear. Logic alone cannot
          demonstrate the beauty of a sunset, or of a noble character; love for
          the beautiful and the right precedes knowledge of the beautiful and
          the right. Ullman draws attention to the derivation of sapientia,
          wisdom, from sapĕre, to taste. So we cannot know God by intellect
          alone; the heart must go with the intellect to make knowledge of
          divine things possible. “Human things,” said Pascal, “need only to be
          known, in order to be loved; but divine things must first be loved, in
          order to be known.” “This [religious] faith of the intellect,” said
          Kant, “is founded on the assumption of moral tempers.” If one were
          utterly indifferent to moral laws, the philosopher continues, even
          then religious truths “would be supported by strong arguments from
          analogy, but not by such as an obstinate, sceptical heart might not
          overcome.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith, then, is the highest knowledge, because it is the act of the
          integral soul, the insight, not of one eye alone, but of the two eyes
          of the mind, intellect and love to God. With one eye we can see an
          object as flat, but, if we wish to see around it and get the
          stereoptic effect, we must use both eyes. It is not the theologian,
          but the undevout astronomer, whose science is one-eyed and therefore
          incomplete. The errors of the rationalist are errors of defective
          vision. Intellect has been divorced from heart, that is, from a right
          disposition, right affections, right purpose in life. Intellect says:
          “I cannot know God”; and intellect is right. What intellect says, the
          Scripture also says: 1 Cor. 2:14—“the natural man receiveth not the
          things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he
          cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged”; 1:21—“in the
          wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scripture on the other hand declares that “by faith we know” (Heb.
          11:3). By “heart”the Scripture means simply the governing disposition,
          or the sensibility + the will; and it intimates that the heart is an
          organ of knowledge: Ex. 35:25—“the women that were wise-hearted”; Ps.
          34:8—“O taste and see that Jehovah is good” = a right taste precedes
          correct sight; Jer. 24:7—“I will give them a heart to know me”; Mat.
          5:8—“Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God”; Luke
          24:25—“slow of heart to believe”; John 7:17—“If any man willeth to do
          his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or
          whether I speak from myself”; Eph. 1:18—“having the eyes of your heart
          enlightened, that ye may know”; 1 John 4:7, 8—“Every one that loveth
          is begotten of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not
          God.” See Frank, Christian Certainty, 303-324; Clarke, Christ. Theol.,
          362; Illingworth, Div. and Hum. Personality, 114-137; R. T. Smith,
          Man&#x27;s Knowledge of Man and of God, 6; Fisher, Nat. and Method of
          Rev., 6; William James, The Will to Believe, 1-31; Geo. T. Ladd, on
          Lotze&#x27;s view that love is essential to the knowledge of God, in
          New World, Sept. 1895:401-406; Gunsaulus, Transfig. of Christ, 14, 15.

          C. Faith, therefore, can furnish, and only faith can furnish, fit and
          sufficient material for a scientific theology.—As an operation of
          man&#x27;s higher rational nature, though distinct from ocular vision
          or from reasoning, faith is not only a kind, but the highest kind, of
          knowing. It gives us understanding of realities which to sense alone
          are inaccessible, namely, God&#x27;s existence, and some at least of
          the relations between God and his creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philippi, Glaubenslehre, 1:50, follows Gerhard in making faith the
          joint act of intellect and will. Hopkins, Outline Study of Man, 77,
          78, speaks not only of “the æsthetic reason” but of “the moral
          reason.” Murphy, Scientific Bases of Faith, 91, 109, 145, 191—“Faith
          is the certitude concerning matter in which verification is
          unattainable.” Emerson, Essays, 2:96—“Belief consists in accepting the
          affirmations of the soul—unbelief in rejecting them.” Morell, Philos.
          of Religion, 38, 52, 53, quotes Coleridge: “Faith consists in the
          synthesis of the reason and of the individual will, ... and by virtue
          of the former (that is, reason), faith must be a light, a form of
          knowing, a beholding of truth.” Faith, then, is not to be pictured as
          a blind girl clinging to a cross—faith is not blind—“Else the cross
          may just as well be a crucifix or an image of Gaudama.” “Blind
          unbelief,” not blind faith, “is sure to err, And scan his works in
          vain.” As in conscience we recognize an invisible authority, and know
          the truth just in proportion to our willingness to “do the truth,” so
          in religion only holiness can understand holiness, and only love can
          understand love (cf. John 3:21—“he that doeth the truth cometh to the
          light”).
        </p>
        <p>
          If a right state of heart be indispensable to faith and so to the
          knowledge of God, can there be any “theologia irregenitorum,” or
          theology of the unregenerate? Yes, we answer; just as the blind man
          can have a science of optics. The testimony of others gives it claims
          upon him; the dim light penetrating the obscuring membrane
          corroborates this testimony. The unregenerate man can know God as
          power and justice, and can fear him. But this is not a knowledge of
          God&#x27;s inmost character; it furnishes some material for a
          defective and ill-proportioned theology; but it does not furnish fit
          or sufficient material for a correct theology. As, in order to make
          his science of optics satisfactory and complete, the blind man must
          have the cataract removed from his eyes by some competent oculist, so,
          in order to any complete or satisfactory theology, the veil must be
          taken away from the heart by God himself (cf. 2 Cor. 3:15, 16—“a veil
          lieth upon their heart. But whensoever it [marg. ‘a man’] shall turn
          to the Lord, the veil is taken away”).
        </p>
        <p>
          Our doctrine that faith is knowledge and the highest knowledge is to
          be distinguished from that of Ritschl, whose theology is an appeal to
          the heart to the exclusion of the head—to fiducia without notitia. But
          fiducia includes notitia, else it is blind, irrational, and
          unscientific. Robert Browning, in like manner, fell into a deep
          speculative error, when, in order to substantiate his optimistic
          faith, he stigmatized human knowledge as merely apparent. The appeal
          of both Ritschl and Browning from the head to the heart should rather
          be an appeal from the narrower knowledge of the mere intellect to the
          larger knowledge conditioned upon right affection. See A. H. Strong,
          The Great Poets and their Theology, 441. On Ritschl&#x27;s postulates,
          see Stearns, Evidence of Christian Experience, 274-280, and
          Pfleiderer, Die Ritschl&#x27;sche Theologie. On the relation of love
          and will to knowledge, see Kaftan, in Am. Jour. Theology, 1900:717;
