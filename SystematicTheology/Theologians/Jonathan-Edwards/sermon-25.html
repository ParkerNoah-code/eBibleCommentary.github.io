        <p class="title">Romans 3:19, “That every mouth may be stopped…”</p>
        <p>
          The main subject of the doctrinal part of this epistle, is the free
          grace of God in the salvation of men by Christ Jesus; especially as it
          appears in the doctrine of justification by faith alone. And the more
          clearly to evince this doctrine, and show the reason of it, the
          apostle, in the first place, establishes that point, that no flesh
          living can be justified by the deeds of the law. And to prove it, he
          is very large and particular in showing, that all mankind, not only
          the Gentiles, but Jews, are under sin, and so under the condemnation
          of the law; which is what he insists upon from the beginning of the
          epistle to this place. He first begins with the Gentiles; and in the
          first chapter shows that they are under sin, by setting forth the
          exceeding corruptions and horrid wickedness that overspread the
          Gentile world: and then through the second chapter, and the former
          part of this third chapter, to the text and following verse, he shows
          the same of the Jews, that they also are in the same circumstances
          with the Gentiles in this regard. They had a high thought of
          themselves, because they were God’s covenant people, and circumcised,
          and the children of Abraham. They despised the Gentiles as polluted,
          condemned, and accursed; but looked on themselves, on account of their
          external privileges, and ceremonial and moral righteousness, as a pure
          and holy people, and the children of God; as the apostle observes in
          the second chapter. It was therefore strange doctrine to them, that
          they also were unclean and guilty in God’s sight, and under the
          condemnation and curse of the law. The apostle does therefore, on
          account of their strong prejudices against such doctrine, the more
          particularly insists upon it, and shows that they are no better than
          the Gentiles; and as in the 9th verse of this chapter, “What then? Are
          we better than they? No, in no wise; for we have before proved both
          Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin.” And, to convince them
          of it, he then produces certain passages out of their own law, or the
          Old Testament, (to whose authority they pretend a great regard,) from
          the ninth verse to our text. And it may be observed, that the apostle,
          first, cites certain passages to prove that all mankind are corrupt,
          (verses 10-12.) “As it is written, there is none righteous, no not
          one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
          after God: They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
          unprofitable, there is none that doeth good, no not one.” Secondly,
          the passages he cites next, are to prove, that not only all are
          corrupt, but each one wholly corrupt, as it were all over unclean,
          from the crown of the head to the soles of his feet; and therefore
          several particular parts of the body are mentioned, the throat, the
          tongue, the lips, the mouth, the feet, (verses 13-15.) “Their throat
          is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the
          poison of asps is under their lips; whose mouth is full of cursing and
          bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood.” And, Thirdly, he
          quotes other passages to show, that each one is not only all over
          corrupt, but corrupt to a desperate degree, by affirming the most
          pernicious tendency of their wickedness; “Destruction and misery are
          in their ways.” And then by denying all goodness or godliness in them;
          “And the way of peace have they not known: There is no fear of God
          before their eyes.” And then, lest the Jews should think these
          passages of their law do not concern them, and only the Gentiles are
          intended in them, the apostle shows in the text, not only that they
          are not exempt, but that they especially must be understood: “Now we
          know that whatsoever things the law saith, it saith to them who are
          under the law.” By those that are under the law is meant the Jews; and
          the Gentiles by those that are without law; as appears by the 12th
          verse of the preceding chapter. There is a special reason to
          understand the law, as speaking to and of them, to whom it was
          immediately given. And therefore the Jews would be unreasonable in
          exempting themselves. And if we examine the places of the Old
          Testament whence these passages are taken, we shall see plainly that
          special respect is had to the wickedness of the people of that nation,
          in every one of them. So that the law shuts all up in universal and
          desperate wickedness, that every mouth may be stopped; the mouths of
          the Jews, as well as of the Gentiles, notwithstanding all those
          privileges by which they were distinguished from the Gentiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The things that the law says, are sufficient to stop the mouths of all
          mankind, in two respects.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. To stop them from boasting of their righteousness, as the Jews were
          wont to do; as the apostle observes in the 23rd verse of the preceding
          chapter.- That the apostle has respect to stopping their mouths in
          this respect, appears by the 27th verse of the context, “Where is
          boasting then? It is excluded.” The law stops our mouths from making
          any plea for life, or the favor of God, or any positive good, from our
          own righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. To stop them from making any excuse for ourselves, or objection
          against the execution of the sentence of the law, or the infliction of
          the punishment that it threatens. That it is intended, appears by the
          words immediately following, “That all the world may become guilty
          before God.” That is, that they may appear to be guilty, and stand
          convicted before God, and justly liable to the condemnation of his
          law, as guilty of death, according to the Jewish way of speaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus the apostle proves, that no flesh can be justified in God’s
          sight by the deeds of the law; as he draws the conclusion in the
          following verse; and so prepares the way for establishing of the great
          doctrine of justification by faith alone, which he proceeds to do in
          the following part of the chapter, and of the epistle.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          “It is just with God eternally to cast off and destroy sinners.”- For
          this is the punishment which the law condemns to- The truth of this
          doctrine may appear by the joint consideration of two things, viz.
          Man’s sinfulness, and God’s sovereignty.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. It appears from the consideration of man’s sinfulness. And that
          whether we consider the infinitely evil nature of all sin, or how much
          sin men are guilty of.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. If we consider the infinite evil and heinousness of sin in general,
          it is not unjust in God to inflict what punishment is deserved;
          because the very notion of deserving any punishment is, that it may be
          justly inflicted. A deserved punishment and a just punishment are the
          same thing. To say that one deserves such a punishment, and yet to say
          that he does not justly deserve it, is a contradiction; and if he
          justly deserves it, then it may be justly inflicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every crime or fault deserves a greater or less punishment, in
          proportion as the crime itself is greater or less. If any fault
          deserves punishment, then so much the greater the fault, so much the
          greater is the punishment deserved. The faulty nature of any thing is
          the formal ground and reason of its desert of punishment; and
          therefore the more any thing hath of this nature, the more punishment
          it deserves. And therefore the terribleness of the degree of
          punishment, let it be never be so terrible, is no argument against the
          justice of it, if the proportion does but hold between the heinousness
          of the crime and the dreadfulness of the punishment; so that if there
          be any such thing as a fault infinitely heinous, it will follow that
          it is just to inflict a punishment for it that is infinitely dreadful.
        </p>
        <p>
          A crime is more or less heinous, according as we are under greater or
          less obligations to the contrary. This is self-evident; because it is
          herein that the criminalness or faultiness of any thing consists, that
          it is contrary to what we are obliged or bound to, or what ought to be
          in us. So the faultiness of one being hating another, is in proportion
          to his obligation to love him. The crime of one being despising and
          casting contempt on another, is proportionably more or less heinous,
          as he was under greater or less obligations to honor him. The fault of
          disobeying another, is greater or less, as any one is under greater or
          less obligations to obey him. And therefore if there be any being that
          we are under infinite obligations to love, and honor, and obey, the
          contrary towards him must be infinitely faulty.<br />
          Our obligation to love, honor, and obey any being, is in proportion to
          his loveliness, honorableness, and authority; for that is the very
          meaning of the words. When we say any one is very lovely, it is the
          same as to say, that he is one very much to be loved. Or if we say
          such a one is more honorable than another, the meaning of the words
          is, that he is one that we are more obliged to honor. If we say any
          one has great authority over us, it is the same as to say, that he has
          great right to our subjection and obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          But God is a being infinitely lovely, because he hath infinite
          excellency and beauty. To have infinite excellency and beauty, is the
          same thing as to have infinite loveliness. He is a being of infinite
          greatness, majesty, and glory; and therefore he is infinitely
          honorable. He is infinitely exalted above the greatest potentates of
          the earth, and highest angels in heaven; and therefore he is
          infinitely more honorable than they. His authority over us is
          infinite; and the ground of his right to our obedience is infinitely
          strong; for he is infinitely worthy to be obeyed himself, and we have
          an absolute, universal, and infinite dependence upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that sin against God, being a violation of infinite obligations,
          must be a crime infinitely heinous, and so deserving of infinite
          punishment.- Nothing is more agreeable to the common sense of mankind,
          than that sins committed against any one, must be proportionably
          heinous to the dignity of the being offended and abused; as it is also
          agreeable to the word of God, I Samuel 2:25. “If one man sin against
          another, the judge shall judge him;” (i.e. shall judge him, and
          inflict a finite punishment, such as finite judges can inflict;) “but
          if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him?” This was
          the aggravation of sin that made Joseph afraid of it. Genesis 39:9.
          “How shall I commit this great wickedness, and sin against God?” This
          was the aggravation of David’s sin, in comparison of which he esteemed
          all others as nothing, because they were infinitely exceeded by it.
          Psalm 51:4. “Against thee, thee only have I sinned.”-The eternity of
          the punishment of ungodly men renders it infinite: and it renders it
          no more than infinite; and therefore renders no more than
          proportionable to the heinousness of what they are guilty of.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there be any evil or faultiness in sin against God, there is
          certainly infinite evil: for if it be any fault at all, it has an
          infinite aggravation, viz. that it is against an infinite object. If
          it be ever so small upon other accounts, yet if it be any thing, it
          has one infinite dimension; and so is an infinite evil. Which may be
          illustrated by this: if we suppose a thing to have infinite length,
          but no breadth and thickness, (a mere mathematical line,) it is
          nothing: but if it have any breadth and thickness, though never so
          small, and infinite length, the quantity of it is infinite; it exceeds
          the quantity of any thing, however broad, thick, and long, wherein
          these dimensions are all finite.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that the objections made against the infinite punishment of sin,
          from the necessity, or rather previous certainty, of the futurition of
          sin, arising from the unavoidable original corruption of nature, if
          they argue any thing, argue against any faultiness at all: for if this
          necessity or certainty leaves any evil at all in sin, that fault must
          be infinite by reason of the infinite object.
        </p>
        <p>
          But every such objector as would argue from hence, that there is no
          fault at all in sin, confutes himself, and shows his own insincerity
          in his objection. For at the same time that he objects, that men’s
          acts are necessary, and that this kind of necessity is inconsistent
          with faultiness in the act, his own practice shows that he does not
          believe what he objects to be true: otherwise why does he at all blame
          men? Or why are such persons at all displeased with men, for abusive,
          injurious, and ungrateful acts towards them? Whatever they pretend, by
          this they show that indeed they do believe that there is no necessity
          in men’s acts that is inconsistent with blame. And if their objection
          be this, that this previous certainty is by God’s own ordering, and
          that where God orders an antecedent certainty of acts, he transfers
          all the fault from the actor on himself; their practice shows, that at
          the same time they do not believe this, but fully believe the
          contrary: for when they are abused by men, they are displeased with
          men, and not with God only.
        </p>
        <p>
          The light of nature teaches all mankind, that when an injury is
          voluntary, it is faulty, without any consideration of what there might
          be previously to determine the futurition of that evil act of the
          will. And it really teaches this as much to those that object and
          cavil most as to others; as their universal practice shows. By which
          it appears, that such objections are insincere and perverse. Men will
          mention others’ corrupt nature when they are injured, as a thing that
          aggravates their crime, and that wherein their faultiness partly
          consists. How common is it for persons, when they look on themselves
          greatly injured by another, to inveigh against him, and aggravate his
          baseness, by saying, “He is a man of a most perverse spirit: he is
          naturally of a selfish, niggardly, or proud and haughty temper: he is
          one of a base and vile disposition.” And yet men’s natural and corrupt
          dispositions are mentioned as an excuse for them, with respect to
          their sins against God, as if they rendered them blameless.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That it is just with God eternally to cast off wicked men, may more
          abundantly appear, if we consider how much sin they are guilty of.
          From what has been already said, it appears, that if men were guilty
          of sin but in one particular, that is sufficient ground of their
          eternal rejection and condemnation. If they are sinners, that is
          enough. Merely this, might be sufficient to keep them from ever
          lifting up their heads, and cause them to smite on their breasts, with
          the publican that cried, “God be merciful to me a sinner.” But sinful
          men are full of sin; full of principles and acts of sin: their guilt
          is like great mountains, heaped one upon another, till the pile is
          grown up to heaven. They are totally corrupt, in every part, in all
          their faculties, and all the principles of their nature, their
          understandings, and wills; and in all their dispositions and
          affections. Their heads, their hearts, are totally depraved; all the
          members of their bodies are only instruments of sin; and all their
          senses, seeing, hearing, tasting, &amp;c. are only inlets and outlets
          of sin, channels of corruption. There is nothing but sin, no good at
          all. Romans. 7:18. “In me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good
          thing.” There is all manner of wickedness. There are the seeds of the
          greatest and blackest crimes. There are principles of all sorts of
          wickedness against men; and there is all wickedness against God. There
          is pride; there is enmity; there is contempt; there is quarreling;
          there is atheism; there is blasphemy. There are these things in
          exceeding strength; the heart is under the power of them, is sold
          under sin, and is a perfect slave to it. There is hard-heartedness,
          hardness greater than that of a rock, or an adamant-stone. There is
          obstinacy and perverseness, incorrigibleness and inflexibleness in
          sin, that will not be overcome by threatenings or promises, by
          awakenings or encouragements, by judgments or mercies, neither by that
          which is terrifying nor that which is winning. The very blood of God
          our Saviour will not win the heart of a wicked man.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there are actual wickednesses without number or measure. There are
          breaches of every command, in thought, word, and deed: a life full of
          sin; days and nights filled up with sin; mercies abused and frowns
          despised; mercy and justice, and all the divine perfections, trampled
          on; and the honor of each person in the Trinity trod in the dirt. Now
          if one sinful word or thought has so much evil in it, as to deserve
          eternal destruction, how do they deserve to be eternally cast off and
          destroyed, that are guilty of so much sin!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. If with man’s sinfulness, we consider God’s sovereignty, it may
          serve further to clear God’s justice in the eternal rejection and
          condemnation of sinners, from men’s cavils and objections. I shall not
          now pretend to determine precisely, what things are, and what things
          are not, proper acts and exercises of God’s holy sovereignty; but
          only, that God’s sovereignty extends to the following things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That such is God’s sovereign power and right, that he is originally
          under no obligation to keep men from sinning; but may in his
          providence permit and leave them to sin. He was not obliged to keep
          either angels or men from falling. It is unreasonable to suppose, that
          God should be obliged, if he makes a reasonable creature capable of
          knowing his will, and receiving a law from him, and being subject to
          his moral government, at the same time to make it impossible for him
          to sin, or break his law. For if God be obliged to this, it destroys
          all use of any commands, laws, promises, or threatenings, and the very
          notion of any moral government of God over those reasonable creatures.
          For to what purpose would it be, for God to give such and such laws,
          and declare his holy will to a creature, and annex promises and
          threatenings to move him to his duty, and make him careful to perform
          it, if the creature at the same time has this to think of, that God is
          obliged to make it impossible for him to break his laws? How can God’s
          threatenings move to care or watchfulness, when, at the same time, God
          is obliged to render it impossible that he should be exposed to the
          threatenings? Or, to what purpose is it for God to give a law at all?
          For according to this supposition, it is God, and not the creature,
          that is under the law. It is the lawgiver’s care, and not the
          subject’s, to see that his law is obeyed; and this care is what the
          lawgiver is absolutely obliged to! If God be obliged never to permit a
          creature to fall, there is an end of all divine laws, or government,
          or authority of God over the creature; there can be no manner of use
          of these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          God may permit sin, though the being of sin will certainly ensue on
          that permission: and so, by permission, he may dispose and order the
          event. If there were any such thing as chance, or mere contingence,
          and the very notion of it did not carry a gross absurdity, (as might
          easily be shown that it does,) it would have been very unfit that God
          should have left it to mere chance, whether man should fall or no. For
          chance, if there should be any such thing, is undesigning and blind.
          And certainly it is more fit that an event of so great importance, and
          that is attended with such an infinite train of great consequences,
          should be disposed and ordered by infinite wisdom, than that it should
          be left to blind chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be said, that God need not have interposed to render it
          impossible for man to sin, and yet not leave it to mere contingence or
          blind chance neither; but might have left it with man’s free will, to
          determine whether to sin or no: I answer, if God did leave it to man’s
          free will, without any sort of disposal, or ordering [or rather,
          adequate cause] in the case, whence it should be previously certain
          how that free will should determine, then still that first
          determination of the will must be merely contingent or by chance. It
          could not have any antecedent act of the will to determine it; for I
          speak now of the very first act of motion of the will, respecting the
          affair that may be looked upon as the prime ground and highest source
          of the event. To suppose this to be determined by a foregoing act is a
          contradiction. God’s disposing this determination of the will by his
          permission, does not at all infringe the liberty of the creature: it
          is in no respect any more inconsistent with liberty, than mere chance
          or contingence. For if the determination of the will be from blind,
          undesigning chance, it is no more from the agent himself, or from the
          will itself, than if we suppose, in the case, a wise, divine disposal
          by permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It was fit that it should be at the ordering of the divine wisdom
          and good pleasure, whether every particular man should stand for
          himself, or whether the first father of mankind should be appointed as
          the moral and federal head and representative of the rest. If God has
          not liberty in this matter to determine either of these two as he
          pleases, it must be because determining that the first father of men
          should represent the rest, and not that every one should stand for
          himself, is injurious to mankind. For if it be not injurious, how is
          it unjust? But it is not injurious to mankind; for there is nothing in
          the nature of the case itself, that makes it better that each man
          should stand for himself, than that all should be represented by their
          common father; as the least reflection or consideration will convince
          any one. And if there be nothing in the nature of the thing that makes
          the former better for mankind than the latter, then it will follow,
          that they are not hurt in God’s choosing and appointing the latter,
          rather than the former; or, which is the same thing, that it is not
          injurious to mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. When men are fallen, and become sinful, God by his sovereignty has
          a right to determine about their redemption as he pleases. He has a
          right to determine whether he will redeem any or not. He might, if he
          had pleased, have left all to perish, or might have redeemed all. Or,
          he may redeem some, and leave others; and if he doth so, he may take
          whom he pleases, and leave whom he pleases. To suppose that all have
          forfeited his favor, and deserved to perish, and to suppose that he
          may not leave any one individual of them to perish, implies a
          contradiction; because it supposes that such a one has a claim to
          God’s favor, and is not justly liable to perish; which is contrary to
          the supposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is meet that God should order all these things according to his own
          pleasure. By reason of his greatness and glory, by which he is
          infinitely above all, he is worthy to be sovereign, and that his
          pleasure should in all things take place. He is worthy that he should
          make himself his end, and that he should make nothing but his own
          wisdom his rule in pursuing that end, without asking leave or counsel
          of any, and without giving account of any of his matters. It is fit
          that he who is absolutely perfect, and infinitely wise, and the
          Fountain of all wisdom, should determine every thing [that he effects]
          by his own will, even things of the greatest importance. It is meet
          that he should be thus sovereign, because he is the first being, the
          eternal being, whence all other beings are. He is the Creator of all
          things; and all are absolutely and universally dependent on him; and
          therefore it is meet that he should act as the sovereign possessor of
          heaven and earth.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          In the improvement of this doctrine, I would chiefly direct myself to
          sinners who are afraid of damnation, in a use of conviction. This may
          be matter of conviction to you, that it would be just and righteous
          with God eternally to reject and destroy you. This is what you are in
          danger of. You who are a Christless sinner are a poor condemned
          creature: God’s wrath still abides upon you; and the sentence of
          condemnation lies upon you. You are in God’s hands, and it is
          uncertain what he will do with you. You are afraid what will become of
          you. You are afraid that it will be your portion to suffer eternal
          burnings; and your fears are not without grounds; you have reason to
          tremble every moment. But be you never so much afraid of it, let
          eternal damnation be never so dreadful, yet it is just. God may
          nevertheless do it, and be righteous, and holy, and glorious. Though
          eternal damnation be what you cannot bear, and how much soever your
          heart shrinks at the thought of it, yet God’s justice may be glorious
          in it. The dreadfulness of the thing on your part, and the greatness
          of your dread of it, do not render it the less righteous on God’s
          part. If you think otherwise, it is a sign that you do not see
          yourself, that you are not sensible what sin is, nor how much of it
          you have been guilty of. Therefore for your conviction, be directed,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, To look over your past life: inquire at the mouth of
          conscience, and hear what that has to testify concerning it. Consider
          what you are, what light you have had, and what means you have lived
          under: and yet how you have behaved yourself! What have those many
          days and nights you have lived been filled up with? How have those
          years that have rolled over your heads, one after another, been spent?
          What has the sun shone upon you for, from day to day, while you have
          improved his light to serve Satan by it? What has God kept your breath
          in your nostrils for, and given you meat and drink, that you have
          spent your life and strength, supported by them, in opposing God, and
          rebellion against him?
        </p>
        <p>
          How many sorts of wickedness have you not been guilty of! How manifold
          have been the abominations of your life! What profaneness and contempt
          of God has been exercised by you! How little regard have you had to
          the Scriptures, to the word preached, to sabbaths, and sacraments! How
          profanely have you talked, many of you, about those things that are
          holy! After what manner have many of you kept God’s holy day, not
          regarding the holiness of the time, not caring what you thought of in
          it! Yea, you have not only spent the time in worldly, vain, and
          unprofitable thoughts, but in immoral thoughts; pleasing yourself with
          the reflection on past acts of wickedness, and in contriving new acts.
          Have not you spent much holy time in gratifying your lusts in your
          imaginations; yea, not only holy time, but the very time of God’s
          public worship, when you have appeared in God’s more immediate
          presence? How have you not only attended to the worship, but have in
          the mean time been feasting your lusts, and wallowing yourself in
          abominable uncleanness! How many sabbaths have you spent, one after
          another, in a most wretched manner! Some of you not only in worldly
          and wicked thoughts, but also a very wicked outward behavior! When you
          on sabbath-days have got along with your wicked companions, how has
          holy time been treated among you! What kind of conversation has there
          been! Yea, how have some of you, by a very indecent carriage, openly
          dishonored and cast contempt on the sacred services of God’s house,
          and holy day! And what you have done some of you alone, what wicked
          practices there have been in secret, even in holy time, God and your
          own consciences know.
        </p>
        <p>
          And how have you behaved yourself in the time of family prayer! And
          what a trade have many of you made of absenting yourselves from the
          worship of the families you belong to, for the sake of vain company!
          And how have you continued in the neglect of secret prayer! Therein
          willfully living in a known sin, going abreast against as plain a
          command as any in the Bible! Have you not been one that has cast off
          fear, and restrained prayer before God?
        </p>
        <p>
          What wicked carriage have some of you been guilty of towards your
          parents! How far have you been from paying that honor to them which
          God has required! Have you not even harbored ill-will and malice
          towards them? And when they have displeased you, have wished evil to
          them? yea, and shown your vile spirit in your behavior? and it is well
          if you have not mocked them behind their backs; and, like the cursed
          Ham and Canaan, as it were, derided your parents’ nakedness instead of
          covering it, and hiding your eyes from it. Have not some of you often
          disobeyed your parents, yea, and refused to be subject to them? Is it
          not a wonder of mercy and forbearance, that the proverb has not before
          now been accomplished on you, Proverbs 30:17. “The eye that mocketh at
          his father, and refuseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley
          shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          What revenge and malice have you been guilty of towards your
          neighbors! How have you indulged this spirit of the devil, hating
          others, and wishing evil to them, rejoicing when evil befell them, and
          grieving at others’ prosperity, and lived in such a way for a long
          time! Have not some of you allowed a passionate furious spirit, and
          behaved yourselves in your anger more like wild beasts than like
          Christians?
        </p>
        <p>
          What covetousness has been in many of you! Such has been your
          inordinate love of the world, and care about the things of it, that it
          has taken up your heart; you have allowed no room for God and
          religion; you have minded the world more than your eternal salvation.
          For the vanities of the world you have neglected reading, praying and
          meditation; for the things of the world, you have broken the sabbath:
          for the world you have spent a great deal of your time in quarreling.
          For the world you have envied and hated your neighbor; for the world
          you have cast God, and Christ, and heaven, behind your back; for the
          world you have sold your own soul. You have as it were drowned your
          soul in worldly cares and desires; you have been a mere earth-worm,
          that is never in its element but when groveling and buried in the
          earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          How much of a spirit of pride has appeared in you, which is in a
          peculiar manner the spirit and condemnation of the devil! How have
          some of you vaunted yourselves in your apparel! others in their
          riches! others in their knowledge and abilities! How has it galled you
          to see others above you! How much has it gone against the grain for
          you to give others their due honor! And how have you shown your pride
          by setting up your wills and in opposing others, and stirring up and
          promoting division, and a party spirit in public affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          How sensual have you been! Are there not some here that have debased
          themselves below the dignity of human nature, by wallowing in sensual
          filthiness, as swine in the mire, or as filthy vermin feeding with
          delight on rotten carrion? What intemperance have some of you been
          guilty of! How much of your precious time have you spent at the
          tavern, and in drinking companies, when you ought to have been at home
          seeking God and your salvation in your families and closets!
        </p>
        <p>
          And what abominable lasciviousness have some of you been guilty of!
          How have you indulged yourself from day to day, and from night to
          night, in all manner of unclean imaginations! Has not your soul been
          filled with them, till it has become a hold of foul spirits, and a
          cage of every unclean and hateful bird? What foul-mouthed persons have
          some of you been, often in lewd and lascivious talk and unclean songs,
          wherein were things not fit to be spoken! And such company, where such
          conversation has been carried on, has been your delight. And with what
          unclean acts and practices have you defiled yourself! God and your own
          consciences know what abominable lasciviousness you have practiced in
          things not fit to be named, when you have been alone; when you ought
          to have been reading, or meditating, or on your knees before God in
          secret prayer. And how have you corrupted others, as well as polluted
          yourselves! What vile uncleanness have you practiced in company! What
          abominations have you been guilty of in the dark! Such as the apostle
          doubtless had respect to in Ephesians 5:12. “For it is a shame even to
          speak of those things that are done of them in secret.” Some of you
          have corrupted others, and done what in you lay to undo their souls,
          (if you have not actually done it;) and by your vile practices and
          example have made room for Satan, invited his presence, and
          established his interest, in the town where you have lived.<br />
          What lying have some of you been guilty of, especially in your
          childhood! And have not your heart and lips often disagreed since you
          came to riper years? What fraud, and deceit, and unfaithfulness, have
          many of you practiced in your own dealings with your neighbors, of
          which your own heart is conscious, if you have not been noted by
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          And how have some of you behaved yourselves in your family relations!
          How have you neglected your children’s souls! And not only so, but
          have corrupted their minds by your bad examples; and instead of
          training them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, have
          rather brought them up in the devil’s service!
        </p>
        <p>
          How have some of you attended that sacred ordinance of the Lord’s
          supper without any manner of serious preparation, and in a careless
          slighty frame of spirits, and chiefly to comply with custom! Have you
          not ventured to put the sacred symbols of the body and blood of Christ
          into your mouth, while at the same time you lived in ways of known
          sins, and intended no other than still to go on in the same wicked
          practices? And, it may be, have sat at the Lord’s table with rancor in
          your heart against some of your brethren that you have sat there with.
          You have come even to that holy feast of love among God’s children,
          with the leaven of malice and envy in your heart; and so have eaten
          and drank judgment to yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          What stupidity and sottishness has attended your course of wickedness:
          which has appeared in your obstinacy under awakening dispensations of
          God’s word and providence. And how have some of you backslidden after
          you have set out in religion, and quenched God’s Spirit after he had
          been striving with you! And what unsteadiness, and slothfulness, and
          long misimprovement of God’s strivings with you, have you been
          chargeable with!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, can you think when you have thus behaved yourself, that God is
          obliged to show you mercy? Are you not after all this ashamed to talk
          of its being hard with God to cast you off? Does it become one who has
          lived such a life to open his mouth to excuse himself, to object
          against God’s justice in his condemnation, or to complain of it as
          hard in God not to give him converting and pardoning grace, and make
          him his child, and bestow on him eternal life? Or to talk of his
          duties and great pains in religion, as if such performances were
          worthy to be accepted, and to draw God’s heart to such a creature? If
          this has been your manner, does it not show how little you have
          considered yourself, and how little a sense you have had of your own
          sinfulness?
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Be directed to consider, if God should eternally reject and
          destroy you, what an agreeableness and exact mutual answerableness
          there would be between God so dealing with you, and your spirit and
          behavior. There would not only be an equality, but a similitude. God
          declares, that his dealings with men shall be suitable to their
          disposition and practice. Psalm 18:25, 26. “With the merciful man,
          thou wilt show thyself merciful; with an upright man, thou wilt show
          thyself upright; with the pure, thou wilt show thyself pure; and with
          the froward, thou wilt show thyself froward.” How much soever you
          dread damnation, and are affrighted and concerned at the thoughts of
          it; yet if God should indeed eternally damn you, you would be met with
          but in your own way; you would be dealt with exactly according to your
          own dealing. Surely it is but fair that you should be made to buy in
          the same measure in which you sell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I would particularly show,- 1. That if God should eternally
          destroy you, it would be agreeable to your treatment of God. 2. That
          it would be agreeable to your treatment of Jesus Christ. 3. That it
          would be agreeable to your behavior towards your neighbors. 4. That it
          would be according to your own foolish behavior towards yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. If God should for ever cast you off, it would be exactly agreeable
          to your treatment of him. That you may be sensible of this, consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. You never have exercised the least degree of love to God; and
          therefore it would be agreeable to your treatment of him, if he should
          never express any love to you. When God converts and saves a sinner,
          it is a wonderful and unspeakable manifestation of divine love. When a
          poor lost soul is brought home to Christ, and has all his sins
          forgiven him, and is made a child of God, it will take up a whole
          eternity to express and declare the greatness of that love. And why
          should God be obliged to express such wonderful love to you, who never
          exercised the least degree of love to him in all your life? You never
          have loved God, who is infinitely glorious and lovely; and why then is
          God under obligation to love you, who are all over deformed and
          loathsome as a filthy worm, or rather a hateful viper? You have no
          benevolence in your heart towards God; you never rejoiced in God’s
          happiness; if he had been miserable, and that had been possible, you
          would have liked it as well as if he were happy; you would not have
          cared how miserable he was, nor mourned for it, any more than you now
          do for the devil’s being miserable. And why then should God be looked
          upon as obliged to take so much care for your happiness, as to do such
          great things for it, as he doth for those that are saved? Or why
          should God be called hard, in case he should not be careful to save
          you from misery? You care not what becomes of God’s glory; you are not
          distressed how much soever his honor seems to suffer in the world: and
          why should God care any more for your welfare? Has it not been so,
          that if you could but promote your private interest, and gratify your
          own lusts, you cared not how much the glory of God suffered? And why
          may not God advance his own glory in the ruin of your welfare, not
          caring how much your interest suffers by it? You never so much as
          stirred one step, sincerely making the glory of God your end, or
          acting from real respect to him: and why then is it hard if God doth
          not do such great things for you, as the changing of your nature,
          raising you from spiritual death to life, conquering the powers of
          darkness for you, translating you out of the kingdom of darkness into
          the kingdom of his dear Son, delivering you from eternal misery, and
          bestowing upon you eternal glory? You were not willing to deny
          yourself for God; you never cared to put yourself out of your way for
          Christ; whenever any thing cross or difficult came in your way, that
          the glory of God was concerned in, it has been your manner to shun it,
          and excuse yourself from it. You did not care to hurt yourself for
          Christ, whom you did not see worthy of it; and why then must it be
          looked upon as a hard and cruel thing, if Christ has not been pleased
          to spill his blood and be tormented to death for such a sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. You have slighted God; and why then may not God justly slight you?
          When sinners are sensible in some measure of their misery, they are
          ready to think it hard that God will take no notice of them; that he
          will see them in such a lamentable distressed condition, beholding
          their burdens and tears, and seem to slight it, and manifest no pity
          to them. Their souls they think are precious: it would be a dreadful
          thing if they should perish, and burn in hell for ever. They do not
          see through it, that God should make so light of their salvation. But
          then, ought they not to consider, that as their souls are precious, so
          is God’s honor precious? The honor of the infinite God, the great King
          of heaven and earth, is a thing of as great importance, (and surely
          may justly be so esteemed by God,) as the happiness of you, a poor
          little worm. But yet you have slighted that honor of God, and valued
          it no more than the dirt under your feet. You have been told that such
          and such things were contrary to the will of a holy God, and against
          his honor; but you cared not for that. God called upon you, and
          exhorted you to be more tender of his honor; but you went on without
          regarding him. Thus have you slighted God! And yet, is it hard that
          God should slight you? Are you more honorable than God, that he must
          be obliged to make much of you, how light soever you make of him and
          his glory?
        </p>
        <p>
          And you have not only slighted God in time past, but you slight him
          still. You indeed now make a pretence and show of honoring him in your
          prayers, and attendance on other external duties, and by sober
          countenance, and seeming devoutness in your words and behavior; but it
          if all mere dissembling. That downcast look and seeming reverence, is
          not from any honor you have to God in your heart, though you would
          have God take it so. You who have not believed in Christ, have not the
          least jot of honor to God; that show of it is merely forced, and what
          you are driven to by fear, like those mentioned in Psalm 66:3.
          “Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit
          themselves to thee.” In the original it is, “shall lie unto thee;”
          that is, yield feigned submission, and dissemble respect and honor to
          thee. There is a rod held over you that makes you seem to pay such
          respect to God. This religion and devotion, even the very appearance
          of it, would soon be gone, and all vanish away, if that were removed.
          Sometimes it may be you weep in your prayers, and in your hearing
          sermons, and hope God will take notice of it, and take it for some
          honor; but he sees it to be all hypocrisy. You weep for yourself; you
          are afraid of hell; and do you think that is worthy of God to take
          much notice of you, because you can cry when you are in danger of
          being damned; when at the same time you indeed care nothing for God’s
          honor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing you thus disregard so great a God, is it a heinous thing for
          God to slight you, a little, wretched, despicable creature; a worm, a
          mere nothing, and less than nothing; a vile insect, that has risen up
          in contempt against the Majesty of heaven and earth?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Why should God be looked upon as obliged to bestow salvation upon
          you, when you have been so ungrateful for the mercies he has bestowed
          upon you already? God has tried you with a great deal of kindness, and
          he never has sincerely been thanked by you for any of it. God has
          watched over you, and preserved you, and provided for you, and
          followed you with mercy all your days; and yet you have continued
          sinning against him. He has given you food and raiment, but you have
          improved both in the service of sin. He has preserved you while you
          slept; but when you arose, it was to return to the old trade of
          sinning. God, notwithstanding this ingratitude, has still continued
          his mercy; but his kindness has never won your heart, or brought you
          to a more grateful behavior towards him. It may be you have received
          many remarkable mercies, recoveries from sickness, or preservations of
          your life when exposed by accidents, when if you had died, you would
          have gone directly to hell; but you never had any true thankfulness
          for any of these mercies. God has kept you out of hell, and continued
          your day of grace, and the offers of salvation, so long a time; while
          you did not regard your own salvation so much as in secret to ask God
          for it. And now God has greatly added to his mercy to you, by giving
          you the strivings of his Spirit, whereby a most precious opportunity
          for your salvation is in your hands. But what thanks has God received
          for it? What kind of returns have you made for all this kindness? As
          God has multiplied mercies, so have you multiplied provocations.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet now are you ready to quarrel for mercy, and to find fault with
          God, not only that he does not bestow more mercy, but to contend with
          him, because he does not bestow infinite mercy upon you, heaven with
          all it contains, and even himself, for your eternal portion. What
          ideas have you of yourself, that you think God is obliged to do so
          much for you, though you treat him ever so ungratefully for his
          kindness wherewith you have been followed all the days of your life.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. You have voluntarily chosen to be with Satan in his enmity and
          opposition to God; how justly therefore might you be with him in his
          punishment! You did not choose to be on God’s side, but rather chose
          to side with the devil, and have obstinately continued in it, against
          God’s often repeated calls and counsels. You have chosen rather to
          hearken to Satan than to God, and would be with him in his work. You
          have given yourself up to him, to be subject to his power and
          government, in opposition to God; how justly therefore may God also
          give you up to him, and leave you in his power, to accomplish your
          ruin! Seeing you have yielded yourself to his will, to do as he would
          have you, surely God may leave you in his hands to execute his will
          upon you. If men will be with God’s enemy, and on his side, why is God
          obliged to redeem them out of his hands, when they have done his work?
          Doubtless you would be glad to serve the devil, and be God’s enemy
          while you live, and then to have God your friend, and deliver you from
          the devil, when you come to die. But will God be unjust if he deals
          otherwise by you? No, surely! It will be altogether and perfectly
          just, that you should have your portion with him with whom you have
          chosen to work; and that you should be in his possession to whose
          dominion you have yielded yourself; and if you cry to God for
          deliverance, he may most justly give you that answer. Judges 10:14.
          “Go to the gods which you have chosen.”
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Consider how often you have refused to hear God’s calls to you, and
          how just it would therefore be, if he should refuse to hear you when
          you call upon him. You are ready, it may be, to complain that you have
          often prayed, and earnestly begged of God to show you mercy, and yet
          have no answer of prayer: One says, I have been constant in prayer for
          so many years, and God has not heard me. Another says, I have done
          what I can; I have prayed as earnestly as I am able; I do not see how
          I can do more; and it will seem hard if after all I am denied. But do
          you consider how often God has called, and you have denied him? God
          has called earnestly, and for a long time; he has called and called
          again in his word, and in his providence, and you have refused. You
          was not uneasy for fear you should not show regard enough to his
          calls. You let him call as loud and as long as he would; for your
          part, you had no leisure to attend to what he said; you had other
          business to mind; you had these and those lusts to gratify and please,
          and worldly concerns to attend; you could not afford to stand
          considering of what God had to say to you. When the ministers of
          Christ have stood and pleaded with you, in his name, sabbath after
          sabbath, and have even spent their strength in it, how little was you
          moved! It did not alter you, but you went on still as you used to do;
          when you went away, you returned again to your sins, to your
          lasciviousness, to your vain mirth, to your covetousness, to your
          intemperance, and that has been the language of your heart and
          practice, Exodus 5:2. “Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice?”
          Was it no crime for you to refuse to hear when God called? And yet is
          it now very hard that God does not hear your earnest calls, and that
          though your calling on God be not from any respect to him, but merely
          from self-love? The devil would beg as earnestly as you, if he had any
          hope to get salvation by it, and a thousand times as earnestly, and
          yet be as much of a devil as he is now. Are your calls more worthy to
          be heard than God’s? Or is God more obliged to regard what you say to
          him, than you to regard his commands, counsels, and invitations to
          you? What can be more justice than this, Proverbs 1:24, &amp;c.
          “Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand,
          and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all my counsel, and
          would none of my reproof: I will also laugh at your calamity, I will
          mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as desolation, and
          your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish
          cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer;
          they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.”
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Have you not taken encouragement to sin against God, on that very
          presumption, that God would show you mercy when you sought it? And may
          not God justly refuse you that mercy that you have so presumed upon?
          You have flattered yourself, that though you did so, yet God would
          show you mercy when you cried earnestly to him for it: how righteous
          therefore would it be in God, to disappoint such a wicked presumption!
          It was upon that very hope that you dared to affront the majesty of
          heaven so dreadfully as you have done; and can you now be so sottish
          as to think that God is obliged not to frustrate that hope?
        </p>
        <p>
          When a sinner takes encouragement to neglect secret prayer which God
          has commanded, to gratify his lusts, to live a carnal vain life, to
          thwart God, to run upon him, and contemn him to his face, thinking
          with himself, “If I do so, God would not damn me; he is a merciful
          God, and therefore when I seek his mercy he will bestow it upon me;”
          must God be accounted hard because he will not do according to such a
          sinner’s presumption?
        </p>
        <p>
          Cannot he be excused from showing such a sinner mercy when he is
          pleased to seek it, without incurring the charge of being unjust; if
          this be the case, God has no liberty to vindicate his own honor and
          majesty; but must lay himself open to all manner of affronts, and
          yield himself up to the abuse of vile men, though they disobey,
          despise, and dishonor him, as much as they will; and when they have
          done, his mercy and pardoning grace must not be in his own power and
          at his own disposal, but he must be obliged to dispense it at their
          call. He must take these bold and vile contemners of his majesty, when
          it suits them to ask it, and must forgive all their sins, and not only
          so, but must adopt them into his family, and make them his children,
          and bestow eternal glory upon them. What mean, low, and strange
          thoughts have such men of God, who think thus of him! Consider, that
          you have injured God the more, and have been the worse enemy to him,
          for his being a merciful God. So have you treated that attribute of
          God’s mercy! How just is it therefore that you never should have any
          benefit of that attribute!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is something peculiarly heinous in sinning against the mercy of
          God more than other attributes. There is such base and horrid
          ingratitude, in being the worse to God because he is a being of
          infinite goodness and grace, that it above all things renders
          wickedness vile and detestable. This ought to win us, and engage us to
          serve God better; but instead of that, to sin against him the more,
          has something inexpressibly bad in it, and does in a peculiar manner
          enhance guilt, and incense wrath; as seems to be intimated, Romans
          2:4, 5. “Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and
          forbearance, and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God
          leadeth thee to repentance? But after thy hardness and impenitent
          heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and
          revelation of the righteous judgment of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The greater the mercy of God is, the more should you be engaged to
          love him, and live to his glory. But it has been contrariwise with
          you; the consideration of the mercies of God being so exceeding great,
          is the thing wherewith you have encouraged yourself in sin. You have
          heard that the mercy of God was without bounds, that it was sufficient
          to pardon the greatest sinner, and you have upon that very account
          ventured to be a very great sinner. Though it was very offensive to
          God, though you heard that God infinitely hated sin, and that such
          practices as you went on in were exceeding contrary to his nature,
          will, and glory, yet that did not make you uneasy; you heard that he
          was a very merciful God, and had grace enough to pardon you, and so
          cared not how offensive your sins were to him. How long have some of
          you gone on in sin, and what great sins have some of you been guilty
          of, on that presumption! Your own conscience can give testimony to it,
          that this has made you refuse God’s calls, and has made you regardless
          of his repeated commands. Now, how righteous would it be if God should
          swear in his wrath, that you should never be the better for his being
          infinitely merciful!
        </p>
        <p>
          Your ingratitude has been the greater, that you have not only abused
          the attribute of God’s mercy, taking encouragement from it to continue
          in sin, but you have also presumed that God would exercise infinite
          mercy to you in particular; which consideration should have especially
          endeared God to you. You have taken encouragement to sin the more,
          from that consideration, that Christ came into the would and died to
          save sinners; such thanks has Christ had from you, for enduring such a
          tormenting death for his enemies! Now, how justly might God refuse
          that you should ever be the better for his Son’s laying down his life!
          It was because of these things that you put off seeking salvation. You
          would take the pleasures of sin still longer, hardening yourself
          because mercy was infinite, and it would not be too late, if you
          sought it afterwards; now, how justly may God disappoint you in this,
          and so order it that it shall be too late!
        </p>
        <p>
          7. How have some of you risen up against God, and in the frame of your
          minds opposed him in his sovereign dispensations! And how justly upon
          that account might God oppose you, and set himself against you! You
          never yet would submit to God; never willingly comply, that God should
          have dominion over the world, and that he should govern it for his own
          glory, according to his own wisdom. You, a poor worm, a potsherd, a
          broken piece of an earthen vessel, have dared to find fault and
          quarrel with God. Isaiah 16:9. “Woe to him that striveth with his
          Maker. Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth: shall
          the clay say to him that fashioned it, What makest thou?” But yet you
          have ventured to do it. Romans 9:20. “Who art thou, O man, that
          repliest against God?” But yet you have thought you was big enough;
          you have taken upon you to call God to an account, why he does thus
          and thus; you have said to Jehovah, What dost thou?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have been restrained by fear from openly venting your
          opposition and enmity of heart against God’s government, yet it has
          been in you; you have not been quiet in the frame of your mind; you
          have had the heart of a viper within, and have been ready to spit your
          venom at God. It is well if sometimes you have not actually done it,
          by tolerating blasphemous thoughts and malignant risings of heart
          against him; yea, and the frame of your heart in some measure appeared
          in impatient and fretful behaviour.- Now, seeing you have thus opposed
          God, how just is it that God should oppose you! Or is it because you
          are so much better, and so much greater than God, that it is a crime
          for him to make that opposition against you which you make against
          him? Do you think that the liberty of making opposition is your
          exclusive prerogative, so that you may be an enemy to God, but God
          must by no means be an enemy to you, but must be looked upon under
          obligation nevertheless to help you, and save you by his blood, and
          bestow his best blessings upon you?
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider how in the frame of your mind you have thwarted God in those
          very exercises of mercy towards others that you are seeking for
          yourself. God exercising his infinite grace towards your neighbours,
          has put you into an ill frame, and it may be, set you into a tumult of
          mind. How justly therefore may God refuse ever to exercise that mercy
          towards you! Have you not thus opposed God showing mercy to others,
          even at the very time when you pretended to be earnest with God for
          pity and help for yourself? Yea, and while you was endeavouring to get
          something wherewith to recommend yourself to God? And will you look to
          God still with a challenge of mercy, and contend with him for it
          notwithstanding? Can you who have such a heart, and have thus behaved
          yourself, come to God for any other than mere sovereign mercy?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. If you should for ever be cast off by God, it would be agreeable
          to your treatment of Jesus Christ. It would have been just with God if
          he had cast you off for ever, without ever making you the offer of a
          Saviour. But God hath not done that; he has provided a Saviour for
          sinners, and offered him to you, even his own Son Jesus Christ, who is
          the only Saviour of men. All that are not for ever cast off are saved
          by him. God offers men salvation through him, and has promised us,
          that if we come to him, we shall not be cast off. But if you have
          treated, and still treat, this Saviour after such a manner, that if
          you should be eternally cast off by God, it would be most agreeable to
          your behaviour towards him; which appears by this, viz. “That you
          reject Christ, and will not have him for your Saviour.”
        </p>
        <p>
          If God offers you a Saviour from deserved punishment, and you will not
          receive him, then surely it is just that you should go without a
          Saviour. Or is God obliged, because you do not like this Saviour, to
          provide you another? He has given an infinitely honorable and glorious
          person, even his only begotten Son, to be a sacrifice for sin, and so
          provided salvation; and this Saviour is offered to you: now if you
          refuse to accept him, is God therefore unjust if he does not save you?
          Is he obliged to save you in a way of your own choosing, because you
          do not like the way of his choosing? Or will you charge Christ with
          injustice because he does not become your Saviour, when at the same
          time you will not have him when he offers himself to you, and
          beseeches you to accept of him as your Saviour?
        </p>
        <p>
          I am sensible that by this time many persons are ready to object
          against this. If all should speak what they now think, we should hear
          a murmuring all over the meeting-house, and one and another would say,
          “I cannot see how this can be, that I am not willing that Christ
          should be my Saviour, when I would give all the world that he was my
          Saviour: how is it possible that I should not be willing to have
          Christ for my Saviour when this is what I am seeking after, and
          praying for, and striving for, as for my life?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Here therefore I would endeavour to convince you, that you are under a
          gross mistake in this matter. And, First, I would endeavour to show
          the grounds of your mistake. And Secondly, To demonstrate to you, that
          you have rejected, and do wilfully reject, Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, That you may see the weak grounds of your mistake, consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. There is a great deal of difference between a willingness not to be
          damned, and a being willing to receive Christ for your Savior. You
          have the former; there is no doubt of that: nobody supposes that you
          love misery so as to choose an eternity of it; and so doubtless you
          are willing to be saved from eternal misery. But that is a very
          different thing from being willing to come to Christ: persons very
          commonly mistake the one for the other, but they are quite two things.
          You may love the deliverance, but hate the deliverer. You tell of a
          willingness; but consider what is the object of that willingness. It
          does not respect Christ; the way of salvation by him is not at all the
          object of it; but it is wholly terminated on your escape from misery.
          The inclination of your will goes no further than self, it never
          reaches Christ. You are willing not to be miserable; that is, you love
          yourself, and there your will and choice terminate. And it is but a
          vain pretence and delusion to say or think, that you are willing to
          accept of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There is certainly a great deal of difference between a forced
          compliance and a free willingness. Force and freedom cannot consist
          together. Now that willingness, whereby you think you are willing to
          have Christ for a Saviour, is merely a forced thing. Your heart does
          not go out after Christ of itself, but you are forced and driven to
          seek an interest in him. Christ has no share at all in your heart;
          there is no manner of closing of the heart with him. This forced
          compliance is not what Christ seeks of you; he seeks a free and
          willing acceptance, Psalm 110:3. “Thy people shall be willing in the
          day of thy power.” He seeks not that you should receive him against
          your will, but with a free will. He seeks entertainment in your heart
          and choice.- And if you refuse thus to receive Christ, how just is it
          that Christ should refuse to receive you? How reasonable are Christ’s
          terms, who offers to save all those that willingly, or with a good
          will, accept of him for their Saviour! Who can rationally expect that
          Christ should force himself upon any man to be his Saviour? Or what
          can be looked for more reasonable, than that all who would be saved by
          Christ, should heartily and freely entertain him? And surely it would
          be very dishonorable for Christ to offer himself upon lower terms.-
          But I would now proceed,
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, To show that you are not willing to have Christ for a
          Saviour. To convince you of it, consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How it is possible that you should be willing to accept of Christ
          as a Saviour from the desert of a punishment that you are not sensible
          you have deserved. If you are truly willing to accept of Christ as a
          Saviour, it must be as a sacrifice to make atonement for your guilt.
          Christ came into the world on this errand, to offer himself as an
          atonement, to answer for our desert of punishment. But how can you be
          willing to have Christ for a Saviour from a desert of hell, if you be
          not sensible that you have a desert of hell? If you have not really
          deserved everlasting burnings in hell, then the very offer of an
          atonement for such a desert is an imposition upon you. If you have no
          such guilt upon you, then the very offer of a satisfaction for that
          guilt is an injury, because it implies in it a charge of guilt that
          you are free from. Now therefore it is impossible that a man who is
          not convinced of his guilt can be willing to accept of such an offer;
          because he cannot be willing to accept the charge which the offer
          implies. A man who is not convinced that he has deserved so dreadful a
          punishment, cannot willingly submit to be charged with it. If he
          thinks he is willing, it is but a mere forced, feigned business;
          because in his heart he looks upon himself greatly injured; and
          therefore he cannot freely accept of Christ, under that notion of a
          Saviour from the desert of such a punishment; for such an acceptance
          is an implicit owning that he does deserve such a punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not say, but that men may be willing to be saved from an
          undeserved punishment; they may rather not suffer it, than suffer it.
          But a man cannot be willing to accept one at God’s hands, under the
          notion of a Saviour from a punishment deserved from him which he
          thinks he has not deserved; it is impossible that any one should
          freely allow a Saviour under that notion. Such an one cannot like the
          way of salvation by Christ; for if he thinks he has not deserved hell,
          then he will think that freedom from hell is a debt; and therefore
          cannot willingly and heartily receive it as a free gift.- If a king
          should condemn a man to some tormenting death, which the condemned
          person thought himself not deserving of, but looked upon the sentence
          as unjust and cruel, and the king, when the time of execution drew
          nigh, should offer him his pardon, under the notion of a very great
          act of grace and clemency, the condemned person never could willingly
          and heartily allow it under that notion, because he judged himself
          unjustly condemned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now by this it is evident that you are not willing to accept of Christ
          as your Saviour; because you never yet had such a sense of your own
          sinfulness, and such a conviction of your great guilt in God ‘s sight,
          as to be indeed convinced that you lay justly condemned to the
          punishment of hell. You never was convinced that you had forfeited all
          favour, and was in God’s hands, and at his sovereign and arbitrary
          disposal, to be either destroyed or saved, just as he pleased. You
          never yet was convinced of the sovereignty of God. Hence are there so
          many objections arising against the justice of your punishment from
          original sin, and from God’s decree, from mercy shown to others, and
          the like.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That you are not sincerely willing to accept of Christ as your
          Saviour, appears by this, That you never have been convinced that he
          is sufficient for the work of your salvation. You never had a sight or
          sense of any such excellency or worthiness in Christ, as should give
          such great value to his blood and his mediation with God, as that it
          was sufficient to be accepted for such exceeding guilty creatures, who
          have so provoked God, and exposed themselves to such amazing wrath.
          Saying it is so and allowing it be as others say, is a very different
          thing from being really convinced of it, and a being made sensible of
          it in your own heart. The sufficiency of Christ depends upon, or
          rather consists in his excellency. It is because he is so excellent a
          person that his blood is of sufficient value to atone for sin, and it
          is hence that his obedience is so worthy in God’s sight; it is also
          hence that his intercession is so prevalent; and therefore those that
          never had any spiritual sight or sense of Christ’s excellency, cannot
          be sensible of his sufficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that sinners are not convinced that Christ is sufficient for the
          work he has undertaken, appears most manifestly when they are under
          great convictions of their sin, and danger of God’s wrath. Though it
          may be before they thought they could allow Christ to be sufficient,
          (for it is easy to allow any one to be sufficient for our defense at a
          time when we see no danger,) yet when they come to be sensible of
          their guilt and God’s wrath, what discouraging thoughts do they
          entertain! How are they ready to draw towards despair, as if there
          were no hope or help for such wicked creatures as they! The reason is,
          They have no apprehension or sense of any other way that God’s majesty
          can be vindicated, but only in their misery. To tell them of the blood
          of Christ signifies nothing, it does not relieve their sinking,
          despairing hearts. This makes it most evident that they are not
          convinced that Christ is sufficient to be their Mediator.- And as long
          as they are unconvinced of this, it is impossible they should be
          willing to accept of him as their Mediator and Saviour. A man in
          distressing fear will not willingly betake himself to a fort that he
          judges not sufficient to defend him from the enemy. A man will not
          willingly venture out into the ocean in a ship that he suspects is
          leaky, and will sink before he gets through his voyage.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is evident that you are not willing to have Christ for your
          Saviour, because you have so mean an opinion of him, that you durst
          not trust his faithfulness. One that undertakes to be the Saviour of
          souls had need be faithful; for if he fails in such a trust, how great
          is the loss! But you are not convinced of Christ’s faithfulness; as is
          evident, because at such times as when you are in a considerable
          measure sensible of your guilt and God’s anger, you cannot be
          convinced that Christ is willing to accept of you, or that he stands
          ready to receive you, if you should come to him, though Christ so much
          invites you to come to him, and has so fully declared that he will not
          reject you, if you do come; as particularly, John 6:37. “Him that
          cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.” Now, there is no man can be
          heartily willing to trust his eternal welfare in the hands of an
          unfaithful person, or one whose faithfulness he suspects.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. You are not willing to be saved in that way by Christ, as is
          evident, because you are not willing that your own goodness should be
          set at nought. In the way of salvation by Christ men’s own goodness is
          wholly set at nought; there is no account at all made of it. Now you
          cannot be willing to be saved in a way wherein your own goodness is
          set at nought, as is evident, since you make much of it yourself. You
          make much of your prayers and pains in religion, and are often
          thinking of them; how considerable do they appear to you, when you
          look back upon them! And some of you are thinking how much more you
          have done than others, and expecting some respect or regard that God
          should manifest to what you do. Now, if you make so much of what you
          do yourself, it is impossible that you should be freely willing that
          God should make nothing of it . As we may see in other things; if a
          man is proud of a great estate, or if he values himself much upon his
          honorable office, or his great abilities, it is impossible that he
          should like it, and heartily approve of it, that others should make
          light of these things and despise them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing therefore it is so evident, that you refuse to accept of Christ
          as your Saviour, why is Christ to be blamed that he does not save you?
          Christ has offered himself to you, to be your Saviour in time past,
          and he continues offering himself still, and you continue to reject
          him, and yet complain that he does not save you.- So strangely
          unreasonable, and inconsistent with themselves, are gospel sinners!
        </p>
        <p>
          But I expect there are many of you that still object. Such an
          objection as this, is probably now in the hearts of many here present.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objection. If I am not willing to have Christ for my Saviour, I cannot
          make myself willing.- But I would give an answer to this objection by
          laying down two things, that must be acknowledged to be exceeding
          evident.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is no excuse, that you cannot receive Christ of yourself, unless
          you would if you could. This is so evident of itself, that it scarce
          needs any proof. Certainly if persons would not if they could, it is
          just the same thing as to the blame that lies upon them, whether they
          can or cannot. If you were willing, and then found that you could not,
          your being unable would alter the case, and might be some excuse;
          because then the defect would not be in your will, but only in your
          ability. But as long as you will not, it is no matter, whether you
          have ability or no ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not willing to accept of Christ, it follows that you have
          no sincere willingness to be willing; because the will always
          necessarily approves of and rests in its own acts. To suppose the
          contrary, would be to suppose a contradiction; it would be to suppose
          that a man’s will is contrary to itself, or that he wills contrary to
          what he himself wills. As you are not willing to come to Christ, and
          cannot make yourself willing, so you have no sincere desire to be
          willing; and therefore may most justly perish without a Saviour. There
          is no excuse at all for you; for say what you will about your
          inability, the seat of your blame lies in your perverse will, that is
          an enemy to the Saviour. It is in vain for you to tell of your want of
          power, as long as your will is found defective. If a man should hate
          you, and smite you in the face, but should tell you at the same time,
          that he hated you so much, that he could not help choosing and willing
          so to do, would you take it the more patiently for that? Would not
          your indignation be rather stirred up the more?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If you would be willing if you could, that is no excuse, unless
          your unwillingness to be willing be sincere. That which is
          hypocritical, and does not come from the heart, but is merely forced,
          ought wholly to be set aside, as worthy of no consideration; because
          common sense teaches, that what is not hearty, but hypocritical is
          indeed nothing, being only a show of what is not; but that which is
          good for nothing, ought to go for nothing. But if you set aside all
          that is not free, and call nothing a willingness, but a free hearty
          willingness, then see how the case stands, and whether or no you have
          not lost all your excuse for standing out against the calls of the
          gospel. You say you would make yourself willing to accept if you
          could; but it is not from any good principle that you are willing for
          that. It is not from any free inclination, or true respect to Christ,
          or any love to your duty, or any spirit of obedience. It is not from
          the influence of any real respect, or tendency in your heart, towards
          any thing good, or from any other principle than such as is in the
          hearts of devils, and would make them have the same sort of
          willingness in the same circumstances. It is therefore evident, that
          there can be no goodness in that would be willing to come to Christ:
          and that which has no goodness, cannot be an excuse for any badness.
          If there be no good in it, then it signifies nothing, and weighs
          nothing, when put into the scales to counterbalance that which is bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sinners therefore spend their time in foolish arguing and objecting,
          making much of that which is good for nothing, making those excuses
          that are not worth offering. It is in vain to keep making objection.
          You stand justly condemned. The blame lies at your door: Thrust it off
          from you as often as you will, it will return upon you. Sew fig-leaves
          as long as you will, your nakedness will appear. You continue wilfully
          and wickedly rejecting Jesus Christ, and will not have him for your
          Saviour, and therefore it is sottish madness in you to charge Christ
          with injustice that he does not save you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the sin of unbelief! Thus the guilt of that great sin lies
          upon you! If you never had thus treated a Saviour, you might most
          justly have been damned to all eternity: it would but be exactly
          agreeable to your treatment of God. But besides this, when God,
          notwithstanding, has offered you his own dear Son, to save you from
          this endless misery you had deserved, and not only so, but to make you
          happy eternally in the enjoyment of himself, you have refused him, and
          would not have him for your Saviour, and still refuse to comply with
          the offers of the gospel; what can render any person more inexcusable?
          If you should now perish for ever, what can you have to say?
        </p>
        <p>
          Hereby the justice of God in your destruction appears in two respects:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is more abundantly manifest that it is just that you should be
          destroyed. Justice never appears so conspicuous as it does after
          refused and abused mercy. Justice in damnation appears abundantly the
          more clear and bright, after a wilful rejection of offered salvation.
          What can an offended prince do more than freely offer pardon to a
          condemned malefactor? And if he refuses to accept of it, will any one
          say that his execution is unjust?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God’s justice will appear in your greater destruction. Besides the
          guilt that you would have had if a Saviour never had been offered, you
          bring that great additional guilt upon you, of most ungratefully
          refusing offered deliverance. What more base and vile treatment of God
          can there be, than for you, when justly condemned to eternal misery,
          and ready to be executed, and God graciously sends his own Son, who
          comes and knocks at your door with a pardon in his hand, and not only
          a pardon, but a deed of eternal glory; I say, what can be worse, than
          for you, out of dislike and enmity against God and his Son, to refuse
          to accept those benefits at his hands? How justly may the anger of God
          be greatly incensed and increased by it! When a sinner thus
          ungratefully rejects mercy, his last error is worse than the first;
          this is more heinous than all his former rebellion, and may justly
          bring down more fearful wrath upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heinousness of this sin of rejecting a Saviour especially appears
          in two things:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The greatness of the benefits offered: which appears in the
          greatness of the deliverance, which is from inexpressible degrees of
          corruption and wickedness of heart and life, the least degree of which
          is infinitely evil; and from misery that is everlasting; and in the
          greatness and glory of the inheritance purchased and offered. Hebrews
          2:3. “How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The wonderfulness of the way in which these benefits are procured
          and offered. That God should lay help on his own Son, when our case
          was so deplorable that help could be had in no mere creature; and that
          he should undertake for us, and should come into the world, and take
          upon him our nature, and should not only appear in a low state of
          life, but should die such a death, and endure such torments and
          contempt for sinners while enemies, how wonderful is it! And what
          tongue or pen can set forth the greatness of the ingratitude,
          baseness, and perverseness there is in it, when a perishing sinner
          that is in the most extreme necessity of salvation, rejects it, after
          it is procured in such a way as this! That so glorious a person should
          be thus treated, and that when he comes on so gracious an errand! That
          he should stand so long offering himself and calling and inviting, as
          he has done to many of you, and all to no purpose, but all the while
          be set at nought! Surely you might justly be cast into hell without
          one more offer of a Saviour! Yea, and thrust down into the lowest
          hell! Herein you have exceeded the very devils; for they never
          rejected the offers of such glorious mercy; no, nor of any mercy at
          all. This will be the distinguishing condemnation of gospel-sinners,
          John 3:18. “He that believeth not is condemned already, because he
          hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.”- That
          outward smoothness of your carriage towards Christ, that appearance of
          respect to him in your looks, your speeches, and gestures, do not
          argue but that you set him at nought in your heart. There may be much
          of these outward shows of respect, and yet you be like Judas, that
          betrayed the Son of man with a kiss; and like those mockers that bowed
          the knee before him, and at the same time spit in his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. If God should for ever cast you off and destroy you, it would be
          agreeable to your treatment of others.- It would be no other than what
          would be exactly answerable to your behaviour towards your
          fellow-creatures, that have the same human nature, and are naturally
          in the same circumstances with you, and that you ought to love as
          yourself. And that appears especially in two things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. You have many of you been opposite in your spirit to the salvation
          of others. There are several ways that natural men manifest a spirit
          of opposition against the salvation of souls. It sometimes appears by
          a fear that their companions, acquaintances, and equals, will obtain
          mercy, and so become unspeakably happier than they. It is sometimes
          manifested by an uneasiness at the news of what others have hopefully
          obtained. It appears when persons envy others for it, and dislike them
          the more, and disrelish their talk, and avoid their company, and
          cannot bear to hear their religious discourse, and especially to
          receive warnings and counsels from them. And it oftentimes appears by
          their backwardness to entertain charitable thoughts of them, and by
          their being brought with difficulty to believe that they have obtained
          mercy, and a forwardness to listen to any thing that seems to
          contradict it. The devil hated to own Job’s sincerity, Job 1:7,
          &amp;c. and chapter 2, verses 3, 4, 5. There appears very often much
          of this spirit of the devil in natural men. Sometimes they are ready
          to make a ridicule of others’ pretended godliness; they speak of the
          ground of others’ hopes, as the enemies of the Jews did of the wall
          that they built. Nehemiah 4:3. “Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him,
          and he said, That which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even
          break down their stone wall.” There are many that join with Sanballat
          and Tobiah, and are of the same spirit with them. There always was,
          and always will be, an enmity betwixt the seed of the serpent and the
          seed of the women. It appeared in Cain, who hated his brother, because
          he was more acceptable to God than himself; and it appears still in
          these times, and in this place. There are many that are like the elder
          brother, who could not bear that the prodigal when he returned should
          be received with such joy and good entertainment, and was put into a
          fret by it, both against his brother that had returned, and his father
          that had made him so welcome. Luke 15.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have many of you been opposite to the salvation of others, who
          stand in as great necessity of it as you. You have been against their
          being delivered from everlasting misery, who can bear it no better
          than you; not because their salvation would do you any hurt, or their
          damnation help you, any otherwise than as it would gratify that vile
          spirit that is so much like the spirit of the devil, who, because he
          is miserable himself, is unwilling that others should be happy. How
          just therefore is it that God should be opposite to your salvation! If
          you have so little love or mercy in you as to begrudge your
          neighbour’s salvation, whom you have no cause to hate, but the law of
          God and nature requires you to love, why is God bound to exercise such
          infinite love and mercy to you, as to save you at the price of his own
          blood? you, whom he is no way bound to love, but who have deserved his
          hatred a thousand and a thousand times? You are not willing that
          others should be converted, who have behaved themselves injuriously
          towards you; and yet, will you count it hard if God does not bestow
          converting grace upon you that have deserved ten thousand times as ill
          of God, as ever any of your neighbours have of you? You are opposite
          to God’s showing mercy to those that you think have been vicious
          persons, and are very unworthy of such mercy. Is others’ unworthiness
          a just reason why God should not bestow mercy on them? And yet will
          God be hard, if, notwithstanding all your unworthiness, and the
          abominableness of your spirit and practice in his sight, he does not
          show you mercy? You would have God bestow liberally on you, and
          upbraid not; but yet when he shows mercy to others, you are ready to
          upbraid as soon as you hear of it; you immediately are thinking with
          yourself how ill they have behaved themselves; and it may be your
          mouths on this occasion are open, enumerating and aggravating the sins
          they have been guilty of. You would have God bury all your faults, and
          wholly blot out all your transgressions; but yet if he bestows mercy
          on others, it may be you will take that occasion to rake up all their
          old faults that you can think of. You do not much reflect on and
          condemn yourself for your baseness and unjust spirit towards others,
          in your opposition to their salvation; you do not quarrel with
          yourself, and condemn yourself for this; but yet you in your heart
          will quarrel with God, and fret at his dispensations, because you
          think he seems opposite to showing mercy to you. One would think that
          the consideration of these things should for ever stop your mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Consider how you have promoted others’ damnation. Many of you, by
          the bad examples you have set, by corrupting the minds of others, by
          your sinful conversation, by leading them into or strengthening them
          in sin, and by the mischief you have done in human society other ways
          that might be mentioned, have been guilty of those things that have
          tended to others’ damnation. You have heretofore appeared on the side
          of sin and Satan, and have strengthened their interest, and have been
          many ways accessory to others’ sins, have hardened their hearts, and
          thereby have done what has tended to the ruin of their souls.- Without
          doubt there are those here present who have been in a great measure
          the means of others’ damnation. One man may really be a means of
          others’ damnation as well as salvation. Christ charges the scribes and
          Pharisees with this, Matthew 23:13. “Ye shut up the kingdom of heaven
          against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them
          that are entering, to go in.” We have no reason to think that this
          congregation has none in it who are cursed from day to day by poor
          souls that are roaring out in hell, whose damnation they have been the
          means of, or have greatly contributed to.- There are many who
          contribute to their own children’s damnation, by neglecting their
          education, by setting them bad examples, and bringing them up in
          sinful ways. They take some care of their bodies, but take little care
          of their poor souls; they provide for them bread to eat, but deny them
          the bread of life, that their famishing souls stand in need of. And
          are there no such parents here who have thus treated their children?
          If their children be not gone to hell, no thanks to them; it is not
          because they have not done what has tended to their destruction.
          Seeing therefore you have had no more regard to others’ salvation, and
          have promoted their damnation, how justly might God leave you to
          perish yourself!
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. If God should eternally cast you off, it would but be agreeable to
          your own behavior towards yourself; and that in two respects:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In being so careless of your own salvation. You have refused to
          take care for your salvation, as God has counseled and commanded you
          from time to time; and why may not God neglect it, now you seek it of
          him? Is God obliged to be more careful of your happiness, than you are
          either of your own happiness or his glory? Is God bound to take that
          care for you, out of love to you, that you will not take for yourself,
          either from love to yourself, or regard to his authority? How long,
          and how greatly, have you neglected the welfare of your precious soul,
          refusing to take pains and deny yourself, or put yourself a little out
          of your way for your salvation, while God has been calling upon you!
          Neither your duty to God, nor love to your own soul, were enough to
          induce you to do little things for your own eternal welfare; and yet
          do you now expect that God should do great things, putting forth
          almighty power, and exercising infinite mercy for it? You was urged to
          take care for your salvation, and not to put it off. You was told that
          was the best time before you grew older, and that it might be, if you
          would put it off, God would not hear you afterwards; but yet you would
          not hearken; you would run the venture of it. Now how justly might God
          order it so, that it should be too late, leaving you to seek in vain!
          You was told, that you would repent of it if you delayed; but you
          would not hear: how justly therefore may God give you cause to repent
          of it, by refusing to show you mercy now! If God sees you going on in
          ways contrary to his commands and his glory, and requires you to
          forsake them, and tells you that they tend to the destruction of your
          own soul, and therefore counsels you to avoid them, and you refuse;
          how just would it be if God should be provoked by it, henceforward to
          be as careless of the good of your soul as you are yourself!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. You have not only neglected your salvation, but you have wilfully
          taken direct courses to undo yourself. You have gone on in those ways
          and practices which have directly tended to your damnation, and have
          been perverse and obstinate it. You cannot plead ignorance; you had
          all the light set before you that you could desire. God told you that
          you was undoing yourself; but yet you would do it. He told you that
          the path you was going in led to destruction, and counseled you to
          avoid it; but you would not hearken. How justly therefore may God
          leave you to be undone! You have obstinately persisted to travel in
          the way that leads to hell for a long time, contrary to God’s
          continual counsels and commands, till it may be at length you are got
          almost to your journey’s end, and are come near to hell’s gate, and so
          begin to be sensible of your danger and misery; and not account it
          unjust and hard if God will not deliver you! You have destroyed
          yourself, and destroyed yourself wilfully, contrary to God’s repeated
          counsels, yea, and destroyed yourself in fighting against God. Now
          therefore, why do you blame any but yourself if you are destroyed? If
          you will undo yourself in opposing God, and while God opposes you by
          his calls and counsels, and, it may be too, by the convictions of his
          Spirit, what can you object against it, if God now leaves you to be
          undone? You would have your own way, and did not like that God should
          oppose you in it, and your way was to ruin your own soul; how just
          therefore is it, if, now at length, God ceases to oppose you, and
          falls in with you, and lets your soul be ruined; and as you would
          destroy yourself, so should put to his hand to destroy you too! The
          ways you went on in had a natural tendency to your misery: if you
          would drink poison in opposition to God, and in contempt of him and
          his advice, who can you blame but yourself if you are poisoned, and so
          perish? If you would run into the fire against all restraints both of
          God’s mercy and authority, you must even blame yourself if you are
          burnt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have proposed some things to your consideration, which, if you
          are not exceeding blind, senseless, and perverse, will stop your
          mouth, and convince you that you stand justly condemned before God;
          and that he would in no wise deal hardly with you, but altogether
          justly, in denying you any mercy, and in refusing to hear your
          prayers, though you pray never so earnestly, and never so often, and
          continue in it never so long. God may utterly disregard your tears and
          moans, your heavy heart, your earnest desires, and great endeavors;
          and he may cast you into eternal destruction, without any regard to
          your welfare, denying you converting grace, and giving you over to
          Satan, and at last cast you into the lake that burns with fire and
          brimstone, to be there to eternity, having no rest day or night, for
          ever glorifying his justice upon you in the presence of the holy
          angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objection. But here many may still object, (for I am sensible it is a
          hard thing to stop sinners’ mouths,) “God shows mercy to others that
          have done these things as well as I, yea, that have done a great deal
          worse than I.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer. 1. That does not prove that God is any way bound to show mercy
          to you, or them either. If God bestows it on others, he does not so
          because he is bound to bestow it: he might if he had pleased, with
          glorious justice, have denied it them. If God bestows it on some, that
          does not prove that he is bound to bestow it on any; and if he is
          bound to bestow it on none, then he is not bound to bestow it on you.
          God is in debt to none; and if he gives to some that he is not in debt
          to, because it is his pleasure, that does not bring him into debt to
          others. It alters not the case as to you, whether others have it, or
          have it not: you do not deserve damnation the less, than if mercy
          never had been bestowed on any at all. Matthew 20:15. “Is thine eye
          evil, because mine is good?”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If this objection be good, then the exercise of God’s mercy is not
          in his own right, and his grace is not his own to give. That which God
          may not dispose of as he pleases, is not his own; for that which is
          one’s own, is at his own disposal: but if it be not God’s own, then he
          is not capable of making a gift or present of it to any one; it is
          impossible to give what is a debt.- What is it that you would make of
          God? Must the great God be tied up, that he must not use his own
          pleasure in bestowing his own gifts, but if he bestows them on one,
          must be looked upon obliged to bestow them on another? Is not God
          worthy to have the same right, with respect to the gifts of his grace,
          that a man has to his money or goods? Is it because God is not so
          great, and should be more in subjection than man, that this cannot be
          allowed him? If any of you see cause to show kindness to a neighbour,
          do all the rest of your neighbors come to you, and tell you, that you
          owe them so much as you have given to such a man? But this is the way
          that you deal with God, as though God were not worthy to have as
          absolute a property in his goods, as you have in yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this rate God cannot make a present of any thing; he has nothing of
          his own to bestow: if he has a mind to show peculiar favor to some, or
          to lay some particular persons under peculiar obligations to him, he
          cannot do it; because he has no special gift at his own disposal. If
          this be the case, why do you pray to God to bestow saving grace upon
          you? If God does not do fairly to deny it you, because he bestows it
          on others, then it is not worth your while to pray for it, but you may
          go and tell him that he has bestowed it on others as bad or worse than
          you, and so demand it of him as a debt. And at this rate persons never
          need to thank God for salvation, when it is bestowed; for what
          occasion is there to thank God for that which was not at his own
          disposal, and that he could not fairly have denied? The thing at
          bottom is, that men have low thoughts of God, and high thoughts of
          themselves; and therefore it is that they look upon God as having so
          little right, and they so much. Matthew 20:15. “Is it not lawful for
          me to do what I will with mine own?”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. God may justly show greater respect to others than to you, for you
          have shown greater respect to others than to God. You have rather
          chosen to offend God than men. God only shows a greater respect to
          others, who are by nature your equals, than to you; but you have shown
          a greater respect to those that are infinitely inferior to God than to
          him. You have shown a greater regard to wicked men than to God; you
          have honored them more, loved them better, and adhered to them rather
          than to him. Yea, you have honored the devil, in many respects, more
          than God: you have chosen his will and his interest, rather than God’s
          will and his glory: you have chosen a little worldly pelf, rather than
          God: you have set more by a vile lust than by him: you have chosen
          these things, and rejected God. You have set your heart on these
          things, and cast God behind your back: and where is the injustice if
          God is pleased to show greater respect to others than to you, or if he
          chooses others and rejects you? You have shown greater respect to vile
          and worthless things, and no respect to God’s glory; and why may not
          God set his love on others, and have no respect to your happiness? You
          have shown great respect to others, and not to God, whom you are laid
          under infinite obligations to respect above all; and why may not God
          show respect to others, and not to you, who never have laid him under
          the least obligation?
        </p>
        <p>
          And will you not be ashamed, notwithstanding all these things, still
          to open your mouth, to object and cavil about the decrees of God, and
          other things that you cannot fully understand. Let the decrees of God
          be what they will, that alters not the case as to your liberty, any
          more than if God had only foreknown. And why is God to blame for
          decreeing things? Especially since he decrees nothing but good. How
          unbecoming an infinitely wise Being would it have been to have made a
          world, and let things run at random, without disposing events, or
          fore-ordering how they should come to pass? And what is that to you,
          how God has fore-ordered things, as long as your constant experience
          teaches you, that it does not hinder your doing what you choose to do.
          This you know, and your daily practice and behavior amongst men
          declares that you are fully sensible of it with respect to yourself
          and others. Still to object, because there are some things in God’s
          dispensations above your understanding, is exceedingly unreasonable.
          Your own conscience charges you with great guilt, and with those
          things that have been mentioned, let the secret things of God be what
          they will. Your conscience charges you with those vile dispositions,
          and that base behavior towards God, that you would at any time most
          highly resent in your neighbour towards you, and that not a whit the
          less for any concern those secret counsels and mysterious
          dispensations of God may have in the matter. It is in vain for you to
          exalt yourself against an infinitely great, and holy, and just God. If
          you continue in it, it will be to your eternal shame and confusion,
          when hereafter you shall see at whose door all the blame of your
          misery lies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will finish what I have to say to natural men in the application of
          this doctrine, with a caution not to improve the doctrine to
          discouragement. For though it would be righteous in God for ever to
          cast you off, and destroy you, yet it would also be just in God to
          save you, in and through Christ, who has made complete satisfaction
          for all sin. Romans 3:25, 26. “Whom God hath set forth to be a
          propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness
          for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of
          God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness, that he might
          be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.” Yea, God
          may, through this Mediator, not only justly, but honorably, show you
          mercy. The blood of Christ is so precious, that it is fully sufficient
          to pay the debt you have contracted, and perfectly to vindicate the
          Divine Majesty from all the dishonor cast upon it, by these many great
          sins of yours that have been mentioned. It was as great, and indeed a
          much greater thing, for Christ to die, than it would have been for you
          and all mankind to have burnt in hell to all eternity. Of such dignity
          and excellency is Christ in the eyes of God, that, seeing he has
          suffered so much for poor sinners, God is willing to be at peace with
          them, however vile and unworthy they have been, and on how many
          accounts soever the punishment would be just. So that you need not be
          at all discouraged from seeking mercy, for there is enough in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed it would not become the glory of God’s majesty to show mercy to
          you, so sinful and vile a creature, for any thing that you have done;
          for such worthless and despicable things as your prayers, and other
          religious performances. It would be very dishonorable and unworthy of
          God so to do, and it is in vain to expect it. He will show mercy only
          on Christ’s account; and that, according to his sovereign pleasure, on
          whom he pleases, when he pleases, and in what manner he pleases. You
          cannot bring him under obligation by your works; do what you will, he
          will not look on himself obliged. But if it be his pleasure, he can
          honorably show mercy through Christ to any sinner of you all, not one
          in this congregation excepted.- Therefore here is encouragement for
          you still to seek and wait, notwithstanding all your wickedness;
          agreeable to Samuel’s speech to the children of Israel, when they were
          terrified with the thunder and rain that God sent, and when guilt
          stared them in the face, 1 Samuel 12:20. “Fear not; ye have done all
          this wickedness; yet turn not aside from following the Lord, but serve
          the Lord with all your heart.”

          I would conclude this discourse by putting the godly in mind of the
          freeness and wonderfulness of the grace of God towards them. For such
          were the same of you.- The case was just so with you as you have
          heard; you had such a wicked heart, you lived such a wicked life, and
          it would have been most just with God for ever to have cast you off:
          but he has had mercy upon you; he hath made his glorious grace appear
          in your everlasting salvation. You had no love to God; but yet he has
          exercised unspeakable love to you. You have contemned God, and set
          light by him: but so great a value has God’s grace set on you and your
          happiness, that you have been redeemed at the price of the blood of
          his own Son. You chose to be with Satan in his service; but yet God
          hath made you a joint heir with Christ of his glory. You was
          ungrateful for past mercies; yet God not only continued those mercies,
          but bestowed unspeakably greater mercies upon you. You refused to hear
          when God called; yet God heard you when you called. You abused the
          infiniteness of God’s mercy to encourage yourself in sin against him;
          yet God has manifested the infiniteness of that mercy, in the
          exercises of it towards you. You have rejected Christ, and set him at
          nought; and yet he is become your Saviour. You have neglected your own
          salvation; but God has not neglected it. You have destroyed yourself;
          but yet in God has been your help. God has magnified his free grace
          towards you, and not to others; because he has chosen you, and it hath
          pleased him to set his love upon you.

          O! what cause is here for praise! What obligations you are under to
          bless the Lord who hath dealt bountifully with you, and magnify his
          holy name! What cause for you to praise God in humility, to walk
          humbly before him. Ezekiel 16:63. “That thou mayest remember and be
          confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame,
          when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the
          Lord God!” You shall never open your mouth in boasting, or
          self-justification; but lie the lower before God for his mercy to you.
          You have reason, the more abundantly, to open your mouth in God’s
          praises, that they may be continually in your mouth, both here and to
          all eternity, for his rich, unspeakable, and sovereign mercy to you,
          whereby he, and he alone, hath made you to differ from others.
