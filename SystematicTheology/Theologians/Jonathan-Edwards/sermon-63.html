          Romans 2:10, “But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh
          good.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THE apostle in the preceding verses declared what is the portion of
          wicked men; viz. indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish; in
          this verse declares what is the portion assigned to good men. In the
          words of the text we should observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The description of a good man; viz. the man that worketh good. Such
          men are here described by the fruit which they bring forth. Christ has
          taught us that the tree is known by its fruit. Paul here describes
          them by that which most distinguishes them; not by the external
          privileges which they enjoy, or the light under which they live; but
          by the fruits which they bring forth. For as the apostle says, in
          verse 13, “Not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the
          doers of it shall be justified.” That which distinguishes good men
          from bad, is not that they hear good, or that they profess good, or
          that they intend good; but that they do good. They are workers of
          good.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The reward of such a man; viz. “glory, honor, and peace;” in which
          are mentioned three sorts of good that are assigned to them as their
          portion. 1. Their moral good, expressed by the word glory. Glory shall
          be given them; i.e. they shall be made excellent and glorious. They
          shall be endued with those excellent and glorious qualifications,
          which will render them beautiful and lovely. They shall have the image
          of God, and be partakers of his holiness. Thus the word glory is used
          by St. Paul, 2 Cor. 3:18. We are changed into the same image from
          glory to glory. 2. Their relative good; Honor. They shall be in most
          honorable circumstances. They shall be advanced to great dignity,
          receive a relation to God, and Christ, and the heavenly inhabitants,
          and God shall put honor upon them. 3. Their natural good; Peace:
          which, as it is used in the Scriptures, signifies happiness; and
          includes all comfort, joy, and pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall endeavor to show from the text, that glory, honor, and peace
          are the portion which God has given to all good men. In describing
          their happiness, I shall consider the successive parts of it; both
          here and hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I propose to treat of their happiness in this world. Those who
          are truly good men have been the subjects of a real thorough work of
          conversion, and have had their hearts turned from sin to God. Of such
          persons it may be said, that they are truly blessed. They are often
          pronounced blessed by God. He is infinitely wise, and sees and knows
          all things. He perfectly knows who are blessed, and who are miserable.
          He hath said, “Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of
          the ungodly.” — “Blessed is he whose sins are forgiven.” — “Blessed is
          the man that maketh the Lord his trust.” — “Blessed are the poor in
          spirit” — “the meek” — “the merciful” — “the pure in heart.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In considering the happiness of the righteous in this world, I shall
          pursue the method which the text obviously points out, and shall
          consider, I. The excellency; II. The honor; and , III. The peace and
          pleasure, which God bestows upon them in the present life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The excellency or glory. The sum of this consists in their having
          the image of God upon them. When a person is converted, he has the
          image of God enstamped on him. Col. 3:10, “And have put on the new
          man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him who created
          him.” and Eph. 4:23, 24, “And be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
          and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
          righteousness.” They have their eyes opened, and are led into such a
          sight of God and thorough acquaintance with him, as changes the soul
          into the image of God’s glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          What can render a creature more excellent than to have the very image
          of the Creator? and how blessed a change is that which is wrought in
          conversion, which brings a man thus to be in the image of God! For
          though the image of God in Christians in this world is very imperfect,
          yet it is real. The real image of God is most excellent, though it be
          imperfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, “the righteous is more excellent than his neighbour,” and “the
          saints are the excellent of the earth.” The image of God is their
          glory, and it may well be called glory, for imperfect as it is, it
          renders them glorious in the eyes of the angels of heaven. The image
          of God is a greater beauty in their eyes, than the brightness and
          glory of the sun in the firmament.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed the saints have no excellency, as they are in and of
          themselves. In them, that is, in their flesh, dwells no good thing.
          They are in themselves poor, guilty, vile creatures, and see
          themselves to be so. But they have an excellency and glory in them,
          because they have Christ dwelling in them. The excellency that is in
          them, though it be but as a spark, yet it is something ten thousand
          times more excellent than any ruby, or the most precious pearl that
          ever was found on the earth; and that because it is something divine,
          something of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This holy heavenly spark is put into the soul in conversion, and God
          maintains it there. All the powers of hell cannot put it out, for God
          will keep it alive, and it shall prevail more and more. Though it be
          but small, yet it is powerful; it has influence over the heart to
          govern it, and brings forth holy fruits in the life, and will not
          cease to prevail till it has consumed all the corruption that is left
          in the heart, and till it has turned the whole soul into a pure, holy,
          and heavenly flame, till the soul of man becomes like the angels, a
          flame of fire, and shines as the brightness of the firmament.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I would consider the honor to which Christians are advanced in
          this world; and the sum of this is, that they are the children of God.
          This is an excellent and glorious degree of honor and dignity to which
          they are admitted; and that because the Being to whom they are related
          is an infinitely glorious being, a being of incomprehensible majesty
          and excellency; and also because the relation is so near and honorable
          a relation. It is a great honor to be the servant of God. John the
          Baptist said of Christ, that he was not worthy to stoop down to loose
          the latchet of Christ’s shoes. But Christians are not only admitted to
          be the servants of God, but his children; and how much more honorable
          in a family is the relation of children than that of servants! Gal.
          4:7, “Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
          then an heir of God through Christ.” Rom. 8:16, 17, “The Spirit itself
          beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God; and
          if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, if
          so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified
          together.” 1 John 3:1, “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath
          bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God!” The honor
          appears the greater if it be considered how Christians are brought
          into their relation to God; and that is by Christ. They become the
          children of God by virtue of their union with the only begotten and
          eternal Son of God. They are united to him as his spouse, and members
          of his body, as his flesh and his bones, and as one spirit; and,
          therefore, as Christ is the Son of God, so they are sons. Therefore
          are they joint heirs with Christ, because they are joint sons with
          him. To this end God sent forth his Son, that so they might through
          him also be sons. Gal. 4:4, 5, “But when the fullness of time was
          come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, to
          redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the
          adoption of sons.” And therefore they partaking of the relation of the
          Son, so are they also of the spirit of the Son; as it follows in the
          next verse, “and because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit
          of his Son into your hears, crying, Abba, Father.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Herein Christians are the children of God in a more honorable way than
          the angels themselves; for the angels are the sons of God by virtue of
          that relation which they have to God, as they are in themselves singly
          and separately. But Christians are the children of God, as partaking
          with Christ, the only begotten Son, in his sonship, whose sonship is
          immensely more honorable than that of the angels. And Christians,
          being the children of God, are honored of God as such. They are
          sometimes owned as such by the inward testimony of the Spirit of God.
          For, as it is found in the verse already cited from Romans, “the
          Spirit beareth witness with our spirits that we are the children of
          God.” They are treated as such in the great value God puts upon them,
          for they are his jewels, those which he has set apart for himself; and
          he is tender of them as of the apple of his eye. He disregards wicked
          men in comparison of them. He will give kings for them and princes for
          their life. He is jealous for them. He is very angry with those that
          hurt them. If any offend them, it were better for them that a
          millstone were cast about their neck, and they were drowned in the
          depths of the sea. He loves them with a very great and wonderful love.
          He pities them as a father pities his children. He will protect them,
          and defend them and provide for them, as a father provides for his
          children. This honor have all they that fear and love God, and trust
          in the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Peace and pleasure are also the portion of Christians in this
          world. Their peace and joy in God begin in the present life, and are
          no less excellent than the glory with which he invests them and the
          honor to which he advances them. We ought here to consider, 1st, what
          foundation they have for peace and joy. 2nd, what peace and joy they
          actually have.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. Their foundation for peace and joy is in their safety and their
          riches.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They have ground for peace because of their safety. They are safe
          in Jesus Christ from the wrath of God and from the power of Satan.
          They that are in Christ shall never perish, for none shall pluck them
          out of his hand. They are delivered from all their dreadful misery,
          that indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, which shall come
          on ungodly men. They were naturally exposed to it, but they are
          delivered from it; their sins are all forgiven them. The handwriting
          is eternally blotted out. Their sins are all done away; God has cast
          them behind his back , and buried their sorrows in the depths of the
          sea, and they shall no more come into remembrance. They are most safe
          from misery, for they are built on Christ their everlasting rock. Who
          is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yea, rather, is risen
          again, who is even at the right hand of God. They have the faithful
          promise of God for their security, that is established as a sure
          witness in heaven. They have an interest in that covenant, that is
          well ordered in all things and sure. “Neither death, nor life, nor
          angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
          to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
          to separate them from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They have a foundation of unspeakable comfort and joy, because of
          their riches. They have true and infinite riches. They are the
          possessors and heirs of something real and substantial, and that is
          worthy to be called by the name of riches. The things they possess are
          excellent, more precious than gold and than rubies; all the desirable
          things of this world cannot equal them, and they have enough of it.
          The riches that they have given them of God are inexhaustible. It is
          sufficient for them; there is no end of it. They have a fountain of
          infinite good for their comfort, and contentment, and joy; for God has
          given himself to them to be their portion, and he is a God of infinite
          glory. There is glory in him to engage their contemplation forever and
          ever, without ever being satiated. And he is also an infinite fountain
          of love; for God is love, yea, an ocean of love without shore or
          bottom! The glorious Son of God is theirs; that lovely one, who was
          from all eternity God’s delight, rejoicing always before him. All his
          beauty is their portion, and his dying love is theirs, his very heart
          is theirs, and his glory and happiness in heaven are theirs, so far as
          their capacity will allow them to partake of it; for he has promised
          it to them, and has taken possession of it in their name. And the
          saints are also rich in the principle that is in them. They have
          inward riches which they carry about with them in their own hearts.
          They are rich in faith. Jam. 2:5, “Hearken, my beloved brethren, hath
          not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the
          kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?” They have the
          grace of God in their hearts, which is a most excellent treasure, and
          a good foundation of joy; for it is the seed of joy. Light is sown for
          the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. And the seed
          that is sown in their hearts, is the grace of God there. That is a
          seed that, however it lies hid, will certainly in due time spring up,
          and put forth itself, and will bud, and blossom, and will bring forth
          rich fruit. These riches are the true riches. This is the good which
          God reserves for his friends. God distributes silver and gold and such
          like things among his enemies, because he slights them and regards
          them not. They are contemptible things in his eyes, as we throw husks
          to swine. But he has reserved better things for his children, of which
          no ungodly man, though a prince or monarch, shall partake. This is the
          ground which Christians have of peace and pleasure in this world.
          However, the saints cannot always take comfort, and do not always
          taste the sweetness that there is in store for them, by reason of the
          darkness and clouds that sometimes interpose. But though they may walk
          in great darkness for a long time, yet they are happy notwithstanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. They sometimes in this world have the actual enjoyment of peace
          and pleasure that are most excellent. Sometimes the clouds that are in
          the way are removed, and Christians are enabled to behold the ground
          they have for rejoicing. Though God’s glory and love be often hid from
          them, as it were with a veil, or at least, so as to hinder a clear
          view of it, yet God sometimes is pleased to remove the veil, to draw
          the curtain, and to give the saints sweet visions. Sometimes there is,
          as it were, a window opened in heaven, and Christ shows himself
          through the lattice. They have sometimes a beam of sweet light
          breaking forth from above into the soul. And God and the Redeemer
          sometimes come to them, and make friendly visits to them, and manifest
          themselves to them. Sometimes Christians have seasons of light and
          gladness for some considerable period, and at other times their views
          are more transient. Sometimes their light and joy arise in reading of
          the Holy Scriptures, sometimes in hearing the word preached, sometimes
          at the Lord’s table, sometimes in the duty of prayer, sometimes in
          Christian conference, sometimes in meditation when they are about
          their occupations, as in the time of more set and solemn meditations;
          and sometimes in the watches of the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those spiritual joys and pleasures which believers possess in this
          world, are chiefly of three sorts.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The joy which they have in a sense of their own good estate; in the
          sense they have of the pardon of their sins, and their safety from
          hell; and a sense of the favor of God, and in the hope they have of
          eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The joy and delight, which they have in the apprehension and view
          of God’s excellency and love. The joy of a Christian does not consist
          merely in the sense of his own good estate, as natural men often are
          ready to imagine; but there is an excellent, transcendent,
          soul-satisfying sweetness that sometimes fills the soul in the
          apprehension of the excellency of God. The soul dwells upon the
          thought, fixes on it, and takes complacence in God as the greatest
          good, the most delightful object of its contemplation. This pleasure
          is the sweetest pleasure that a Christian ever feels, and is the
          foretaste of the pleasures of heaven itself. Herein sometimes the
          saints do boast of the cluster of Canaan. This sort of joy is evidence
          of sincerity above any other joy, a more sure evidence than a
          rejoicing in our own good estate. From the joy which the Christian has
          in the view of the glory and excellency of God; the consideration of
          the love of God to him cannot be excluded. When he rejoices in God as
          a glorious God, he rejoices in him the more because he is his God, and
          in consideration of there being a union between him and this God.
          Otherwise, if there were a separation, the view of God’s excellency,
          though it would raise joy one way, would proportionally excite grief
          another. God is sometimes pleased to manifest his love to the saints,
          and commonly at those times, when a Christian has the greatest views
          of God’s excellency, he has also of his love. The soul is spiritually
          sensible of God as being present with it, and as manifesting and
          communication himself; and it has sweet communion with God, and tastes
          the sweetness of his love, and knows a little what is the length, and
          breadth, and depth, and height of that love which passeth knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The third kind of joy is found in doing that which is to the glory
          of God. The true love of God makes this sweet and delightful to the
          soul. The joy of a Christian not only arises in knowing and viewing
          but also in doing; not only in apprehending God, but also in doing for
          God. For he loves God not only with a love of complacence, but a love
          of benevolence also. And as a love of complacence delights in
          beholding, so does a love of benevolence delight in doing for the
          object beloved. The peace and pleasure which the Christian has in
          these things, is far better more desirable than pleasures that this
          world can afford, and especially than the pleasures of wicked men; and
          that on the following accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1). There is light in this pleasure. The peace and pleasures of
          wicked men have their foundation in darkness. When wicked men have any
          quietness or joy, it is because they are blind, and do not see what is
          their real condition. If it were not for blindness and delusion, they
          could have no peace nor comfort in anything. There needs nothing but
          to open a wicked man’s eyes, and let him look about him and see where
          he is, and it would be enough to destroy all the quietness and comfort
          of the most prosperous wicked man in the world. But on the contrary,
          the peace of a godly man, is a peace that arises from light. When he
          sees things most as they are, then he has most peace; and the distress
          and trouble which he sometimes feels, arise from clouds and darkness.
          When a godly man is in the greatest fear and distress, if he did not
          know what a happy state he were in, he would at the same time rejoice
          with unspeakable joy; so that his pleasure is not founded, like that
          of wicked men, in stupidity, but in sensibleness; not in blindness,
          but in light, and sight, and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2). There is rest in this pleasure. He that has found this joy, finds
          a sweet repose and acquiescence of the soul in it. It sweetly calms
          the soul and allays its disappointments. Christ says, Mat. 11:28,
          “Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will
          give you rest.” There is a sweet contentment in it; the soul that
          tastes it, desires no better pleasure. There is a satisfaction in it.
          The soul that has been wandering before, when it comes to taste of
          this fountain, finds in it that which satisfies its desires and
          cravings, and discovers that in it which it needs in order to its
          happiness. John 4:14, “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall
          give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up into
          everlasting life.” It is quite otherwise with the pleasures of ungodly
          men. There is no true rest in them, they are not enjoyed with inward
          quietness, there is no true peace enjoyed within, neither do they
          afford contentment. But those wicked men that have the most worldly
          pleasures, are yet restlessly inquiring, “who will show us any good?”
          “The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose
          waters cast up mire and dirt.” Wicked men in the midst of their
          enjoyment of pleasure have no true rest, neither do their reflections
          on it afford rest; but only remorse of conscience, and disquietude of
          soul, under the guilt that is contracted. But the pleasures of the
          godly afford rest in the enjoyment, and rest and sweetness in the
          reflection. It oftentimes calms and refreshers the soul to look on
          past comforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3). There is life in it. It is a pleasure that strengthens and
          nourishes and preserves the soul, and gives it life, and does not
          corrupt and destroy and bring it to death, as do sinful pleasures. The
          pleasures of the wicked are poison to the soul, they tend to enfeeble
          it, to consume it, and kill it. But the pleasures of the godly feed
          the soul, and do not consume it; they strengthen, and do not weaken
          it; they exalt, and do not debase it; they enrich, and do not
          impoverish it. Death and corruption are the natural fruit of the
          pleasures of sin, but life is the fruit of spiritual pleasures. Gal.
          6:8, “For he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap
          corruption: but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap
          life everlasting.” The life in which this joy consists, and to which
          it tends, is the most excellent life, and the only life worthy of the
          name; it is spiritual, and the beginning of eternal life. This
          pleasure is a fountain springing up to everlasting life. John 4:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4). There is substance in it. This pleasure is not a mere shadow, an
          empty delight, as earthly pleasures are, but it is substantial joy.
          The pleasures of sin last but a little season, they are the crackling
          of thorns under a pot, or as the blazing meteors of the night, that
          appear for a moment, and then vanish. But this pleasure is like the
          durable light of the stars or the sun. Worldly pleasures are easily
          overthrown. A little thing will spoil all the pleasures of a king’s
          court. Haman, in the midst of all his prosperity and greatness, could
          say, “Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the
          Jew sitting at the king’s gate.” But the joys of the saints are such
          as the changes of time cannot overthrow. If God lifts up the light of
          his countenance, this will compose and rejoice the heart under the
          saddest tidings. They joy in affliction. Their enemies cannot
          overthrow this joy. The devil and even death itself cannot overthrow
          it; but oftentimes it lives, and is in its greatest height, in the
          midst of the valley of the shadow of death. When in the most
          tormenting death, how often have the martyrs sung in the midst of the
          flames, and under the hands of their cruel tormentors! Job 35:10, “But
          none saith, Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (5). There is holiness in it. It is the excellency of these joys that
          they are holy joys. They are not like the polluted stream of sinful
          pleasures, but they are pure and holy. Rev. 22:1, “And he showed me a
          pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the
          throne of God and of the Lamb.” These pleasures do not defile the
          soul, but purify it; they do not deform, but beautify it; they not
          only greatly delight the soul, but render it more excellent. They
          impart something more of God, more of a divine disposition and temper,
          dispose to holy actions, and cause the soul to shine as Moses’s face
          did when he had been conversing with God in the mount, and as
          Stephen’s face, which was as the face of an angel, when he was heaven
          opened, and the Son on man standing on the right hand of God. Thus
          these pleasures make the soul more excellent, and more divine, as well
          as more happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6). There is sometimes glory in it. God sometimes unveils his face,
          and lest in light more plentifully. This is a delight and joy, the
          excellency, and sweetness, and admirableness of which cannot be
          expressed. It is a kind of glory that fills the soul. So excellent is
          its nature, that the sweetness earthly delight vanishes into nothing,
          and appears as base and vile as dross and dirt, or as the mere mire of
          the street. It is bright above all that is earthly, as the sun in
          brighter than the glow-worm. Of this, the apostle takes notice. 1 Pet.
          1:8, “Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him
          not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
          glory.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I proceed to consider the happiness of the saints in death.
          It may seem a mystery to the world that men should be happy in death,
          which the world looks upon as the most terrible of all things; but
          thus it is to the saints. Their happiness is built upon a rock, and it
          will stand the shock of death. When the storm and floods of death come
          with their greatest violence, it stands firm, and neither death nor
          hell can overthrow it. Here,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Death is rendered no death to them. It is not worthy of the name of
          death. As the life of a wicked man is not worthy of the name of life,
          so the death of a godly man is not worthy of the name of death. It is
          not looked upon as any death at all in the eyes of God, who sees all
          things as they are, nor is it called death by him. Hence Christ
          promises, that those who believe in him shall not die. John 6:50, 51,
          “this is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat
          thereof and not die. I am the living bread which came down from
          heaven; if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever: and the
          bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of
          the world.” It is no death to the saints, because it is no destruction
          to them. The notion of death implies destruction, or perishing, in it;
          but the godly are not destroyed by death, death cannot destroy them;
          for as Christ says, they shall never perish. John 3:15, “That
          whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.”
          A godly man, when he dies, in no wise perishes. There is no end put to
          his life as a Christian, for that is a spiritual life that remains
          unquenched by death. A wicked man, when he dies, dies indeed, because
          then an end is put to all the life which he has; for he has no other
          life but temporal life. But the life of a Christian is hid with
          Christ, and safely laid up with him in heaven; and therefore death
          cannot reach his life, because it cannot reach heaven. Death can no
          more reach the believer’s life than Christ’s life. No death can reach
          Christ our life now though he died once. But now he has forever sat
          down at the right hand of God. He says, for the comfort of his saints,
          Rev. 1:18, “I am he that liveth and was dead: and behold, I am alive
          for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and death.” Death not
          only cannot destroy a Christian, but it cannot hurt him. Christ
          carries him on eagle wings aloft on high, out of the reach of death.
          Death, with respect to him, is disarmed of his power. And every
          Christian may say, “O death, where is thy sting?” Death was once
          indeed a terrible enemy, but now he has become weak. He spent all his
          strength on Christ; in killing him, he killed himself; he was
          conquered then, and has now no power to hurt his followers. Death is
          now but the shadow of what he would have been if Christ had not
          conquered him. He was once a lion, but now he is but a lamb. A good
          man nay indeed be harassed with fears of death, and may be much
          terrified when going through the valley of the shadow of death, but
          that is no just ground of any terror, and if the saints are terrified,
          it is only through their infirmity and darkness. As a child is
          frightened in the dark where there is no danger, because he is a
          child, so a good man may be affrighted at the terrible looks of death.
          But he will find this awful appearance to be only a shadow, that can
          look terribly, but can do nothing terrible. Death may, through the
          weakness of the saints, trouble them, and exercise them, but he cannot
          destroy the ground they have for comfort and support. When death comes
          to a wicked man, all those things on which he built his comfort fail,
          their foundation is overflown with a flood. Job 22:16. But the
          foundation of the peace and comfort of the godly man is not shaken at
          such a time. Oftentimes the saints are actually carried above all the
          fears and terrors of death; they see that it is but a shadow, and are
          not afraid. Not only their foundation of comfort remains, but that
          peace and comfort itself is undisturbed, the light shines through the
          darkness, and the lamb-like nature of death appears through the shadow
          of the lion. The godly have a God to stand by them when they come to
          die, in whose love and favor they may shelter themselves, in whose
          favor is life, yea, life in death; and they have a blessed Savior to
          be with them, to uphold them with the right hand of his righteousness.
          These are the friends they have with them, when they are going to take
          their leave of all earthly friends. God will be with them when their
          flesh and heart fails. God will be the strength of their heart, when
          they are weak and faint, and nature fails. God will put underneath his
          everlasting arms to support them, and will make all their bed for them
          in their sickness. Psa. 37:37, “Mark the perfect man, and behold the
          upright; for the end of that man is peace.”
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Death is not only no death to them, but it is a translation to a
          more glorious life, and is turned into a kind of resurrection from the
          dead. Death is a happy change to them, and a change that is by far
          more like a resurrection than a death. It is a change from a state of
          perfect light, and holiness, and joy. When a saint dies, he awakes, as
          it were, out of sleep. This life is a dull, lifeless state. There is
          but a little spiritual life, and a great deal of deadness. There is
          but a little light, and a great deal of darkness. There is but a
          little sense, and a great deal of stupidity and senselessness. But
          when a godly man dies, all this deadness, and darkness, and stupidity,
          and senselessness are gone forever, and he enters immediately into a
          state of perfect life, and perfect light, and activity, and
          joyfulness. A man’s conversion is compared to a resurrection, because
          then a man rises from spiritual death. Eph. 2:1, “And you hath he
          quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins.” But through
          spiritual life is then begun, yet there are great remains of spiritual
          death after this, and but little life. But when a godly man dies, he
          rises from all remains of spiritual death, and comes into a state of
          perfect life. This body is like a prison to the holy soul, it
          exceedingly clogs, and hinders, and cramps it in its spiritual
          exercises and comforts. But when a saint dies, the soul is released
          from this prison, this grave, and comes into a state of glorious
          freedom and happiness. So that death is not only deprived of his
          sting, but is made a servant to the saints, to bring them to Christ in
          heaven, who is their life. And their ground of comfort does not only
          last when they are going out of the world, but it is in some respects
          increased, for then their perfect happiness draws nigh. It is “far
          better” to depart and be with Christ, than to continue here. And when
          the saints are enabled to see their own happiness in death, they are
          enabled exceedingly to rejoice in the midst of the valley of the
          shadow of death, and to triumph joyfully over the king of terrors.
          Death to the saints is always a passage or avenue, leading out of a
          world of vanity, and sin, and misery, into a world of life, light, and
          glory. But though often a dark avenue, it is at times full of light,
          the darkness all vanishes away, and the light shines out of that
          glorious city into which they are entering. It shines through the
          darkness and fills the soul, and the clouds of death vanish before it.
          The awful appearance of death is but a mask or disguise that death
          wears. It is not terrible but joyful in reality, and this light of the
          new Jerusalem sometimes so clearly shines, that it shines through the
          frightful disguise, and shows the saints that death is but a servant.
          Yea, sometimes it is so when death has on its most terrible disguise
          that ever it wears, and comes in its most dreadful forms, as when the
          saints are burnt at the stake, and put to all cruel and tormenting
          deaths. It is often times joyful to the saints when dying, to think
          that they are now going into the glorious presence of God, to enjoy
          God and Christ to the full. The joyful expectation sometimes makes
          them ready to cry out, “Even so, come, Lord Jesus, come quickly!” and
          “Why is his chariot so long in coming?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, let us next consider the happiness of the saints, in their
          state of separation from the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. When the soul departs from the body, it is received by the blessed
          angels and conducted by them to the third heavens. On the eve of its
          departure there is a guard if angels standing round the dying bed; and
          the devils, though eager to seize upon it as their prey, shall by no
          means be suffered to come nigh. The holy angels shall be a guard to
          the soul, to keep off al its enemies. We are taught that this is part
          of the office in which God employs them. Psa. 34:7, “The angel of the
          Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.”
          Psa. 91:11, “For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep
          thee in all thy ways;” as it was with Daniel in the lion’s den. Dan.
          6:22, “My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths,
          that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was
          found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.” And
          as soon as the soul is loose from the body, it shall be kindly and
          courteously received by those bright and blessed ones, to be conducted
          by them in to Christ’s glorious presence. For the angels are all
          ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to them that shall be the
          heir of salvation. This is one way in which they shall minister; viz.
          to guard and conduct the departed spirits of the saints; which we are
          plainly taught in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. Luke 16:22,
          “And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the
          angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried.”
          These spirits of holiness and love, when they have received the soul,
          shall conduct it along through the aerial and starry heavens to the
          most glorious part of the universe; the highest part of the creation,
          the place of God’s most holy residence, the city and palace of the
          most high God, where Christ is. There are some who say that there is
          no such place as heaven; but this is evidently a mistake, for the
          heaven into which the man Christ Jesus entered with his glorified
          body, is certainly some place. It is absurd to suppose that the heaven
          where the body of Christ is, is not a place. To say that the body of
          Christ is in no place, is the same thing as to say he has no body. The
          heaven where Christ is, is a place; for he was seen ascending, and
          will be seen descending again; and the heaven were the departed souls
          of the saints are, is the same heaven where Christ has ascended. And
          therefore Stephen, when he was departing this life, saw heaven opened,
          and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. And he prayed to
          that same Jesus who he saw, that he would receive his spirit; i.e.
          that he would receive it to him, where he was him, at the right hand
          of God. And the apostle Paul signifies, that if he should depart, he
          should be with Christ. Phil. 1:23, “For I am in a strait betwixt two,
          having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far
          better:” 2 Cor. 5:8, “We are confident, I say, and willing rather to
          be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.” Besides,
          there are some of the saints there already with their bodies, as Enoch
          and Elijah. Therefore there is some place, where God gloriously
          manifests himself, and were Christ is, and were saints and angels
          dwell, and whither the angels carry the souls of the saints when they
          depart from their bodies; and this place is called Paradise, and the
          third heaven. 2 Cor. 12:2, 4. The aerial heaven is the first heaven;
          the starry heaven is the second; and the blessed abode of Christ and
          saints and angels the third, because it is above the other two; and so
          Christ is said to be made higher than the heavens. Heb. 7:26, “For
          such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled,
          separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens,” i.e. higher
          than the visible heaven. This heaven is far above the stars. So it is
          said that Christ ascended far above all heavens. Eph. 4:10, “He that
          descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens,
          that he might fill all things,” i.e. far above all the heaven that we
          see. This is the mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly
          Jerusalem, and hither the angels conduct the souls of the saints when
          they leave their earthly tabernacles. When they come there, they shall
          be received with a joyful welcome, the doors of this glorious city are
          opened to them, and they shall have entrance given to them into
          heaven, as an inheritance to which they have a right. Rev. 22:14,
          “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right
          to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the
          city.” And then shall open to view that glorious world, that beautiful
          city, and delightful paradise, which they had often before heard of,
          and thought of, and desired. Then they shall see it, and possess it as
          their own. There they shall be welcomed and joyfully received by that
          glorious company that dwell there, by the angels, and by the saints
          that went to heaven before them. There was joy among them at their
          conversion, and now also will there be joy among them when they are
          brought home to glory. To have one that was dear to them before,
          because a child of the same family and a disciple of the same Lord,
          brought home from a strange country to come and dwell with them
          forever; how will their fellow citizens and brethren in heaven be glad
          for them, and rejoice with them, and embrace them, when they come
          there to join them in their praises of God and the Lamb! And then they
          shall be conducted unto the Lord Jesus Christ in his glory, and shall
          be presented to him perfectly free from sin, and without spot, or
          wrinkle, or any such thing; who will also abundantly welcome them to
          his glory, and to the blessed enjoying of his love. And then shall
          their good Shepherd rejoice, when he shall not only have brought home
          the soul that was lost to a saving close with him, but home to him in
          his heavenly Father’s house. The Savior shall then rejoice when he
          shall receive a soul that he loved before the foundation of the world;
          and for which he laid down his life, and endured such dreadful
          sufferings. This was the joy that was set before him, to redeem and
          make happy the souls of his elect; and he will rejoice, therefore,
          when he sees this accomplished. He will bid them welcome, and make
          them welcome, and they shall be received into the full enjoyment of
          his love. The Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall feed them,
          and he shall present them also to God his Father, having redeemed them
          to him by his blood, who shall also abundantly welcome them there.
          Then the soul shall behold that glory and taste that pleasure which it
          long hoped for, and thought of with delight, and the thoughts of which
          were wont to be such a support to it when on earth. Then shall it know
          by experience what the joys of heaven are; then shall the great and
          precious promises of the gospel to fulfilled; then shall faith be
          turned into vision, and hope into fruition; then shall all sin be
          eternally left behind. There shall be no more indwelling corruption,
          wicked thoughts, or sinful dispositions, to torment them. And whatever
          sorrow and affliction they underwent on earth, God shall now wipe away
          all tears from their eyes; and though they have lately passed through
          death, yet there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying;
          neither shall there be any more pain, because the former things shall
          be passed away. Rev. 21:4. If they have lived hardly in this world,
          and suffered hunger and thirst, there shall be an end of it all; and
          they that have suffered persecution, and have had their raiment
          stained with their own blood, shall now suffer no more. “And he said
          unto me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
          washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
          Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and
          night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell
          among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more;
          neither shall the sun light on them, not any heat: for the Lamb which
          is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them
          unto living fountains of water; and God shall wipe away all tears from
          their eyes.” Rev. 7:14, 15, 16, 17. Though they had many enemies to
          conflict with while on earth, yet now shall they obtain the victory
          over them; now shall they triumph and sing, being forever out of the
          reach of all Satan’s temptations, and of all his power to afflict or
          molest them. Now shall they appear in mount Zion with the Lamb,
          clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands. Rev. 7:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. They shall remain there in a state of exceeding glory and
          blessedness, till the resurrection. They shall remain there in the
          enjoyment of God, dwelling with Jesus Christ in a state of perfect
          rest, without the least disturbance or molestation. Rev. 14:13, “And I
          heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead
          which die in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that
          they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.”
          There they shall dwell in habitations of sweet delight and pleasure in
          paradise; there they shall drink of those rivers of pleasures for
          evermore. There they shall dwell in perfect light and perfect love.
          There they shall see and converse with God and Christ, and with angels
          and glorious spirits, and shall contemplate the wonderful love of God
          to men in sending his only Son. There shall they contemplate the
          glorious love of God to them, the love he had to them before the
          foundation of the world. There shall they see and know what love
          Christ had to them, that influenced him to lay down his life for them;
          and shall behold the beauty and excellency of Christ, and see face to
          face, and know even as they are known. 1 Cor. 13:12. There they shall
          sweetly meditate on the wonderful dealings of God to them while in
          this lower world, in preserving of them, in granting to them to live
          under means of grace, when many thousands and millions of others never
          had these privileges. They shall contemplate the wonderful mercy of
          God to them in striving with them by his Spirit, in convincing them of
          sin, in stirring them up to seek salvation, in converting them, and in
          bringing them out of darkness into marvelous light. The mercy and
          grace of God in converting them will then appear otherwise to them
          than it does now. They shall then contemplate the manifold mercies of
          God to them through the whole course of their lives. They shall see
          how God has protected them, and guided them by his counsel, and led
          them all along. They shall see the wonderful wisdom and mercy of God
          towards them in these and those dispensations, that now appear most
          dark to them, shall see the meaning of those that were matter of
          difficulty to them, and shall see how all things wrought together for
          their good. These will be sweet meditations to them, and doubtless
          will be subjects of the saints’ conversation with each other. How
          sweet will it be for the saints to look back and see how God carried
          them along through the wilderness, through all the storms of this
          world, and all its dangers, and temptations, and enemies, after they
          have come to their resting-place; and how sweet will it be for them to
          converse together of these things, and what ardent praises will it
          occasion! And then also shall they see the wisdom of God in the
          government and ordering of the affairs of his church all along, the
          scheme of divine providence shall be opened to them, and the admirable
          wisdom of it shall be unfolded; and they shall also see how God brings
          his purposes and promises to pass in his providence towards his church
          here on earth. They shall see and rejoice at it when the kingdom of
          God flourishes in the world. We are told, there is joy in heaven if
          but one sinner repenteth. Then doubtless the saints of the Old
          Testament after their entrance into heaven, saw and rejoiced when
          Christ came into the world. And therefore two of them, Moses and
          Elijah, came down to converse with Christ, at his transfiguration.
          Abraham, Moses, and David, and the prophets Isaiah and Daniel, and all
          the prophets, doubtless saw the fulfillment of the glorious things
          foretold in their prophecies with exceeding rejoicing. They saw that
          glorious enlargement of the church that was produced by the preaching
          of the prophets. And thus also the apostles and evangelists in heaven,
          and other primitive Christians and martyrs, saw the glorious
          flourishing and prevailing of the kingdom of Christ after their death,
          till the utter downfall of heathenism, and the establishment of
          Christianity throughout the Roman empire.
        </p>
        <p>
          The holy martyrs with joy beheld the destruction of those pagan powers
          that persecuted the church of God. Rev. 6:9, 10, 11, “And when he had
          opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that
          were slain for the Word of God, and for the testimony which they held:
          and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and
          true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on
          the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it
          was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season,
          until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, that should be
          killed as they were, should be fulfilled.” Therefore they rejoiced
          when they saw it accomplished. And so the saints that died in former
          ages, they without doubt beheld and rejoiced greatly at the time of
          the resurrection from popery in the days of Luther and Calvin, and
          other reformers. And so doubtless the saints that went to heaven,
          before this remarkable outpouring of the Spirit on this town and other
          neighboring towns, especially those that went to heaven from hence,
          have seen this work and greatly rejoiced at it. And so the saints,
          that die before the glorious days that are coming at the downfall of
          antichrist and the calling of the Jews, will rejoice at the conversion
          of the world to Christianity. We are ready to lament that we shall not
          probably live to see those times. But if we die and go to heaven, we
          shall see them nevertheless, and rejoice in them not the less for not
          being in this world. But we shall rejoice more, for we shall see and
          understand more of the glory of God in such a work, and have more love
          to God, and therefore shall rejoice more at the advancement of his
          kingdom. Thus when the apostle John had visions of the glorious things
          that should be brought to pass for the advancement of the kingdom of
          Christ, he from time to time mentions the visions he also had of the
          hosts of heaven rejoicing at it. Rev. 11:15, 16, 17, “And the seventh
          angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The
          kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his
          Christ; and he shall reign forever and ever. And the four and twenty
          elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces and
          worshipped God, saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty,
          which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee
          thy great power, and hast reigned.” So when the spiritual Babylon, the
          church of Rome, falls, the holy apostles and prophets, though dead
          many ages before, are called upon to rejoice. Rev. 18:20, “Rejoice
          over her, thou heavens, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God
          hath avenged you on her.” So the multitude of the heavenly hosts are
          described as rejoicing, and as singing hallelujahs on that occasions;
          and all heaven is full of praise. Rev. 19:1 “And after these things I
          heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia;
          Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:
          for true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged the great
          whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hast
          avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. And again they said,
          Alleluia. And her smoke went up forever and ever.” These things may
          give us some notion how the spirits of just men made perfect do employ
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. They remain in a joyful expectation of their more full and
          complete blessedness at the resurrection. As the wicked have not their
          full punishment until after the resurrection, so neither have the
          saints their complete happiness. Though they have attained to such
          exceeding glory, yet they are not yet arrived at its highest degrees,
          for that is reserved for their final state. The reward which the
          saints receive after the resurrection, is often spoken of as their
          chief reward. This is the reward that Christ has promised. John 6:40,
          “And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth
          the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life; and I will
          raise him up at the last day.” This is the chief reward that the
          saints seek and wait for. Rom. 8:23, “And not only they, but ourselves
          also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves
          groan earnestly within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit,
          the redemption of our body,” Phil. 3:11, “If by any means I might
          attain unto the resurrection of the dead.” “Women received their dead
          raised to life again; and others were tortured, not accepting
          deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.” So the
          happiness, that shall be given at Christ’s second coming, is spoken of
          as the principal happiness. Tit. 2:13, “Looking for that blessed hope,
          and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
          Christ.”
        </p>
        <p>
          This the saints will be in joyful expectation of in heaven; they
          shall; rest in sweet repose on God’s promise that it shall be so,
          their desires of it bringing no uneasiness; they rejoicing in it most
          in the consideration that it will be in God’s time, in the fittest and
          best time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, I shall consider the glory, honor, and peace, which the
          godly shall receive at the resurrection and the day of judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. When the time appointed comes, notice shall be given of it in
          heaven, which will be to their exceeding joy. God has in his own
          eternal counsels fixed the time, but now it is kept secret. It is not
          only not known by any on the earth, but neither is it known in heaven
          by either saints or angels there, and the man Christ Jesus himself, in
          his state of humiliation, did not himself know it. Mat. 24:36, “But of
          that day and hour knoweth no man; no not and angels in heaven have a
          joyful expectation of it, but they know not when it is; but when the
          time comes, God’s eternal counsels concerning it shall be made known;
          the joyful tidings shall be proclaimed through all heaven, that all
          may prepare to attend the Lord Jesus Christ in his descent to the
          earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. They shall descend with Christ from the highest heaven towards the
          earth. When notice is given to the heavenly host, they shall all
          gather themselves together to attend on this most joyful and glorious
          occasion; and then the glorious Son of God shall descend, and the holy
          angels with him, and not only the angels, but the souls of the saints,
          shall come with Christ. 1 Thes. 4:14, “For if we believe that Jesus
          died, and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God
          bring with him.” Christ shall descend with the glory of his Father; he
          shall appear in a glory becoming the Supreme Lord and Judge of heaven
          and earth. Now heaven will for a time be left empty of its
          inhabitants; those glorious and blessed abodes will be deserted by
          those that dwelt there, to attend the judge of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The saints on earth shall behold this glorious sight of their
          Savior coming in the clouds of heaven, with all his holy angels with
          him. The first notice that shall be given of this descent shall be in
          heaven, but soon after there shall be notice of it on earth. Christ
          shall be seen coming while he is yet at a great distance; every eye
          shall see him of both good and bad. And it will be the most joyful
          sight to the saints that ever they saw. The first notice of it will
          cause their hearts to overflow with joy and gladness, it will fill the
          hearts of the godly as full of joy as it will the wicked with terror
          and amazement. If the saints are then waked out of their sleep at
          midnight with this sound, that Christ appears in the clouds of heaven
          coming to judgment, it will be joyful news to them. It is probable
          many of the saints at that time will be found suffering persecution,
          for there are several things in Scripture which seem to declare, that
          the time when Christ is coming shall be a time when wickedness shall
          exceedingly abound, and the saints shall be greatly persecuted. But
          this shall set them at liberty; then they may lift up their heads out
          of prisons and dungeons, and many out of galleys, and mines, and shall
          see their Redeemer drawing nigh. This sight will drive away their
          persecutors, it will put an end to all their cruelties, and set God’s
          people at liberty. And then when all the kindreds of the earth shall
          wail at the sight of Christ in the clouds of heaven, and wicked men
          everywhere shall be shrieking and crying with terrible amazement, the
          saints shall be filled with praise and transport. We read that, when
          Christ ascended into heaven, the disciples stood steadfastly looking
          on as he went up. But the saints then on earth shall view Christ with
          more steadfastness as he descends in his heavenly and exceeding glory.
          They shall feed and feast their eyes with this majestic sight,
          beholding in what solemn and glorious pomp their own blessed Redeemer
          descends. This sight shall put a final end to all sorrow, and their
          everlasting joy and glory will commence from it. The hope of the
          glorious appearing of the great God, and our Savior Jesus Christ, is
          said to be a blessed hope. Tit. 2:13, “Looking for that blessed hope,
          and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
          Christ.” But when it comes it will be a more blessed sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The dead in Christ shall arise at the sound of the last trumpet
          with glorified bodies, and the living saints shall see them. The holy
          and blessed souls of saints that descended from heaven with Christ,
          shall then be reunited to those bodies that shall be prepared by
          infinite wisdom and skill to be fit organs for a holy and happy soul.
          The body shall not rise as it was before; there shall be a vast
          difference in it. 1 Cor. 15:42, 43, 44, “It is sown in corruption, it
          is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in
          glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a
          natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body,
          and there is a spiritual body.” The glory of that body, that the
          saints shall rise with is what we now cannot conceive of. It shall not
          be such a dull and heavy-molded thing as it is now. It shall be active
          and vigorous as a flame of fire fit for the use of a glorified soul.
          It will be no clog or hindrance to the soul as it is now, but an organ
          every way fit for the use of a glorious spirit. It shall not be weak,
          infirm, and frail as it is now; for, though it is sown in weakness, it
          is raised in power. Now the body is in need of food and sleep
          continually, to recreate it, but it shall not be so then. Now the body
          is subject to weariness, and to diseases, but it shall not be so then.
          Now if God lets in any great matter of divine light into the soul, the
          body is ready to sink under it, but it shall not be so then. The
          glorified body of the saints shall not then fail or flag at all by the
          most powerful exercises of mind. Now not many can see God and live,
          but the body shall not fail at all by the immediate beholding of God.
          Now the saints can see but little. When God a little reveals himself,
          as he doth at times, the saints are forced to beseech God either to
          strengthen them to see it, or to stay his hand. But then the body
          shall be so vigorous and spiritual, that the constant and everlasting
          view of the glory of God shall not in any wise overcome it, or cause
          it in the least to fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          The body shall not only be raised in an exceeding strength, but in
          wonderful beauty, for we are told that their bodies shall be like to
          Christ’s glorious body. The greatest beauty that ever any human body
          appeared in this world, is vile and base in comparison. The beauty of
          the bodies of the saints shall not only consist in the most lovely
          proportion of the features of their countenance and parts of their
          bodies, but in a semblance of the excellencies of their minds, which
          will appear exceedingly in their countenance. Their air and mien will
          be such as will naturally result from the wisdom, purity, and love of
          the soul, and shall denote and hold forth an inexpressible sweetness,
          benevolence, and complacence. And if I may speak what appears to me
          probable, and what seems to be authorized by the Scriptures, their
          bodies shall be as it were clothed with garments of light. The prophet
          Daniel, speaking of the resurrection, says, Dan. 12:2, 3, “And many of
          them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to
          everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And they
          that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they
          that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.” And
          Christ, speaking of the end of the world, says, Mat. 13:43, “Then
          shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their
          Father.” And there is nothing to hinder our understanding this
          literally of their bodies, and especially when this shining of the
          saints is spoken of from time to time as what shall be at the
          resurrection, and not of their souls in a separate state. Moses’s face
          shone when he had been conversing with God in the mount. Much more may
          it be expected that the bodies of the saints shall shine, when they
          shall converse a thousand times more intimately with God, not in mount
          Sinai, but in heaven. We read of Christ, that when his body was
          transfigured, to teach us what the body of Christ should be in its
          glorified state, we are told that, when his body was transfigured, his
          face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
          Mat. 17:2. But we are told that the bodies of the saints shall be made
          like unto Christ’s glorious body. There therefore seems to be much
          ground to think, that at the resurrection the bodies of the saints
          shall shine with a glorious light, and that they shall be as it were
          clothed with light. Thus the departed saints shall arise with glorious
          bodies, they shall lift up their heads out of their graves with joyful
          and glorious countenances. And at the same time the bodies of the
          living shall in a moment be changed into the same strength, and
          activity, and incorruptibility, and beauty and glory, with which those
          that were dead shall arise. 1 Cor. 15:51, 52, 53, “Behold, I show you
          a mystery, we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a
          moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump (for the trumpet
          shall sound); and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall
          be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this
          mortal must put on immortality.”
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Then all the saints shall mount up, as with wings, to meet the Lord
          in the air, and to be forever with him. After the dead in Christ are
          risen, and the living saints changed, then they will be prepared to go
          to Christ, and to meet the bridegroom. The world will be about to be
          destroyed, and the wicked shall be in dreadful amazement, but the
          saints shall be delivered. Dan. 12:1, “And at that time shall Michael
          stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy
          people, and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since
          there was a nation, even to that same time: and at that time thy
          people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in
          the book.” They shall take an everlasting farewell of this evil world
          where there is so much sin, and where they have met with so much
          trouble, and they shall be caught up in the clouds, and there they
          shall meet their glorious Redeemer; and a joyful meeting it will be.
          They shall go to Christ, never any more to be separated from him. 1
          Thes. 4:16, 17, “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a
          shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and
          the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we, which are alive and
          remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet
          the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Then shall the good works, which the saints have done, be declared
          to their peace and glory. We are often told that every man shall be
          judged according to his works, and Christ keeps a book of remembrance
          of the good works of the saints as well as of the sins of the ungodly.
          And however mean and polluted that which the saints do is in itself,
          yet all the pollution that attends it is hid, and everything they do
          for God that has the least sincerity in it is precious in God’s eyes.
          Through his infinite grace it shall in no wise lose its reward,
          neither shall it in any wise lose its honor. At the day of judgment
          they shall receive praise and glory in reward for it. Christ will
          declare all the good they have done to their honor; what they did
          secretly and the world knew it not, and when they did not let their
          left hand know what their right had did. Then shall they receive
          praise and honor for all their labor, for all their self-denial, and
          all their suffering in the cause of Christ; and those good works of
          theirs that were despised, and for which they were condemned, and
          suffered reproach, shall now be set in a true light. And however they
          were reproached and slandered by men, they shall receive praise of God
          in the sight of angels and men. 1 Cor. 4:5, “Therefore judge nothing
          before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the
          hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the
          hearts; and then shall every man have praise of God.” Those righteous
          men that have been condemned here before unjust judges, shall be
          acquitted and honored then before the righteous Judge of heaven and
          earth. Heb. 6:10, “For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and
          labour of love, which ye have showed towards his name, in that ye have
          ministered to the saints, and do minister.” Then will be the time when
          their Lord and Master will say unto them, “Well done, good and
          faithful servants.” Thus, in the description of the day of judgment in
          the 25th chapter of Matthew, Christ rehearses the good works of the
          saints. “For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty,
          and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and
          ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye
          came unto me.” And though the saints there reply, “Lord, when saw we
          thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? when
          saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
          Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?” Though
          they thought that nothing that they had done was worthy to be so
          accounted of as it was by Christ, yet Christ of his grace esteemed it
          highly, and highly honored them for it, as it there follows, 40th
          verse, “And the King shall answer, and say unto them, Verily I say
          unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these
          my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” And if the sins of the saints
          shall be rehearsed, it shall not be for their shame, but for the glory
          of divine grace, to give opportunity to them to plead the atonement of
          that Savior who will be the Judge, to give occasion to them to produce
          Christ’s righteousness, which will surely be accepted by himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. The saints shall sit on thrones with Christ, to judge wicked men
          and devils. Christ will put that honor upon them on that day, he will
          cause them to sit on his right hand as judges with him, and so the
          saints shall judge the world. Mat. 19:28, “And Jesus said unto them,
          verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the
          regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory,
          ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of
          Israel.” 1 Cor. 6:2, 3, “Do ye not know that the saints shall judge
          the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to
          judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels?
          how much more things that pertain to this life?” They shall judge
          kings and princes who were their persecutors, and the devils who were
          their tempters.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. At the finishing of the judgment Christ shall pronounce the
          blessed sentence upon them, “Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
          kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”
        </p>
        <p>
          This blessed sentence Christ shall pronounce on them with
          inexpressible manifestations of grace and love. Every word of it will
          be ravishing to them and will cause raptures of joy in their hearts;
          that this glorious person, though he orders with such indignation the
          wicked to depart from him, yet will so sweetly invite them to come
          with him, and that he should accost them after such a manner, saying,
          “ye blessed of my Father.” Christ will pronounce them blessed in the
          sight of men and angels; and blessed indeed, because blessed by his
          Father. There will not only be a manifestation of Christ’s love to
          them in this sentence, but a declaration of the Father’s love, for
          they are declared to be blessed of him. Christ shall invite them to
          come with him, and for no less a purpose than to inherit a kingdom.
          Christ gives them a glorious kingdom. The wealth to which he invites
          them is the wealth of a kingdom; and the honor he gives them is the
          honor of kings. And what yet adds to the blessedness is this, that it
          is a kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world. God
          loved them from all eternity, and therefore he has prepared a kingdom
          for them. God had respect to them in the creation of the world, and
          then prepared this glorious kingdom for them, and out of love to them.
          They have therefore a right to it, and now therefore they are invited
          to come to possess it; and not only to possess it, but to inherit it,
          that is, to posses it as heirs, as those that have a right to the
          kingdom by virtue of their being his children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus having considered what glory, honor, and peace the saints have in
          this life, at death, in a separate state, and at the day of judgment,
          I now proceed,
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifthly, To consider their consummate state of happiness after the day
          of judgment. And here I would consider,
        </p>
        <p>I. Their entrance into this happiness; and</p>
        <p>
          II. Its nature, its degree, and some of the circumstances which attend
          it.
        </p>
        <p>I. Their entrance into this state of consummate happiness.</p>
        <p>
          1st. When the judgment is ended they shall ascend with Christ in a
          triumphant and glorious manner into heaven. Christ, when he has passed
          sentence, shall then return again. He shall pass beyond these aerial
          heavens, and shall ascend towards the highest heaven, together with
          ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands of
          glorious spirits, and of the saints with their glorified bodies. They
          shall leave this lower world, and all the wicked, to be burnt in
          everlasting fire, and as they are ascending shall look back and see it
          all in one vast conflagration. Then shall be fulfilled in the most
          remarkable manner, the prophecy in Psa. 47:4, 5, “He shall choose our
          inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob, whom he loved. God is
          gone up with a shout, the lord with the sound of a trumpet.” And that
          will be the most joyful procession that ever will be seen. And when
          they are come to heaven they shall enter in with joy into that new
          Jerusalem where they are to dwell forever; and this will be the most
          joyful day that ever was in heaven. It is probable, that when Christ
          ascended into heaven after his death and resurrection, it was the most
          joyful day in heaven that ever had been seen till them. But this
          second ascension will be a more glorious and joyful day than that.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. When they have come to heaven, they shall be there actually
          instated by God and Christ in their ultimate and consummate happiness;
          and now they shall have complete redemption. To illustrate this, it
          may be observed,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They shall be perfectly happy in the whole man; both body and soul.
          Before, their souls only were happy, while the body lay in a state of
          putrefaction in the grave. Now they shall be in that state which is
          natural to the human soul., which is a state of union with the body.
          It is natural for the soul to act by a body, and to make use of such
          an organ, and the soul is not complete without the body. And then both
          body and soul shall be glorified together.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Then will the body of Christ be perfect and complete. Then it shall
          have all its members, no one wanting. Now the body of Christ is
          incomplete, there are many members wanting; but then it will be
          perfected, having every member. Now the body of Christ is in a growing
          state, but then it shall have come to its perfect state, to receive no
          more addition. Then the body of Christ shall be perfect, not only as
          it shall have every member, but every member shall be in its perfect
          state. Now as there are many of the members of Christ’s body wanting,
          so there are many that are imperfect. Many that are engrafted into
          Christ have great infirmity, and great remains of corruption, and many
          of his members are now under affliction. But then every member shall
          be perfectly freed from all sin and sorrow, and there never will be
          any more either sin or sorrow, in any member of the body of Christ.
          Then also the body of Christ will be complete, because those that are
          brought to a perfect state are wholly brought home. Before only the
          soul was brought home to glory, while the body that was also to be
          united to Christ, lay in the grave. The body of Christ will then also
          be in its complete state, because then all the parts will be together;
          and this is one end of Christ’s coming into the world, viz. that he
          might gather together all in one. Eph. 1:16. Before they were
          scattered, some in heaven and some on earth, some mixed with wicked
          men, as wheat with tares, and as lilies among thorns. The church,
          therefore, now being made complete, will exceedingly rejoice. And
          Christ, having his mystical body complete, will rejoice in the
          completeness of his church, and the church will rejoice in its own
          completeness.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Then will the Mediator have fully accomplished the work for which
          he came into the world. Then will he have perfected the work of
          redemption, not only in the impetration, but also in the application
          of it. Then all that God has given him will be actually and fully
          redeemed, their bodies as well as souls. Then will he have conquered
          all his enemies, and will triumph over them all. Then he will have put
          down all authority and power. 1 Cor. 15:21, 22, “For since by man came
          death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam
          all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in
          his own order: Christ the first-fruits; afterwards they that are
          Christ’s, at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have
          delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have
          put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he must reign till
          he hath put all enemies under his feet.” Then Christ will surely have
          obtained that joy that was set before him. Then he shall have
          perfected the full design that was upon his heart from all eternity.
          And then Christ will rejoice, and all his members must rejoice with
          him. Christ shall triumph over his enemies, and the saints shall then
          triumph over all their enemies, and the joys of the triumph shall last
          forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Then God will have obtained the end of all his great works which he
          has been doing from the beginning of the world. Then will be the
          consummation of all thing. The deep designs of God will be unfolded,
          his marvelous contrivances, and his hidden, intricate, and
          inexplicable works, will appear. The end being obtained, as all things
          are from God, so will they then all be to him, and will issue in his
          glory. His power appeared in the beginning of them, and his glory will
          be manifested in the end and consummation of them. Then will it be
          seen that all the revolutions and changes which have existed from the
          beginning of the world are for God’s glory. Then it will appear how
          all the wheels of his providence have conspired together to bring
          about the glory of God and Christ, and the happiness of his people.
          And this will cause an exceeding accession of happiness to the saints
          who behold it. Then will God have fully glorified himself, and
          glorified his Son, and glorified his elect. Then he will see that all
          is very good, and will rejoice in his own works, which will be the joy
          of all heaven. Then will God rest and be refreshed, and thence forward
          will all the inhabitants of heaven keep an eternal Sabbath of rest and
          praise, such as never was kept before.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Then will be the marriage of the Lamb. When the church is
          completely purified and beautified, and nothing wanting, and all the
          parts of the body in their due proportion and joyful state. Then may
          the Lamb’s wife be said to have made herself ready. Then will she be
          as a bride prepared for her husband. And when the church is thus
          prepared by Christ at such great cost, at the shedding of his own
          blood; it will be brought to a more glorious union to Christ than ever
          before, and to a more intimate communion with him, and to a more high
          enjoyment of his excellency and love. Then will be the highest
          accomplishment of the joy spoken of in Rev. 19:7, 8, 9, “ Let us be
          glad and rejoice, and give honour to him; for the marriage of the Lamb
          is come; and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted
          that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white; for the
          fine linen is the righteousness of saints. And he saith unto me,
          write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of
          the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.” It
          will be the day of the gladness of Christ’s heart; the feast, and
          pomp, and holy mirth, and joy of this marriage day, will be continued
          to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Then will Christ present his church to his Father. The Father sent
          forth Christ into the world on that errand, to redeem a vast number of
          the children of men, and to bring them home to God, from whom they had
          apostatized, to bring them back to him, the great Creator and Father
          of all things, and the fountain of all good. Christ, having
          accomplished this, will bring them to God, and present them to him;
          and then may Christ say, as in Heb 2:13, “Here am I, and the children
          which thou hast given me;” none of them is missing; “of those that
          thou hast given me, I have lost nothing.” We read that Christ, when he
          shall have accomplished the work which the Father sent him to do,
          shall deliver up the kingdom to the Father. 1 Cor. 15:24, “Then cometh
          the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the
          Father; when he shall have put down all rule, and all authority and
          power.” And as he shall deliver up the kingdom, he shall present the
          subjects of the kingdom; and what he has obtained by ruling, he shall
          present as the fruits of his reign.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Then will God make a still more abundant manifestation and
          communication of himself. God shall be all in all. And the glory of
          God and the glory of his Son shall be displayed in heaven, in a more
          abundant manner than ever before. And he will put forth more
          plentifully of his Spirit, and will make answerable additions to the
          glory of the saints, such as will be becoming the commencement of the
          ultimate and most perfect state of things, and such as will become the
          joyful occasion of the marriage of the Lamb.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I shall now describe the nature and degree of the consummate and
          eternal glory and blessedness of the saints.
        </p>
        <p>1st. The nature of this glory and blessedness.</p>
        <p>
          1. I would begin with the lowest part of it, viz. the glory of the
          place. We have already observed that heaven is a place. They shall
          dwell in the most glorious part of the whole creation of God. It is
          called paradise. Luke 23:43, “And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say
          unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.” 2 Cor. 12:4, “How
          that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words,
          which it is not lawful for man to utter.” Rev. 2:7, “He that hath ears
          to hear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him
          that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in
          the midst of the paradise of God.” The word paradise signifies a most
          pleasant and delightful garden, of which the garden of Eden was a
          type. The garden of Eden was without doubt a place that was delightful
          beyond what we can easily conceive. But if this earthly paradise was
          so delightful, how pleasant and glorious may we conclude the heavenly
          paradise to be; that was not made merely top be the residence of some
          of the innocent creatures of God during their time of probation, as
          Eden was, but was prepared by infinite wisdom and skill for the
          everlasting dwelling-place of the great King of heaven and earth, and
          of his Son Jesus Christ; the place where they might show their glory,
          and wisdom, and love forever, and which is to be the habitation of
          confirmed saints and angels! When God made the universe, he made many
          parts of it for inferior uses, in which he displayed marvelous skill.
          Then he made the earth, and the sun, and moon, and stars, and the
          visible heavens, which appear truly glorious; but there was one part
          of the creation that God made more especially for himself, to be his
          own dwelling-place, the place of his glorious rest; and we may
          conclude that this is beyond all comparison more glorious than the
          other parts of it. If some parts of the visible world are so glorious,
          as the sun, moon, and stars how glorious may we conclude the highest
          heavens to be! This is the heavenly mount Zion, the royal city of the
          great God. It has been the ambition of earthly monarchs to make the
          cities where they dwell exceedingly magnificent. Thus the king of
          Babylon boasted, “Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the
          house of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honour of
          my majesty?” Dan. 4:30. Especially will kings have their own palaces
          most magnificent. But if those earthly cities and palaces are some of
          them so glorious, which are for the habitation of worms, how glorious
          may we think that to be which is for the glorious habitation of God
          Almighty! As the third heavens are higher than the earth, so we may
          expect that it is proportionally more glorious than any earthly
          garden, city, or palace. Heaven is not only the city of God, but his
          palace; not only his palace, but his throne. Isa. 66:1, “Thus saith
          the Lord, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is
          the house that ye build unto me; and where is the place of my rest?”
          We read how magnificent was Solomon’s throne. 1 Kin. 10:18, 19, 20,
          “Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with
          the best of gold. The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne
          was round behind: and there were stays on either side of the place of
          the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays. And twelve lions stood
          there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was
          not the like made in any kingdom.” But what is the throne of a
          glowworm? God does not want skill to make his palace and throne
          glorious enough to become the majesty and glory of him whose house and
          seat it is . The builder is God, and there is no want of skill in the
          architect. How glorious and magnificent was the temple of Solomon,
          that was built only to be the place of the special symbols of God’s
          presence on earth among his people Israel! How much more glorious is
          that heavenly temple which God himself has built, to be the place of
          his glorious presence among glorified saints and angels throughout all
          eternity! This is a place contrived on purpose to show the boundless
          riches of God’s grace and love. And therefore, God has not spared as
          to the delights and glories with which he has adorned the place. God
          is rich enough to make the place transcend all created glory. Earthly
          kings build their houses and palaces, and make them magnificent,
          according to their wealth and ability. But God is infinitely rich, he
          does not spare for the cost of the treasures to be laid out in
          adorning heaven, through fear of impoverishing himself. The glory of
          his residence is what we cannot conceive of; and this is one of those
          things spoken of in 1 Cor. 2:9, “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
          neither hath entered into the heart of man, the things which God hast
          prepared for them that love him.” Therefore in the descriptions that
          are given of it in the Scriptures, the images made use of to shadow it
          forth to us, are the most glorious with which we are conversant in the
          world. Such is the glorious description of it by John, as represented
          to him in the apocalyptic vision. Rev. 21:10-23, “And he carried me
          away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that
          great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
          having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most
          precious, even like a jasper-stone, clear as crystal. And the building
          of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto
          clear glass. And the foundations of the wall of the city was garnished
          with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper;
          the second sapphire; the third a chalcedony; the fourth an emerald;
          the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the
          eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the
          eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. And the twelve gates
          were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl; and the
          street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. And I
          saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the
          temple of it. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the
          moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the
          Lamb is the light thereof.” Heaven is here represented by a city whose
          very walls were made of precious stones. And the foundations were also
          all precious stones, and the gates were each a single pearl, and the
          very streets of the city were of pure gold; and yet it was something
          so excellent, as it appeared to John, that his comparing it to pure
          gold did not represent the excellency of it. It had also the beautiful
          transparency of clear glass. The apostle could find nothing on earth
          excellent enough adequately to represent its surpassing beauty. “The
          streets of the city were pure gold, like unto clear glass.” He goes on
          with the destruction in the beginning of the next chapter. Rev. 22:1,
          2-5, “And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as
          crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the
          midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there
          the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her
          fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of
          the nations. — And there shall be no night there; and they need no
          candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light:
          and they shall reign for ever and ever.” This glorious place shall be
          the residence of the saints forever. They shall dwell with him in
          their father’s house; they shall dwell in this house, for it is
          Christ’s house. He is the heir and owner of it, because he is the
          only-begotten Son of God; and the church shall dwell in it with
          Christ, because she is “the Lamb’s wife.” God has made heaven to be
          his won peculiar dwelling-place, and the dwelling-place of his
          children; when he made the world, he made heaven for them and
          therefore Christ says to them at the close of their trial, Mat. 25:34,
          “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
          from the foundation of the world.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The glory of the bodies of the saints; but this need not be
          insisted on here; as I have considered it already, when speaking of
          the resurrection. I would only observe, that however great the glory
          of the place is, the glory of their bodies will doubtless be far
          greater. For the place is made to be a dwelling-place for their
          glorious bodies, and the inhabitants will doubtless be more glorious
          than the habitation that is made for them; as the end is of greater
          value than the means. However bright heaven itself shall shine, the
          bodies of the saints themselves will shine far brighter, and appear
          far more beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The glory and beauty which God will put upon their souls, will as
          far exceed the beauty of their bodies, as the beauty of their bodies
          will far exceed the beauty of the place. Here will be their principal
          ornament, and if their bodies shall shine forth as the sun in the
          kingdom of their Father, how bright will their souls shine in the
          glorious image of God, made perfect in them! When they shall be
          presented to Christ, perfectly free from sin, without spot or wrinkle,
          or any such thing; then they shall appear holy and without blemish;
          their bodies shall not only be made like to Christ’s glorious body,
          but their souls like to his holy and glorified soul. They shall then
          shine with the glory of Christ reflected from them without anything to
          obscure the bright image. Their souls shall be made glorious in wisdom
          and knowledge; their faculties shall be exceedingly strengthened and
          enlarged, their eyes made perfectly clear, and divine light shall fill
          the soul, so that there shall be no darkness within, and perfect love
          shall reign in the heart. Divine love shall be strong; all the soul
          shall be as it were love. This love shall be exceedingly great in the
          principle of it, and shall always be in its highest exercise. Then
          shall humility also be brought to perfection. None can now express or
          conceive how pure and holy will be the disposition of the soul of a
          glorified saint, which shall be, as it were, all love all sweetness,
          all humility. The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit is said to be in
          the sight of God of great price, in this world. But how precious will
          such spiritual ornaments be heaven, when they shall be thus perfected!
          The souls of the saints are God’s jewels; and how bright will God make
          those his jewels shine in heaven, when he has polished them and fitted
          them to be gems in his own crown of glory! The soul of man, being
          spiritual and rational, is susceptible of incomparably greater beauty
          than the body, because the soul is capable of receiving the image of
          God, of which the body is not. And the souls of the saints, when God
          has perfected them, shall appear as the very image of God himself; and
          in the graces in which they shall shine shall be seen the glory of the
          divine workmanship in its perfection. And so lovely will they be, that
          there will be more loveliness and beauty in the soul of one saint than
          in all the glory and beauty of the place put together.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. They shall have great delight in the society and enjoyment of one
          another. We now do not know what enjoyment they will have in
          conversing together, and in communicating with each other; but
          doubtless it will be far more perfect than any we have now. The saints
          in heaven shall all be one society, they shall be united together
          without any schism, there shall be a sweet harmony, and a perfect
          union. There the saints shall see and converse with Noah, and Abraham,
          and Moses, and David, and Isaiah, and Paul, and all the holy martyrs;
          and they shall freely converse with them. It will be a most blessed
          society. There shall be no jars or contentions, nor breaking out among
          them; no manner of strife, nor envy, nor jealousy; no ill will, but
          perfect peace and perfect love through the whole society. Each one
          shall love every other with a most endeared and strong affection. Each
          one will be perfectly excellent and lovely, and will appear so in
          every other’s eyes. They will be delighted exceedingly in that lovely
          and perfect image of God, which each one shall see in every other.
          They shall manifest their love to each other in the most becoming and
          amiable manner, without anything ever to disturb or interrupt the
          peace of that blessed society. They shall manifest their love to each
          other in the most becoming and amiable manner, without anything ever
          to disturb or interrupt the peace of that blessed society. There shall
          be no mixture of wicked men among them as it is here in this world, to
          defile or dishonor their company. Here the visible churches of Christ
          are often defiled and dishonored by one wicked man or other, but that
          church above shall always be perfectly pure. Rev. 21:27, “And there
          shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither
          whatever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie; but they which are
          written in the Lamb’s book of life.” This blessed family being all
          united in one body, as having many members, shall all subserve and
          contribute to each other’s happiness, as the members of a body that is
          in perfect health. They shall delight to assist each other in their
          contemplations, communicating their glorious contemplations one to
          another. How sweetly will they converse together of the glories of God
          and Christ, and of God’s glorious works of power, and wisdom, and
          mercy! And how will they convey the bright conceptions and the
          raptures of joy from one soul to another, imparting to each other the
          sweet communications which they themselves receive from the glorious
          King of heaven! And how will they help one another in their praises to
          God and Christ, each one bearing his part in the heavenly melody,
          extolling the Most High! And what a glorious harmony of celestial
          voices without number will that be, when the whole assembly of the
          upper world shall together lift up the praises of God on high! John
          had this represented to him at a great distance, and tells us, Rev.
          14:2, “I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and
          as the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers,
          harping with their harps:” So ardent were they, and so great a
          multitude. And how will they rejoice in their numbers, to see so great
          a multitude all united, all perfectly holy, all full of mutual love,
          all fellow-citizens, all brethren!
        </p>
        <p>
          Here a question may arise, whether the saints, when they go to heaven,
          have any peculiar comfort in meeting with those who have been their
          pious friends on earth? I answer in the affirmative, and I think it is
          evident from 1 Thes. 4:13-18, “But I would not have you to be
          ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow
          not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus
          died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God
          bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that
          we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not
          prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from
          heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the
          trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which
          are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the
          clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the
          Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” Here it is
          evident,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1). That what the apostle mentions, as a matter of comfort to
          Christians respecting their departed Christian friends, is that they
          shall meet them, and see them again. It is not only that their
          departed friends, though dead, are happy, but they shall see them, and
          be with them again. This is here plainly asserted. Mourn not for them,
          says the apostle, as those that have no hope; for when Christ comes,
          God shall bring them again, and we which are alive shall be caught up
          with them; and so shall we be ever with the Lord together. Wherefore
          comfort one another with these words. The apostle therefore must be
          understood to mean, that they should comfort one another when
          mourners, with the consideration that they should hereafter be with
          their departed friends again in a glorious and happy state, and never
          part more.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2). That their will be something else that will give comfort in
          meeting them in a future state, than in seeing other saints. Otherwise
          why did the apostle mention it for their comfort, that they should see
          them again rather than other saints whom they had not seen or heard
          of? The apostle’s speaking thus to the Thessalonians might give them
          just ground to expect, that the peculiarly strong affection which they
          had cherished for their departure, would be again gratified by meeting
          them again. For this crossing of that affection was the ground of
          their mourning. If the Thessalonians knew, that to see their friends
          again in another world would be no gratification to the affection
          which they had for them as their friends, and did no way think or
          conceive of it as such; then to think of seeing them would be no more
          comfort to them or remedy to their sorrow, than to think that they
          should see any other saint that lived or died in another country, or
          in a past age; and that, because it would be no remedy to the ground
          and foundation of their mourning, viz. the crossing their affection to
          them as their friends; and if it would be no remedy to their mourning,
          to think thus respecting it, it never would have been mentioned to
          them by the apostle as a ground of comfort, or reason why they need
          not mourn. That was what they mourned for viz. that they should not
          have their affections towards them satisfied by seeing them, and
          conversing with them again. That for which the heathen here spoken of,
          that have no hope, mourned excessively, was that they should never
          more have that affection gratified again. Hence it follows that the
          special affection, which the saints have in this world to other saints
          who are their friends, will in some respects remain in another world.
          There is no reason why we should suppose that saints that have dwelt
          together in this world, and have showed kindness to each other, have
          been affectionate to each other’s true happiness, should not love one
          another with a love of gratitude for it in another world. There is no
          reason why good ministers whom God had made the instruments of
          salvation to others, should not have special joy in meeting their
          converts in heaven. 2 Cor. 1:14, “As also ye have acknowledged us in
          part that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours, in the day
          of the Lord Jesus.” 1 Thes. 2:19, 20, “For what is our hope, or joy,
          or crown of rejoicing? are not even ye in the presence of our Lord
          Jesus Christ at his coming? For ye are our glory and joy.” I see no
          reason why those that love one another with a virtuous love, and from
          such a love have shown kindness one to another, should not love one
          another the better for it in another world. There is no reason to
          think, that the friendship contracted here on earth between saints
          will be rooted out in another world. All natural affections, so far as
          founded in animal nature of the infirmity of the present state, will
          ceases in another world. And with respect to any affection that the
          godly have had to the finally reprobate, the love of God will wholly
          swallow it up, and cause it wholly to cease. But I see nothing that
          argues that one saint in glory may not have a special respect to
          another, because God made use of that other as an instrument to bring
          him into being, and thus made him the remote occasion of his
          happiness; or that, when pious parents lose pious children, they may
          not comfort themselves with the thought that they shall go to them, as
          probably David did when he said concerning his child, 2 Sam. 12:23,
          “But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back
          again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me:” Or that even
          a former acquaintance with persons and their virtues may not occasion
          a particular respect in another world. They may go to heaven with a
          desire to see them upon that very account. The impressions which they
          have of their amiable qualifications in consequence of their
          acquaintance with them here, may yet remain in another world.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The saints in heaven shall see and converse with Christ. They shall
          see Christ in a twofold sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1). They shall see him, as appearing in his glorified human nature,
          with their bodily eyes; and this will be a most glorious sight. The
          loveliness of Christ as thus appearing will be a most ravishing thing
          to them; for though the bodies of the saints shall appear with an
          exceeding beauty and glory, yet the body of Christ will without doubt
          immensely surpass them, as much as the brightness of the sun does that
          of the stars. The glorified body of Christ will be the masterpiece of
          all God’s workmanship the whole material universe. There shall be in
          his glorious countenance the manifestations of his glorious spiritual
          perfections, his majesty, his holiness, his surpassing grace, and
          love, and meekness. The eye will never be wearied with beholding this
          glorious sight. When Christ was transfigured in the mount, Peter was
          for making three tabernacles, the Christ, and Moses, and Elijah might
          remain there, and that the heavenly vision might never come to an end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Job had respect to this sight of Christ, and comforted himself with
          the thoughts of it, when he said, “For I know that my Redeemer liveth,
          and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though
          after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see
          God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not
          another; though my reins be consumed within me.” This will be the most
          glorious object that the saints will ever see with their bodily eyes.
          And there will be far more happiness redounding to the beholders from
          this sight than from any other; yea, the eyes of the glorified body
          will be given chiefly that the saints may behold this sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2). They shall see him with the eye of the soul. It is said, “They
          shall see him as he is.” 1 John 3:2, “And they shall know even as they
          are known.” 1 Cor. 13:12. They shall have a clear understanding of
          Christ as Mediator, how he has undertaken from all eternity to
          accomplish their salvation. They shall understand the glorious
          covenant of redemption between the Father and the Son. [They] shall
          see the eternal love Christ had to them before the foundation of the
          world. They shall in all probability understand the mystery of his
          incarnation. They shall know and understand the gloriousness of the
          way of salvation by Christ, “which things the angels desire to look
          into.” They shall have a full understanding of the infinite wisdom of
          God in contriving the plan of salvation. [They] shall comprehend the
          height, and depth, and length, and breadth of the love of Christ to
          sinners, in undergoing for them the agony of the garden, and the more
          overwhelming agonies of the cross. Now the heart is dull in the
          contemplation of such things. How often are they heard of by the
          saints on earth with but little affection! How often, when they see
          them set forth in the Lord’s supper, are they cold and lifeless! But
          then it shall not be so. Then the wonderful works of God, and the love
          of Christ in the work of redemption, will appear as they are. Then
          there will constantly without any interruption be a most lively and
          full sense of it, without any deadness or coldness. Everything in the
          work of redemption will appear in its true glory, the understanding
          shall be wonderfully opened, and it shall be perpetually like the
          clear hemisphere with the sun in the meridian, and there shall never
          come over one cloud to darken the mind. And then the saints shall see
          fully how the excellence and loveliness of Christ appear in all that
          he did and suffered. They shall see the liveliness of those
          excellencies that appeared in Christ’s human nature when on earth; his
          wonderful meekness and humility, his patience under suffering, his
          perfect obedience to the Father. And then shall they also see the
          beauty that appears in Christ’s human nature in its glorified state,
          wherein the excellencies of it shine without a veil. They shall also
          see the excellence of the divine nature of Christ. They shall behold
          clearly and immediately his divine majesty, and his divine and
          infinite holiness, and grace, and love. They shall see Christ as the
          perfect image of God, an image wherein all the glory of the divine
          nature is fully expressed. They shall behold him as the brightness of
          his Father’s glory; and they shall see that bright and perfect image
          of God which the Father beheld, and was infinitely happy in beholding,
          from all eternity. But this sight of the glory of Christ in his divine
          nature belongs to that beatific vision, of which I would speak more
          particularly hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          They shall not only see this glorious person, as at a distance, but
          they shall be admitted to be near him and to converse with him. This
          sight of his glory and loveliness will fill them with the most exalted
          love, which love will cause them to desire conversation; and they
          shall be admitted to it, to the full of their desires, and that at all
          times. Two things may be observed concerning this converse with
          Christ, to which the saints shall be admitted in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          One, it shall be most free and intimate. There shall be nothing to
          forbid them or deter them. Though Christ is so glorious a person, in
          so exalted a state in heaven, being Lord of heaven and earth, yet he
          will treat them as brethren, and they shall converse with him a
          friends. He will also honor them and advance them to the dignity of
          kings, that they may be fit to converse with so glorious a King. Rev.
          1:6, “And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to
          him be glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen.” Christ, when on
          earth, treated his disciples with great familiarity and freedom, he
          treated them as friends. John 15:15, “I call you not servants; for the
          servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I call you friends; for
          all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.”
          So in heaven he will not keep them at a greater distance, but admit
          them nearer; because they shall be fitted to be nearer to him and to
          converse more intimately with him. O how happy will it render them to
          have so great and honorable a person treating them with such grace and
          condescension!
        </p>
        <p>
          Though they shall see the awful majesty of Christ, that will not make
          them afraid, because they will see his love, and grace, and
          condescension, equal to his majesty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two, this converse shall be most full and satisfying. This is evident
          from that most emphatic expression of the church being “the bride, the
          Lamb’s wife.” He will open the infinite and eternal fountain of his
          love to them, and will pour forth that fountain into their hearts.
          This love will be as a pure river of water of life, a river of
          pleasures, constantly flowing into the souls of the saints, that shall
          be in them as rivers of living water. And they shall also in their
          converse with Christ manifest their love to him. Their hearts shall
          flow out in an unceasing stream, or ascend continually in a rapturous
          transport of love. Of those things we can say but little now; yet
          sometimes when God helps us we can conceive of them a little, but it
          is but a little at the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The saints in heaven shall see God. They shall not only see that
          glorious city, and the saints there, and the holy angels, and the
          glorified body of Christ; but they shall see God himself. This is
          promised to the saints. Mat. 5:8, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for
          they shall see God.” 1 Cor. 13:12, “For now we see through a glass
          darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I
          know even as also I am know.” This is that which is called by divines,
          “the beatific vision,” because this is that in which the blessedness
          of the saints in glory does chiefly consist. This is the fountain, the
          infinite fountain of their blessedness. The sight of Christ, which has
          already been spoken of, is not here to be excluded, for he is a divine
          person; the sight of him in his divine nature therefore belongs to the
          beatifical vision. This vision of God is the chief bless of heaven,
          and therefore I would speak of it a little more particularly. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1). As to the faculty that is the subject of this vision. It is no
          sight of anything with the bodily eyes; but is an intellectual view.
          The beatific vision of God is no a sight with the eyes of the body,
          but with the eyes of the soul. There is no such thing as seeing God
          properly with the bodily eyes, because he is a spirit. One of his
          attributes is that he is invisible. 1 Tim. 1:17, “Now unto the King
          eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory
          for ever and ever.” Col. 1:15, “Who is the image of the invisible God,
          the firstborn of every creature.” Heb. 11:27, “By faith he forsook
          Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing
          him who is invisible.” This highest blessedness of the soul does not
          enter in at the door of the bodily senses. This would be to make the
          blessedness of the soul dependent on the body, or the happiness of
          man’s superior part to be dependent on the inferior. The beatific
          vision of God is not any sight with the bodily eyes, because the
          separate souls of the saints, and the angels which are mere spirits,
          and never were united to body, have this vision. Mat. 18:10, “Take
          heed that ye despise not one of these little ones: for I say unto you,
          that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father
          which is in heaven.” It is not in beholding any form or visible
          representation, or shape, or color, or shining light, in which the
          highest happiness of the soul consists; but it is in seeing God, who
          is a spirit, spiritually, with the eyes of the soul. We have no reason
          to think that there is any such thing as God’s manifesting himself by
          any outward glorious appearance, that is, the symbol of his presence
          in heaven, any otherwise than by the glorified body of Christ. God was
          wont in the Old Testament, oftentimes to manifest himself by an
          outward glory, and sometimes in an outward shape, or the form of a
          man. But when God manifested himself thus, it was by Christ. It was
          the second person of the Trinity only that was wont thus to appear to
          men in an outward glory and human shape. John 1:18, “No man hath seen
          God at any time; the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the
          Father, he hath declared him.” But since Christ has actually assumed a
          human body, there is no need of his assuming any aerial form or shape
          anymore. The Deity now became visible to the bodily eyes in a more
          perfect manner by his having a real body. The saints that shall see
          Christ in heaven in his glorified body, much more properly see Christ
          than if they only saw an assumed shape, or some outward glorious
          appearance, as the symbol of his presence. For now, that which they
          see is not only a glorious appearance by which Christ is represented,
          but the real Christ; it is his own body. The seeing God in the
          glorified body of Christ, is the most perfect way of seeing God with
          the bodily eyes that can be. For in seeing a real body, which one of
          the persons of the Trinity has assumed to be his body, and in which he
          dwells forever as his own, the divine majesty and excellency appear as
          much as it is possible for them to appear in outward form or shape.
          The saints do actually see a divine person with bodily eyes, and in
          the same manner as we see one another. But when God showed himself
          under outward appearances and symbols of his presence only, that was
          not so proper a sight of a divine person, and it was a more imperfect
          way of God’s manifesting himself, suitably to the more imperfect state
          of the church under the Old Testament. But now Christ really subsists
          in a glorified body. Those outward symbols and appearances are done
          away, as being needless and imperfect. This more imperfect way
          therefore is altogether needless, seeing Christ there appears as a
          glorified body.
        </p>
        <p>
          This seems to be one end of God’s assuming a human body, viz. that the
          saints might see God with bodily eyes; that they may see him, not only
          in the understanding, but in every way of seeing of which the human
          nature is capable; that we might see God as a divine person as we see
          one another. And there is no need of God the Father’s manifesting
          himself in any other glorious form; for he that sees the Son, sees the
          Father, John 14:9. And that because he is the image of the invisible
          God. Col. 1:15. — Heb. 1:3, “Who being the brightness of his glory,
          and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the
          word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on
          the right hand of the Majesty on high.” But if there be any outward
          symbol by which God the Father represents himself in heaven; seeing
          that is not the beatific vision, for that is a far more imperfect way
          of seeing God than seeing him with the eye of the soul. The soul is
          capable of apprehending God in a thousand times more perfect and
          glorious manner than the eye of the body is. The soul has in itself
          those powers whereby it is sufficiently capable of apprehending
          spiritual objects without looking through the windows of the outward
          senses. The soul is capable of seeing God more immediately, and more
          certainly, and more fully and gloriously, than the eye of the body is.
        </p>
        <p>(2). The act of vision. And,</p>
        <p>
          One, it will be an immediate sight, it will be no apprehension of
          God’s excellency by acquiring it from his works. Neither will it be
          such a spiritual sight of God as the saints have in this world, seeing
          him in his word and making use of his ordinances, which is called
          seeing “through a glass darkly.” Then they shall see him “face to
          face.” 1 Cor. 13:12. They shall not only see the glory of God as
          reflected from other things, but they shall see him as we see the sun,
          by his own light in a clear hemisphere. It will be an intuitive view
          of God. What knowledge the saints have of God in this world is like
          the twilight before sun-rising; it is not the direct light of the sun,
          but the light of the sun reflected, and it is comparatively a dim
          light. But hereafter the saints shall enjoy the perfect day, they
          shall see God as we immediately behold the sun after it is risen above
          the horizon, and no cloud or vapor in the heavens to hinder its sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two, it shall be, according to men’s capacity, a perfect sight. It
          shall not be a perfectly comprehensive sight, because it is impossible
          that a saint’s mind should comprehend God; but yet it shall be perfect
          in its kind, it shall be perfectly certain, without any doubt or
          possibility of doubt. There shall be a view of God in his being, and
          in his power, and wisdom, and holiness, and goodness, and love, and
          all-sufficiency, that shall be attended with intuitive certainty,
          without any mixture of unbelief, and with much greater certainty than
          any sight with the bodily eye. And then it shall be perfectly clear
          without any view of darkness. Now, how much darkness is there mingled
          with that spiritual sight, which the saints have of God’s glory in
          this world! But then, there shall be no obscurity, nothing to cloud
          the understanding, or to hinder the clearness of the view. God shall
          be hid with no veil, neither shall there be any veil in the heavens.
          And this sight shall be most enlarged. They shall see vastly more of
          the glory of God than any of the saints do in this world; the souls of
          the saints shall be like the angels in extensiveness of understanding.
        </p>
        <p>(3). The object of this vision: concerning which I observe,</p>
        <p>
          One, they shall see everything in God that tends to excite and inflame
          love, i. e. everything that is lovely, everything that tends to exalt
          their esteem and admiration, to warm and endear the heart. They shall
          behold the infinite excellency and glory of God, shall have a
          blessed-making sight of his glorious majesty and of his infinite
          holiness; shall see as those angels do, of whom we read in Isa. 6:3,
          “That, standing before the throne, they cry, Holy, holy, holy is the
          Lord of hosts,” and shall behold the infinite grace and goodness of
          God. Then shall that glorious fountain and ocean be opened fully to
          their view. Then shall they behold all its excellency and loveliness,
          they shall have a clear sight of his immense glory and excellency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two, they shall see everything in God that gratifies love. They shall
          see in him all that love desires. Love desires the love of the
          beloved. So the saints in glory shall see God’s transcendent love to
          them. God will make ineffable manifestations of his love to them. They
          shall see as much love in God towards them as they desire. They
          neither will nor can crave any more. This very manifestation that God
          will make of himself that will cause the beatific vision, will be an
          act of love in God. It will be from the exceeding love of God to them
          that he will give them this vision, which will add an immense
          sweetness to it. When they see God so glorious, and at the same time
          see how greatly this God loves them, what delight will it not cause in
          the soul! Love desires union. They shall therefore see this glorious
          God united to them, and see themselves united to him. They shall see
          that he is their Father, and that they are his children. They shall
          see God gloriously present with them; God with them; and God in them;
          and they in God. Love desires the possession of its object. Therefore
          they shall see God, even their own God. When they behold this
          transcendent glory of God, they shall see him as their own. When they
          shall see that glory, power, and wisdom of God, they shall see it as
          altogether engaged for them. When they shall see the beauty of God’s
          holiness, they shall see it as their own, for them to enjoy forever.
          When they see the boundless ocean of God’s goodness and grace, they
          shall see it to be all theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4). The manner in which they shall see and enjoy God; and that is as
          having communion with Christ therein. The saints shall enjoy God, as
          partaking with Christ of his enjoyment of God; for they are united to
          him, and are glorified and made happy in the enjoyment of God as his
          members. As the members of the body partake of the life and health of
          the head, so the saints in glory shall be happy as partaking of the
          blessedness of the Son of God. They being in Christ, shall partake of
          the love of God the Father to Christ. And as the Son knows the Father,
          so they shall partake with him in his sight of God, as being as it
          were parts of him. As he is in the bosom of the Father, so are they in
          the bosom of the Father. As he has immense joy in the love of the
          Father, so have they, every one of them in their measure, the same joy
          in the Father’s love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Herein they shall enjoy God in a more exalted and excellent manner
          than man would have done if he had never fallen; for doubtless that
          happiness, that Christ himself partakes of in his Father’s bosom, is
          transcendently sweet and excellent. And how happy therefore are they
          who are admitted to partake of that portion of delight with him!
        </p>
        <p>
          (5). The agent by whom this vision of God shall be communicated; viz.
          the Holy Spirit. As it is by the Holy Spirit that a spiritual sight of
          God is given in this world, so it is the same Holy Spirit by whom the
          beatific vision is given of God in heaven. The saints in heaven are as
          dependent on God for all their happiness, and all their holiness, and
          all their light, as those on earth. There all is from God by his Holy
          Spirit, just as it is here. they shall have the beatific vision of God
          because they will be full of God, filled with the Holy spirit of God.
          The Holy Ghost is the pure river of water of life that proceeds from
          the throne of God and the Lamb, spoken of in Rev. 22:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6). The effects of this vision. And these are, that the soul shall be
          inflamed with love, and satisfied with pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          One, it shall be inflamed with love. The soul shall not be an inactive
          spectator, but shall be most active, and in the most ardent exercise
          of love towards the object seen. The soul shall be as it were all eyes
          to behold, and yet all act to love. The soul shall be as full of love
          as it shall be of light, and of both it shall be as full as it can
          hold. The understanding will be in its most perfect act in loving.
          This love will be perfectly such as it ought to be. It shall be
          perfectly humble, the soul shall be in its place at all times, adoring
          at God’s feet, and yet embraced in the arms of his love. This love
          shall excite them to praise. And therefore, singing praises and
          hallelujahs shall be that in which they shall unweariedly be employed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two, this sight of God shall satisfy the soul with pleasure. So great
          will the joy be that the soul will desire no greater. It shall be as
          full of grace, as the large desires of the soul can receive. So sweet
          shall it be, that the soul will desire nothing sweeter. So pure and
          excellent will it be, that the soul will desire nothing better. Psa.
          17:15, “As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness: I shall
          be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.” When the soul beholds
          the glory and love of God; it shall receive satisfying pleasure, for
          it shall receive God. God will communicate, and as it were pour forth
          himself into the soul. And with what inexpressible sweetness and
          complacency will the soul open itself to be thus filled, as the
          flowers open before the sun to be filled with his light and pleasant
          influences!
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. Having thus considered wherein the eternal happiness of the
          saints consists, I proceed next to consider some circumstances of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It will add sweetness to the happiness of heaven, that it is all
          the fruit of free grace, and the dying love of Christ. The saints in
          this world are of that spirit that they choose the way of salvation by
          free and sovereign grace. And salvation in this way seems better and
          sweeter by far, than if they could have it by their own works. Much
          more will this exceedingly heighten the sweetness of their happiness
          when they are in heaven, when their love, and their humility, will be
          perfect, when they will be abundantly more sensible than they are now,
          what vile creatures they were in this world. And when they consider to
          what exceeding glory God has advanced them, what a sweet admiration
          will it excite in them of the free and boundless grace of God! And
          what a sweetness will it add, that all this glorious blessedness which
          they possess, is not of themselves, but is the fruit of the love of
          that glorious person whom they shall then see in his glory, the fruit
          of his dying love, that it was bought by his own precious blood! It
          adds greatly to the value of a gift, if we receive if from a dear
          friend as a token of his love. But how greatly then will heaven be the
          more prized by the saints, when they consider it as the fruit of his
          love who is so glorious and excellent, and who is so exceedingly
          beloved by them!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It will give them the greater sense of their own blessedness, when
          they contemplate the misery of those who are finally lost, and
          consider how exceedingly different is their own state. The saints will
          witness the misery of the wicked, they shall see their state at the
          day of judgment, they shall see them at the left hand with devils,
          shall hear the sentence pronounced, and see it executed. This shall
          greatly heighten the sense of their own happy state, when they
          consider how different their own state is, how differently God has
          dealt with themselves from what he has done with the wicked; when they
          see how dreadful the misery is from which they are delivered, and
          which they must have unavoidably suffered, had not God graciously
          redeemed them; when they consider that they deserved this misery as
          well as those that suffer it, but that Christ has of his free grace
          redeemed them. This will give exalted thoughts of the free grace of
          God, and cause them exceedingly to admire it, and will greatly
          heighten their exercises of love to him who has been so gracious to
          them, and consequently will heighten their joy in his love. As the
          damned when they contemplate the happiness of the saints in heaven
          will find their own misery aggravated, so the saints in heaven when
          they contemplate the misery of the damned in hell, will feel a greater
          sense of their own happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There are different degrees of happiness and glory in heaven. As
          there are degrees among the angels, viz. thrones, dominions,
          principalities, and powers; so there are degrees among the saints. In
          heaven are many mansions, and of different degrees of dignity. The
          glory of the saints above will be in some proportion to their eminency
          in holiness and good works here. Christ will reward all according to
          their works. He that gained ten pounds was made ruler over ten cities,
          and he that gained five pounds over five cities. Luke 19:17; 2 Cor.
          9:6, “He that soweth sparingly, shall reap sparingly; and he that
          soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.” And the apostle Paul
          tells us that, as one star differs from another star in glory, so also
          it shall be in the resurrection of the dead. 1 Cor. 15:41. Christ
          tells us that he who gives a cup of cold water unto a disciple in the
          name of a disciple, shall in no wise lose his reward. But this could
          not be true, if a person should have no greater reward for doing many
          good works than if he did but few. It will be no damp to the happiness
          of those who have lower degrees of happiness and glory, that there are
          others advanced in glory above them. For all shall be perfectly happy,
          every one shall be perfectly satisfied. Every vessel that is cast into
          this ocean of happiness is full, though there are some vessels far
          larger than others. And there shall be no such thing as envy in
          heaven, but perfect love shall reign through the whole society. Those
          who are not so high in glory as other, will not envy those that are
          higher, but they will have so great, and strong, and pure love to
          them, that they will rejoice in their superior happiness. Their love
          to them will be such that they will rejoice that they are happier than
          themselves; so that instead of having a damp to their own happiness,
          it will add to it. They will see it to be fit that they that have been
          most eminent in works of righteousness should be most highly exalted
          in glory. And they will rejoice in having that done, that is fittest
          to be done. There will be a perfect harmony in that society; those
          that are most happy will also be most holy, and all will be both
          perfectly holy and perfectly happy. But yet there will be different
          degrees of both holiness and happiness according to the measure of
          each one’s capacity, and therefore those that are lowest in glory will
          have the greatest love to those that are highest in happiness, because
          they will see most of the image of God in them. And having the
          greatest love to them, they will rejoice to see them the most happy
          and the highest in glory. And so, on the other hand, those that are
          highest in glory, as they will be the most lovely, so they will be
          fullest of love. As they will excel in happiness, they will
          proportionally excel in divine benevolence and love to others, and
          will have more love to God and to the saints than those that are lower
          in holiness and happiness. And besides, those that will excel in glory
          will also excel in humility. Here in this world, those that are above
          others are the objects of envy, because that others conceive of them
          as being lifted up with it. But in heaven it will not be so, but those
          saints in heaven who excel in happiness will also in holiness, and
          consequently in humility. The saints in heaven are more humble than
          the saints on earth, and still the higher we go among them the greater
          humility there is. The highest orders of saints, who know most of God,
          see most of the distinction between God and them, and consequently are
          comparatively least in their own eyes, and so are more humble. The
          exaltation of some in heaven above the rest will be so far from
          diminishing the perfect happiness and joy of the rest who are
          inferior, that they will be the happier for it. Such will be the union
          in their society that they will be partakers of each other’s
          happiness. Then will be fulfilled in its perfection that which is
          declared in 1 Cor. 12:26, “If one of the members be honoured all the
          members rejoice with it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This happiness of the saints shall never have any interruption.
          There will never be any alloy to it; there never will come any cloud
          to obscure their light; there never will be anything to cool their
          love. The rivers of pleasure will not fail, the glory and love of God
          and of Christ will forever be the same and the manifestation of it
          will have no interruption. No sin or corruption shall ever enter
          there, no temptation to disturb their blessedness. The divine love in
          the saints shall never cool, there shall be no inconsistency in any of
          them. The faculties of the saints shall never flag from exercise; and
          they will never be cloyed, their relish for those delights will
          forever be kept up to its height, that glorious society shall not grow
          weary of their hallelujahs. Their exercises, though they are so active
          and vigorous, will be performed with perfect ease. The saints shall
          not be weary of loving, and praising, and fearing, as the sun is never
          weary of shining.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. And to sum up this whole description, there shall never be any end
          to their glory and blessedness. Therefore is it so often called
          eternal life, and everlasting life. We are told that at the day of
          judgment, when the wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment,
          the righteous shall enter into life eternal. Mat. 25:46. The pleasures
          which there are at God’s right hand, are said to be forevermore; Psa.
          16:11. And that this is not merely a long duration, but an absolute
          eternity, is evident from that which Christ has said, that those who
          believe on him shall not die. John. 6:50. Rev. 22:5. In the
          description of the new Jerusalem it is said, “And they shall reign for
          ever and ever.” The eternity of this blessedness shall crown all. If
          the saints knew that there would be an end to their happiness, though
          at never so great a distance, yet it would be a great damp to their
          joy. The greater the happiness is, so much the more uncomfortable
          would the thoughts of an end be, and so much the more joyful will it
          be to think that there will be no end. The saints will surely know
          that there will be no more danger of their happiness coming to an end,
          than there will be that the being of God will come to an end. As God
          is eternal, so their happiness is eternal. As long as the fountain
          lasts, they need not fear but they shall be supplied.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          I. Hence we learn how great a mercy conversion is, because it confers
          upon him who is exposed to eternal misery a right to all this
          blessedness. Man, as he is naturally, is very far from this
          blessedness. We came into the world wretched, miserable, undone
          creatures, in cruel bondage to sin and Satan, under guilt and under
          wrath, and at enmity against God, the fountain of blessedness, and in
          a state of condemnation to everlasting destruction. But when a man is
          converted there is a great change made in his state; he is that day
          passed from death to life, he is brought out of that state of woe and
          misery into a sure title to glory, honor, and peace forever. When once
          a man is converted all this blessedness that we have heard of is his,
          he has an absolute right to it, God’s work is passed for it, his
          faithful promise is given. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but that
          promise of God shall not fail, but shall be fulfilled. Their witness
          is in heaven, and their record on high. On that day in which a man is
          converted he enters into a blessed state, he is sure to be a blessed
          person as long as he lives. And he has a right to all that blessedness
          we have heard of, at death, and in a state of separation, and at the
          day of judgment, and to that glory which the saints have in their
          state of consummate glory and blessedness. This teaches how great and
          how blessed a change conversion is in its consequences, and what cause
          have they who have good ground to think that they have been the
          subjects of it, to bless, and praise, and extol the name of God, when
          they consider what a situation they were once in, and what a happy
          state they are now in; for the bringing them out of that miserable
          state into so glorious a state is owing only to free and sovereign
          grace. 1 Cor. 4:7, “Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what
          hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now, if thou didst receive it,
          why dost thou glory as it thou hadst not received it?”
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Hence we may learn the folly of those that are cold and slack in
          seeking salvation, seeing that the glory and happiness of those who
          are saved is so exceedingly great. How unreasonable is it to expect to
          obtain that which is so great without effort! Men will seek worldly
          riches and honors that are worth so little, and cannot make them
          happy, and will soon vanish away, with great and indefatigable labor
          and diligence. And shall men expect to obtain such eternal glory and
          blessedness in a slack and cold way of seeking it? How unlike the
          nature and importance of this blessedness do men treat it that seek it
          in a cold and careless manner! And can it be expected that God will
          also treat it so unlike its value, as to bestow it upon such seekers?
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Hence we may solve the difficulty of some Christians meeting with
          so much affliction and darkness in the world. Some godly persons are
          the subjects of very great outward afflictions, and some are the
          subjects of great spiritual darkness. Some truly godly persons spend
          great part of their lives in the dark, in exercising doubts, and
          anxious thoughts, and distressing fears. And oftentimes God’s people
          make this an argument against themselves. They argue that if God loved
          them, and had made them his children, he would never leave them in
          such darkness and distress, he would give them more of the light of
          his countenance. They are ready to say with themselves, if God loves
          me, why does he not give me more comfort, why does he see me in such
          darkness, and does not comfort me? But what we have heard may solve
          all the difficulty. If their happiness throughout all eternity be so
          great, of how little consequence is it what may be their condition for
          that short moment they continue in this world! What if they are in the
          dark, what if they walk in darkness and are exercised with great
          trouble! How little difference will it make, though it be cast into
          the scales, when weighed against that far more exceeding and eternal
          weight of glory! It will prove lighter than vanity. If God gives
          eternal happiness to them, that is evident proof of his love, and all
          the darkness and sorrow they can meet with in this world are not
          worthy to be mentioned. All this darkness, how long soever continued,
          if we compare it with future glory, vanishes into nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. This subject furnishes solid ground of consolation to the
          righteous. What can be matter of greater joy and comfort to any
          person, than to consider that he is entitled to such eternal
          blessedness? Here is sufficient consolation under all adversity;
          whatever changes we meet with in the world, this may be matter of
          abundant comfort under the greatest and heaviest trials. In these
          things a Christian may well rejoice, though the fig tree should not
          blossom, and there should be no fruit in the vine. Having this firm
          support and consolation, a Christina will not fear though the earth be
          removed, and the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let these things, therefore, comfort thee, who fearest and lovest God
          and trustest in Christ. What a glorious hope, and incorruptible, and
          undefiled, and never-fading inheritance, are reserved in heaven for
          thee! Hence I would answer an objection or two, that unbelief in the
          saint may be ready to make against what has been said.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, some may be ready to say, this glory and blessedness are so
          great and wonderful that it seems too great to be given to such
          creatures as men are. It seems almost incredible that God should so
          exalt and advance worms of the dust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer. The death and suffering of Christ made everything credible
          that belongs to this blessedness. If God has not thought his own Son
          too much for us, what will he think too much for us? If God did not
          spare him, but gave him even to be made a reproach, and a curse, and a
          victim to death for us, no blessedness, however great, can be
          incredible which is the fruit of this. Rom. 8:32, “He that spared not
          his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with
          him also freely give us all things?” If God would so contrive to show
          his love in the manner and means of procuring our happiness, nothing
          can be incredible in the degree of the happiness itself. If nothing be
          too much to be given to man, and to be done for man in the manner of
          procuring his happiness, nothing will be too much to be given to him
          as the happiness procured, and no degree of happiness too great for
          him to enjoy. If all that God does about it be consistent, his
          infinite wisdom will also work, to make their happiness and glory
          great in the degree of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, some Christians may still be ready to object. It is not too
          great to be bestowed on others, yet it seems to me too great to be
          bestowed on such an unworthy creature as I. It seems incredible that
          God should ever give such glory to such an one as I am, that am so
          mean, and so worthless, and vile. I not only was once unworthy, but I
          am so unworthy still, I am so blind, I have so much sin, and so little
          goodness, I commit so much sin, and do so little good, that it appears
          incredible that I should have a title to such blessedness. I can far
          more easily think that others will possess it than myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer. It is no way incredible that infinite grace should bestow it
          on the meanest and unworthiest. God’s design is to glorify his free
          grace, and this is one way by which free grace is glorified, viz. by
          bestowing such great blessedness on the most unworthy. This is of a
          piece with the rest. Everything in the work of redemption is
          wonderful, and therefore one of the names by which Christ is called,
          is Wonderful. As grace is wonderful in the means of procurement, viz.
          giving Christ to die, and wonderful in the degree of happiness
          procured; so it is wonderful with respect to the subjects of it, that
          they are in themselves so mean and unworthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. This subject furnishes ground of solemn exhortation to natural men,
          earnestly to seek this blessedness. And here you may well consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, how poor you are who have no heaven but this world! In this
          exceeding and eternal glory of which you have heard, you have no lot
          or portion. You have nothing but a little part of this clod of earth.
          And what is all that you have worth? If you have a little more land
          than some of your neighbors, or if you are in a way to make more money
          than others, if your accommodations are better than others, and you
          have more worldly conveniences and pleasures than others, or if you
          are promoted a little higher among men than some others are, what a
          poor portion is this. And how miserable are you who have no better
          happiness that you can call your own! How happy do these things make
          you, what great satisfaction do they yield to you! Are such things as
          these the rivers of pleasure that you choose for your portion? O, how
          miserable are you that have your portion in this life! When a few days
          are passed you must go to the grave and into eternity, and then your
          glory shall not descend after you. And how wretched are they of whom
          it may be said, when they have done with worldly enjoyments, that they
          have received their consolation! Luke 6:24.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, to what misery are you exposed! You not only have no lot in
          this happiness and glory, but you are hanging over endless misery, and
          are in danger every day of being irrecoverably lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, you have now an opportunity to obtain this blessedness. It is
          true that now you are exposed to this misery, but yet this glory is
          offered to you. The time is not past wherein the offer is made. You
          have yet an opportunity to be made happy forever. The opportunity you
          now have to obtain the happiness of another world, is worth ten
          thousands of this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here I would say something by way of direction in answer to this.
        </p>
        <p>Inquiry. What must I be brought to in order to get to heaven?</p>
        <p>
          Answer. 1. You must be brought entirely to renounce all hope of
          obtaining heaven by anything that you can do by your own strength, —
          that you cannot do it either directly or indirectly. Many are sensible
          that they cannot get to heaven by their own strength directly, but yet
          they hope to do it indirectly; they hope by their own strength to
          bring themselves to a disposition to close with Christ, and accept of
          him for a Savior. They are hoping to bring themselves to a compliance
          with the terms of salvation. You must be brought off from all
          confiding in your own strength; and you must also be brought to
          renounce your own righteousness as the price of heaven. The
          consideration of what has been said of the glory and happiness of the
          saints, may show us the exceeding folly of those that think to
          purchase so great happiness by their own righteousness. What a vain
          thought have men of their performances to think them a sufficient
          price to offer to God to purchase such glory of him! How would God
          dishonor himself, and dishonor such riches of his own goodness, if he
          should bestow them on men for their righteousness, and should accept
          their miserable performances as the price of them!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Your heart must be brought to close with him who has purchased
          heaven. Renouncing all other ways, your heart must entirely close with
          him, and adhere to him, as the way, the truth, and the life. Your
          heart must be drawn to him, and it must be pleasing and sweet to you
          to have heaven as a free gift, as the fruit of mercy and saving grace,
          and you must assuredly believe that Christ is a sufficient Savior, and
          your soul must acquiesce in the way of salvation by him, by his blood
          and his righteousness, as wise, holy, sufficient, and excellent way.
          Your heart must incline to Jesus Christ as a Savior above your own
          righteousness and all other ways. Your delight must be in this holy
          way of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. You must choose the God of heaven for your portion. You must be of
          the same temper and disposition with the psalmist, who says, Psa.
          73:25, “Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none on the earth
          whom I desire beside thee.” You must esteem and relish the enjoyment
          of him far above all other things. You must be brought to see that
          there is that in the enjoyment of God and communion with him that is
          far better than all the profits or pleasures of the world. It must be
          so with you, that if you could have your choice of all kinds of
          happiness you could devise, and have which you would, and in what
          degree you would, to all eternity, this would be what you would far
          prefer.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Your heart must be brought sincerely to close with the employments
          of heaven. In heaven they are not idle, but they are continually
          employed, and their employments are holy employments. They spend their
          time wholly in holy exercises; in contemplating on God, in praising
          and serving him. Rev. 22:3, “And there shall be no more curse: but the
          throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall
          serve him.” If ever you go to heaven, your heart must be brought
          beforehand to such a temper as freely to choose such employments, you
          must have a relish of them, and must account them excellent and
          delightful employments.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. You must be pure in heart, and clean in hands. The pure in heart
          alone shall see God. Mat. 5:8. They that shall ascend into God’s holy
          hill, are those that are of pure hearts and clean hands. Psa. 24:4.
          You must have and abhor all sin, and allow none in your life. Sin must
          become to you a great burden. You must loathe yourself for it, and
          fight and strive against it, to purge yourself more and more from it;
          striving more and more to mortify sin, earnestly desiring and seeking
          to be more holy, more conformed to the will of God, and to walk more
          becoming a Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. You must be brought to sell all for heaven. Mat. 13:44, 45, 46.
          Heaven must be to you like the treasure hid in a field; or like the
          pearl of great price. If you would have heaven, you must take it as
          your whole portion. You must in your heart part with all other things
          for it, and it must be your manner actually to part with them whenever
          they stand in the way of your getting forward towards heaven. If you
          would have heaven, you must sell your worldly profit and your credit,
          and the good will of your neighbors, and your worldly pleasures and
          conveniences, and whatever stands in your way. Many flatter themselves
          that they shall obtain heaven without this, and think they have a
          right to heaven, though they were never brought to this, but they are
          sure to find themselves disappointed.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. You must never expect to go to heaven in any other than a strait
          and narrow way. Some expect to get to heaven who are not walking in a
          narrow way. The way they are walking in is a way of indulging their
          ease, and of shifting off the hard and difficult parts of religion. It
          is not the ways of self-denial, and toil, and laboriousness, but they
          walk in a broad way, a way wherein they are not pinched, but can go on
          without labor, or watchfulness, or bearing the cross. But such as
          these, let their hopes be what they may, and their profession what it
          may, and their pretenses to experiences what they may, are not like to
          get to heaven. To some, the way that the Scripture has laid out is too
          narrow and strait. Therefore they are endeavoring to get to heaven in
          a broad way; but it is in vain for you to contrive this. If you can
          find out any way of getting to heaven that is not a strait and narrow
          way, it will be a way that you are the first inventor of. If you go
          thither, you must go in the way of the footsteps of the flock. If you
          would go to heaven, you must be content to go there in the way of
          self-denial and sufferings, you must be willing to take up the cross
          daily and follow Christ, and through much tribulation to enter into
          the kingdom of heaven.

          VI. This subject furnishes ground of solemn exhortation to the godly,
          to strive earnestly after holiness of life. What manner of persons
          ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness, who have
          received such infinite mercy of God, and entertain such glorious
          hopes. Seeing God has admitted you to such happiness, earnestly labor
          that you may walk in some measure answerably; seeing God has admitted
          you to the happiness of children, walk as children. Eph. 5:1. Be ye
          therefore followers of God as dear children; imitate your heavenly
          Father; be ye holy, for he is holy. Seeing that you are admitted to
          the blessedness of disciples and friends of Jesus, walk as the friends
          of Christ, imitate your glorious Lord and Head. Here consider several
          things: particularly,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, what great love God hath bestowed upon you in choosing you to
          such unspeakable blessedness before the foundation of the world. How
          wonderful was the love of God in giving his Son to purchase this
          blessedness for you, and how wonderful was the love of the Son of God
          in shedding his own blood to purchase such glory for you! How ought
          you therefore to live to God’s glory! Let me therefore beseech, by
          those great mercies of God, that you give yourself up a living
          sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your reasonable
          service. And be not slothful in business, but fervent in spirit,
          serving the Lord. Give the utmost diligence that you may keep al the
          commandments of God. Study that you may prove what is that good, and
          acceptable, and perfect will of God. Study that in all things you may
          be found approved. Seeing God hath so loved you, see that you love one
          another; let love be without dissimulation. Be ye kindly affectioned
          one with another with brotherly love. Be of the same mind one towards
          another, in honor preferring one another; have fervent charity among
          yourselves. Seeing God hath mercy on you, be ye merciful as your
          Father which is in heaven is merciful. Look not every one on his own
          things. Be pitiful, be courteous; be ready to distribute, willing to
          communicate; be kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
          another. Christ hath thus loved you while an enemy; therefore
          recompense to no man evil for evil, but contrariwise blessing. Do good
          to them that do evil to you. Such things as these become those that
          are the heirs of the glory that we have heard of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, consider how much above the world that blessedness is which
          God has given; how therefore ought you to live above the world. God
          has redeemed you out of the world, and therefore do not live as though
          you had your portion in this life. Live as pilgrims and strangers; as
          those that are not at home; as fellow-citizens with the saints and of
          the household of God. Be ye not conformed to this world, but be ye
          transformed by the renewing of your mind. How dishonorable will it be
          to you that God had so advanced and entitled you to such glory, to set
          your heart upon the dust of the earth. How you dishonor the grace of
          God in giving you such blessedness; and how will you dishonor the
          blessedness that God has given, no more to set your heart on it, and
          to set it so much on the world!
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, consider what a vast difference has God made between you and
          other men, how vastly different is your relative state from theirs,
          how much more has God done for you than for them. Seek therefore those
          things which are above, where God is. Will it not be a shame if one
          that is entitled to such glory conducts no better than a child of the
          devil? Consider it seriously; and let it not be asked with reference
          to you, Mat. 5:47. What do ye more than others? Other men love those
          that love them; other men do good to those that do good to them. Walk
          worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called. And let it appear that
          you are of a spirit more excellent than your neighbor; manifest more
          love, and more meekness, and more humility, with all lowliness and
          meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love. Walk
          worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, strengthened with all might
          according to his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering.
          Put ye on as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies,
          kindness, gentleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering, forbearing one
          another, forgiving one another; and let your light so shine before
          men, that they seeing your good works, may glorify your Father who is
          in heaven. Seeing god has given you so much, God and men may well
          expect of you, that you should be greatly distinguished in your life
          from other men.
