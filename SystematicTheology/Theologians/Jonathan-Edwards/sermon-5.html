        <p>Matthew 25:46, “These shall go away into everlasting punishment.”</p>
        <p>
          IN this chapter we have the most particular description of the day of
          judgment, of any in the whole Bible. Christ here declares that when he
          shall hereafter sit on the throne of his glory, the righteous and the
          wicked shall be set before him, and separated one from the other, as a
          shepherd divides his sheep from the goats. Then we have an account how
          both will be judged according to their works: how the good works of
          the one and the evil works of the other will be rehearsed, and how the
          sentence shall be pronounced accordingly. We are told what the
          sentence will be on each, and then we have an account of the execution
          of the sentence on both. In the words of the text is the account of
          the execution of the sentence on the wicked or the ungodly, concerning
          which, it is to my purpose to observe two things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The duration of the punishment on which they are here said to
          enter: it is called everlasting punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The time of their entrance on this everlasting punishment, viz.
          after the day of judgment, when all these things that are of a
          temporary continuance shall have come to an end and even those of them
          that are most lasting — the frame of the world itself, the earth which
          is said to abide forever, the ancient mountains and everlasting hills,
          [and] the sun, moon, and stars. When the heavens shall have waxed old
          like a garment and as a vesture shall be changed, then shall be the
          time when the wicked shall enter on their punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctrine. — The misery of the wicked in hell will be absolutely
          eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two opinions which I mean to oppose in this doctrine. One is
          that the eternal death with which wicked men are threatened in
          Scripture, signifies no more than eternal annihilation: that God will
          punish their wickedness by eternally abolishing their being.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other opinion which I mean to oppose is that though the punishment
          of the wicked shall consist in sensible misery, yet it shall not be
          absolutely eternal, but only of a very long continuance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, to establish the doctrine in opposition to these different
          opinions, I shall undertake to show,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That it is not contrary to the divine perfections to inflict on
          wicked men a punishment that is absolutely eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That the eternal death which God threatens is not annihilation,
          but an abiding sensible punishment or misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. That this misery will not only continue for a very long time, but
          will be absolutely without end.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. That various good ends will be obtained by the eternal punishment
          of the wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I am to show that it is not contrary to the divine perfections to
          inflict on wicked men a punishment that is absolutely eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the sum of the objections usually made against this doctrine:
          that it is inconsistent with the justice, and especially with the
          mercy, of God. And some say [that] if it be strictly just, yet how can
          we suppose that a merciful God can bear eternally to torment his
          creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I shall briefly show that it is not inconsistent with the
          justice of God to inflict an eternal punishment. To evince this, I
          shall use only one argument, viz. that sin is heinous enough to
          deserve such a punishment, and such a punishment is no more than
          proportionable to the evil or demerit of sin. If the evil of sin be
          infinite, as the punishment is, then it is manifest that the
          punishment is no more than proportionable to the sin punished, and is
          no more than sin deserves. And if the obligation to love, honor, and
          obey God be infinite, then sin which is the violation of this
          obligation, is a violation of infinite obligation, and so is an
          infinite evil. Again, if God be infinitely worthy of love, honor, and
          obedience, then our obligation to love, and honor, and obey him is
          infinitely great. — So that God being infinitely glorious, or
          infinitely worthy of our love, honor, and obedience, our obligation to
          love, honor, and obey him (and so to avoid all sin) is infinitely
          great. Again, our obligation to love, honor, and obey God being
          infinitely great, sin is the violation of infinite obligation, and so
          is an infinite evil. Once more, sin being an infinite evil, deserves
          an infinite punishment. An infinite punishment is no more than it
          deserves. Therefore such punishment is just, which was the thing to be
          proved. There is no evading the force of this reasoning, but by
          denying that God, the sovereign of the universe, is infinitely
          glorious, which I presume none of my hearers will venture to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, I am to show that it is not inconsistent with the mercy of
          God, to inflict an eternal punishment on wicked men. It is an
          unreasonable and unscriptural notion of the mercy of God, that he is
          merciful in such a sense that he cannot bear that penal justice should
          be executed. This is to conceive of the mercy of God as a passion to
          which his nature is so subject that God is liable to be moved, and
          affected, and overcome by seeing a creature in misery, so that he
          cannot bear to see justice executed: which is a most unworthy and
          absurd notion of the mercy of God, and would, if true, argue great
          weakness. — It would be a great defect, and not a perfection, in the
          sovereign and supreme Judge of the world, to be merciful in such a
          sense that he could not bear to have penal justice executed. It is a
          very unscriptural notion of the mercy of God. The Scriptures
          everywhere represent the mercy of God as free and sovereign, and not
          that the exercises of it are necessary, so that God cannot bear
          justice should take place. The Scriptures abundantly speak of it as
          the glory of the divine attribute of mercy, that it is free and
          sovereign in its exercises, and not that God cannot but deliver
          sinners from misery. This is a mean and most unworthy idea of the
          divine mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is most absurd also as it is contrary to plain fact. For if there
          be any meaning in the objection, this is supposed in it, that all
          misery of the creature, whether just or unjust, is in itself contrary
          to the nature of God. For if his mercy be of such a nature that a very
          great degree of misery, though just, is contrary to his nature, then
          it is only to add to the mercy. And then a less degree of misery is
          contrary to his nature (again to add further to it), and a still less
          degree of misery is contrary to his nature. And so the mercy of God
          being infinite, all misery must be contrary to his nature, which we
          see to be contrary to fact. For we see that God in his providence,
          does indeed inflict very great calamities on mankind even in this
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          However strong such kind of objections against the eternal misery of
          the wicked, may seem to the carnal, senseless hearts of men, as though
          it were against God’s justice and mercy, yet their seeming strength
          arises from a want of sense of the infinite evil, odiousness, and
          provocation there is in sin. Hence it seems to us not suitable that
          any poor creature should be the subject of such misery, because we
          have no sense of anything abominable and provoking in any creature
          answerable to it. If we had, then this infinite calamity would not
          seem unsuitable. For one thing would but appear answerable and
          proportionable to another, and so the mind would rest in it as fit and
          suitable, and no more than what is proper to be ordered by the just,
          holy, and good Governor of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          That this is so, we may be convinced by this consideration, viz. that
          when we hear or read of some horrid instances of cruelty, it may be to
          some poor innocent child or some holy martyr — and their cruel
          persecutors, having no regard to their shrieks and cries, only sported
          themselves with their misery, and would not vouchsafe even to put an
          end to their lives — we have a sense of the evil of them, and they
          make a deep impression on our minds. Hence it seems just, every way
          fit and suitable, that God should inflict a very terrible punishment
          on persons who have perpetrated such wickedness. It seems no way
          disagreeable to any perfection of the Judge of the world. We can think
          of it without being at all shocked. The reason is that we have a sense
          of the evil of their conduct, and a sense of the proportion there is
          between the evil or demerit and the punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just so, if we saw a proportion between the evil of sin and eternal
          punishment, i.e. if we saw something in wicked men that should appear
          as hateful to us, as eternal misery appears dreadful (something that
          should as much stir up indignation and detestation, as eternal misery
          does terror), all objections against this doctrine would vanish at
          once. Though now it seem incredible, [and] though when we hear of such
          a degree and duration of torments as are held forth in this doctrine
          and think what eternity is, it is ready to seem impossible that such
          torments should be inflicted on poor feeble creatures by a Creator of
          infinite mercy. Yet this arises principally from these two causes: 1.
          It is so contrary to the depraved inclinations of mankind, that they
          hate to believe it and cannot bear it should be true. 2. They see not
          the suitableness of eternal punishment to the evil of sin. They see
          not that it is no more than proportionable to the demerit of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus shown that the eternal punishment of the wicked is not
          inconsistent with the divine perfections, I shall now proceed to show
          that it is so far from being inconsistent with the divine perfections,
          that those perfections evidently require it; i.e. they require that
          sin should have so great a punishment, either in the person who has
          committed it, or in a surety. And therefore with respect to those who
          believe not in a surety, and have no interest in him, the divine
          perfections require that this punishment should be inflicted on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This appears as it is not only not unsuitable that sin should be thus
          punished, but it is positively suitable, decent, and proper. — If this
          be made to appear, that it is positively suitable that sin should be
          thus punished, then it will follow that the perfections of God require
          it. For certainly the perfections of God require what is proper to be
          done. The perfection and excellency of God require that to take place
          which is perfect, excellent, and proper in its own nature. But that
          sin should be punished eternally is such a thing, which appears by the
          following considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is suitable that God should infinitely hate sin, and be an
          infinite enemy to it. Sin, as I have before shown, is an infinite
          evil, and therefore is infinitely odious and detestable. It is proper
          that God should hate every evil, and hate it according to its odious
          and detestable nature. And sin being infinitely evil and odious, it is
          proper that God should hate it infinitely.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If infinite hatred of sin be suitable to the divine character, then
          the expressions of such hatred are also suitable to this character.
          Because that which is suitable to be, is suitable to be expressed.
          That which is lovely in itself, is lovely when it appears. If it be
          suitable that God should be an infinite enemy to sin, or that he
          should hate it infinitely, then it is suitable that he should act as
          such an enemy. If it be suitable that he should hate and have enmity
          against sin, then it is suitable for him to express that hatred and
          enmity in that to which hatred and enmity by its own nature tends. But
          certainly hatred in its own nature tends to opposition, and to set
          itself against that which is hated, and to procure its evil and not
          its good, and that in proportion to the hatred. Great hatred naturally
          tends to the great evil, and infinite hatred to the infinite evil, of
          its object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whence it follows that if it be suitable that there should be infinite
          hatred of sin in God, as I have shown it is, it is suitable that he
          should execute an infinite punishment on it. And so the perfections of
          God require that he should punish sin with an infinite, or which is
          the same thing with an eternal, punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we see not only the great objection against this doctrine
          answered, but the truth of the doctrine established by reason. I now
          proceed further to establish it by considering the remaining
          particulars under the doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That eternal death or punishment which God threatens to the
          wicked, is not annihilation, but an abiding sensible punishment or
          misery. — The truth of this proposition will appear by the following
          particulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the Scripture everywhere represents the punishment of the
          wicked, as implying very extreme pains and sufferings. But a state of
          annihilation is no state of suffering at all. Persons annihilated have
          no sense or feeling of pain or pleasure, and much less do they feel
          that punishment which carries in it an extreme pain or suffering. They
          no more suffer to eternity than they did suffer from eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, it is agreeable both to Scripture and reason to suppose that
          the wicked shall be punished in such a manner that they shall be
          sensible of the punishment they are under: that they should be
          sensible that now God has executed and fulfilled what he threatened,
          what they disregarded and would not believe. They should know
          themselves that justice takes place upon them, that God vindicates
          that majesty which they despised, [and] that God is not so despicable
          a being as they thought him to be. They should be sensible for what
          they are punished, while they are under the threatened punishment. It
          is reasonable that they should be sensible of their own guilt, and
          should remember their former opportunities and obligations, and should
          see their own folly and God’s justice. — If the punishment threatened
          be eternal annihilation, they will never know that it is inflicted.
          They will never know that God is just in their punishment, or that
          they have their deserts. And how is this agreeable to the Scriptures,
          in which God threatens, that he will repay the wicked to his face,
          Deu. 7:10. And to that in Job 21:19, 20, “God rewardeth him, and he
          shall know it; his eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink
          of the wrath of the Almighty.” And to that in Eze. 22:21, 22, “Yea, I
          will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye
          shall be melted in the midst thereof. As silver is melted in the midst
          of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye
          shall know that I the Lord have poured out my fury upon you.” — And
          how is it agreeable to that expression so often annexed to the
          threatenings of God’s wrath against wicked men, And ye shall know that
          I am the Lord?
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, the Scripture teaches that the wicked will suffer different
          degrees of torment, according to the different aggravations of their
          sins. Mat. 5:22, “Whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause,
          shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his
          brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall
          say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell-fire.” Here Christ teaches
          us that the torments of wicked men will be different in different
          persons, according to the different degrees of their guilt. — It shall
          be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah, for Tyre and Sidon, than for
          the cities where most of Christ’s mighty works were wrought. — Again,
          our Lord assures us that he that knows his Lord’s will, and prepares
          not himself, nor does according to his will, shall be beaten with many
          stripes. But he that knows not, and commits things worthy of stripes,
          shall be beaten with few stripes. — These several passages of
          Scripture infallibly prove that there will be different degrees of
          punishment in hell, which is utterly inconsistent with the supposition
          that the punishment consists in annihilation, in which there can be no
          degrees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, the Scriptures are very express and abundant in this matter:
          that the eternal punishment of the wicked will consist in sensible
          misery and torment, and not in annihilation. — What is said of Judas
          is worthy to be observed here, “It had been good for that man if he
          had not been born;” Mat. 26:24. — This seems plainly to teach us, that
          the punishment of the wicked is such that their existence, upon the
          whole, is worse than non-existence. But if their punishment consists
          merely in annihilation, this is not true. — The wicked, in their
          punishment, are said to weep, and wail, and gnash their teeth; which
          implies not only real existence, but life, knowledge, and activity,
          and that they are in a very sensible and exquisite manner affected
          with their punishment, Isa. 33:14. Sinners in the state of their
          punishment are represented to dwell with everlasting burnings. But if
          they are only turned into nothing, where is the foundation for this
          representation? It is absurd to say that sinners will dwell with
          annihilation, for there is no dwelling in the case. It is also absurd
          to call annihilation a burning, which implies a state of existence,
          sensibility, and extreme pain: whereas in annihilation there is
          neither.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is said that they shall be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone.
          How can this expression with any propriety be understood to mean a
          state of annihilation? Yea, they are expressly said to have no rest
          day nor night, but to be tormented with fire and brimstone forever and
          ever, Rev. 20:10. But annihilation is a state of rest, a state in
          which not the least torment can possibly be suffered. The rich man in
          hell lifted up his eyes being in torment, and saw Abraham afar off,
          and Lazarus in his bosom, and entered into a particular conversation
          with Abraham: all which proves that he was not annihilated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spirits of ungodly men before the resurrection are not in a state
          of annihilation, but in a state of misery. They are spirits in prison,
          as the apostle says of them that were drowned in the flood, 1 Pet.
          3:19. — And this appears very plainly from the instance of the rich
          man before mentioned, if we consider him as representing the wicked in
          their separate state between death and the resurrection. But if the
          wicked even then are in a state of torment, much more will they be,
          when they shall come to suffer that which is the proper punishment of
          their sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Annihilation is not so great a calamity but that some men have
          undoubtedly chosen it, rather than a state of suffering even in this
          life. This was the case of Job, a good man. But if a good man in this
          world may suffer that which is worse than annihilation, doubtless the
          proper punishment of the wicked, in which God means to manifest his
          peculiar abhorrence of their wickedness, will be a calamity vastly
          greater still, and therefore cannot be annihilation. That must be a
          very mean contemptible testimony of God’s wrath towards those who have
          rebelled against his crown and dignity — broken his laws, and despised
          both his vengeance and his grace — which is not so great a calamity as
          some of his true children have suffered in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eternal punishment of the wicked is said to be the second death,
          as Rev. 20:14, and 21:8. It is doubtless called the second death in
          reference to the death of the body, and as the death of the body is
          ordinarily attended with great pain and distress, so the like, or
          something vastly greater, is implied in calling the eternal punishment
          of the wicked the second death. And there would be no propriety in
          calling it so, if it consisted merely in annihilation. And this second
          death wicked men will suffer, for it cannot be called the second death
          with respect to any other than men. It cannot be called so with
          respect to devils, as they die no temporal death, which is the first
          death. In Rev. 2:11, it is said, “He that overcometh, shall not be
          hurt of the second death;” implying that all who do not overcome their
          lusts, but live in sin, shall suffer the second death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, wicked men will suffer the same kind of death with the devils;
          as in verse 41 of the context, “Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting
          fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.” Now the punishment of
          the devil is not annihilation, but torment. He therefore trembles for
          fear of it. not for fear of being annihilated — he would be glad of
          that. Where he is afraid of is torment, as appears by Luke 8:28, where
          he cries out and beseeches Christ that he would not torment him before
          the time. And it is said, Rev. 20:10, “The devil that deceived them
          was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the
          false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night, for ever and
          ever.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is strange how men will go directly against so plain and full
          revelations of Scripture, as to suppose notwithstanding all these
          things, that the eternal punishment threatened against the wicked
          signifies no more than annihilation.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. As the future punishment of the wicked consists in sensible
          misery, so it shall not only continue for a very long time, but shall
          be absolutely without end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of those who have held that the torments of hell are not absolutely
          eternal, there have been two sorts. Some suppose that in the
          threatenings of everlasting punishment, the terms used do not
          necessarily import a proper eternity, but only a very long duration.
          Others suppose that if they do import a proper eternity, yet we cannot
          necessarily conclude thence, that God will fulfill his threatenings. —
          Therefore I shall,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, show that the threatenings of eternal punishment do very
          plainly and fully import a proper, absolute eternity, and not merely a
          long duration. — This appears,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Because when the Scripture speaks of the wicked being sentenced to
          their punishment at the time when all temporal things are come to an
          end, it then speaks of it as everlasting, as in the text, and
          elsewhere. It is true that the term forever is not always in Scripture
          used to signify eternity. Sometimes it means “as long as a man lives.”
          In this sense it is said that the Hebrew servant, who chose to abide
          with his master, should have his ear bored and should serve his master
          forever. Sometimes it means “during the continuance of the state and
          church of the Jews.” In this sense, several laws, which were peculiar
          to that church and were to continue in force no longer than that
          church should last, are called statutes forever. See Exo. 27:21,
          28:43, etc. Sometimes it means as long as the world stands. So in Ecc.
          1:4, “One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh, but
          the earth abideth for ever.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And this last is the longest temporal duration that such a term is
          ever used to signify. For the duration of the world is the longest of
          things temporal, as its beginning was the earliest. Therefore when the
          Scripture speaks of things as being before the foundation of the
          world, it means that they existed before the beginning of time. So
          those things which continue after the end of the world, are eternal
          things. When heaven and earth are shaken and removed, those things
          that remain will be what cannot be shaken, but will remain forever,
          Heb. 12:26-27.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the punishment of the wicked will not only remain after the end of
          the world, but is called everlasting, as in the text, “These shall go
          away into everlasting punishment.” So in 2 Thes. 1:9-10, “Who shall be
          punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord,
          and from the glory of his power; when he shall come to be glorified in
          his saints,” etc. — Now, what can be meant by a thing being
          everlasting, after all temporal things are come to an end, but that it
          is absolutely without end!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Such expressions are used to set forth the duration of the
          punishment of the wicked, as are never used in the scriptures of the
          New Testament to signify anything but a proper eternity. It is said,
          not only that the punishment shall be forever, but for ever and ever.
          Rev. 14:11, “The smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and
          ever.” Rev. 20:10, “Shall be tormented day and night, for ever and
          ever.” Doubtless the New Testament has some expression to signify a
          proper eternity, of which it has so often occasion to speak. But it
          has no higher expression than this: if this do not signify an absolute
          eternity, there is none that does.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The Scripture uses the same way of speaking to set forth the
          eternity of punishment and the eternity of happiness, yea, the
          eternity of God himself. Mat. 25:46, “These shall go away into
          everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.” The
          words everlasting and eternal, in the original, are the very same.
          Rev. 22:5, “And they (the saints) shall reign for ever and ever.” And
          the Scripture has no higher expression to signify the eternity of God
          himself, than that of his being for ever and ever, as Rev. 4:9, “To
          him who sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever;” and in the
          10th verse, and in Rev. 5:14; 10:6, and 15:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the Scripture expresses God’s eternity by this: that it shall
          be forever, after the world is come to an end, Psa. 102:26-27, “They
          shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old
          like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be
          changed. But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The Scripture says that wicked men shall not be delivered till they
          have paid the uttermost farthing of their debt, Mat. 5:26. The last
          mite, Luke 12:59, i.e. the utmost that is deserved, and all mercy is
          excluded by this expression. But we have shown that they deserve an
          infinite, an endless punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The Scripture says absolutely that their punishment shall not have
          an end, Mark 9:44, “Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not
          quenched.” Now it will not do to say that the meaning is [that] their
          worm shall live a great while, or that it shall be a great while
          before their fire is quenched. If ever the time comes that their worm
          shall die, if ever there shall be a quenching of the fire at all, then
          it is not true that their worm dieth not and that the fire is not
          quenched. For if there be a dying of the worm and a quenching of the
          fire, let it be at what time it will, nearer or further off, it is
          equally contrary to such a negation — it dieth not, it is not
          quenched.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, there are others who allow that the expression of the
          threatenings do denote a proper eternity. But then, they say, it does
          not certainly follow that the punishment will really be eternal,
          because God may threaten, and yet not fulfill his threatenings. Though
          they allow that the threatenings are positive and peremptory, without
          any reserve, yet they say [that] God is not obliged to fulfill
          absolute positive threatenings, as he is absolute promises. Because in
          promises a right is conveyed that the creature to whom the promises
          are made will claim. But there is no danger of the creature’s claiming
          any right by a threatening. Therefore I am now to show that what God
          has positively declared in this matter, does indeed make it certain
          that it shall be as he has declared. To this end, I shall mention two
          things:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is evidently contrary to the divine truth, positively to declare
          anything to be real, whether past, present, or to come, which God at
          the same time knows is not so. Absolutely threatening that anything
          shall be, is the same as absolutely declaring that it is to be. For
          any to suppose that God absolutely declares that anything will be,
          which be at the same time knows will not be, is blasphemy, if there be
          any such thing as blasphemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, it is very true that there is no obligation on God, arising
          from the claim of the creature, as there is in promises. They seem to
          reckon the wrong way, who suppose the necessity of the execution of
          the threatening to arise from a proper obligation on God to the
          creature to execute consequent on his threatening. For indeed the
          certainty of the execution arises the other way, viz. on the
          obligation there was on the omniscient God, in threatening, to conform
          his threatening to what he knew would be future in execution. Though,
          strictly speaking, God is not properly obliged to the creature to
          execute because he has threatened, yet he was obliged not absolutely
          to threaten, if at the same time he knew that he should not or would
          not fulfill, because this would not have been consistent with his
          truth. So that from the truth of God there is an inviolable connection
          between positive threatenings and execution. They who suppose that God
          positively declared that he would do contrary to what he knew would
          come to pass, do therein suppose, that he absolutely threatened
          contrary to what he knew to be truth. And how anyone can speak
          contrary to what he knows to be truth, in declaring, promising, or
          threatening, or any other way, consistently with inviolable truth, is
          inconceivable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Threatenings are significations of something, and if they are made
          consistently with truth, they are true significations, or
          significations of truth, that which shall be. If absolute threatenings
          are significations of anything, they are significations of the
          futurity of the things threatened. But if the futurity of the things
          threatened be not true and real, then how can the threatening be a
          true signification? And if God, in them, speaks contrary to what he
          knows, and contrary to what he intends, how he can speak true is
          inconceivable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Absolute threatenings are a kind of predictions. And though God is not
          properly obliged by any claim of ours to fulfill predictions, unless
          they are of the nature of promises, yet it certainly would be contrary
          to truth, to predict that such a thing would come to pass, which he
          knew at the same time would not come to pass. Threatenings are
          declarations of something future, and they must be declarations of
          future truth, if they are true declarations. Its being future alters
          not the case any more than if it were present. It is equally contrary
          to truth, to declare contrary to what at the same time is known to be
          truth, whether it be of things past, present, or to come: for all are
          alike to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beside, we have often declarations in Scripture of the future eternal
          punishment of the wicked, in the proper form of predictions, and not
          in the form of threatenings. So in the text, “These shall go away into
          everlasting punishment.” So in those frequent assertions of eternal
          punishment in the Revelation, some of which I have already quoted. The
          Revelation is a prophecy, and is so called in the book itself. So are
          those declarations of eternal punishment. — The like declarations we
          have also in many other places of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The doctrine of those who teach that it is not certain that God
          will fulfill those absolute threatenings, is blasphemous another way,
          and that is, as God, according to their supposition, was obliged to
          make use of a fallacy to govern the world. They own that it is needful
          that men should apprehend themselves liable to an eternal punishment,
          that they might thereby be restrained from sin, and that God has
          threatened such a punishment, for the very end that they might believe
          themselves exposed to it. But what an unworthy opinion does this
          convey of God and his government, of his infinite majesty, and wisdom,
          and all-sufficiency! — Beside, they suppose that though God has made
          use of such a fallacy, yet it is not such an one but that they have
          detected him in it. Though God intended men should believe it to be
          certain that sinners are liable to an eternal punishment, yet they
          suppose that they have been so cunning as to find out that it is not
          certain. And so that God had not laid his design so deep, but that
          such cunning men as they can discern the cheat and defeat the design,
          because they have found out that there is no necessary connection
          between the threatening of eternal punishment, and the execution of
          that threatening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering these things, is it not greatly to be wondered at, that
          Archbishop Tillotson, who has made so great a figure among the
          new-fashioned divines, should advance such an opinion as this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I conclude this head, it may be proper for me to answer an
          objection or two that may arise in the minds of some.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objection 1. It may be here said [that] we have instances wherein God
          has not fulfilled his threatenings: as his threatening to Adam, and in
          him to mankind, that they should surely die, if they should eat the
          forbidden fruit. I answer, it is not true that God did not fulfill
          that threatening. He fulfilled it and will fulfill it in every jot and
          tittle. When God said, “Thou shalt surely die,” if we respect
          spiritual death, it was fulfilled in Adam’s person in the day that he
          ate. For immediately his image, his holy spirit and original
          righteousness, which was the highest and best life of our first
          parents, were lost, and they were immediately in a doleful state of
          spiritual death.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we respect temporal death, that was also fulfilled. He brought
          death upon himself and all his posterity, and he virtually suffered
          that death on that very day on which he ate. His body was brought into
          a corruptible, mortal, and dying condition, and so it continued till
          it was dissolved. If we look at all that death which was comprehended
          in the threatening, it was, properly speaking, fulfilled in Christ.
          When God said to Adam, “If thou eatest, thou shalt die,” he spoke not
          only to him, and of him personally, but the words respected mankind,
          Adam and his race, and doubtless were so understood by him. His
          offspring were to be looked upon as sinning in him, and so should die
          with him. The words do as justly allow of an imputation of death as of
          sin. They are as well consistent with dying in a surety, as with
          sinning in one. Therefore, the threatening is fulfilled in the death
          of Christ, the surety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objection 2. Another objection may arise from God’s threatening to
          Nineveh. He threatened, that in forty days Nineveh should be
          destroyed, which yet he did not fulfill. — I answer, that threatening
          could justly be looked upon no otherwise than as conditional. It was
          of the nature of a warning, and not of an absolute denunciation. Why
          was Jonah sent to the Ninevites, but to give them warning, that they
          might have opportunity to repent, reform, and avert the approaching
          destruction? God had no other design or end in sending the prophet to
          them, but that they might be warned and tried by him, as God warned
          the Israelites, Judah and Jerusalem, before their destruction.
          Therefore the prophets, together with their prophecies of approaching
          destruction, joined earnest exhortations to repent and reform, that it
          might be averted.
        </p>
        <p>
          No more could justly be understood to be certainly threatened, than
          that Nineveh should be destroyed in forty days, continuing as it was.
          For it was for their wickedness that that destruction was threatened,
          and so the Ninevites took it. Therefore, when the cause was removed,
          the effect ceased. It was contrary to God’s known manner, to threaten
          punishment and destruction for sin in this world absolutely, so that
          it should come upon the persons threatened unavoidably, let them
          repent and reform and do what they would; Jer. 18:7, 8, “At what
          instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom,
          to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; if that nation
          against whom I have pronounced turn from their evil, I will repent of
          the evil that I thought to do unto them.” So that all threatenings of
          this nature had a condition implied in them, according to the known
          and declared manner of God’s dealing. And the Ninevites did not take
          it as an absolute sentence of denunciation: if they had, they would
          have despaired of any benefit by fasting and reformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the threatenings of eternal wrath are positive and absolute. There
          is nothing in the Word of God from which we can gather any condition.
          The only opportunity of escaping is in this world. This is the only
          state of trial, wherein we have any offers of mercy, or place for
          repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I shall mention several good and important ends, which will be
          obtained by the eternal punishment of the wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, hereby God vindicates his injured majesty. Wherein sinners cast
          contempt upon it, and trample it in the dust, God vindicates and
          honors it and makes it appear, as it is indeed infinite, by showing
          that it is infinitely dreadful to condemn or offend it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, God glorifies his justice. — The glory of God is the greatest
          good. It is that which is the chief end of the creation. It is of
          greater importance than anything else. But this one way wherein God
          will glorify himself, as in the eternal destruction of ungodly men, he
          will glorify his justice. Therein he will appear as a just governor of
          the world. The vindictive justice of God will appear strict, exact,
          awful, and terrible, and therefore glorious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, God hereby indirectly glorifies his grace on the vessels of
          mercy. — The saints in heaven will behold the torments of the damned:
          “the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever.” Isa.
          66:24, “And they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men
          that have trangressed against me: for their worm shall not die,
          neither shall their fire be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring
          unto all flesh.” And in Rev. 14:10 it is said, that they shall be
          tormented in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of
          the Lamb. So they will be tormented in the presence also of the
          glorified saints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hereby the saints will be made the more sensible how great their
          salvation is. When they shall see how great the misery is from which
          God has saved them, and how great a difference he has made between
          their state and the state of others, who were by nature (and perhaps
          for a time by practice) no more sinful and ill-deserving than any, it
          will give them a greater sense of the wonderfulness of God’s grace to
          them. Every time they look upon the damned, it will excite in them a
          lively and admiring sense of the grace of God, in making them so to
          differ. This the apostle informs us is one end of the damnation of
          ungodly men; Rom. 9:22-23, “What if God willing to show his wrath, and
          to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels
          of wrath fitted to destruction: and that he might make known the
          riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore
          prepared unto glory?” The view of the misery of the damned will double
          the ardor of the love and gratitude of the saints in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, the sight of hell torments will exalt the happiness of the
          saints forever. It will not only make them more sensible of the
          greatness and freeness of the grace of God in their happiness, but it
          will really make their happiness the greater, as it will make them
          more sensible of their own happiness. It will give them a more lively
          relish of it: it will make them prize it more. When they see others,
          who were of the same nature and born under the same circumstances,
          plunged in such misery, and they so distinguished, O it will make them
          sensible how happy they are. A sense of the opposite misery, in all
          cases, greatly increases the relish of any joy or pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sight of the wonderful power, the great and dreadful majesty, and
          awful justice and holiness of God, manifested in the eternal
          punishment of ungodly men, will make them prize his favor and love
          vastly the more. And they will be so much the more happy in the
          enjoyment of it.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          I. From what has been said, we may learn the folly and madness of the
          greater part of mankind, in that for the sake of present momentary
          gratification, they run the venture of enduring all these eternal
          torments. They prefer a small pleasure, or a little wealth, or a
          little earthly honor and greatness, which can last but for a moment,
          to an escape from this punishment. If it be true that the torments of
          hell are eternal, what will it profit a man if he gain the whole world
          and lose his own soul, or what shall a man give in exchange for his
          soul? What is there in this world, which is not a trifle and lighter
          than vanity, in comparison with these eternal things?
        </p>
        <p>
          How mad are men, who so often hear of these things and pretend to
          believe them; who can live but a little while (a few years); who do
          not even expect to live here longer than others of their species
          ordinarily do; and who yet are careless about what becomes of
          themselves in another world, where there is no change and no end! How
          mad are they, when they hear that if they go on in sin, they shall be
          eternally miserable — that they are not moved by it, but hear it with
          as much carelessness and coldness as if they were no way concerned in
          the matter — when they know not but that it may be their case, that
          they may be suffering these torments before a week is at an end!
        </p>
        <p>
          How can men be so careless of such a matter as their own eternal and
          desperate destruction and torment! What a strange stupor and
          senselessness possesses the hearts of men! How common a thing is it to
          see men, who are told from Sabbath to Sabbath of eternal misery, and
          who are as mortal as other men, so careless about it that they seem
          not to be at all restrained by it from whatever their souls lust
          after! It is not half so much their care to escape eternal misery, as
          it is to get money and land, and to be considerable in the world, and
          to gratify their sense. Their thoughts are much more exercised about
          these things, and much more of their care and concern is about them.
          Eternal misery, though they lie every day exposed to it, is a thing
          neglected, it is but now and then thought of, and then with a great
          deal of stupidity, and not with concern enough to stir them up to do
          anything considerable in order to escape it. They are not sensible
          that it is worth their while to take any considerable pains in order
          to it. And if they do take pains for a little while, they soon leave
          off, and something else takes up their thoughts and concern.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus you see it among young and old. Multitudes of youth lead a
          careless life, taking little care about their salvation. So you may
          see it among persons of middle age, and with many advanced in years,
          and when they certainly draw near to the grave. — Yet these same
          persons will seem to acknowledge that the greater part of men go to
          hell and suffer eternal misery, and this through carelessness about
          it. However, they will do the same. How strange is it that men can
          enjoy themselves and be at rest, when they are thus hanging over
          eternal burnings: at the same time, having no lease of their lives and
          not knowing how soon the thread by which they hang will break. Nor
          indeed do they pretend to know. And if it breaks, they are gone: they
          are lost forever, and there is no remedy! Yet they trouble not
          themselves much about it, nor will they hearken to those who cry to
          them, and entreat them to take care for themselves, and labor to get
          out of that dangerous condition. They are not willing to take so much
          pains. They choose not to be diverted from amusing themselves with
          toys and vanities. Thus, well might the wise man say, Ecc. 9:3, “The
          heart of the sons of men is full of evil. Madness is in their heart
          while they live; and after that they go to the dead.” — How much wiser
          are those few, who make it their main business to lay a foundation for
          eternity, to secure their salvation!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I shall improve this subject in a use of exhortation to sinners,
          to take care to escape these eternal torments. If they be eternal, one
          would think that would be enough to awaken your concern, and excite
          your diligence. If the punishment be eternal, it is infinite, as we
          said before. And therefore no other evil, no death, no temporary
          torment that ever you heard of, or that you can imagine, is anything
          in comparison with it, but is as much less and less considerable, not
          only as a grain of sand is less than the whole universe, but as it is
          less than the boundless space which encompasses the universe. —
          Therefore here,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, be entreated to consider attentively how great and awful a
          thing eternity is. Although you cannot comprehend it the more by
          considering, yet you may be made more sensible that it is not a thing
          to be disregarded. — Do but consider what it is to suffer extreme
          torment forever and ever: to suffer it day and night from one year to
          another, from one age to another, and from one thousand ages to
          another (and so adding age to age, and thousands to thousands), in
          pain, in wailing and lamenting, groaning and shrieking, and gnashing
          your teeth — with your souls full of dreadful grief and amazement,
          [and] with your bodies and every member full of racking torture;
          without any possibility of getting ease; without any possibility of
          moving God to pity by your cries; without any possibility of hiding
          yourselves from him; without any possibility of diverting your
          thoughts from your pain; without any possibility of obtaining any
          manner of mitigation, or help, or change for the better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, do but consider how dreadful despair will be in such torment.
          How dismal will it be, when you are under these racking torments, to
          know assuredly that you never, never shall be delivered from them. To
          have no hope: when you shall wish that you might be turned into
          nothing, but shall have no hope of it; when you shall wish that you
          might be turned into a toad or a serpent, but shall have no hope of
          it; when you would rejoice if you might but have any relief; after you
          shall have endured these torments millions of ages, but shall have no
          hope of it. After you shall have worn out the age of the sun, moon,
          and stars, in your dolorous groans and lamentations, without rest day
          and night, or one minute’s ease, yet you shall have no hope of ever
          being delivered. After you shall have worn a thousand more such ages,
          you shall have no hope, but shall know that you are not one whit
          nearer to the end of your torments. But that still there are the same
          groans, the same shrieks, the same doleful cries, incessantly to be
          made by you, and that the smoke of your torment shall still ascend up
          forever and ever. Your souls, which shall have been agitated with the
          wrath of God all this while, will still exist to bear more wrath. Your
          bodies, which shall have been burning all this while in these glowing
          flames, shall not have been consumed, but will remain to roast through
          eternity, which will not have been at all shortened by what shall have
          been past.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may by considering make yourselves more sensible than you
          ordinarily are. But it is a little you can conceive of what it is to
          have no hope in such torments. How sinking would it be to you, to
          endure such pain as you have felt in this world, without any hopes,
          and to know that you never should be delivered from it, nor have one
          minute’s rest! You can now scarcely conceive how doleful that would
          be. How much more to endure the vast weight of the wrath of God
          without hope! The more the damned in hell think of the eternity of
          their torments, the more amazing will it appear to them. And alas,
          they will not be able to keep it out of their minds! Their tortures
          will not divert them from it, but will fix their attention to it. O
          how dreadful will eternity appear to them after they shall have been
          thinking on it for ages together, and shall have so long an experience
          of their torments! The damned in hell will have two infinites
          perpetually to amaze them, and swallow them up: one is an infinite
          God, whose wrath they will bear, and in whom they will behold their
          perfect and irreconcilable enemy. The other is the infinite duration
          of their torment.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it were possible for the damned in hell to have a comprehensive
          knowledge of eternity, their sorrow and grief would be infinite in
          degree. The comprehensive view of so much sorrow, which they must
          endure, would cause infinite grief for the present. Though they will
          not have a comprehensive knowledge of it, yet they will doubtless have
          a vastly more lively and strong apprehension of it than we can have in
          this world. Their torments will give them an impression of it. — A man
          in his present state, without any enlargement of his capacity, would
          have a vastly more lively impression of eternity than he has, if he
          were only under some pretty sharp pain in some member of his body, and
          were at the same time assured that he must endure that pain forever.
          His pain would give him a greater sense of eternity than other men
          have. How much more will those excruciating torments, which the damned
          will suffer, have this effect!
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, their capacity will probably be enlarged, their
          understandings will be quicker and stronger in a future state, and God
          can give them as great a sense and as strong an impression of
          eternity, as he pleases, to increase their grief and torment. — O be
          entreated, ye that are in a Christless state and are going on in a way
          to hell, that are daily exposed to damnation, to consider these
          things. If you do not, it will surely be but a little while before you
          will experience them, and then you will know how dreadful it is to
          despair in hell. And it may be before this year, or this month, or
          this week, is at an end: before another Sabbath, or ever you shall
          have opportunity to hear another sermon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, that you may effectually escape these dreadful and awful
          torments. Be entreated to flee and embrace him who came into the world
          for the very end of saving sinners from these torments, who has paid
          the whole debt due to the divine law, and exhausted eternal in
          temporal sufferings. What great encouragement is it to those of you
          who are sensible that you are exposed to eternal punishment, that
          there is a Savior provided, who is able and who freely offers to save
          you from that punishment, and that in a way which is perfectly
          consistent with the glory of God: yea, which is more to the glory of
          God than it would be if you should suffer the eternal punishment of
          hell. For if you should suffer that punishment you would never pay the
          whole of the debt. Those who are sent to hell never will have paid the
          whole of the debt which they owe to God, nor indeed a part which bears
          any proportion to the whole. They never will have paid a part which
          bears so great a proportion to the whole, as one mite to ten thousand
          talents. Justice therefore never can be actually satisfied in your
          damnation. But it is actually satisfied in Christ. Therefore he is
          accepted of the Father, and therefore all who believe are accepted and
          justified in him. Therefore believe in him, come to him, commit your
          souls to him to be saved by him. In him you shall be safe from the
          eternal torments of hell. Nor is that all: but through him you shall
          inherit inconceivable blessedness and glory, which will be of equal
          duration with the torments of hell. For, as at the last day the wicked
          shall go away into everlasting punishment, so shall the righteous, or
          those who trust in Christ, go into life eternal.
