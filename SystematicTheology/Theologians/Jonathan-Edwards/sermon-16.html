        <h2>Pardon for the Greatest of Sinners – Psalm 25:11</h2>
        <p class="title">
          Psalm 25:11, “For thy name’s sale, O Lord, pardon my iniquity; for it
          is great.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident by some passages in this psalm, that when it was penned,
          it was a time of affliction and danger with David. This appears
          particularly by the 15th and following verses: “Mine eyes are ever
          towards the Lord; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net,” etc. His
          distress makes him think of his sins, and leads him to confess them,
          and to cry to God for pardon, as is suitable in a time of affliction.
          See ver. 7. “Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my
          transgressions;” and verse 18. “Look upon mine affliction, and my
          pain, and forgive all my sins.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is observable in the text, what arguments the psalmist makes use of
          in pleading for pardon.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He pleads for pardon for God’s name’s sake. He has no expectation
          of pardon for the sake of any righteousness or worthiness of his for
          any good deeds he had done, or any compensation he had made for his
          sins; though if man’s righteousness could be a just plea, David would
          have had as much to plead as most. But he begs that God would do it
          for his own name’s sake, for his own glory, for the glory of his own
          free grace, and for the honour of his own covenant-faithfulness.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The psalmist pleads the greatness of his sins as an argument for
          mercy. He not only doth not plead his own righteousness, or the
          smallness of his sins; he not only doth not say, Pardon mine iniquity,
          for I have done much good to counterbalance it; or, Pardon mine
          iniquity, for it is small, and thou hast no great reason to be angry
          with me; mine iniquity is not so great, that thou hast any just cause
          to remember it against me; mine offence is not such but that thou
          mayest well enough overlook i’: but on the contrary he says, Pardon
          mine iniquity, for it is great; he pleads the greatness of his sin,
          and not the smallness of it; the enforces his prayer with this
          consideration, that his sins are very heinous.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how could he make this a plea for pardon? I answer, Because the
          greater his iniquity was, the more need he had of pardon. It is as
          much as if he had said, Pardon mine iniquity, for it is so great that
          I cannot bear the punishment; my sin is so great that I am in
          necessity of pardon; my case will be exceedingly miserable, unless
          thou be pleased to pardon me. He makes use of the greatness of his
          sin, to enforce his plea for pardon, as a man would make use of the
          greatness of calamity in begging for relief. When a beggar begs for
          bread, he will plead the greatness of his poverty and necessity. When
          a man in distress cries for pity, what more suitable plea can be urged
          than the extremity of his case?—And God allows such a plea as this:
          for he is moved to mercy towards us by nothing in us but the
          miserableness of our case. He doth not pity sinners because they are
          worthy, but because they need his pity.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          If we truly come to God for mercy, the greatness of our sin will be no
          impediment to pardon.—If it were an impediment, David would never have
          used it as a plea for pardon, as we find he does in the text.—The
          following things are needful in order that we truly come to God for
          mercy:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That we should see our misery, and be sensible of our need of
          mercy. They who are not sensible of their misery cannot truly look to
          God for mercy; for it is the very notion of divine mercy, that it is
          the goodness and grace of God to the miserable. Without misery in the
          object, there can be no exercise of mercy. To suppose mercy without
          supposing misery, or pity without calamity, is a contradiction:
          therefore men cannot look upon themselves as proper objects of mercy,
          unless they first know themselves to be miserable; and so, unless this
          be the case, it is impossible that they should come to God for mercy.
          They must be sensible that they are the children of wrath; that the
          law is against them, and that they are exposed to the curse of it:
          that the wrath of God abideth on them; and that he is angry’ with them
          every day while they are under the guilt of sin.—They must be sensible
          that it is a very dreadful thing to be the object of the wrath of God;
          that it is a very awful thing to have him for their enemy; and that
          they cannot bear his wrath. They must he sensible that the guilt of
          sin makes them miserable creatures, whatever temporal enjoyments they
          have; that they can be no other than miserable, undone creatures, so
          long as God is angry with them; that they are without strength, and
          must perish, and that eternally, unless God help them. They must see
          that their case is utterly desperate, for any thing that any one else
          can do for them; that they hang over the pit of eternal misery; and
          that they must necessarily drop into it, if God have not mercy on
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. They must be sensible that they are not worthy that God should
          have mercy on them. They who truly come to God for mercy, come as
          beggars, and not as creditors: they come for mere mercy. for sovereign
          grace, and not for any thing that is due. Therefore, they must see
          that the misery under which they lie is justly brought upon them, and
          that the wrath to which they are exposed is justly threatened against
          them; and that they have deserved that God should be their enemy, and
          should continue to be their enemy. They must be sensible that it would
          be just with God to do as he hath threatened in his holy law, viz.
          make them the objects of his wrath and curse in hell to all eternity.—
          They who come to God for mercy in a right manner are not disposed to
          find fault with his severity; but they come in a sense of their own
          utter unworthiness, as with ropes about their necks, and lying in the
          dust at the foot of mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. They must come to God for mercy in and through Jesus Christ
          alone. All their hope of mercy must be from the consideration of what
          he is, what he hath done, and what he hath suffered; and that there is
          no other name given under heaven, among men, whereby we can be saved,
          but that of Christ; that he is the Son of God, and the Saviour of the
          world; that his blood cleanses from all sin, and that he is so worthy,
          that all sinners who are in him may well be pardoned and accepted.—It
          is impossible that any should come to God for mercy, and at the same
          time have no hope of mercy. Their coming to God for it, implies that
          they have some hope of obtaining, otherwise they would not think it
          worth the while to come. But they that come in a right manner have all
          their hope through Christ, or from the consideration of his
          redemption, and the sufficiency of it.—If persons thus come to God for
          mercy, the greatness of their sins will be no impediment to pardon.
          Let their sins be ever so many, and great, and aggravated, it will not
          make God in the least degree more backward to pardon them. This may be
          made evident by the following considerations:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The mercy of God is as sufficient for the pardon of the greatest
          sins, as for the least; and that because his mercy is infinite. That
          which is infinite, is as much above what is great, as it is above what
          is small. Thus God being infinitely great, he is as much above kings
          as he is above beggars; he is as much above the highest angel, as he
          is above the meanest worm. One finite measure doth not come any nearer
          to the extent of what is infinite than another.—So the mercy of God
          being infinite, it must be as sufficient for the pardon of all sin, as
          of one. If one of the least sins be not beyond the mercy of God, so
          neither are the greatest, or ten thousand of them.—However, it must be
          acknowledged, that this alone doth not prove the doctrine. For though
          the mercy of God may be as sufficient for the pardon of great sins as
          others; yet there may be other obstacles, besides the want of mercy.
          The mercy of God may be sufficient, and yet the other attributes may
          oppose the dispensation of mercy in these cases.— Therefore I observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That the satisfaction of Christ is as sufficient for the removal of
          the greatest guilt, as the least: 1 John i. 7. ” The blood of Christ
          cleanseth from all sin.” Acts xiii. 39. ” By him all that believe are
          justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the
          law of Moses.” All the sins of those who truly come to God for mercy,
          let them be what they will, are satisfied for, if God be true who
          tells us so; and if they be satisfied for, surely it is not
          incredible, that God should be ready to pardon them. So that Christ
          having fully satisfied for all sin, or having wrought out a
          satisfaction that is sufficient for all, it is now no way inconsistent
          with the glory of the divine attributes to pardon the greatest sins of
          those who in a right manner come unto him for it. God may now pardon
          the greatest sinners without any prejudice to the honour of his
          holiness. The holiness of God will not suffer him to give the least
          countenance to sin, but inclines him to give proper testimonies of his
          hatred of it. But Christ having satisfied for sin, God can now love
          the sinner, and give no countenance at all to sin, however great a
          sinner he may have been. It was a sufficient testimony of God’s
          abhorrence of sin, that he poured out his wrath on his own dear Son,
          when he took the guilt of it upon himself. Nothing can more show God’s
          abhorrence of sin than this. If all mankind had been eternally damned,
          it would not have been so great a testimony of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          God may, through Christ, pardon the greatest sinner without any
          prejudice to the honour of his majesty. The honour of the divine
          majesty indeed requires satisfaction; but the sufferings of Christ
          fully repair the injury. Let the contempt be ever so great, yet if so
          honourable a person as Christ undertakes to be a Mediator for the
          offender, and suffers so much for him, it fully repairs the injury
          done to the Majesty of heaven and earth. The sufferings of Christ
          fully satisfy justice. The justice of God, as the supreme Governor and
          Judge of the world, requires the punishment of sin. The supreme Judge
          must judge the world according to a rule of justice. God doth not show
          mercy as a judge, but as a sovereign; therefore his exercise of mercy
          as a sovereign, and his justice as a judge, must be made consistent
          one with another; and this is done by the sufferings of Christ, in
          which sin is punished fully, and justice answered. Rom. iii. 25, 26. ”
          Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
          blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are
          past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time,
          his righteousness; that he might be just, and the justifier of him
          which believeth in Jesus.”—The law is no impediment in the way of the
          pardon of the greatest sin, if men do but truly come to God for mercy:
          for Christ hath fulfilled the law, he hath borne the curse of it, in
          his sufferings; Gal. iii. 13. ” Christ hath redeemed us from the curse
          of the law, being made a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is
          every one that hangeth on a tree.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Christ will not refuse to save the greatest sinners, who in a right
          manner come to God for mercy; for this is his work. It is his business
          to be a Saviour of sinners; it is the work upon which he came into the
          world; and therefore he will not object to it. He did not come to call
          the righteous, but sinners to repentance, Matt. ix. 13. Sin is the
          very evil which he came into the world to remedy: therefore he will
          not object to any man that he is very sinful. The more sinful he is,
          the more need of Christ.—The sinfulness of man was the reason of
          Christ’s coming into the world; this is the very misery from which he
          came to deliver men. The more they have of it, the more need they have
          of being delivered; ” They that are whole need not a physician, but
          they that are sick,” Matt. ix. 12. The physician will not make it an
          objection against healing a man who applies to him, that he stands in
          great need of his help. If a physician of compassion comes among the
          sick and wounded, surely he will not refuse to heal those that stand
          in most need of healing, if he be able to heal them.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Herein doth the glory of grace by the redemption of Christ much
          consist, viz. in its sufficiency for the pardon of the greatest
          sinners. The whole contrivance of the way of salvation is for this
          end, to glorify the free grace of God. God had it on his heart from
          all eternity to glorify this attribute; and therefore it is, that the
          device of saving sinners by Christ was conceived. The greatness of
          divine grace appears very much in this, that God by Christ saves the
          greatest offenders. The greater the guilt of any sinner is, the more
          glorious and wonderful is the grace manifested in his pardon: Rom. v.
          20. ” Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.” The apostle,
          when telling how great a sinner he had been, takes notice of the
          abounding of grace in his pardon, of which his great guilt was the
          occasion: 1 Tim. i. 13. ” Who was before a blasphemer, and a
          persecutor, and injurious. But I obtained mercy; and the grace of our
          Lord was exceeding abundant, with faith and love which is in Christ
          Jesus.” The Redeemer is glorified, in that he proves sufficient to
          redeem those who are exceeding sinful, in that his blood proves
          sufficient to wash away the greatest guilt, in that he is able to save
          men to the uttermost, and in that he redeems even from the greatest
          misery. It is the honour of Christ to save the greatest sinners, when
          they come to him, as it is the honour of a physician that he cures the
          most desperate diseases or wounds. Therefore, no doubt, Christ will be
          willing to save the greatest sinners, if they come to him; for he will
          not be backward to glorify himself, and to commend the value and
          virtue of his own blood. Seeing he hath so laid out himself to redeem
          sinners, he will not be unwilling to show, that he is able to redeem
          to the uttermost.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Pardon is as much offered and promised to the greatest sinners as
          any, if they will come aright to God for mercy. The invitations of the
          gospel are always in universal terms: as, Ho, every one that
          thirsteth; Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden; and,
          Whosoever will, let him come. And the voice of Wisdom is to men in
          general: Prov. viii. 4. ” Unto you, O men, I call, and my voice is to
          the sons of men.” Not to moral men, or religious men, but to you, O
          men. So Christ promises, John vi. 37. ” Him that cometh to me, I will
          in no wise cast out.” This is the direction of Christ to his apostles,
          after his resurrection, Mark xvi. 15, 16. ” Go ye into all the world,
          and preach the gospel to every creature: he that believeth, and is
          baptized, shall be saved.” Which is agreeable to what the apostle
          saith, that “the gospel was preached to every creature which is under
          heaven,” Col. i. 23.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          The proper use of this subject is, to encourage sinners whose
          consciences are burdened with a sense of guilt, immediately to go to
          God through Christ for mercy. If you go in the manner we have
          described, the arms of mercy are open to embrace you. You need not be
          at all the more fearful of coming because of your sins, let them be
          ever so black. If you had as much guilt lying on each of your souls as
          all the wicked men in the world, and all the damned souls in hell; yet
          if you come to God for mercy, sensible of your own vileness, and
          seeking pardon only through the free mercy of God in Christ, you would
          not need to be afraid; the greatness of your sins would be no
          impediment to your pardon. Therefore, if your souls be burdened, and
          you are distressed for fear of hell, you need not bear that burden and
          distress any longer. If you are but willing, you may freely come and
          unload yourselves, and cast all your burdens on Christ, and rest in
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here I shall speak to some OBJECTIONS which some awakened sinners
          may be ready to make against what I now exhort them to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Some may be ready to object, I have spent my youth and all the best
          of my life in sin, and I am afraid God will not accept of me, when I
          offer him only mine old age.—To this I would answer, 1. Hath God said
          any where, that he will not accept of old sinners who come to him? God
          hath often made offers and promises in universal terms; and is there
          any such exception put in? Doth Christ say, All that thirst, let them
          come to me and drink, except old sinners? Come to me, all ye that
          labour and are heavy laden, except old sinners, and I will give you
          rest? Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out, if he be not
          an old sinner? Did you ever read any such exception any where in the
          Bible? and why should you give way to exceptions which you make out of
          your own heads, or rather which the devil puts into your heads, and
          which have no foundation in the word of God?—Indeed it is more rare
          that old sinners are willing to come, than others; but if they do
          come, they are as readily accepted as any whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. When God accepts of young persons, it is not for the sake of the
          service which they are like to do him afterwards, or because youth is
          better worth accepting than old age. You seem entirely to mistake the
          matter, in thinking that God will not accept of you because you are
          old; as though he readily accepted of persons in their youth, because
          their youth is better worth his acceptance; whereas it is only for the
          sake of Jesus Christ, that God is willing to accept of any.
        </p>
        <p>
          You say, your life is almost spent, and you are afraid that the best
          time for serving God is past; and that therefore God will not now
          accept of you; as if it were for the sake of the service which persons
          are like to do him, after they are converted, that he accepts of them.
          But a self-righteous spirit is at the bottom of such objections. Men
          cannot get off from the notion, that it is for some goodness or
          service of their own, either done or expected to be done, that God
          accepts of persons, and receives them into favour.—Indeed they who
          deny God their youth, the best part of their lives, and spend it in
          the service of Satan, dreadfully sin and provoke God; and he very
          often leaves them to hardness of heart when they are grown old. But if
          they are willing to accept of Christ when old, he is as ready to
          receive them as any others; for in that matter God hath respect only
          to Christ and his worthiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But, says one, I fear I have committed sins that are peculiar to
          reprobates. I have sinned against light, and strong convictions of
          conscience; I have sinned presumptuously; and have so resisted the
          strivings of the Spirit of God, that I am afraid I have committed such
          sins as none of God’s elect ever commit. I cannot think that God will
          ever leave one whom he intends to save, to go on and commit sins
          against so much light and conviction, and with such horrid
          presumption.—Others may say, I have had risings of heart against God;
          blasphemous thoughts, a spiteful and malicious spirit; and have abused
          mercy and the strivings of the Spirit, trampled upon the Saviour, and
          my sins are such as are peculiar to those who are reprobated to
          eternal damnation. To all this I would answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. There is no sin peculiar to reprobates but the sin against the Holy
          Ghost. Do you read of any other in the word of God? And if you do not
          read of any there, what ground have you to think any such thing? What
          other rule have we, by which to judge of such matters, but the divine
          word? If we venture to go beyond that, we shall be miserably in the
          dark. When we pretend to go further in our determinations than the
          word of God, Satan takes us up, and leads us. It seems to you that
          such sins are peculiar to the reprobate, and such as God never
          forgives. But what reason can you give for it, if you have no word of
          God to reveal it? Is it because you cannot see how the mercy of God is
          sufficient to pardon, or the blood of Christ to cleanse from such
          presumptuous sins? If so, it is because you never yet saw how great
          the mercy of God is; you never saw the sufficiency of the blood of
          Christ, and you know not how far the virtue of it extends. Some elect
          persons have been guilty of all manner of sins, except the sin against
          the Holy Ghost; and unless you have been guilty of this, you have not
          been guilty of any that are peculiar to reprobates.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Men may be less likely to believe, for sins which they have
          committed, and not the less readily pardoned when they do believe. It
          must be acknowledged that some sinners are in more danger of hell than
          others. Though all are in great danger, some are less likely to be
          saved. Some are less likely ever to be converted and to come to
          Christ: but all who do come to him are alike readily accepted; and
          there is as much encouragement for one man to come to Christ as
          another.—Such sins as you mention are indeed exceeding heinous and
          provoking to God, and do in an especial manner bring the soul into
          danger of damnation, and into danger of being given to final hardness
          of heart; and God more commonly gives men up to the judgment of final
          hardness for such sins, than for others. Yet they are not peculiar to
          reprobates; there is but one sin that is so, viz. that against the
          Holy Ghost. And notwithstanding the sins which you have committed, if
          you can find it in your hearts to come to Christ, and close with him,
          you will be accepted not at all the less readily because you have
          committed such sins.—Though God doth more rarely cause some sorts of
          sinners to come to Christ than others, it is not because his mercy or
          the redemption of Christ is not as sufficient for them as others, but
          because in wisdom he sees fit so to dispense his grace, for a
          restraint upon the wickedness of men; and because it is his will to
          give converting grace in the use of means, among which this is one,
          viz. to lead a moral and religious life, and agreeable to our light,
          and the convictions of our consciences. But when once any sinner is
          willing to come to Christ, mercy is as ready for him as for any. There
          is no consideration at all had of his sins; let him have been ever so
          sinful, his sins are not remembered; God doth not upbraid him with
          them.

          III. But had I not better stay till I shall have made myself better,
          before I presume to come to Christ. I have been, and see myself to be
          very wicked now; but am in hopes of mending myself, and rendering
          myself at least not so wicked: then I shall have more courage to come
          to God for mercy.—In answer to this,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Consider how unreasonably you act. You are striving to set up
          yourselves for your own saviours; you are striving to get something of
          your own, on the account of which you may the more readily be
          accepted. So that by this it appears that you do not seek to be
          accepted only on Christ’s account. And is not this to rob Christ of
          the glory of being your only Saviour? Yet this is the way in which you
          are hoping to make Christ willing to save you.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. You can never come to Christ at all, unless you first see that he
          will not accept of you the more readily for any thing that you can do.
          You must first see, that it is utterly in vain for you to try to make
          yourselves better on any such account. You must see that you can never
          make yourselves any more worthy, or less unworthy, by any thing which
          you can perform.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If ever you truly come to Christ, you must see that there is enough
          in him for your pardon, though you be no better than you are. If you
          see not the sufficiency of Christ to pardon you, without any
          righteousness of your own to recommend you, you never will come so as
          to be accepted of him. The way to be accepted is to come—not on any
          such encouragement, that now you have made yourselves better, and more
          worthy, or not so unworthy, but—on the mere encouragement of Christ’s
          worthiness, and God’s mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If ever you truly come to Christ, you must come to him to make you
          better. You must come as a patient comes to his physician, with his
          diseases or wounds to be cured. Spread all your wickedness before him,
          and do not plead your goodness; but plead your badness, and your
          necessity on that account: and say, as the psalmist in the text, not
          Pardon mine iniquity, for it is not so great as it was, but, ” Pardon
          mine iniquity, for it is Great.”
