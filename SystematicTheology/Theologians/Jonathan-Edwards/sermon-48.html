          John 13:15, 16, “For I have given you an example, that he should do as
          I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not
          greater than his lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that
          sent him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          WE have in the context an account of one of the many very remarkable
          things that passed that night wherein Christ was betrayed (which was
          on many accounts the most remarkable night that ever was), viz.
          Christ’s washing his disciples’ feet; which action, as it was
          exceeding wonderful in itself, so it manifestly was symbolical, and
          represented something else far more important and more wonderful, even
          that greatest and most wonderful of all things that ever came to pass,
          which was accomplished the next day in his last sufferings. There were
          three symbolical representations given of that great event this
          evening; one in the passover, which Christ now partook of with his
          disciples; another in this remarkable action of his washing his
          disciples’ feet. Washing the feet of guests was the office of
          servants, and one of their meanest offices. And therefore was fitly
          chosen by our Savior to represent that great abasement which he was to
          be the subject of in the form of a servant, in becoming obedient unto
          death, even that ignominious and accursed death of the cross, that he
          might cleanse the souls of his disciples from their guilt and
          spiritual pollution.
        </p>
        <p>
          This spiritual washing and cleansing of believers was the end for
          which Christ so abased himself for them. Tit. 2:14, “Who gave himself
          for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto
          himself a peculiar people.” Eph. 5:25, 26, “Christ loved the church,
          and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with
          the washing of water.” That Christ’s washing his disciples’ feet
          signified this spiritual washing of the soul, is manifest by his own
          words in the 8th verse of the context, “Peter saith unto him, Thou
          shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him. If I wash thee now, thou
          has no part with me.” Christ, in being obedient unto death, even the
          death of the cross, not only did the part of a servant unto God, but
          in some respects also of a servant unto us. And this is not the only
          place where his so abasing himself for our sakes is compared to the
          doing of the part of a servant to guests. We have the like
          representation made in Luke 22:27, “For whether is greater, he that
          sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at meat?
          But I am among you as he that serveth.” And wherein Christ was among
          the disciples as he that did serve, is explained in Mat. 20:28.
          Namely, in his giving his life a ransom for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Christ had finished washing his disciples’ feet, he solemnly
          requires their attention to what he had done, and commands them to
          follow his example therein. Verses 12-17, “So after he had washed
          their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he
          said unto them, Know ye what I have done unto you? Ye call me Master
          and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and
          Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another’s
          feet: for I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have
          done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not
          greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that
          sent him. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When our Savior calls on his disciples to imitate the example he had
          given them in what he had done, we are to understand him, not merely
          by the example he gave in the emblematical action, in washing his
          disciples’ feet, in itself considered, but more especially, of that
          much greater act of his that was signified by it, in abasing himself
          so low, and suffering so much, for the spiritual cleansing and
          salvation of his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what is chiefly insisted on as the great example Christ has
          given us to follow. So it is once and again afterward, in the
          discourse Christ had with his disciples, this same night, verse 34 of
          the chapter wherein is the text, “A new commandment I give unto you,
          that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one
          another.” John 15:12, 13, “This is my commandment, that ye love one
          another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this, that
          a man lay down his life for his friends.” And so in 1 John 3:16,
          “Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for
          us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ, in the words of the text, does not only intend to recommend
          this example of his to the disciples as Christians, or some of his
          professing people, but especially as his ministers. This is evident by
          those words he uses to enforce this counsel. “Neither he that is sent,
          is greater than he that sent him.” In which words he manifestly has
          respect to that great errand on which he had sent them, when he bid
          them go and preach the gospel to the lost sheep of the house of
          Israel; Mat. 10:5, 6. And on which they were to be sent after his
          resurrection, when he said to them, “Go ye into all the world, and
          preach the gospel to every creature.” The same errand that Christ has
          respect to John 20:21, “As my Father hath sent me, even so send I
          you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And what confirms this is, that Christ elsewhere recommends to
          officers in his church, that are in that respect chief among his
          followers, the example which he set in his abasing himself to be as a
          servant that minister, to guests at a table, in his giving for us;
          Mat. 20:27, 28, “Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your
          servant: even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
          minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.” Compare Luke
          22:25-28.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work and business of ministers of the gospel is as it were that of
          servants, to wash and cleanse the souls of men. For this is done by
          the preaching of the word, which is their main business. Eph. 5:26,
          “That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by
          the word.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The words of the text thus considered, do undoubtedly lead us to this
          conclusion, and teach us this doctrine, viz.
        </p>
        <p>
          That it is the duty of ministers of the gospel, in the work of their
          ministry, to follow the example of their great Lord and Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is what I would by divine assistance make the subject of my
          present discourse.
        </p>
        <p>And I propose to handle this subject in the following method:</p>
        <p>
          I. I would observe wherein ministers of the gospel ought to follow the
          example of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>II. Give some reasons why they should follow his example.</p>
        <p>
          III. I would endeavor to make a proper application of those things to
          myself, and others that are called to this work of the ministry.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Show what improvement should be made of them by the people of this
          church and congregation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Then, I would show wherein ministers of the gospel ought, in the
          work of their ministry, to follow the example of their great Lord and
          Master, Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>And here,</p>
        <p>
          First, in general, ministers should follow their Lord and Master in
          all those excellent virtues, and in that universal and eminent
          holiness of life, which he set an example of in this human nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ministers of Christ should be persons of the same spirit that
          their Lord was of: the same spirit of humility and lowliness of heart;
          for the servant is not greater than his Lord. They should be of the
          same spirit of heavenly-mindedness, and contempt of the glory, wealth,
          and pleasures of this world. They should be of the same spirit of
          devotion and fervent love to God. They should follow the example of
          his prayerfulness; of whom we read from time to time of his retiring
          from the world, away from the noise and applause of the multitudes,
          into mountains and solitary places, for secret prayer, and holy
          converse with his Father; and once of his rising up in the morning a
          great while before day, and going and departing into a solitary place
          to pray, Mark 1:35. And another time, of his going out into a mountain
          to pray, and continuing all night in prayer to God, Luke 6:12.
          Ministers should follow Christ’s example, in his strict, constant, and
          inflexible observance of the commands which God has given him,
          touching what he should do and what he should say; he spake nothing of
          himself, but those things which the Father had commanded him, those he
          spake, and always did those things that pleased him, and continued in
          thorough obedience in the greatest trials, and through the greatest
          opposition that ever there was any instance of. Ministers should be
          persons of the same quiet, lamb-like spirit that Christ was of, the
          same spirit of submission to God’s will, and patience under
          afflictions, and meekness towards men; of the same calmness and
          composure of spirit under reproaches and sufferings from the malignity
          of evil men; of the same spirit of forgiveness of injuries; of the
          same spirit of charity, of fervent love and extensive benevolence; the
          same disposition to pity the miserable, to weep with those that weep,
          to help men under their calamities of both soul and body, to hear and
          grant the requests of the needy, and relieve afflicted; the same
          spirit of condescension to the poor and mean, tenderness and
          gentleness toward the weak, and great and effectual love to enemies.
          They should also be of the same spirit of zeal, diligence, and
          self-denial for the glory of God, and advancement for his kingdom, and
          for the good of mankind; for which things’ sake Christ went though the
          greatest labors, and endured the most extreme sufferings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, more particularly should ministers of the gospel follow the
          example of their great Master, in the manner in which they seek the
          salvation and happiness of the souls of men. They should follow his
          example of love to souls. Though it be impossible that they should
          love them to so great a degree, yet they should have the same spirit
          of love to them, and concern for their salvation, according to their
          capacity. Love to men’s souls in Christ was far above any regard he
          had to his temporal interest, his ease, his honor, his meat and drink.
          And so it should be with his ministers. They should have the same
          spirit of compassion to men under their spiritual calamities and
          miseries that he had, of whom we read, Mark 6:34, “That when he came
          out and saw much people, he was moved with compassion towards them,
          because they were as sheep not having a shepherd; and he began to
          teach them many things.” The word translated moved with compassion,
          signifies, that he was most sensibly affected, and his inmost bowels
          moved with pity. And again we read, Luke 19, that when Christ was
          riding to Jerusalem, that wicked city, but a few days before his
          crucifixion, and was come to the descent of the mount of Olives, where
          he had a fair view of the city, when he beheld it, he wept over it, on
          account of the misery and ruin they brought themselves into danger of
          by their sin. Although the sin by which especially they had made
          themselves thus miserable, was their vile treatment of him (for
          Jerusalem was a city that had been peculiarly injurious to him). And
          though Christ knew how cruelly he should be treated in that city
          before that week was past, how he there should be set at nought, and
          with great malignity bound, falsely accused and condemned, reviled,
          spit upon, scourged, and crucified; yet all does not prevent his most
          affectionate tears of compassion towards them. “When he was come near,
          he beheld the city, and wept over it, saying, If thou hadst know, even
          thou (thou, as wicked as thou art, and as vile as thou hast been in
          thy treatment of me; even thou), the things which belong unto thy
          peace! But now they are hid from thine eyes.” (Compare Mat. 23:37, and
          Luke 13:34). One would have thought he would have been more concerned
          for himself than Jerusalem, who had such a dreadful cup to drink, and
          was to suffer such extreme things by the cruelty of Jerusalem that
          week. But he, as it were, forgets his own sorrow and death, and weeps
          over the misery of his cruel enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ministers should imitate their great Master in his fervent prayers for
          the good of the souls of men. We find it to be Christ’s manner,
          whenever he undertook anything of special importance in the work of
          his ministry, first to retire and pour out his soul in extraordinary
          prayer to this Father. Thus when he was about to enter on a journey,
          and go a circuit throughout all Galilee, to preach in their
          synagogues, “he rose up a great while before day, and went out, and
          departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.” Mark 1:35-39. And
          when he was about to choose his twelve apostles, and send them out to
          preach the gospel, he first went out into a mountain to pray, and
          continued all night in prayer to God. Luke 6:12, etc. And the night
          before his crucifixion, wherein he offered up himself a sacrifice for
          the souls of men, he pours out his soul in extraordinary prayer for
          those he was about to die for, as we have an account in John 17. That
          wonderful and most affecting prayer of his, was not so much for
          himself as for his people. Although he knew what amazing sufferings he
          was to undergo the next day, yet he seems as it were to be unmindful
          of himself, and to have his heart all taken up with concern about his
          disciples; which he manifests in his spending so much time in
          comforting and counseling them, and praying for them with great
          affection, compassion, earnest care, and fatherly tenderness. And the
          prayers that he made in the garden of Gethsemane, under the amazing
          view of the cup he was to drink the next day, seem to be intercessory;
          especially the last of the three prayers which he there made, when
          being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat was as it
          were great drops of blood falling down to the ground: when he did not
          pray that the cup might pass from him, as he had done before, but that
          God’s will might be done. (Compare Luke 22:44. With Mat. 26:42). That
          prayer, as the apostle teaches us, Heb. 5:6, 7, was a prayer that he
          put up as our High Priest; and therefore must be a prayer of
          intercession for us, a prayer offered up with his blood which he sweat
          in his agony; as prayers were wont to be offered up with the blood of
          the sacrifices in the temple. His prayer at that time, Thy will be
          done, was not only an expression of submission, but had the form of a
          petition, as it is in the Lord’s prayer. He prayed that God’s will
          might be done in his being enabled to do the will of God, persevering
          in obedience unto death; and in the success of his sufferings; which
          might in an eminent manner be called the will of God, as it is in Psa.
          40:7, 8, “Then said I, Lo, I come, I delight to do thy will, O my
          God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ministers should follow the example of Christ in his diligence and
          laboriousness in his work. “He went about doing good, and healing all
          that were oppressed of the devil.” Acts 10:38. So abundant was he in
          labors, that oftentimes he scarcely allowed himself time to eat or
          drink; insomuch that his friends sometimes went out to lay hold of
          him, saying, “He is beside himself.” Mark 3:20, 21. That three years
          and a half of his public ministry was so filled with action and labor,
          that one of his disciples that constantly attended him, and was an
          eyewitness of his activity, tells us that if all that he did should be
          written, the world would not contain the books.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ministers should follow the example of Christ, in his readiness not
          only to labor, but suffer, for the salvation of souls, to spend and be
          spent for them. In this respect the apostle Paul imitated his Lord and
          Master. Phil. 2:17, “Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and
          service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all.” Col. 1:24,
          “Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is
          behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his body’s sake,
          which is the church.” 2 Cor. 12:15, “And I will very gladly spend and
          be spent for you.” Christ, in his prayers, labors, and sufferings for
          the souls of men, is represented as travailing in birth with them.
          Isa. 53:11, “He shall see of the travail of his soul.” In like manner
          should ministers travail for the conversion and salvation of their
          hearers. They should imitate the faithfulness of Christ in his
          ministry, in speaking whatsoever God had commanded him, and declaring
          the whole counsel of God. They should imitate him the manner of his
          preaching; who taught not as the scribes, but with authority, boldly,
          zealously, and fervently; insisting chiefly on the most important
          things in religion, being much in warning men of the danger of
          damnation, setting forth the greatness of the future misery of the
          ungodly; insisting not only on the outward, but also the inward and
          spiritual, duties of religion. Being much in declaring the great
          provocation and danger of spiritual pride, and a self-righteous
          disposition; yet much insisting on the necessity and importance of
          inherent holiness, and the practice of piety. Behaving himself with
          admirable wisdom in all that he said and did in his ministry, amidst
          the many difficulties, enemies, and temptations he was surrounded
          with, wonderfully adapting his discourses to persons, seasons, and
          occasions. Isa. 50:4, “The Lord hath given me the tongue of the
          learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that
          is weary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ministers should follow their Master in his zeal, so wonderfully mixed
          and tempered with gentleness and condescension in his dealing with
          souls, preaching the gospel to the poor, and taking a gracious notice
          from time to time of little children. And they should imitate their
          Lord in his following the work of ministry, not from mercenary views,
          or for the sake of worldly advantages, but for God’s glory, and men’s
          salvation. And in having his heart engaged in his work; it being his
          great delight, and his meat, to do the will of his Father, and finish
          his work, John 4:34, and having his heart set on the success of his
          great undertaking in the salvation of souls; this being the joy that
          was set before him, for which he run his race, endured the cross, and
          despised the shame. His delight in the prospect of the eternal
          salvation of souls more than countervailing the dread he had of his
          extreme sufferings. Many waters could not quench his love, neither
          could the floods drown it, for his love was stronger than death; yea,
          than the mighty pains and torments of such a death.
        </p>
        <p>I now proceed to the</p>
        <p>
          II. Thing proposed in the handling of this subject, which was to give
          some reasons why ministers of the gospel should follow the example of
          their great Lord and Master, Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, they should follow his example, because he is their Lord and
          Master. Christ, as he is a divine person, is the Lord of heaven and
          earth, and so one of infinite dignity, to whom our supreme respect is
          due. And on that account he is infinitely worthy that we should
          regard, not only his precepts but example. The infinite honorableness
          of his person recommends his virtues, and a conformity to them as our
          greatest dignity and honor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ is more especially the Lord of Christians; who are therefore
          under special obligations to follow him. He is their shepherd; and
          surely the flock should follow their shepherd. He is the captain of
          their salvation; and it becomes soldiers to follow their captain and
          leader. He is their head, not only their head of rule and authority,
          but their head of influence and communication, their vital head. And
          Christians are members of his body; but members, as partakers of the
          life and spirit of the head, are conformed to the head.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Christ is still in a more peculiar manner the Lord and Master of
          ministers of the gospel, as they are not only members of his church,
          but the officers of his kingdom, and the dignified servants of his
          family. It is the manner of a people to imitate their prince, but
          especially the ministers of his kingdom, and officers of his
          household. It is the duty of the whole army to follow their general,
          but especially of those officers that have a commission under him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, ministers of the gospel are in some respects called and
          devoted to the same work and business that Christ himself was
          appointed to. Ministers are not men’s mediators; for there is but one
          Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus. They are not our
          priests to make atonement and work out righteousness for us. For
          Christ by one offering has perfected for ever them that are
          sanctified. They are not lords over God’s heritage; for one is their
          Master, even Christ. But yet ministers of the gospel, as Christ’s
          servants and officers under him, are appointed to promote the designs
          of that great work of Christ, the work of salvation. It is the work
          that ministers are devoted to; and therefore they are represented as
          coworkers with Christ. 2 Cor. 6:1, “We then as workers together with
          him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.”
          Christ is the Savior of the souls of men. Ministers, also, are spoken
          of in Scripture as saving men’s souls. 1 Tim. 4:16, “In doing this,
          thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee.” Rom. 11:14, “
          If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh,
          and might save some of them.” 1 Cor. 9:22, “That I might by all means
          save some. And whereas it is said, Oba. 21, “Saviors shall come upon
          mount Zion;” ministers of the gospel are supposed to be there
          intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work of ministers is in many respects like the work that Christ
          himself was appointed to, as the Savior of men; and especially the
          same with the work which Christ does in his prophetical office; only
          with this difference, that ministers are to speak and act wholly under
          Christ, as taught of him, as holding forth his word, and by light and
          strength communicated from him. Christ himself, after his baptism,
          followed the work of the ministry. He was a minister of the true
          sanctuary (Heb. 8:2), he spake and acted as his Father’s minister; was
          a minister of the gospel, and as such preached and administered
          sacraments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pastors of churches are ministers of the same gospel. But in their
          ministry, they act as the ministers of Christ. Jesus Christ is the
          great Bishop of souls. Ministers are also bishops under him. Christ
          came into the world that he might be the light of the world. Ministers
          are set to be lights unto the churches, and are also set to be the
          light of the world, Mat. 5:14. Christ is the bright and morning star.
          Ministers are stars in the Christ’s hand. Christ is the messenger of
          the covenant. Ministers are called messengers of the Lord of hosts.
          Christ is his people’s shepherd, the good shepherd, the great shepherd
          of his sheep. Ministers are also frequently called shepherds and are
          directed to feed the flock of Christ, which he purchased with his own
          blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing therefore it is thus, that the work that ministers are called
          and devoted to, is no other than the work of Christ, or the work that
          Christ does, certainly they ought to do his work; which they do not do
          unless they imitate him, and do as he does, or as he hath set them an
          example.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, the example of Christ is most worthy of ministers’ imitation.
          His example was perfect, without error, blemish, or defect; and
          therefore worthy to be made our rule, and to be regarded and followed
          without exception, limitation, or reserve; unless in those things
          which he did that were proper to his peculiar office. Christ’s virtue
          was not only perfect, but was exercised in those circumstances, and
          under those trials, that rendered his virtuous acts vastly the most
          amiable of any that ever appeared in any creature whether man or
          angel. If we consider the perfection of the virtue that Christ
          exercised, his virtue did exceed that of the most eminent saints, more
          than the purest gold exceeds the meanest and foulest ore. And if we
          consider the manner of its exercise, and the trials under which it was
          exercised, and the blessed fruits it has brought forth, so his virtue
          exceeds that of all other perfectly innocent creatures, and even of
          the brightest angel, as the sun in its glory exceeds the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this example was set us in our own nature, and so is especially
          fitted for our imitation. There was in the man Christ Jesus, who was
          one of us, and dwelt among us, such exercises of virtue as became our
          state and circumstances in the world, as those who dwell in frail
          flesh and blood, and as members of human society, and dwellers in such
          a world of sorrow and death.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then these amiable exercises of virtue in Christ were exhibited
          chiefly in the things which he did in that work wherein ministers are
          called to act as coworkers with him. The bright and glorious example
          of Christ that is set before us is chiefly in what he did during the
          three years and a half of his public ministry; and in the devotion,
          heavenly-mindedness, humility patience, meekness, forgiveness,
          self-denial, and charity, which he exercised in the labors and
          sufferings he went through for the good of the souls of men. And
          therefore is especially set for the imitation of those who are set
          apart that they may make it the whole business of their lives to seek
          the same good of souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, ministers should follow that example of Christ which has been
          spoken of, because if they are fit for ministers, and are such as have
          any right to take that work upon themselves, Christ has set them this
          example in what he has done for their souls. “I have given you an
          example (says Christ in the text) that you should do as I have done to
          you.” Ministers should be animated in this work by a great love to the
          souls of men, and should be ready to spend and be spent for them; for
          Christ loved them, and gave himself for them. He loved them with a
          love stronger than death. They should have compassion to men under
          their spiritual miseries, as Christ had pity on them. They should be
          much in prayer for the people of their flock, considering how Christ
          prayed and agonized for them, in tears of blood. They should travail
          in birth with the souls that are committed to their care, seeing their
          own salvation is the fruit of the travail of Christ’s soul. They
          should exercise a meek and condescending spirit to the mean and weak
          and poor, and should as it were wash the feet of Christ’s disciples;
          considering how Christ condescended to them, when they were wretched,
          and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked, and abased himself to
          wash their feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chief trials of Christ’s virtue, and so their most bright and
          eminent exercises, were in the abasement, labor, and suffering that he
          was the subject of for our salvation. Which certainly may well endear
          those virtues to us, and greatly engage us to imitate that example. So
          the things whereof this example consists, were things by which we have
          infinite benefit, without which we should have been unspeakably
          miserable for ever and ever, and by virtue of which we have the
          glorious privilege of the children of God, and have a full title to
          the crown of exceeding glory, and pleasures for evermore, at God’s
          right hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I now proceed, as was proposed, in the third place, to apply what
          has been said to myself, and others that are employed in this sacred
          work of the gospel ministry, and to such as are about to undertake it,
          or are candidates for it; and particularly to him that is now to be
          solemnly set apart to this work in this place.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are those to whom these things especially belong. We may hear
          Christ saying to us this day, “I have given you an example, that ye
          should do as I have done.” For the words of Christ in the text were
          not only spoken to the twelve, but are also spoken unto us. We have
          now had represented to us, though in a very imperfect manner, the
          example that Christ has set, and what reasons there are that we, above
          all others, should imitate it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not only our great duty, but will be our greatest honor, to
          imitate Christ, and do the work that he has done, and so act as
          coworkers with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two kinds of persons that are given to Christ, and appointed
          and devoted of God to be his servants, to be employed with Christ, and
          under him, in his great work of the salvation of the souls of men; and
          they are angels and ministers. The angels are all of them, even the
          most exalted of them, subjected of God the Father to our Redeemer, and
          given to him as his servants, to be subservient to the great designs
          of his saving and glorifying his elect. Heb. 1:14, “Are they not all
          ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be
          heirs of salvation?” And doubtless they were created for this very
          end; God made them for his Son, to be subservient to him in this great
          work; which seems to be the chief design of all God’s works. And the
          employment of ministers of the gospel in this respect, is like that of
          the glorious angels. The principalities and powers in heavenly places,
          esteem it not any debasement, but their great honor, to be employed as
          Christ’s ministers in this work. For therein they are employed as the
          ministers of God, in the greatest and most honorable of all God’s
          works; that work of God wherein his glory is chiefly displayed, and
          which his heart was chiefly upon from eternity. It is the honor of the
          Son of God himself, that he is appointed to this work. It was because
          God the Father infinitely loved his Son, and delighted to put honor
          upon him, that he appointed him to be the author of that glorious work
          of the salvation of men. And when we consider the greatness,
          importance, and excellency of it, we have reason to be astonished at
          the condescension of God, that he would ever improve mere creatures as
          coworkers and ministers of Christ in this affair; for who is
          sufficient for these things? 2 Cor. 2:6, “Which is fit, or worthy? Who
          is equal to a work of such dignity, and vast importance?” Especially
          have we reason to wonder that God will employ, not only holy and
          glorious angels, but feeble, frail, sinful worms of the dust in this
          work, who need redemption themselves. And yet the honor that is put
          upon faithful ministers is, in some respects, greater than that of the
          angels. They seem to be that kind of servants that are the most
          dignified of the two. For Christ makes his angels to be ministering
          spirits unto them, unto the faithful ministers. And the angels are
          their angels: as faithful ministers of the gospel are not only
          ministers to the church, but dignified members of the church, that
          spouse of the King of glory, on whom the most glorious angels, the
          highest ministers in the court of heaven, are appointed to attend. And
          then Christ seems especially to delight to carry on his work of the
          salvation of souls, through the ministrations of men, who have that
          nature that Christ is united to, and that are of those sons of men
          with whom he had his delight before the world was made. So it is by
          the ministration of men, that the Scriptures are given. They were the
          penmen of the Holy Bible; and by them the gospel is preached to the
          world. By them ordinances are administered, and, through their
          ministrations, especially, souls are converted. When Christ himself
          was employed in the work of the ministry, in the time of his
          humiliation, but few, comparatively, were brought home to him,
          immediately by his ministrations. It pleased Christ to reserve this
          honor for his disciples and ministers, after his ascension, to whom he
          promised that they should, in this respect, do greater works than he,
          John 14:12. And accordingly it was by their preaching that the Gentile
          world was converted, and Satan’s kingdom overthrown. Thus God delights
          “to perfect praise out of the mouths of babes and suckling, that he
          may still the enemy and the avenger.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be our great honor that we are called to this work of Christ,
          if therein we follow him. For therein we shall be like the Son of God.
          But if we are unfaithful in this office, and do not imitate our
          Master, our offense will be heinous in proportion to the dignity of
          our office, and our final and everlasting disgrace and ignominy
          proportionably great. And we, who in honor are exalted up to heaven,
          shall be cast down proportionably low in hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us further consider, that our following the example of Christ in
          the work of the ministry, is the way to enjoy the sensible joyful
          presence of Christ with us. The disciples had the comfort of Christ’s
          presence and conversation by following him, and going where he went.
          When we cease to follow him, he will go fro us, and we shall soon lose
          sight of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our being conformed to Christ’s example, will also be the way for us
          to be conformed to him, and partake with him in his privileges. It is
          the way for us to have his joy fulfilled in us. Christ, in doing the
          work to which the Father appointed him, obtained a glorious victory
          over his enemies, and having spoiled principalities and powers,
          triumphed over them. If we imitate his example, it will be the way for
          us in like manner to conquer the principalities and powers, yea, to be
          much more than conquerors. It will be the way for us always to triumph
          in Jesus Christ. It will be the way for us to obtain success in our
          ministry, and actually to be made the happy instruments of the eternal
          salvation of souls. Christ has not only told us, but shown us, the way
          to success in our business, and the way to victory over all that
          oppose us in it. And our imitating Christ in our ministry, will be the
          way for us to be partakers with him in his glory; the way for us in
          like manner to be approved, and openly honored and rewarded by God;
          the way to be brought to sit with Christ on his throne, as he is set
          down with the Father on his throne. And as Christ is now exalted to
          shine as the bright luminary and glory of heaven, so our following his
          example will be the way for us to be exalted, to shine with him, “as
          the stars for ever and ever,” Dan. 12:3. And as Christ in heaven
          rejoices in his success, and will receive his church, presented to him
          without spot, as his everlasting crown; so our imitating Christ in our
          work, will be the way to partake with Christ in this joy, and have the
          souls whose salvation we are the instruments of, to be our crown of
          rejoicing for ever. Thus Christ and we shall rejoice together in that
          world of glory and joy where there is no more labor or sorrow. And we
          must enter into that joy and glory, in the way of following Christ in
          our work. There is no other way for ministers to enter there.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that we may thus follow Christ’s example, and be partakers with
          him in his glory, we had need to be much in prayer for his Spirit.
          Christ himself, though the eternal Son of God, obtained the Holy
          Spirit for himself in a way of prayer. Luke 3:21, 22, “Jesus being
          baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghost
          descended like a dove upon him.” If we have the Spirit of Christ
          dwelling in us, we shall have Christ himself thereby living in us, and
          then we shall undoubtedly live like him. If that fountain of light
          dwells richly in us, we shall shine like him, and so shall be burning
          and shining lights.
        </p>
        <p>
          That we may be and behave like Christ, we should earnestly seek much
          acquaintance with him, and much love to him, and be much in secret
          converse with him. It is natural, and as it were necessary, for us to
          imitate those whom we are much acquainted and conversant with, and
          have a strong affection for.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in order to our imitating Christ in the work of the ministry, in
          any tolerable degree, we had need not to have our hearts overcharged,
          and time filled up with worldly affections, cares, and pursuits. The
          duties of a minister that have been recommended, are absolutely
          inconsistent with a mind much taken up with worldly profit, glory,
          amusements, and entertainments.
        </p>
        <p>
          And another thing that is of very great importance, in order to our
          doing the work that Christ did, is that we take heed that the religion
          we promote, be that same religion that Christ taught and promoted, and
          not any of its counterfeits and delusive appearances, or anything
          substituted by the subtle devices of Satan, or vain imaginations of
          men, in lieu of it. If we are zealous and very diligent to promote
          religion, but do not take good care to distinguish true from false
          religion, we shall be in danger of doing much more hurt than good with
          all our zeal and activity.
        </p>
        <p>I come now to the</p>
        <p>
          IV. And last thing at first proposed, viz. to show what improvement
          should be made of what has been said, by the people of this church and
          congregation, who are now about solemnly to commit their souls to the
          charge of him whom they have chosen to be their pastor, and who is now
          about to be set apart to that office.
        </p>
        <p>
          And YOU, MY BRETHREN, as all of you have immortal souls to save, if
          you have considered the things that have been spoken, cannot but be
          sensible, that it not only greatly concerns your elect pastor to take
          heed how he behaves himself in his great work, wherein he is to act as
          a coworker with Christ for your salvation; but that it infinitely
          concerns you how you receive him, and behave towards him. Seeing that
          it is for your eternal salvation that he is appointed to watch and
          labor; and seeing his business is to do the work of Christ for you, it
          is natural and easy to infer, that your reception and entertainment of
          him should in some respect imitate the church’s reception of Jesus
          Christ. Gal. 4:14, “My temptation which was in my flesh, ye despised
          not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ
          Jesus.” Christ, in the text, commands those whom he sends to follow
          his example, and then in the 20th verse following, he directs those to
          whom he sends them, how to treat them. “Verily, verily, I say unto
          you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me; and he that
          receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.” Seeing the work of your
          minister is in some respects the same with the work of Christ, and he
          is to be appointed and devoted to do this work for your souls in
          particular, surely you should esteem him very highly in love for his
          work’s sake and do all that is in your power to help him, and put him
          under the best advantages to imitate his great Master in this work, to
          give himself wholly to his work, as Christ did during the time of his
          ministry, and to be successful in his work. And as it was observed
          before, that it is impossible that ministers should in any tolerable
          degree imitate the example of Christ in their work, if their minds are
          overcharged with worldly cares and concerns, you ought so to provide
          for him and support him, that he shall have no need to entangle
          himself with these things; otherwise you will not only bring a great
          temptation upon him, which will vastly tend to hinder him in the work
          of Christ among you, but will, for the sake of sparing a little of
          your worldly substance to yourselves, foolishly and miserably starve
          your own souls and the souls of your children, and will but cheat
          yourselves. For you will not be in the way to prosper either in your
          spiritual or temporal concerns. The way to have your houses filled
          with plenty, is to “honor the Lord with your substance, and with the
          first-fruits of all your increase.” Pro. 3:9.

        <p>
          And as it is your duty and interest well to support your minister, so
          it concerns you to pray earnestly for him, and each one to do what in
          him lies in all respects to encourage and help him, and strengthen his
          hands, by attending diligently to his ministry, receiving the truth in
          love, treating him with the honor due to a messenger of Christ,
          carefully avoiding all contention with him, and one with another. And
          take heed in particular, that you do not forsake him to follow those,
          who under pretense of extraordinary purity, are doubtless doing the
          devil’s work, in separating themselves, and endeavoring to draw off
          others from the ministers and churches in the land in general.

          If you think I have spoken something freely to you, I hope it will be
          considered, that this is probably the last time you will ever hear me
          speak from the pulpit, and that I shall never see you again, till we
          see one another in the invisible and eternal world, where these things
          will open to us all in their just importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now nothing is left but to express my sincerest wishes and
          prayers, that the God of all grace would be with you and your elect
          pastor, and that he would give you in him a great and long-lasting
          blessing, that you may enjoy much of the presence of Christ with you
          in him. That in him may be made up the great loss you sustained by the
          death of your former faithful and eminent pastor, whose praise was in
          all the churches. And that you may receive him as you ought to receive
          a faithful minister of Jesus Christ, and may be a great comfort to
          him, and may receive great spiritual and eternal benefit by his means
          And that you may be each other’s crown of rejoicing in the day of the
          Lord Jesus.
