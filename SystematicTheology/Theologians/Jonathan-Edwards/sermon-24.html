        <h2>Ruth’s Resolutions – Ruth 1:16</h2>
        <p class="title">Dated April 1735</p>
        <p>
          Ruth 1:16, “And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return
          from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and
          where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and
          thy God my God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THE historical things in this book of Ruth, seem to be inserted in the
          canon of the Scripture, especially on two accounts:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, because Christ was of Ruth’s posterity. The Holy Ghost thought
          fit to take particular notice of that marriage of Boaz with Ruth,
          whence sprang the Savior of the world. We may often observe it, that
          the Holy Spirit who indited the Scriptures, often takes notice of
          little things, or minute occurrences, that do but remotely relate to
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, because this history seems to be typical of the calling of
          the Gentile church, and indeed of the conversion of every believer.
          Ruth was not originally of Israel, but was a Moabitess, and alien from
          the commonwealth of Israel, but she forsook her own people, and the
          idols of the Gentiles, to worship the God of Israel, and to join
          herself to that people. Herein she seems to be a type of the Gentile
          church, and also of every sincere convert. Ruth was the remote mother
          of Christ. He came of her posterity. So the church is Christ’s mother,
          as she is represented, Rev. 12 at the beginning. And so also is every
          true Christian his mother. Mat. 12:50, “Whosoever shall do the will of
          my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and
          mother.” Christ is what the soul is in travail with, at the new birth.
          Ruth forsook all her natural relations, and her own country, the land
          of her nativity, and all her former possessions there, for the sake of
          the God of Israel, as every true Christian forsakes all for Christ.
          Psa. 45:10, “Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
          forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Naomi was now returning out of the land of Moab, into the land of
          Israel, with her two daughters-in-law, Orpah and Ruth, who will
          represent to us two sorts of professors of religion. Orpah
          [represents] those who indeed make a fair profession, and seem to set
          out well, but continue only for a while, and then turn back. Ruth
          [represents] those who are sound and sincere, and therefore are
          stedfast and perservering in their way. Naomi, in the preceding
          verses, represents to her daughters the difficulties of their leaving
          their own country to go with her. And in this verse may be observed,
        </p>
        <p>
          1.The remarkable conduct and behavior of Ruth on this occasion: with
          what inflexible resolution she cleaves to Naomi, and follows her. When
          Naomi first arose to return from the country of Moab into the land of
          Israel, Orpah and Ruth both set out with her, and Naomi exhorts them
          both to return. And both wept, and seemed as if they could not bear
          the thoughts of leaving her, and appeared as if they were resolved to
          go with her. Verse 10, “And they said unto her, Surely we will return
          with thee unto thy people.” Then Naomi says to them again, “Turn
          again, my daughters, go your way,” etc. And then they were greatly
          affected again, and Orpah returned and went back. Now Ruth’s
          stedfastness in her purpose had a greater trial, but yet is not
          overcome: “She clave unto her,” verse 14. Then Naomi speaks to her
          again, verse 15, “Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her
          people, and unto her gods; return thou after thy sister-in-law.” And
          then she shows her immovable resolution in the text and following
          verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. I would particularly observe that wherein the virtuousness of this
          her resolution consists, viz. that it was for the sake of the God of
          Israel, and that she might be one of his people, that she was thus
          resolved to cleave to Naomi: “Thy people shall be my people, and thy
          God my God.” It was for God’s sake that she did thus, and therefore
          her so doing is afterwards spoken of as a virtuous behavior in her,
          Ruth 2:11,12, “And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been
          showed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the
          death of thine husband; and how thou has left thy father, and thy
          mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which
          thou knewest not heretofore. The Lord recompense thy work, and a full
          reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings thou
          are come to trust.” She left her father and mother, and the land of
          her nativity, to come and trust under the shadow of God’s wings, and
          she had indeed a full reward given her, as Boaz wished. For besides
          immediate spiritual blessings to her own soul, and eternal rewards in
          another world, she was rewarded with plentiful and prosperous outward
          circumstances in the family of Boaz. And God raised up David and
          Solomon of her seed, and established the crown of Israel (the people
          that she chose before her own people) in her posterity; and, which is
          much more, of her seed he raised up Jesus Christ, in whom all the
          families of the earth are blessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the words thus opened, I observe this for the subject of my
          present discourse: — “When those that we have formerly been conversant
          with, are turning to God, and joining themselves to his people, it
          ought to be our firm resolution, that we will not leave them, but that
          their people shall be our people, and their God our God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It sometimes happens, that of those who have been conversant one with
          another — who have dwelt together as neighbors, and have been often
          together as companions, or united in their relation, and have been
          together in darkness, bondage, and misery, in the service of Satan —
          some are enlightened, and have their minds changed, are made to see
          the great evil of sin, and have their hearts turned to God. They are
          influenced by the Holy Spirit of God, to leave their company that are
          on Satan’s side, and to join themselves with that blessed company that
          are with Jesus Christ. They are made willing to forsake the tents of
          wickedness, to dwell in the land of uprightness with the people of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And sometimes this proves a final parting or separation between them
          and those with whom they have been formerly conversant. Though it may
          be no parting in outward respects, they may still dwell, and converse
          one with another. Yet in other respects, it sets them at a great
          distance. One is a child of God, and the other his enemy. One is in a
          miserable, and the other in a happy, condition. One is a citizen of
          the heavenly Zion, the other is under condemnation to hell. They are
          no longer together in those respects wherein they used to be together.
          They used to be of one mind to serve sin, and do Satan’s work, now
          they are of contrary minds. They used to be together in worldliness
          and sinful vanity, now they are of exceeding different dispositions.
          They are separated as they are in different kingdoms. The one remains
          in the kingdom of darkness, the other is translated into the kingdom
          of God’s dear Son. And sometimes they are finally separated in these
          respects: while one dwells in the land of Israel, and in the house of
          God, the other, like Orpah, lives and dies in the land of Moab.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is lamentable, it is awful being parted so. It is doleful, when
          of those who have formerly been together in sin, some turn to God, and
          join themselves with his people, that it should prove a parting
          between them and their former companions and acquaintance. It should
          be our firm and inflexible resolution in such a case, that it shall be
          no parting, but that we will follow them, that their people shall be
          our people, and their God our God, and that for the following reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. .Because their God is a glorious God. There is none like him, who
          is infinite in glory and excellency. He is the most high God, glorious
          in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders. His name is excellent
          in all the earth, and his glory is above the heavens. Among the gods
          there is none like unto him. There is none in heaven to be compared to
          him, nor are there any among the sons of the mighty that can be
          likened unto him. Their God is the fountain of all good, and an
          inexhaustible fountain. He is an all-sufficient God, able to protect
          and defend them, and do all things for them. He is the King of glory,
          the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle: a strong rock,
          and a high tower. There is none like the God of Jeshurun, who rideth
          on the heaven in their help, and in his excellency on the sky. The
          eternal God is their refuge, and underneath are everlasting arms. He
          is a God who has all things in his hands, and does whatsoever he
          pleases. He killeth and maketh alive; he bringeth down to the grave
          and bringeth up; he maketh poor and maketh rich: the pillars of the
          earth are the Lord’s. Their God is an infinitely holy God. There is
          none holy as the Lord. And he is infinitely good and merciful. Many
          that others worship and serve as gods, are cruel beings, spirits that
          seek the ruin of souls, but this is a God that delighteth in mercy.
          His grace is infinite, and endures forever. He is love itself, and
          infinite fountain and ocean of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such a God is their God! Such is the excellency of Jacob! Such is the
          God of them who have forsaken their sins and are converted! They have
          made a wise choice who have chosen this for their God. They have made
          a happy exchange indeed, that have exchanged sin, and the world, for
          such a God!
        </p>
        <p>
          They have an excellent and glorious Savior, who is the only-begotten
          Son of God: the brightness of his Father’s glory. One in whom God from
          eternity had infinite delight; a Savior of infinite love; one that has
          shed his own blood, and made his soul an offering for their sins, and
          one that is able to save them to the uttermost.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Their people are an excellent and happy people. God has renewed
          them, and stamped his own image upon them, and made them partakers of
          his holiness. They are more excellent than their neighbors, Pro.
          12:26. Yea, they are the excellent of the earth, Psa. 16:3. They are
          lovely in the sight of the angels, and they have their souls adorned
          with those graces that in the sight of God himself are of great price.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people of God are the most excellent and happy society in the
          world. That God whom they have chosen for their God, is their Father.
          He has pardoned all their sins, and they are at peace with him, and he
          has admitted them to all the privileges of his children. As they have
          devoted themselves to God, so he has given himself to them. He is
          become their salvation, and their portion: his power and mercy, and
          all his attributes are theirs. They are in a safe state, free from all
          possibility of perishing. Satan has no power to destroy them. God
          carries them on eagle’s wings, far above Satan’s reach, and above the
          reach of all the enemies of their souls. God is with them in this
          world. They have his gracious presence. God is for them: who then can
          be against them? As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so
          Jehovah is round about them. God is their shield, and their exceeding
          great reward, and their fellowship is with the Father, and with his
          Son Jesus Christ. They have the divine promise and oath, that in the
          world to come they shall dwell forever in the glorious presence of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may well be sufficient to induce us to resolve to cleave to those
          that forsake their sins and idols to join themselves with this people,
          that God is with them, Zec. 8:23, “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, in
          those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of
          all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him
          that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you; for we have heard that God
          is with you.” So should persons, as it were, take hold of the skirt of
          their neighbors and companions that have turned to God, and resolve
          that they will go with them, because God is with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Happiness is no where else to be had, but in their God, and with
          their people. There are that are called gods many, and lords many.
          Some make gods of their pleasures; some choose Mammon for their god;
          some make gods of their supposed excellencies, or the outward
          advantages they have above their neighbors; some choose one thing for
          their god, and other another. But men can be happy in no other but the
          God of Israel. He is the only fountain of happiness. Other gods cannot
          help in calamity. Nor can any of them afford what the poor empty soul
          stands in need of. Let men adore those other gods never so much, and
          call upon them never so earnestly, and serve them never so diligently.
          They will nevertheless remain poor, wretched, unsatisfied, undone
          creatures. All other people are miserable, but that people whose God
          is the Lord. — The world is divided into two societies: the people of
          God, the little flock of Jesus Christ, that company that we read of,
          Rev. 14:4, “These are they which were not defiled with women; for they
          are virgins: these are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he
          goeth: these were redeemed from among men, being the first-fruits unto
          God, and to the Lamb:” and, those that belong to the kingdom of
          darkness, that are without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth
          of Israel, strangers from the covenant of promise, having no hope, and
          without God in the world. All that are of this latter company are
          wretched and undone. They are the enemies of God, and under his wrath
          and condemnation. They are the devil’s slaves, that serve him
          blindfold, and are befooled and ensnared by him, and hurried along in
          the broad way to eternal perdition.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. When those that we have formerly been conversant with are turning
          to God and to his people, their example ought to influence us. Their
          example should be looked upon as the call of God to us, to do as they
          have done. God, when he changes the heart of one, calls upon another,
          especially does he loudly call on those that have been their friends
          and acquaintance. We have been influenced by their examples in evil,
          and shall we cease to follow them, when they make the wisest choice
          that ever they made, and do the best thing that ever they did? If we
          have been companions with them in worldliness, in vanity, in
          unprofitable and sinful conversation, it will be a hard case, if there
          must be a parting now, because we are not willing to be companions
          with them in holiness and true happiness. Men are greatly influenced
          by seeing one another’s prosperity in other things. If those whom they
          have been much conversant with, grow rich, and obtain any great
          earthly advantages, it awakens their ambition, and eager desire after
          the like prosperity. How much more should they be influenced, and
          stirred up to follow them, and be like them, when they obtain that
          spiritual and eternal happiness, that is of infinitely more worth,
          than all the prosperity and glory of this world!
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Our resolutions to cleave to and follow those that are turning to
          God, and joining themselves to his people, ought to be fixed and
          strong, because of the great difficulty of it. If we will cleave to
          them, and have their God for our God, and their people for our people,
          we must mortify and deny all our lusts, and cross every evil appetite
          and inclination, and forever part with all sin. But our lusts are many
          and violent. Sin is naturally exceeding dear to us. To part with it is
          compared to plucking out our right eyes. Men may refrain from wonted
          ways of sin for a little while, and may deny their lusts in a partial
          degree, with less difficulty; but it is heart-rending work, finally to
          part with all sin, and to give our dearest lusts a bill of divorce,
          utterly to send them away. But this we must do, if we would follow
          those that are truly turning to God. Yea, we must not only forsake
          sin, but must, in a sense, forsake all the world, Luke 14:33,
          “Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot
          be my disciple.” That is, he must forsake all in his heart, and must
          come to a thorough disposition and readiness actually to quit all for
          God, and the glorious spiritual privileges of his people, whenever the
          case may require it, and that without any prospect of anything of the
          like nature, or any worldly thing whatsoever, to make amends for it —
          all to go into a strange country, a land that has hitherto been
          unseen, like Abraham, who being called of god, “went out of his own
          country, and from his kindred, and from his father’s house, for a land
          that God should show him, not knowing whither he went.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, it was a hard thing for Ruth to forsake her native country, her
          father and mother, her kindred and acquaintance, and all the pleasant
          things she had in the land of Moab, to dwell in the land of Israel,
          where she never had been. Naomi told her of the difficulties once and
          again. They were too hard for her sister Orpah. The consideration of
          them turned her back after she was set out. Her resolution was not
          firm enough to overcome them. But so firmly resolved was Ruth, that
          she brake through all. She was stedfast in it, that let the difficulty
          be what it would, she would not leave her mother-in-law. So persons
          had need to be very firm in their resolution to conquer the
          difficulties that are in the way of cleaving to them who are indeed
          turning from sin to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our cleaving to them, and having their God for our God, and their
          people for our people, depends on our resolution and choice, and that
          in two respects.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.The firmness of resolution in using means in order to it, is the way
          to have means effectual. There are means appointed in order to our
          becoming some of the true Israel, and having their God for our God.
          The thorough use of these means is the way to have success, but not a
          slack or slighty use of them. And that we may be thorough, there is
          need of strength of resolution, a firm and inflexible disposition and
          bent of mind to be universal in the use of means, and to do what we do
          with our might, and to persevere in it. Mat. 11:12, “The kingdom of
          heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. A choosing of their God, and their people, with a full
          determination, and with the whole soul, is the condition of an union
          with them. God gives every man his choice in this matter: as Orpah and
          Ruth had their choice, whether they would go with Naomi into the land
          of Israel, or stay in the land of Moab. A natural man may choose
          deliverance from hell, but no man does ever heartily choose God and
          Christ, and the spiritual benefits that Christ has purchased, and the
          happiness of God’s people, till he is converted. On the contrary, he
          is averse to them. He has no relish of them; and is wholly ignorant of
          their inestimable worth and value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many carnal men seem to choose these things, but do it not really, as
          Orpah seemed at first to choose to forsake Moab to go into the land of
          Israel. But when Naomi came to set before her the difficulty of it,
          she went back, and thereby showed that she was not fully determined in
          her choice, and that her whole soul was not in it as Ruth’s was.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          The use that I shall make of what has been said, is to move sinners to
          this resolution, with respect to those amongst us that have lately
          turned to God, and joined themselves to the flock of Christ. Through
          the abundant mercy and grace of God to us in this place, it may be
          said of many of you that are in a Christless condition, that you have
          lately been left by those that were formerly with you in such a state.
          Some of those with whom you have formerly been conversant, have lately
          forsaken a life of sin and the service of Satan, and have turned to
          God, and fled to Christ, and joined themselves to that blessed company
          that are with him. They formerly were with you in sin and in misery,
          but now they are with you no more in that state or manner of life.
          They are changed, and have fled from wrath to come. They have chosen a
          life of holiness here, and the enjoyment of God hereafter. They were
          formerly your associates in bondage, and were with you in Satan’s
          business, but now you have their company no longer in these things.
          Many of you have seen those you live with, under the same roof,
          turning from being any longer with you in sin, to be with the people
          of Jesus Christ. Some of you that are husbands, have had your wives;
          some of you that are wives, have had your husbands; some of you that
          are children, have had your parents; and parents have had your
          children; many of you have had your brothers and sisters; and many
          your near neighbors, and acquaintance and special friends; many of you
          that are young have had your companions: I say, many of you have had
          those that you have been thus concerned with, leaving you, forsaking
          that doleful life and wretched state in which you still continue. God,
          of his good pleasure and wonderful grace, has lately caused in this
          place multitudes to forsake their old abodes in the land of Moab, and
          under the gods of Moab, and go into the land of Israel, to put their
          trust under the wings of the Lord God of Israel. Though you and they
          have been nearly related, and have dwelt together, or have been often
          together and intimately acquainted, they have been taken, and you
          hitherto left! O let it not be the foundation of a final parting! But
          earnestly follow them. Be firm in your resolution in this matter. Do
          not as Orpah did, who though at first she made as though she would
          follow Naomi, yet when she had the difficulty set before her, went
          back. But say as Ruth, “I will not leave thee; but where thou goest, I
          will go: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.” Say as
          she said, and do as she did. Consider the excellency of their God, and
          their Savior, and the happiness of their people, the blessed state
          that they are in, and the doleful state you are in.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are old sinners, who have lived long in the service of Satan, have
          lately seen some that have traveled with you in the paths of sin these
          many years, turning to God. They with you enjoyed great means and
          advantages, had calls and warnings with you, and with you passed
          through remarkable times of the pouring out of God’s Spirit in this
          place, and hardened their hearts and stood it out with you, and with
          you have grown old in sin. Yet you have seen some of them turning to
          God, i.e. you have seen those evidences of it in them, whence you may
          rationally judge that it is so. O! let it not be a final parting! You
          have been thus long together in sin, and under condemnation. Let it be
          your firm resolution, that if possible, you will be with them still,
          now they are in a holy and happy state, and that you will follow them
          into the holy and pleasant land. — You that tell of your having been
          seeking salvation for many years (though, without doubt, in a poor
          dull way, in comparison of what you ought to have done), have seen
          some old sinners and old seekers, as you are, obtaining mercy. God has
          lately roused them from their dullness, and caused them to alter their
          hand, and put them on more thorough endeavors. They have now, after so
          long a time, heard God’s voice, and have fled for refuge to the rock
          of ages. Let this awaken earnestness and resolution in you. Resolve
          that you will not leave them.
        </p>
        <p>
          You who are in your youth how many have you seen of your age and
          standing, that have of late hopefully chosen God for their God, and
          Christ for their Savior! You have followed them in sin, and have
          perhaps followed them into vain company. Will you not now follow them
          to Christ? — And you who are children, know that there have lately
          been some of your sort who have repented of their sins, loved the Lord
          Jesus Christ, and trusted in him, and are become God’s children, as we
          have reason to hope. Let it stir you up to resolve to your utmost to
          seek and cry to God, that you may have the like change made in your
          hearts, that their people may be your people, and their God your God.
        </p>
        <p>
          You who are great sinners, who have made yourselves distinguishingly
          guilty by the wicked practices you have lived in, know that there are
          some of your sort who have lately (as we have reason to hope) had
          their hearts broken for sin, and have forsaken it, and trusted in the
          blood of Christ for the pardon of it. They have chosen a holy life,
          and have betaken themselves to the ways of wisdom: let it excite and
          encourage you resolutely to cleave to them, and earnestly to follow
          them.
        </p>
        <p>Let the following things be considered:</p>
        <p>
          1. That your soul is as precious as theirs. It is immortal as theirs
          is, and stands in as much need of happiness, and can as ill bear
          eternal misery. You was born in the same miserable condition that they
          were, having the same wrath of God abiding on you. You must stand
          before the same Judge, who will be as strict in judgment with you as
          with them. Your own righteousness will stand you in no more stead
          before him than theirs, and therefore you stand in as absolute
          necessity of a Savior as they. Carnal confidences can no more answer
          your end than theirs, nor can this world or its enjoyments serve to
          make you happy without God and Christ more than them. When the
          bridegroom comes, the foolish virgins stand in as much need of oil as
          the wise, Mat. 25 at the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Unless you follow them in their turning to God, their conversion
          will be a foundation of an eternal separation between you and them.
          You will be in different interests, and in exceeding different states,
          as long as you live. They the children of God, and you the children of
          Satan, and you will be parted in another world; when you come to die,
          there will be a vast separation made between you. Luke 16:26, “And
          besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so
          that they which would pass from hence to you, cannot; neither can they
          pass to us, that would come from thence.” And you will be parted at
          the day of judgment. You will be parted at Christ’s first appearance
          in the clouds of heaven. While they are caught up in the clouds to
          meet the Lord in the air, to be ever with the Lord, you will remain
          below, confined to this cursed ground, that is kept in store, reserved
          unto fire, against the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men.
          You will appear separated from them, while you stand before the great
          judgment-seat, they being at the right hand, while you are set at the
          left. Mat. 25:32, 33, “And before him shall be gathered all nations;
          and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth
          his sheep from the goats; and he shall set the sheep on his right
          hand, but the goats on the left.” And you shall then appear in
          exceeding different circumstances: while you stand with devils, in the
          image and deformity of devils, and in ineffable horror and amazement,
          they shall appear in glory, sitting on thrones, as assessors with
          Christ, and as such passing judgment upon you, 1 Cor. 6:2. And what
          shame and confusion will then cover you, when so many of your
          contemporaries, your equals, your neighbors, relations, and
          companions, shall be honored, and openly acknowledged, and confessed
          by the glorious Judge of the universe, and Redeemer of saints, and
          shall be seen by you sitting with him in such glory. You shall appear
          to have neglected your salvation, and not to have improved your
          opportunities, and rejected the Lord Jesus Christ, the same person
          that will then appear as your great Judge, and you shall be the
          subjects of wrath, and as it were, trodden down in eternal contempt
          and disgrace. Dan. 12:2, “Some shall rise to everlasting life, and
          some to shame and everlasting contempt.” And what a wide separation
          will the sentence then passed and executed make between you and them!
          When you shall be sent away out of the presence of the Judge with
          indignation and abhorrence, as cursed and loathsome creatures they
          shall be sweetly accosted and invited into his glory as his dear
          friends, and the blessed of his Father! When you, with all that vast
          throng of wicked and accursed men and devils, shall descend with loud
          lamentings and horrid shrieks, into that dreadful gulf of fire and
          brimstone, and shall be swallowed up in that great and everlasting
          furnace, they shall joyfully, and with sweet songs of glory and
          praise, ascend with Christ, and all that beauteous and blessed company
          of saints and angels, into eternal felicity, in the glorious presence
          of God, and the sweet embraces of his love. You and they shall spend
          eternity in such a separation, and immensely different circumstances!
          You have been intimately acquainted and nearly related, closely united
          and mutually conversant in this world, and you have taken delight in
          each other’s company! And shall it be — after you have been together a
          great while, each of you in undoing yourselves, enhancing your guilt,
          and heaping up wrath — that their so wisely changing their minds and
          their course, and choosing such happiness for themselves, should now
          at length be the beginning of such an exceeding and everlasting
          separation between you and them? How awful will it be to be parted so!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Consider the great encouragement that God gives you, earnestly to
          strive for the same blessing that others have obtained. There is great
          encouragement in the Word of God to sinners to seek salvation, in the
          revelation we have of the abundant provision made for the salvation
          even of the chief of sinners, and in the appointment of so many means
          to be used with and by sinners, in order to their salvation, and by
          the blessing which God in his Word connects with the means of his
          appointment. There is hence great encouragement for all, at all times,
          that will be thorough in using of these means. But now God gives
          extraordinary encouragement in his providence, by pouring out his
          Spirit so remarkably amongst us, and bringing savingly home to himself
          all sorts, young and old, rich and poor, wise and unwise, sober and
          vicious, old self-righteous seekers, and profligate livers: no sort
          are exempt. There is at this day amongst us the loudest call, and the
          greatest encouragement, and the widest door opened to sinners, to
          escape out of a state of sin and condemnation, that perhaps God ever
          granted in New England. Who is there that has an immortal soul, so
          sottish as not to improve such an opportunity, and that will not
          bestir himself with all his might? How unreasonable is negligence, and
          how exceeding unreasonable is negligence, and how exceeding
          unreasonable is discouragement, at such a day as this! Will you be so
          stupid as to neglect your soul now? Will any mortal amongst us be so
          unreasonable as to lag behind, or look back in discouragement, when
          God opens such a door? Let every person be thoroughly awake! Let
          everyone encourage himself now to press forward, and fly for his life!
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Consider how earnestly desirous they that have obtained are that
          you should follow them, and that their people should be your people,
          and their God your God. They desire that you should partake of that
          great good which God has given them, and that unspeakable and eternal
          blessedness which he has promised them. They wish and long it. If you
          do not go with them, and are not still of their company, it will not
          be for want of their willingness, but your own. That of Moses to Hobab
          is the language of every true saint of your acquaintance to you. Num.
          10:29, “We are journeying unto the place of which the Lord said, I
          will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for the
          Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel.” As Moses, when on his
          journey through the wilderness, following the pillar of cloud and
          fire, invited Hobab — with whom he had been acquainted in the land of
          Midian, where Moses had formerly dwelt with him — to go with him and
          his people to Canaan, to partake with them in the good that God had
          promised them, so do those of your friends and acquaintance invite
          you: out of a land of darkness and wickedness, where they have
          formerly been with you, to go with them to the heavenly Canaan. The
          company of saints, the true church of Christ, invite you. The lovely
          bride calls you to the marriage supper. She has authority to invite
          guests to her own wedding, and you ought to look on her invitation and
          desire, as the call of Christ the bridegroom. For it is the voice of
          his Spirit in her, Rev. 22:17, “The Spirit and bride say, Come.” Where
          seems to be a reference to what has been said, chap. 19:7-9, “The
          marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
          And to her was granted, that she should be arrayed in fine linen,
          clean and white; for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
          And he saith unto me, Write, blessed are they which are called to the
          marriage-supper of the Lamb.” It is with respect to this her
          marriage-supper that she, from the motion of the Spirit of the Lamb in
          her, says, Come. So that you are invited on all hands. All conspire to
          call you, [and] God the Father invites you. This is the King who has
          made a marriage for his Son, and he sends forth his servants, the
          ministers of the gospel, to invite the guests. And the Son himself
          invites you: it is he that speaks, Rev. 22:17, “And let him that
          heareth say, Come; and let him that is athirst, come; and whosoever
          will, let him come.” He tells us who he is in the foregoing verse, “I
          Jesus, the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star.”
          And God’s ministers invite you, and all the church invites you; and
          there will be joy in the presence of the angels of God that hour that
          you accept the invitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Consider what a doleful company will be left after this
          extraordinary time of mercy is over. We have reason to think that
          there will be a number left. We read that when Ezekiel’s healing
          waters increased so abundantly, and the healing effect of them was so
          very general. Yet there were certain places, where the waters came,
          that never were healed. Eze. 47:9-11, “And it shall come to pass, that
          everything that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall
          come, shall live. And there shall be a very great multitude of fish,
          because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed, and
          everything shall live whither the river cometh. And it shall come to
          pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it, from En-gedi even unto
          En-eglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets: there fish
          shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea,
          exceeding many. But the miry places thereof, and the marishes thereof,
          shall not be healed, they shall be given to salt.” And even in the
          apostles times, when there was such wonderful success of the gospel
          wherever they came, there were some that did not believe. Acts 13:48,
          “And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the
          word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life,
          believed.” And chap. 28:24, “And some believed, and some believed
          not.” So we have no reason to expect but there will be some left
          amongst us. It is to be hoped it will be but a small company, but what
          a doleful company will it be! How darkly and awfully will it look upon
          them! If you shall be of that company, how well may your friends and
          relations lament over you, and bemoan your dark and dangerous
          circumstances! If you would not be one of them, make haste, delay not,
          and look not behind you. Shall all sorts obtain, shall everyone press
          into the kingdom of God, while you stay loitering behind in a doleful
          undone condition? Shall everyone take heaven, while you remain with no
          other portion but this world? Now take up that resolution, that if it
          be possible you will cleave to them that have fled for refuge to lay
          hold of the hope set before them. Count the cost of a thorough,
          violent, and perpetual pursuit of salvation, and forsake all, as Ruth
          forsook her own country, and all her pleasant enjoyments in it. Do not
          do as Orpah did; who set out, and then was discouraged, and went back.
          But hold out with Ruth through all discouragement and opposition. When
          you consider others that have chosen the better part, let that
          resolution be ever firm with you: “Where thou goest, I will go; where
          thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God
          my God.”
