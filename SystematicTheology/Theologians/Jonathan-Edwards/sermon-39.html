        <p>Psalms 65:2, “O thou that hearest prayer.”</p>
        <p>
          THIS psalm seems to be written, either as a psalm of praise to God for
          some remarkable answer of prayer, in the bestowment of some public
          mercy, or else on occasion of some special faith and confidence which
          David had that his prayer would be answered. It is probable that this
          mercy bestowed, or expected to be bestowed, was some great public
          mercy for which David had been very earnest and importunate, and had
          annexed a vow to his prayer. And that he had vowed to God that if he
          would grant him his request he would render him praise and glory. —
          This seems to be the reason why he expresses himself as he does in the
          first verse of the psalm, “Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion;
          and unto thee shall the vow be performed,” i.e. that praise which I
          have vowed to give thee, on the answer of my prayer, waiteth for thee,
          to be given thee as soon as thou shalt have answered my prayer; and
          the vow which I made to thee shall be performed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the verse of the text, there is a prophecy of the glorious times of
          the gospel, when “all flesh shall come” to the true God, as to the God
          who heareth prayer, which is here mentioned as what distinguishes the
          true God from the gods to whom the nations prayed and sought, those
          gods who cannot hear, and cannot answer their prayer. The time was
          coming when all flesh should come to that God who doth hear prayer. —
          Hence we gather this doctrine, that it is the character of the Most
          High, that he is a God who hears prayer.
        </p>
        <p>I shall handle this point in the following method:</p>
        <p>I. Show that the Most High is a God that hears prayer.</p>
        <p>II. That he is eminently such a God.</p>
        <p>III. That herein he is distinguished for all false gods.</p>
        <p>IV. Give the reasons of the doctrine.</p>
        <p>
          I. The Most High is a God that hears prayer. Though he is infinitely
          above all and stands in no need of creatures, yet he is graciously
          pleased to take a merciful notice of poor worms of the dust. He
          manifests and presents himself as the object of prayer, appears as
          sitting on a mercy-seat, that men may come to him by prayer. When they
          stand in need of anything, he allows them to come, and ask it of him,
          and he is wont to hear their prayers. God in his Word hath given many
          promises that he will hear their prayers. The Scripture is full of
          such examples, and in his dispensations towards his church, manifests
          himself to be a God that hears prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here it may be inquired what is meant by God’s hearing prayer? There
          are two things implied in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, his accepting the supplications of those who pray to him. Their
          address to him is well taken, he is well-pleased with it. He approves
          of their asking such mercies as they request of him and approves of
          their manner of doing it. He accepts of their prayers as an offering
          to him. He accepts the honor they do him in prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, he acts agreeably to his acceptance. He sometimes manifests
          his acceptance of their prayers by special discoveries of his mercy
          and sufficiency, which he makes to them in prayer, or immediately
          after. While they are praying, he gives them sweet views of his
          glorious grace, purity, sufficiency, and sovereignty, and enables
          them, with great quietness, to rest in him, to leave themselves and
          their prayers with him, submitting to his will and trusting in his
          grace and faithfulness. Such a manifestation God seems to have made of
          himself in prayer to Hannah, which quieted and composed her mind, and
          took away her sadness. We read (1 Sam. 1) how earnest she was, and how
          exercised in her mind, and that she was a woman of a sorrowful spirit.
          But she came and poured out her soul before God, and spake out of the
          abundance of her complaint and grief. Then we read that she went away
          and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad, verse 18, which
          seems to have been from some refreshing discoveries which God had made
          of himself to her, to enable her quietly to submit to his will and
          trust in his mercy, whereby God manifested his acceptance of her. —
          Not that I conclude persons can hence argue, that the particular thing
          which they ask will certainly be given them, or that they can
          particularly foretell from it what God will do in answer to their
          prayers, any further than he has promised in his Word. Yet God may,
          and doubtless does, thus testify his acceptance of their prayers, and
          from hence they may confidently rest in his providence [and] in his
          merciful ordering and disposing, with respect to the thing which they
          ask. Again, God manifests his acceptance of their prayers, by doing
          for them agreeably to their needs and supplications. He not only
          inwardly and spiritually discovers his mercy to their souls by his
          Spirit, but outwardly by dealing mercifully with them in his
          providence, in consequence of their prayers, and by causing an
          agreeableness between his providence and their prayers. — I proceed
          now,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. To show that the Most High is eminently a God that hears prayer.
          This appears in several things.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, in his giving such free access to him by prayer. God in his
          Word manifests himself ready at all times to allow us this privilege.
          He sits on a throne of grace, and there is no veil to hide this throne
          and keep us from it. The veil is rent from the top to the bottom. The
          way is open at all times, and we may go to God as often as we please.
          Although God be infinitely above us, yet we may come with boldness.
          Heb. 4:14, 16, “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace,
          that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.” How
          wonderful is it that such worms as we should be allowed to come boldly
          at all times to so great a God! — Thus God indulges all kinds of
          persons, of all nations. 1 Cor. 1:2, 3, “unto all that in every place
          call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours; grace
          be unto you,” etc. Yea, God allows the most vile and unworthy: the
          greatest sinners are allowed to come through Christ. And he not only
          allows, but encourages and frequently invites them, yea, manifests
          himself as delighting in being sought to by prayer. Pro. 15:8, “The
          prayer of the upright is his delight;” and in the Song 2:14, we have
          Christ saying to the spouse, “O my dove, let me hear they voice; for
          sweet is they voice.” The voice of the saints in prayer is sweet unto
          Christ, he delights to hear it. He allows them to be earnest and
          importunate, yea, to the degree as to take no denial, and as it were
          to give him no rest, and even encouraging them so to do. Isa. 62:6, 7,
          “Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence, and give him no
          rest.” Thus Christ encourages us, in the parable of the importunate
          widow and the unjust judge, Luke 18. So, in the parable of the man who
          went to his friend at midnight, Luke 11:5, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus God allowed Jacob to wrestle with him, yea, to be resolute in it,
          “I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.” It is noticed with
          approbation when men are violent for the kingdom of heaven and take it
          by force. Thus Christ suffered the blind man to be most importunate
          and unceasing in his cries to him, Luke 18:38, 39. He continued
          crying, “Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.” Others who were
          present rebuked him, that he should hold his peace, looking upon it as
          too great a boldness and an indecent behavior towards Christ, thus to
          cry after him as he passed by. But Christ did not rebuke him, but
          stood and commanded him to be brought unto him, saying, “What wilt
          thou that I should do to thee?” And when the blind man had told him,
          Christ graciously granted his request. — The freedom of access that
          God gives, appears also in allowing us to come to him by prayer for
          everything we need, both temporal and spiritual, whatever evil we need
          to be delivered from, or good we would obtain. Phil. 4:6, “Be careful
          for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and supplication, with
          thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, that God is eminently of this character, appears in his
          hearing prayer so readily. He often manifests his readiness to hear
          prayer, by giving an answer so speedily, sometimes while they are yet
          speaking, and sometimes before they pray, when they only have a design
          of praying. So ready is God to hear prayer, that he takes notice of
          the first purpose of praying, and sometimes bestows mercy thereupon.
          Isa. 65:24, “And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will
          answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.” We read, that
          when Daniel was making humble and earnest supplication, God sent an
          angel to comfort him and to assure him of an answer, Dan. 9:20-24.
          When God defers for the present to answer the prayer of faith, it is
          not from any backwardness to answer, but for the good of his people
          sometimes, that they may be better prepared for the mercy before they
          receive it, or because another time would be the best and fittest on
          some other account. And even then, when God seems to delay an answer,
          the answer is indeed hastened, as in Luke 18:7, 8, “And shall not God
          avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear
          long with them? I tell you, that he will avenge them speedily.”
          Sometimes, when the blessing seems to tarry, God is even then at work
          to bring it about in the best time and the best manner. Hab. 2:3,
          “Though it tarry, wait for it; it will come, it will not tarry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, that the Most High is eminently one that hears prayer, appears
          by his giving so liberally in answer to prayer. Jam. 1:5, 6, “If any
          of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally,
          and upbraideth not.” Men often show their backwardness to give, both
          by the scantiness of their gifts and by upbraiding those who ask of
          them. They will be sure to put them in mind of some faults when they
          give them anything, but on the contrary, God both gives liberally and
          upbraids us not with our undeservings. He is plenteous and rich in his
          communications to those who call upon him. Psa. 86:5, “For those art
          good and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto all that call
          upon thee.” And Rom. 10:12, “For there is no difference between the
          Jew and the Greek; for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that
          call upon him.” — Sometimes, God not only gives the thing asked, but
          he gives them more than is asked. So he did to Solomon. 1 Kin. 3:12,
          13, “Behold, I have done according to thy words; lo, I have given thee
          a wise and an understanding heart, so that there was none like thee,
          before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. And I
          have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and
          honour; so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee,
          all thy days.” Yea, God will give more to his people than they can
          either ask or think, as is implied in Eph. 3:20, “Now unto him that is
          able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, that God is eminently of this character appears by the
          greatness of the things which he has often done in answer to prayer.
          Thus, when Esau, was coming out against his brother Jacob, with four
          hundred men, without doubtfully resolved to cut him off, Jacob prayed
          and God turned the heart of Esau, so that he met Jacob in a very
          friendly manner, Gen. 32. So in Egypt, at the prayers of Moses, God
          brought those dreadful plagues, and at his prayer removed them again.
          When Samson was ready to perish with thirst, he prayed to God, and he
          brought water out of a dry jaw-bone, for his supply, Jdg. 15:18, 19.
          And when he prayed, after his strength was departed from him, God
          strengthened him, so as to pull down the temple of Dagon on the
          Philistines: so that those whom he slew at his death were more than
          all those whom he slew in his life. — Joshua prayed to God, and said,
          “Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon and thou, Moon, in the valley of
          Ajalon.” And God heard his prayer and caused the sun and moon to stand
          still accordingly. The prophet “Elijah was a man of like passion” with
          us, “and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain; and it rained not
          on the earth by the space of three years and six months. And he prayed
          again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought for her fruit;”
          as the apostle James observes, Jam. 5:17, 18. So God confounded the
          army of Zerah, the Ethiopian, of a thousand thousand, in answer to the
          prayer of Asa, 2 Chr. 14:9, etc. And God sent an angel and slew in one
          night an hundred and eighty-five thousand men of Sennacherib’s army,
          in answer to Hezekiah’s prayer, 2 Kin. 19:14-16, 19, 35.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, this truth appears, in that God is, as it were, overcome by
          prayer. When God is displeased by sin, he manifests his displeasure,
          comes out against us in his providence, and seems to oppose and resist
          us. In such cases, God is, speaking after the manner of men, overcome
          by humble and fervent prayer. “The effectual fervent prayer of a
          righteous man availeth much,” Jam. 5:16. It has a great power in it:
          such a prayer-hearing God is the Most High, that he graciously
          manifests himself as conquered by it. Thus God appeared to oppose
          Jacob in what he sought of him. Yet Jacob was resolute and overcame.
          Therefore God changed his name from Jacob to Israel, for says he, “as
          a prince thou hast power with God and with men, and hast prevailed,”
          Gen. 32:28. A mighty prince indeed! Hos 12:4, “Yea, he had power over
          the angel, and prevailed; He wept and made supplication unto him.” —
          When his anger was provoked against Israel, and he appeared to be
          ready to consume them in his hot displeasure, Moses stood in the gap,
          and by his humbled and earnest prayer and supplication, averted the
          stroke of divine vengeance, Exo. 32:9, etc. Num. 14:11, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Herein the most high God is distinguished from false gods. The
          true God is the only one of this character. There is no other of whom
          it may be said, that he heareth prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of those things that are worshipped as gods are idols made by
          their worshippers: mere stocks and stones that know nothing. They are
          indeed made with ears, but they hear not the prayers of them that cry
          to them. They have eyes, but they see not, etc. Psa. 115:5, 6. —
          Others, though not the work of men’s hands, yet are things without
          life. Thus, many worship the sun, moon, and stars, which though
          glorious creatures, yet are not capable of knowing anything of the
          wants and desires of those who pray to them. — Some worship certain
          kinds of animals, as the Egyptians were wont to worship bulls, which
          though not without life, yet are destitute of that reason whereby they
          would be capable of knowing the requests of their worshippers. Others
          worship devils instead of the true God. 1 Cor. 10:20, “but I say, that
          the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils.”
          These, though beings of great power, have not knowledge necessary to
          capacitate them fully to understand the state, circumstances,
          necessities, and desires of those who pray to them. But the true God
          perfectly knows the circumstances of everyone that prays to him
          throughout the world. Though millions pray to him at once, in
          different parts of the world, it is no more difficult for him who is
          infinite in knowledge, to take notice of all than of one alone. God is
          so perfect in knowledge, that he does not need to be informed by us in
          order to a knowledge of our wants, for he know what things we need
          before we ask him. The worshippers of false gods were wont to lift
          their voices and cry aloud, lest their gods should fail of hearing
          them, as Elijah tauntingly bid the worshippers of Baal [to] do, 1 Kin.
          18:27. But the true God hears the silent petitions of his people. He
          needs not that we should cry aloud: yea, he knows and perfectly
          understands when we only pray in our hearts, as Hannah did, 1 Sam.
          1:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          Idols are but vanities and lies: in them is no help. As to power or
          knowledge, they are nothing. As the apostle says, 1 Cor. 8:4, “An idol
          is nothing in the world.” As to images, they are so far from having
          power to answer prayer, that they are not able to act, “They have
          hands, and handle not; feet have they, but they walk not; neither
          speak they through their throat.” They, therefore, that make them and
          pray to them, are senseless and sottish, and make themselves, as it
          were, stocks and stones, like unto them: Psa. 115:7, 8, and Jer. 10:5.
          “They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not; they must needs be
          borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot
          do evil; neither also is it in them to do good.” As to the hosts of
          heaven, the sun, moon, and stars: although mankind receive benefit by
          them, yet they act only by necessity of nature. Therefore they have no
          power to do anything in answer to prayers. And devils, though
          worshipped as gods, are not able, if they had disposition, to make
          those happy who worship them, and [they] can do nothing at all but by
          divine permission and as subject to the disposal of Divine Providence.
          When the children of Israel departed from the true God to idols, and
          yet cried to him in their distress, he reproved them for their folly,
          by bidding them cry to the gods whom they had served, for deliverance
          in the time of their tribulation, Jos. 10:14. So God challenges those
          gods themselves. Isa. 41:23, 24, “Show the things that are to come
          hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods; yea, do good, or do
          evil, that we may be dismayed and behold it together. Behold, ye are
          of nothing, and your work of nought; an abomination is he that
          chooseth you.” — These false gods, instead of helping those who pray
          to them, cannot help themselves. The devils are miserable tormented
          spirits. They are bound in chains of darkness for their rebellion
          against the true God and cannot deliver themselves. Nor have they any
          more disposition to help mankind than a parcel of hungry wolves or
          lions would have to protect and help a flock of lambs. And those that
          worship and pray to them get not their goodwill by serving them. All
          the reward that Satan will give them for the service which they do
          him, is to devour them. — I proceed now.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. To give the reasons of the doctrine, which I would do in answer to
          these two inquires. First, why God requires prayer in order to the
          bestowment of mercies, and secondly, why God is so ready to hear
          prayers of men?
        </p>

          INQ. I. Why does God require prayer in order to the bestowment of
          mercies?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not in order that God may be informed of our wants or desires.
          He is omniscient, and with respect to his knowledge, unchangeable. God
          never gains any knowledge by information. He knows what we want a
          thousand times more perfectly than we do ourselves, before we ask him.
          For though, speaking after the manner of men, God is sometimes
          represented as if he were moved and persuaded by the prayers of his
          people. Yet it is not to be thought that God is properly moved or made
          willing by our prayers. For it is no more possible that there should
          be any new inclination or will in God than new knowledge. The mercy of
          God is not moved or drawn by anything in the creature. But the spring
          of God’s beneficence is within himself only. He is self-moved, and
          whatsoever mercy he bestows, the reason and ground of it is not to be
          sought for in the creature, but in God’s own good pleasure. It is the
          will of God to bestow mercy in this way, viz. in answer to prayer,
          when he designs beforehand to bestow mercy, yea, when he has promised
          it, as Eze. 36:35, 37, “I the Lord have spoken it, and will do it.
          Thus saith the Lord, I will yet for this be inquired of by the house
          of Israel, to do it for them.” God has been pleased to constitute
          prayer, to be antecedent to the bestowment of mercy. And he is pleased
          to bestow mercy in consequence of prayer, as though he were prevailed
          on by prayer. — When the people of God are stirred up to prayer, it is
          the effect of his intention to show mercy. Therefore, he pours out the
          spirit of grace and supplication.
        </p>
        <p>
          There may be two reasons given why God requires prayer in order to the
          bestowment of mercy: one especially respects God, and the other
          respects ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, with respect to God, prayer is but a sensible acknowledgment of
          our dependence on him to his glory. As he has made all things for his
          own glory, so he will be glorified and acknowledged by his creatures.
          And it is fit that he should require this of those who would be the
          subjects of his mercy, that we, when we desire to receive any mercy
          from him, should humbly supplicate the Divine Being. For the
          bestowment of that mercy, is but a suitable acknowledgment of our
          dependence on the power and mercy of God for that which we need, and
          but a suitable honor paid to the great Author and Fountain of all
          good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, with respect to ourselves, God requires prayer of us in order
          to the bestowment of mercy, because it tends to prepare us for its
          reception. Fervent prayer many ways tends to prepare the heart. Hereby
          is excited a sense of our need, and of the value of the mercy which we
          seek, and at the same times earnest desires for it, whereby the mind
          is more prepared to prize it, to rejoice in it when bestowed, and to
          be thankful for it. Prayer, with suitable confession, may excite a
          sense of our unworthiness of the mercy we seek. And the placing of
          ourselves in the immediate presence of God, may make us sensible of
          his majesty, and in a sense fit to receive mercy of him. Our prayer to
          God may excite in us a suitable sense and consideration of our
          dependence on God for the mercy we ask, and a suitable exercise of
          faith in God’s sufficiency, that so we may be prepared to glorify his
          name when the mercy is received.
        </p>
        <p>
          INQ. II. Why is God so ready to hear the prayers of men? — To this I
          answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, because he is a God of infinite grace and mercy. It is indeed a
          very wonderful thing, that so great a God should be so ready to hear
          our prayers, though we are so despicable and unworthy. That he should
          give free access at all times to everyone, should allow us to be
          importunate without esteeming it an indecent boldness, [and] should be
          so rich in mercy to them that call upon him: that worms of the dust
          should have such power with God by prayer, that he should do such
          great things in answer to their prayers, and should show himself, as
          it were, overcome by them. This is very wonderful, when we consider
          the distance between God and us, and how we have provoked him by our
          sins, and how unworthy we are of the least gracious notice. It cannot
          be from any need that God stands in of us, for our goodness extends
          not to him. Neither can it be from anything in us to incline the heart
          of God to us. It cannot be from any worthiness in our prayers, which
          are in themselves polluted things. But it is because God delights in
          mercy and condescension. He is herein infinitely distinguished from
          all other Gods. He is the great fountain of all good, from whom
          goodness flows as light from the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, we have a glorious Mediator, who has prepared the way, that
          our prayers may he heard consistently with the honor of God’s justice
          and majesty. Not only has God in himself mercy sufficient for this,
          but the Mediator has provided that this mercy may be exercised
          consistently with the divine honor. Through him we may come to God for
          mercy. He is the way, the truth, and the life. No man can come to the
          Father but by him. This Mediator hath done three things to make way
          for the hearing of our prayers.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He hath by his blood made atonement for sin, so that our guilt need
          not stand in the way, as a separating wall between God and us, and
          that our sins might not be a cloud through which our prayers cannot
          pass. By his atonement he hath made the way to the throne of grace
          open. God would have been infinitely gracious if there had been no
          Mediator, but the way to the mercy-seat would have been blocked up.
          But Christ hath removed whatever stood in the way. The veil which was
          before the mercy-seat “is rent from the top to the bottom” by the
          death of Christ. If it had not been for this, our guilt would have
          remained as a wall of brass to hinder our approach. But all is removed
          by his blood, Heb. 10:17, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Christ, by his obedience, has purchased this privilege, viz. that
          the prayers of those who believe in him should be heard. He has not
          only removed the obstacles to our prayers, but has merited a hearing
          of them. His merits are the incense that is offered with the prayers
          of the saints, which renders them a sweet savor to God, and acceptable
          in his sight. Hence the prayers of the saints have such power with
          God. Hence at the prayer of a poor worm of the dust, God stopped the
          sun in his course for about the space of a whole day. Hence Jacob as a
          prince had power with God, and prevailed. Our prayers would be of no
          account, and of no avail with God, were it not for the merits of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Christ enforces the prayers of his people, by his intercession at
          the right hand of God in heaven. He hath entered for us into the holy
          of holies, with the incense which he hath provided, and there he makes
          continual intercession for all that come to God in his name, so that
          their prayers come to God the Father through his hands, if I may so
          say, which is represented in Rev. 8:3, 4, “And another angel came and
          stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto
          him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the
          saints upon the golden altar, which is before the throne. And the
          smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints,
          ascended up before God, out of the angel’s hand.” — This was typified
          of old by the priest’s offering incense in the temple, at the time
          when the people were offering up their prayers to God, as Luke 1:10,
          “And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the
          time of incense.”
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          Hence we may learn how highly we are privileged, in that we have the
          Most High revealed to us, who is a God that heareth prayer. The
          greater part of mankind are destitute of this privilege. Whatever
          their necessities are, whatever their calamities or sorrows, they have
          no prayer-hearing God to whom they may go. If they go to the gods whom
          they worship, and cry to them ever so earnestly, it will be in vain.
          They worship either lifeless things that can neither help them nor
          know that they need help, or wicked cruel spirits, who are their
          enemies, and wish nothing but their misery, and who, instead of
          helping them, are from day to day working their ruin and watching over
          them as a hungry lion watches over his prey.
        </p>
        <p>
          How are we distinguished from them, in that we have the true God made
          known to us: a God of infinite grace and mercy, a God full of
          compassion to the miserable, who is ready to pity us under all our
          troubles and sorrows, to hear our cries, and to give us all the relief
          which we need, a God who delights in mercy and is rich unto all that
          call upon him! How highly privileged are we, in that we have the holy
          Word of this same God, to direct us how to seek for mercy! And
          whatever difficulties or distress we are in, we may go to him with
          confidence and great encouragement. What a comfort may this be to us!
          And what reason have we to rejoice in our privileges, to prize them so
          highly, and to bless God that he hath been so merciful to us, as to
          give us his Word, and reveal himself to us; and that he hath not left
          us to cry for help to stocks and stones, and devils, as he has left
          many thousands of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECTION. I have often prayed to God for certain mercies, and he has
          not heard my prayers. — To this I answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. It is no argument, that God is not a prayer-hearing God, if he give
          not to men what they ask of him to consume upon their lusts.
          Oftentimes when men pray for temporal good things, they desire them
          for no good end, but only to gratify their pride or sensuality. If
          they pray for worldly good things chiefly from a worldly spirit and
          make an idol of the world, it is no wonder that God doth not hear
          their prayers. Jam. 4:3, “Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask
          amiss, to consume it upon your lusts.” If you request him to give you
          something of which you will make an idol, and set up in opposition to
          him — or will use as weapons of warfare against him, or as instruments
          to serve his enemies — no wonder that God will not hear you. If God
          should hear such prayers, he would act as his own enemy, inasmuch as
          he would bestow them to serve his enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. It is no argument that God is not a prayer-hearing God, that he
          heareth not insincere and unbelieving prayers. How can we expect that
          he should have any respect to that which has no sincerity in it? God
          looketh not at words, but at the heart; and it is fit that he should
          do so. If men pray only in words, and not in heart, what are their
          prayers good for? And why should that God who searches the heart, and
          tries the reins, have any respect of them? — Sometimes men do nothing
          but dissemble in their prayers. And when they do so, it is no argument
          that God is the less a prayer-hearing God, that he doth not hear such
          prayers, for it is no argument of want of mercy. Sometimes they pray
          for that in words which they really desire not in their hearts, as
          that he would purge them from sin, when at the same time they show by
          their practice, that they do not desire to be purged from sin, while
          they love and choose it and are utterly averse to parting with it. In
          like manner, they often dissemble in the pretense and show, which they
          make in their prayers, of dependence on God for mercies, and of a
          sense of his sufficiency to supply them. In our coming to God, and
          praying to him for such and such things, there is a show that we are
          sensible we are dependent on him for them, and that he is sufficient
          to give them to us. But men sometimes seem to pray, while not sensible
          of their dependence on God, nor do they think him sufficient to supply
          them. For all the while they trust in themselves, and have no
          confidence in God. — They show in words as though they were beggars,
          but in heart they come as creditors, and look on God as their debtor.
          In words they seem to ask for things as the fruit of free grace. But
          in heart they account it would be hard, unjust, and cruel, if God
          should deny them. In words they seem humble and submissive, but in
          heart they are proud and contentious. There is no prayer but in their
          words.
        </p>
        <p>
          It doth not render God at all the less a prayer-hearing God, that he
          distinguishes, as an all-seeing God, between real prayers and pretend
          ones. Such prayers as those which I have just now been mentioning, are
          not worthy of the name in the eyes of him who searches the heart and
          sees things as they are. — That prayer which is not of faith is
          insincere, for prayer is a show or manifestation of dependence on God
          and trust in his sufficiency and mercy. Therefore, where this trust or
          faith is wanting, there is no prayer in the sight of God. And however
          God is sometimes pleased to grant the requests of those who have no
          faith, yet he has not obliged himself so to do. Nor is it an argument
          of his not being a prayer-hearing God, when he hears them not.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. It is no argument that he is not a prayer-hearing God, that he
          exercises his own wisdom as to the time and manner of answering
          prayer. Some of God’s people are sometimes ready to think that he does
          not hear their prayers, because he does [not] answer them at times
          when they expected, when indeed God hears them, and will answer them,
          in the time and way to which his own wisdom directs. — The business of
          prayer is not to direct God, who is infinitely wise and needs not any
          of our direction, who knows what is best for us ten thousand times
          better that we, and knows what time and what way are best. It is fit
          that he should answer prayer, and as an infinitely wise God in the
          exercise of his own wisdom, and not ours. God will deal as a father
          with us, in answering our requests. But a child is not to expect that
          the father’s wisdom be subject to his, nor ought he to desire it, but
          should esteem it a privilege, that the parent will provide for him
          according to his own wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to particular temporal blessings for which we pray, it is no
          argument that he is not a prayer-hearing God, because he bestows them
          not upon us. For it may be that God sees the things for which we pray
          not to be best for us. If so, it would be no mercy in him to bestow
          them upon us, but a judgment. Such things, therefore, ought always to
          be asked with submission to the divine will. God can answer prayer,
          though he bestow not the very thing for which we pray. He can
          sometimes better answer the lawful desires and good end we have in
          prayer another way. If our end be our own good and happiness, God can
          perhaps better answer that end in bestowing something else than in the
          bestowment of that very thing which we ask And if the main good we aim
          at in our prayer be attained, our prayer is answered, though not in
          the bestowment of the individual thing which we sought. And so that
          may still be true which was before asserted, that God always hears the
          prayer OF FAITH. God never once failed of hearing a sincere and
          believing prayer; and those promises forever hold good, “Ask, and ye
          shall receive; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened
          to you: for every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh,
          findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Another use of this doctrine may be of reproof to those that neglect
          the duty of prayer. If we enjoy so great a privilege as to have the
          prayer-hearing God revealed to us, how great will be our folly and
          inexcusableness if we neglect the privilege, or make no use of it, and
          deprive ourselves of the advantage by not seeking this God by prayer.
          They are hereby reproved who neglect the great duty of secret prayer,
          which is more expressly required in the Word of God than any other
          kind. What account can those persons give of themselves, who neglect
          so known a duty? It is impossible that any among us should be ignorant
          of this command of God. How daring, therefore, is their wickedness who
          live in the neglect of this duty! And what can they answer to their
          Judge, when he shall call them to an account for it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I shall briefly say something to an EXCUSE which some may be
          ready to make for themselves. Some may be ready to say If I do pray,
          my prayer will not be the prayer of faith, because I am in a natural
          condition, and have no faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          This excuses not from obedience to a plain command of God. The command
          is to all to whom the command shall come. God not only directs godly
          persons to pray, but others also. In the beginning of the second
          chapter of Proverbs, God directs all persons to cry after wisdom and
          to lift up their voices for understanding, in order to their obtaining
          the fear and knowledge of God. And in Jam. 1:5, the apostle says, “If
          any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God.” And Peter directed Simon
          Magus to repent and pray to God, if perhaps the thought of his heart
          might be forgiven him, Acts 8:22. Therefore when God says, do thus or
          thus, it is not for us to make excuses, but we must do the thing
          required. Besides,
        </p>
        <p>
          God is pleased sometimes to answer the prayers of unbelievers. Indeed
          he hears not their prayers for their goodness or acceptableness, or
          because of any true respect to him manifested in them, for there is
          none. Nor has he obliged himself to answer such prayers. Yet he is
          pleased sometimes, of his sovereign mercy, to pity wicked men, and
          hear their cries. Thus he heard the cries of the Ninevites (Jonah 3)
          and the prayer of Ahab, 1 Kin. 21:27, 28. Though there be no regard to
          God in their prayers yet he, of his infinite grace, is pleased to have
          respect to their desires of their own happiness, and to grant their
          requests. He may, and sometimes does, hear the cries of wicked men, as
          he hears the hungry ravens when they cry, Psa. 147:9. And as he opens
          his bountiful hand and satisfies the desires of every living thing,
          Psa. 145:16. Besides the prayers of sinners, though they have no
          goodness in them, yet are made a means of a preparation for mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, seeing we have such a prayer-hearing God as we have heard,
          let us be much employed in the duty of prayer. Let us pray with all
          prayer and supplication. Let us live prayerful lives, continuing
          instant in prayer, watching thereunto with all perseverance. Praying
          always, without ceasing, earnestly, and not fainting.
