          Hebrews 11:13, 14, “And confessed that they were strangers and
          pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things, declare plainly
          that they seek a country.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THE apostle is here setting forth the excellencies of the grace of
          faith, by the glorious effects and happy issue of it in the saints of
          the Old Testament. He had spoken in the preceding part of the chapter
          particularly, of Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Sarah, Isaac, and
          Jacob. Having enumerated those instances, he takes notice that “these
          all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen
          them afar off, were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and
          confessed that they were strangers,” etc. — In these words the apostle
          seems to have a more particular respect to Abraham and Sarah, and
          their kindred, who came with them from Haran, and from Ur of the
          Chaldees, as appears by the 15th verse, where the apostle says, “and
          truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came
          out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.”
        </p>
        <p>Two things may be observed here:</p>
        <p>
          1. What these saints confessed of themselves, viz. that they were
          strangers and pilgrims on the earth. — Thus we have a particular
          account concerning Abraham, “I am a stranger and a sojourner with
          you.” (Gen. 23:4) And it seems to have been the general sense of the
          patriarchs, by what Jacob says to Pharaoh. “And Jacob said to Pharaoh,
          The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty
          years; few and evil have the days of years of my life been, and have
          not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the
          days of their pilgrimage.” (Gen. 47:9) “I am a stranger and a
          sojourner with thee, as all my fathers were.” (Psa. 39:12)
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The inference that the apostle draws from hence, viz. that they
          sought another country as their home. “For they that say such things,
          declare plainly that they seek a country.” In confessing that they
          were strangers, they plainly declared that this is not their country;
          that this is not the place where they are at home. And in confessing
          themselves to be pilgrims, they declared plainly that this is not
          their settled abode, but that they have respect to some other country,
          which they seek, and to which they are traveling.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>
          That this life ought to be so spent by us, as to be only a journey or
          pilgrimage towards heaven.
        </p>
        <p>HERE I would observe,</p>
        <p>
          1. That we ought not to rest in the world and its enjoyments, but
          should desire heaven. We should “seek first the kingdom of God.” (Mat.
          6:33) We ought above all things to desire a heavenly happiness; to be
          with God and dwell with Jesus Christ. Though surrounded with outward
          enjoyments, and settled in families with desirable friends and
          relations; though we have companions whose society is delightful, and
          children in whom we see many promising qualifications; though we live
          by good neighbors, and are generally beloved where known; we ought not
          to take our rest in these things as our portion. We should be so far
          from resting in them, that we should desire to leave them all, in
          God’s due time. We ought to possess, enjoy and use them, with no other
          view but readily to quit them, whenever we are called to it, and to
          change them willingly and cheerfully for heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          A traveler is not wont to rest in what he meets with, however
          comfortable and pleasing, on the road. If he passes through pleasant
          places, flowery meadows, or shady groves, he does not take up his
          content in these things, but only takes a transient view of them as he
          goes along. He is not enticed by fine appearances to put off the
          thought of proceeding. No, but his journey’s end is in his mind. If he
          meets with comfortable accommodations at an inn, he entertains no
          thoughts of settling there. He considers that these things are not his
          own, that he is but a stranger, and when he has refreshed himself, or
          tarried for a night, he is for going forward. And it is pleasant to
          him to think that so much of the way is gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          So should we desire heaven more than the comforts and enjoyments of
          this life. The apostle mentions it as an encouraging, comfortable
          consideration to Christians, that they draw nearer their happiness.
          “Now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.” — Our hearts
          ought to be loose to these things, as that of a man on a journey, that
          we may as cheerfully part with them whenever God calls. “But this I
          say, brethren, the time is short, it remaineth, that both they that
          have wives be as though they had none; and they that weep, as though
          they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and
          they that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use this
          world, as not abusing it; for the fashion of this world passeth away.”
          (1 Cor. 7:29-31) These things are only lent to us for a little while,
          to serve a present turn, but we should set our hearts on heaven, as
          our inheritance forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We ought to seek heaven, by traveling in the way that lead thither.
          This is a way of holiness. We should choose and desire to travel
          thither in this way and in no other, and part with all those carnal
          appetites which, as weights, will tend to hinder us. “Let us lay aside
          every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us
          run with patience the race set before us.” (Heb 12:1) However pleasant
          the gratification of any appetite may be, we must lay it aside if it
          be a hindrance, or a stumbling block, in the way to heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should travel on in the way of obedience to all God’s commands,
          even the difficult as well as the easy, denying all our sinful
          inclinations and interests. The way to heaven is ascending. We must be
          content to travel up hill, though it be hard and tiresome, and
          contrary to the natural bias of our flesh. We should follow Christ:
          the path he traveled, was the right way to heaven. We should take up
          our cross and follow him, in meekness and lowliness of heart,
          obedience and charity, diligence to do good, and patience under
          afflictions. The way to heaven is a heavenly life, an imitation of
          those who are in heaven in their holy enjoyments, loving, adoring,
          serving, and praising God and the Lamb. Even if we could go to heaven
          with the gratification of our lusts, we should prefer a way of
          holiness and conformity to the spiritual self-denying rules of the
          gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We should travel on in this way in a laborious manner. — Long
          journeys are attended with toil and fatigue, especially if through a
          wilderness. Persons in such a case expect no other than to suffer
          hardships and weariness. — So we should travel in this way of
          holiness, improving our time and strength, to surmount the
          difficulties and obstacles that are in the way. The land we have to
          travel through, is a wilderness. There are many mountains, rocks, and
          rough places that we must go over, and therefore there is a necessity
          that we should lay out our strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Our whole lives ought to be spent in traveling this road. — We
          ought to begin early. This should be the first concern, when persons
          become capable of acting. When they first set out in the world, they
          should set out on this journey. — And we ought to travel on with
          assiduity. It ought to be the work of every day. We should often think
          of our journey’s end; and make it our daily work to travel on in the
          way that leads to it. — He who is on a journey is often thinking of
          the destined place, and it is his daily care and business to get along
          and to improve his time to get towards his journey’s end. Thus should
          heaven be continually in our thoughts, and the immediate entrance or
          passage to it, viz. death, should be present with us. — We ought to
          persevere in this way as long as we live.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Let us run with patience the race that is set before us.” (Heb. 12:1)
          Though the road be difficult and toilsome, we must hold out with
          patience, and be content to endure hardships. Though the journey be
          long, yet we must not stop short, but hold on till we arrive at the
          place we seek. Nor should we be discouraged with the length and
          difficulties of the way, as the children of Israel were, and be for
          turning back again. All our thought and design should be to press
          forward till we arrive.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. We ought to be continually growing in holiness, and in that respect
          coming nearer and nearer to heaven. — We should be endeavoring to come
          nearer to heaven, in being more heavenly, becoming more and more like
          the inhabitants of heaven in respect of holiness and conformity to
          God, the knowledge of God and Christ, in clear views of the glory of
          God, the beauty of Christ, and the excellency of divine things, as we
          come nearer to the beatific vision. — We should labor to be
          continually growing in divine love — that this may be an increasing
          flame in our hearts, till they ascend wholly in this flame — in
          obedience and a heavenly conversation, that we may do the will of God
          on earth as the angels do in heaven, in comfort and spiritual joy,
          [and] in sensible communion with God and Jesus Christ. Our path should
          be as “the shining light, that shines more and more to the perfect
          day.” (Pro. 4:18) We ought to be hungering and thirsting after
          righteousness: after an increase in righteousness. “As new-born babes,
          desire the sincere milk of the work, that ye may grow thereby.” (1
          Pet. 2:2) The perfection of heaven should be our mark. “This one thing
          I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth
          unto those things that are before, I press toward the mark, for the
          prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 3:13, 14)
        </p>
        <p>
          6. All other concerns of life ought to be entirely subordinate to
          this. — When a man is on a journey, all the steps he takes are
          subordinated to the aim of getting to his journey’s end. And if he
          carries money or provisions with him, it is to supply him in his
          journey. So we ought wholly to subordinate all our other business, and
          all our temporal enjoyments, to this affair of traveling to heaven.
          When anything we have becomes a clog and hindrance to us, we should
          quit it immediately. The use of our worldly enjoyments and
          possessions, should be with such a view, and in such a manner, as to
          further us in our way heavenward. Thus we should eat, and drink, and
          clothe ourselves, and improve the conversation and enjoyment of
          friends. And whatever business we are setting about, whatever design
          we are engaging in, we should inquire with ourselves, whether this
          business or undertaking will forward us in our way to heaven? And if
          not, we should quit our design.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>Why the Christian’s life is a journey, or pilgrimage?</p>
        <p>
          1. THIS world is not our abiding place. Our continuance here is but
          very short. Man’s days on the earth, are as a shadow. It was never
          designed by God that this world should be our home. Neither did God
          give us these temporal accommodations for that end. If God has given
          us ample estates, and children, or other pleasant friends, it is with
          no such design, that we should be furnished here, as for a settled
          abode, but with a design that we should use them for the present, and
          then leave them in a very little time. When we are called to any
          secular business, or charged with the care of a family, [and] if we
          improve our lives to any other purpose than as a journey toward
          heaven, all our labor will be lost. If we spend our lives in the
          pursuit of a temporal happiness, as riches or sensual pleasures,
          credit and esteem from men, delight in our children and the prospect
          of seeing them well brought up and well settled, etc. — all these
          things will be of little significancy to us. Death will blow up all
          our hopes, and will put an end to these enjoyments. “The places that
          have known us, will know us no more” and “the eye that has seen us,
          shall see us no more.” We must be taken away forever from all these
          things, and it is uncertain when: it may be soon after we are put into
          the possession of them. And then, where will be all our worldly
          employments and enjoyments, when we are laid in the silent grave! “So
          man lieth down, and riseth not again, till the heavens be no more.”
          (Job 14:12)
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The future world was designed to be our settled and everlasting
          abode. There it was intended that we should be fixed, and there alone
          is a lasting habitation and a lasting inheritance. The present state
          is short and transitory, but our state in the other world is
          everlasting. And as we are there at first, so we must be without
          change. Our state in the future world, therefore, being eternal, is of
          so much greater importance than our state here, that all our concerns
          in this world should be wholly subordinated to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Heaven is that place alone where our highest end and highest good
          is to be obtained. God hath made us for himself. “Of him, and through
          him, and to him are all things.” Therefore, then do we attain to our
          highest end, when we are brought to God: but that is by being brought
          to heaven, for that is God’s throne, the place of his special
          presence. There is but a very imperfect union with God to be had in
          this world, a very imperfect knowledge of him in the midst of much
          darkness: a very imperfect conformity to God, mingled with abundance
          of estrangement. Here we can serve and glorify God, but in a very
          imperfect manner: our service being mingled with sin, which dishonors
          God. — But when we get to heaven (if ever that be), we shall be
          brought to a perfect union with God and have more clear views of him.
          There we shall be fully conformed to God, without any remaining sin:
          for “we shall see him as he is.” There we shall serve God perfectly
          and glorify him in an exalted manner, even to the utmost of the powers
          and capacity of our nature. Then we shall perfectly give up ourselves
          to God: our hearts will be pure and holy offerings, presented in a
          flame of divine love.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is the highest good of the reasonable creature, and the enjoyment
          of him is the only happiness with which our souls can be satisfied. —
          To go to heaven fully to enjoy God, is infinitely better than the most
          pleasant accommodations here. Fathers and mothers, husbands, wives,
          children, or the company of earthly friends, are but shadows. But the
          enjoyment of God is the substance. These are but scattered beams, but
          God is the sun. These are but streams, but God is the fountain. These
          are but drops, but God is the ocean. — Therefore it becomes us to
          spend this life only as a journey towards heaven, as it becomes us to
          make the seeking of our highest end and proper good, the whole work of
          our lives, to which we should subordinate all other concerns of life.
          Why should we labor for, or set our hearts on anything else, but that
          which is our proper end, and true happiness?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Our present state, and all that belongs to it, is designed by him
          that made all things, to be wholly in order to another world. — This
          world was made for a place of preparation for another. Man’s mortal
          life was given him, that he might be prepared for his fixed state. And
          all that God has here given us, is given to this purpose. The sun
          shines, the rain falls upon us, and the earth yields her increase to
          us for this end. Civil, ecclesiastical, and family affairs, and all
          our personal concerns, are designed and ordered in subordination to a
          future world, by the maker and disposer of all things. To this
          therefore they ought to be subordinated by us.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>
          Instruction afforded by the consideration, that life is a journey or
          pilgrimage, towards heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THIS doctrine may teach us moderation in our mourning for the loss
          of such dear friends, who while they lived, improved their lives to
          right purposes. If they lived a holy life, then their lives were a
          journey towards heaven. And why should we be immoderate in mourning,
          when they are got to their journey’s end? Death, though it appears to
          us with a frightful aspect, is to them a great blessing. Their end is
          happy, and better than their beginning. “The day of their death, is
          better than the day of their birth.” (Ecc. 7:1) While they lived, they
          desired heaven, and chose it above this world or any of its
          enjoyments. For this they earnestly longed, and why should we grieve
          that they have obtained it? — Now they have got to their Father’s
          house. They find more comfort a thousand times now [that] they are
          gone home, than they did in their journey. In this world they
          underwent much labor and toil: it was a wilderness they passed
          through. There were many difficulties in the way: mountains and rough
          places. It was laborious and fatiguing to travel the road, and they
          had many wearisome days and nights: but now they have got to their
          everlasting rest. “And I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me,
          Write, blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth:
          yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their
          works do follow them.” (Rev. 14:13) They look back upon the
          difficulties, and sorrows, and dangers of life, rejoicing that they
          have surmounted them all.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are ready to look upon death as their calamity, and to mourn that
          those who were so dear to us should be in the dark grave: that they
          are there transformed to corruption and worms, taken away from their
          dear children and enjoyments, etc. as though they were in awful
          circumstances. But this is owing to our infirmity. They are in a happy
          condition, inconceivably blessed. They do not mourn, but rejoice with
          exceeding joy: their mouths are filled with joyful songs, and they
          drink at rivers of pleasure. They find no mixture of grief that they
          have changed their earthly enjoyments, and the company of mortals, for
          heaven. Their life here, though in the best circumstances, was
          attended with much that was adverse and afflictive, but now there is
          an end to all adversity. “They shall hunger no more nor thirst any
          more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb
          which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them and shall lead
          them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all
          tears from their eyes.” (Rev. 7:16, 17)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true, we shall see them no more in this world, yet we ought to
          consider that we are traveling towards the same place; and why should
          we break our hearts that they have got there before us? We are
          following after them, and hope as soon as we get to our journey’s end,
          to be with them again, in better circumstances. A degree of mourning
          for near relations when departed is not inconsistent with
          Christianity, but very agreeable to it. For as long as we are flesh
          and blood, we have animal propensities and affections. But we have
          just reason that our mourning should be mingled with joy. “But I would
          not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are
          asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others that have no hope:” (1
          Thes. 4:13) i.e. that they should not sorrow as the heathen, who had
          no knowledge of a future happiness. This appears by the following
          verse; “for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
          also which sleep in Jesus, will God bring with him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If our lives ought to be only a journey towards heaven, how ill do
          they improve their lives, that spend them in traveling towards hell? —
          Some men spend their whole lives, from their infancy to their dying
          day, in going down the broad way to destruction. They not only draw
          nearer to hell as to time, but they every day grow more ripe for
          destruction. They are more assimilated to the inhabitants of the
          internal world. While others press forward in the straight and narrow
          way to life and laboriously travel up the hill toward Zion, against
          the inclinations and tendency of the flesh, these run with a swift
          career down to eternal death. This is the employment of every day,
          with all wicked men, and the whole day is spent in it. As soon as ever
          they awake in the morning, they set out anew in the way to hell and
          spend every waking moment in it. They begin in early days. “The wicked
          are estranged from the womb, they go astray as soon as they are born,
          speaking lies.” (Psa. 58:3) They hold on it with perseverance. Many of
          them who live to be old, are never weary in it. Though they live to be
          an hundred years old, they will not cease traveling in the way to hell
          till they arrive there. And all the concerns of life are subordinated
          to this employment. A wicked man is a servant of sin, [and] his powers
          and faculties are employed in the service of sin and in fitness for
          hell. And all his possessions are so used by him as to be subservient
          to the same purpose. Men spend their time in treasuring up wrath
          against the day of wrath Thus do all unclean persons, who live in
          lascivious practices in secret: all malicious persons, all profane
          persons that neglect the duties of religion. Thus do all unjust
          persons, and those who are fraudulent and oppressive in their
          dealings. Thus do all backbiters and revilers, [and] all covetous
          persons that set their hearts chiefly on the riches of this world.
          Thus do tavern-haunters, and frequenters of evil company, and many
          other kinds that might be mentioned. Thus the bulk of mankind are
          hastening onward in the broad way to destruction, which is, as it
          were, filled up with the multitude that are going in it with one
          accord. And they are every day going to hell out of this broad way by
          thousands. Multitudes are continually flowing down into the great lake
          of fire and brimstone, as some mighty river constantly disembogues its
          water into the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Hence when persons are converted they do but begin their work and
          set out in the way they have to go. — They never till then do anything
          at that work in which their whole lives ought to be spent. Persons
          before conversion never take a step that way. Then does a man first
          set out on his journey, when he is brought home to Christ, and so far
          is he from having done his work, that his care and labor in his
          Christian work and business, is then but begun, in which he must spend
          the remaining part of his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those persons do ill, who when they are converted and have obtained a
          hope of their being in a good condition, do not strive as earnestly as
          they did before, while they were under awakenings. They ought,
          henceforward, as long as they live, to be as earnest and laborious, as
          watchful and careful as ever: yea, they should increase more and more.
          It is no just excuse that now they have obtained conversion. Should
          not we be as diligent as that we ourselves may be that we may serve
          and glorify God, happy? And if we have obtained grace, yet we ought to
          strive as much that we may obtain the other degrees that are before,
          as we did to obtain that small degree that is behind. The apostle
          tells us that he forgot what was behind and reached forth towards what
          was before. (Phil. 3:13)
        </p>
        <p>
          Yea, those who are converted have now a further reason to strive for
          grace. For they have seen something of its excellency. A man who has
          once tasted the blessings of Canaan, has more reason to press towards
          it than he had before. And they who are converted, should strive to
          “make their calling and election sure.” All those who are converted
          are not sure of it, and those who are sure, do not know that they
          shall be always so, and still, seeking and serving God with the utmost
          diligence, is the way to have assurance and to have it maintained.

        <p>SECTION IV</p>
        <p>
          An exhortation so to spend the present life, that it may only be a
          journey towards heaven
        </p>
        <p>
          Labor to obtain such a disposition of mind that you may choose heaven
          for your inheritance and home, and may earnestly long for it and be
          willing to change this world, and all its enjoyments, for heaven.
          Labor to have your heart taken up so much about heaven, and heavenly
          enjoyments, as that you may rejoice when God calls you to leave your
          best earthly friends and comforts for heaven, there to enjoy God and
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be persuaded to travel in the way that leads to heaven: viz. in
          holiness, self-denial, mortification, obedience to all the commands of
          God, following Christ’s example [and] in a way of a heavenly life, or
          imitation of the saints and angels in heaven. Let it be your daily
          work, from morning till night, and hold out in it to the end. Let
          nothing stop or discourage you, or turn you aside from this road. And
          let all other concerns be subordinated to this. Consider the reasons
          that have been mentioned why you should thus spend your life: that
          this world is not your abiding place, that the future world is to be
          your everlasting abode, and that the enjoyments and concerns of this
          world are given entirely in order to another. And consider further for
          motive.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How worthy is heaven that your life should be wholly spent as a
          journey towards it. — To what better purpose can you spend your life,
          whether you respect your duty or your interest? What better end can
          you propose to your journey, than to obtain heaven? You are placed in
          this world with a choice given you, that you may travel which way you
          please, and one way leads to heaven. Now, can you direct your course
          better than this way? All men have some aim or other in living. Some
          mainly seek worldly things. They spend their days in such pursuits.
          But is not heaven, where is fullness of joy forever, much more worthy
          to be sought by you? How can you better employ your strength, use your
          means, and spend your days, than in traveling the road that leads to
          the everlasting enjoyment of God: to his glorious presence, to the new
          Jerusalem, to the heavenly mount Zion, where all your desires will be
          filled and no danger of ever losing your happiness? — No man is at
          home in this world, whether he choose heaven or not: here he is but a
          transient person. Where can you choose your home better than in
          heaven?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This is the way to have death comfortable to us. — To spend our
          lives so as to be only a journeying towards heaven, is the way to be
          free from bondage and to have the prospect and forethought of death
          comfortable. Does the traveler think of his journey’s end with fear
          and terror? Is terrible to him to think that he has almost got to his
          journey’s end? Were the children of Israel sorry after forty years’
          travel in the wilderness, when they had almost got to Canaan? This is
          the way to be able to part with the world without grief. Does it
          grieve the traveler when he has got home, to quit his staff and load
          of provisions that he had to sustain him by the way?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. No more of your life will be pleasant to think of when you come to
          die, than has been spent after this manner. — If you have spent none
          of your life this way, your whole life will be terrible to you to
          think of, unless you die under some great delusion. You will see then,
          that all of your life that has been spent otherwise, is lost. You will
          then see the vanity of all other aims that you may have proposed to
          yourself. The thought of what you here possessed and enjoyed will not
          be pleasant to you, unless you can think also that you have
          subordinated them to this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Consider that those who are willing thus to spend their lives as a
          journey towards heaven may have heaven. — Heaven, however high and
          glorious, is attainable to such poor worthless creatures as we are. We
          may attain that glorious region which is the habitation of angels:
          yea, the dwelling-place of the Son of God, and where is the glorious
          presence of the great Jehovah. And we may have it freely, without
          money and without price. If we are but willing to travel the road that
          leads to it and bend our course that way as long as we live, we may
          and shall have heaven for our eternal resting place.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Let it be considered that if our lives be not a journey towards
          heaven, they will be a journey to hell. All mankind, after they have
          been here a short while, go to either of the two great receptacles of
          all that depart out of this world: the one in heaven; whither the bulk
          of mankind throng. And one or the other of these must be the issue of
          our course in this world.
        </p>
        <p>I shall conclude by giving a few directions:</p>
        <p>
          1. Labor to get a sense of the vanity of this world, on account of the
          little satisfaction that is to be enjoyed here, its short continuance,
          and unserviceableness when we most stand in need of help, viz. on a
          death-bed. — All men, that live any considerable time in the world,
          might see enough to convince them of its vanity, if they would but
          consider. — Be persuaded therefore to exercise consideration when you
          see and hear, from time to time, of the death of others. Labor to turn
          your thoughts this way. See the vanity of the world in such a glass.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Labor to be much acquainted with heaven. — If you are not
          acquainted with it, you will not be likely to spend your life as a
          journey thither. You will not be sensible of its worth, nor will you
          long for it. Unless you are much conversant in your mind with a better
          good, it will be exceeding difficult to you to have your hearts loose
          from these things, to use them only in subordination to something
          else, and be ready to part with them for the sake of that better good.
          — Labor therefore to obtain a realizing sense of a heavenly world, to
          get a firm belief of its reality, and to be very much conversant with
          it in your thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Seek heaven only by Jesus Christ. — Christ tells us that he is the
          way, and the truth, and the life. (John 14:6) He tells us that he is
          the door of the sheep. “I am the door, by me if any man enter in he
          shall be saved; and go in and out and find pasture.” (John 10:9) If we
          therefore would improve our lives as a journey towards heaven, we must
          seek it by him and not by our own righteousness, as expecting to
          obtain it only for his sake: looking to him [and] having our
          dependence on him, who has procured it for us by his merit. And expect
          [that] strength to walk in holiness, the way that leads to heaven,
          only from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Let Christians help one another in going this journey. — There are
          many ways whereby Christians might greatly forward one another in
          their way to heaven, as by religious conference, etc. Therefore let
          them be exhorted to go this journey as it were in company: conversing
          together, and assisting one another. Company is very desirable in a
          journey, but in none so much as this. — Let them go united and not
          fall out by the way, which would be to hinder one another, but use all
          means they can to help each other up the hill. — This would ensure a
          more successful traveling and a more joyful meeting at their Father’s
          house in glory.
