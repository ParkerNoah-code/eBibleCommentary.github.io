          Psalm 94:8-11, “Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools,
          when will ye be wise? He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he
          that formed the eye, shall he not see? He that chastiseth the heathen,
          shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he
          know? The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.”
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>Introductory observations.</p>
        <p>
          IN these words the following particulars are to be observed. (1.) A
          certain spiritual disease charged on some persons, viz. darkness, and
          blindness of mind, appearing in their ignorance and folly. (2.) The
          great degree of this disease; so as to render the subjects of it
          fools. Ye fools, when will ye be wise? And so as to reduce them to a
          degree of brutishness. Ye brutish among the people. This ignorance and
          folly were to such a degree, as to render men like beasts. (3.) The
          obstinacy of this disease; expressed in that interrogation, When will
          ye be wise? Their blindness and folly were not only very great; but
          deeply rooted and established, resisting all manner of cure. (4.) Of
          what nature this blindness is. It is especially in things pertaining
          to God. They were strangely ignorant of his perfections, like beasts.
          And had foolish notions of him, as though he did not see, nor know,
          and as though he would not execute justice, by chastising and
          punishing wicked men. (5.) The unreasonableness and sottishness of the
          notion they had of God, that he did not hear, did not observe their
          reproaches of him and his people, is shown by observing that he
          planted the ear. It is very unreasonable to suppose that he, who gave
          power of perceiving words to others, should not perceive them himself.
          And the sottishness of their being insensible of God’s all-seeing eye,
          and particularly of his seeing their wicked actions, appears, in that
          God is the being who formed the eye and gave others a power of seeing.
          The sottishness of their apprehension of God, as though he did not
          know what they did, is argued from his being the fountain and original
          of all knowledge. The unreasonableness of their expecting to escape
          God’s just chastisements and judgments for sin is set forth by his
          chastising even the heathen, who did not sin against that light, or
          against so great mercies, as the wicked in Israel did; nor had ever
          made such a profession as they. (6.) We may observe, that this
          dreadful disease is ascribed to mankind in general. The Lord knoweth
          the thoughts of MAN, that they are vanity. The psalmist had been
          setting forth the vanity and unreasonableness of the thoughts of some
          of the children of men. And immediately upon it he observes that this
          vanity and foolishness of thought is common and natural to mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          From these particulars we may fairly deduce the following doctrinal
          observation: THAT THERE IS AN EXTREME AND BRUTISH BLINDNESS IN THINGS
          OF RELIGION, WHICH NATURALLY POSSESSES THE HEARTS OF MANKIND. — This
          doctrine is not to be understood as any reflection on the capacity of
          the human nature. For God has made man with a noble and excellent
          capacity. The blindness I speak of is not merely negative ignorance,
          such as in trees and stones that know nothing. They have no faculties
          of understanding and perception, whereby they should be capable of any
          knowledge. And inferior animals, though they have sensitive
          perception, are not capable of any intellectual views. There is no
          fault to be found with man’s natural faculties. God has given men
          faculties truly noble and excellent, well capable of true wisdom and
          divine knowledge. Nor is the blindness I speak of like the ignorance
          of a new-born infant, which arises from want of necessary opportunity
          to exert these faculties.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blindness that is in the heart of man, which is spoken of in the
          text and doctrine, is neither for want of faculties, nor opportunity
          to know, but from some positive cause. *2* There is a principle in his
          heart, of such a blinding and besotting nature, that it hinders the
          exercises of his faculties about the things of religion, exercises for
          which God has made him well capable, and for which he gives him
          abundant opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to make it appear that such an extreme brutish blindness,
          with respect to the things of religion, does naturally possess the
          hearts of men, I shall show how this is manifest in those things that
          appear in men’s open profession. And how it is manifest in those
          things that are found by inward experience, and are visible in men’s
          practice.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>
          Man’s natural blindness in religion, manifested by those things which
          appear in men’s open profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          I WOULD now show, how it is manifest that there is a sottish and
          brutish blindness in the hearts of men in the things of religion, by
          those things which appear in men’s open profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. It appears in the grossness of that ignorance and those delusions
          which have appeared among mankind. Man has faculties given him whereby
          he is well capable of inferring the being of the Creator from the
          creatures. The invisible things of God are very plainly and clearly to
          be seen by the things that are made. And the perfections of the Divine
          Being, his eternal power and Godhead, are very manifest in the works
          of his hands. And yet grossly absurd notions concerning the Godhead
          have prevailed in the world. Instead of acknowledging and worshipping
          the true God, they have fallen off to the worship of idols. Instead of
          acknowledging the one only true God, they have made a multitude of
          deities. Instead of worshipping a God, who is an almighty, infinite,
          all-wise, and holy Spirit, they have worshipped the hosts of heaven,
          the sun, moon, and stars; and the works of their own hands, images of
          gold and silver, brass and iron, wood and stone; gods that can neither
          hear, nor see, nor walk, nor speak, nor do, nor know anything. Some in
          the shape of men, others in the shape of oxen and calves; some in the
          shape of serpents, others of fishes, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sottishness of men in thus worshipping the lifeless images which
          they themselves have made, is elegantly and forcibly represented by
          the prophet Isaiah. “The smith with the tongs both worketh in the
          coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the
          strength of his arms. Yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth; he
          drinketh no water, and is faint. The carpenter stretcheth out his
          rule; he marketh it out with a line: he fitteth it with planes, and he
          marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a
          man, according to the beauty of a man, that it may remain in the
          house. He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak,
          which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest; he
          planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it. Then shall it be for a
          man to burn; for he will take thereof and warm himself; yea, he
          kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth
          it: he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto. He burneth
          part thereof in the fire: with part thereof he eateth flesh: he
          roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith,
          Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire. And the residue thereof he
          maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and
          worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me, for thou
          art my god. They have not known, nor understood: for he hath shut
          their eyes, that they cannot see, and their hearts, that they cannot
          understand. And none considereth in his heart, neither is there
          knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the
          fire, yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have
          roasted flesh, and eaten it, and shall I make the residue thereof an
          abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?” (Isa.
          44:12-19).
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the images which the heathen worshipped were made in the most
          monstrous and terrible shapes they could devise. And the more hideous
          and frightful they appeared, the better they supposed they would serve
          their turn for gods. Some of their images were made so as to be the
          most unclean representations; images of men openly exposing their
          nakedness. These unclean images, they judged, appeared in a god-like
          manner, and worthy to be worshipped. Many, instead of worshipping a
          holy and good God, and infinitely perfect Being, ascribed vices to
          many of the gods which they worshipped. One god they reckoned
          notorious for drunkenness; others notorious for uncleanness. To others
          they ascribed lying and stealing; to others cruelty; and yet looked
          upon them worthy to be worshipped as gods! Many worshipped devils, who
          appeared to them, and whom they themselves reckoned to be evil
          spirits. But yet built temples, and offered sacrifices to them because
          they were afraid of them. Many worshipped beasts and birds and fishes.
          And the most hateful and loathsome animals were most worshipped.
          Particularly, serpents were more commonly worshipped than any other
          beast. Many worshipped rivers and trees and mountains. They worshipped
          many diseases. There is scarcely anything of which men have not made
          gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so far has that principle of blindness prevailed, with respect to
          the things of religion, that it has in a great measure extinguished
          all light in the minds of many, even in matters of morality, and
          things that have but a distant relation to religion. So that many
          whole nations have professedly approved of many things directly
          contrary to the light of nature. And the most horrid vices and
          immoralities have been esteemed harmless, yea, accounted virtues among
          them, such as revenge, cruelty, and incest. Many nations have openly
          allowed the practice of sodomy. And with some it has been accounted
          commendable to marry their nearest relations. Many have even
          worshipped their gods in their temples with acts of drunkenness and
          whoredom, and the most abominable lewdness. And the more filthy they
          were in their uncleanness, they thought their gods the more pleased
          and delighted with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many nations have been so under the influence of mental blindness that
          they have been void of all civility, and have been reduced to a state
          very little above the beasts in their common customs, and ordinary way
          of living, and in a great many things far below the beasts, being, if
          I may so speak, much more beastly than the beasts themselves. Now this
          has not been, because these men, with whom this has been the case,
          have not had the same faculties that we have. That we are not as
          ignorant as they, is not because we have better natural
          understandings, or that our minds are by nature more clear, and our
          eyes more discerning, or that our hearts are not naturally so inclined
          to sottishness and delusion as theirs. But only because God has not
          left us so much to ourselves, as he has them. He has given us more
          instruction to help us against our delusions. God has so ordered it in
          his providence that we should have his good word to instruct us. And
          has caused that we should grow up from our infancy under Christian
          instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The extreme blindness and sottishness in things of religion, which
          is naturally in the hearts of men, appears not only in embracing and
          professing those errors that are very great, but also those that are
          so unnatural. They have not only embraced errors which are very
          contrary to truth, but very contrary to humanity, not only against the
          light of nature, but against the more innocent inclinations of nature.
          Such has been, and still is, the blindness of many nations in the
          world, that they embrace those errors which do not only exclude all
          true virtue, all holy dispositions, but those that have swallowed up
          the more harmless inclinations of human nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus they have embraced many gross delusions that are as contrary as
          possible to natural affection. Such as offering up their own children
          in sacrifice to their idol, which has been a common thing in the
          heathen world. And the parents have not only offered them up to death,
          but they have brought them, and offered them up to the most cruel and
          tormenting deaths: as, to be burnt alive, to be broiled to death in
          burning brass; which was the way of offering up children to Moloch.
          The image of the idol being made of brass, in a horrid shape, was
          heated red hot. And the poor child was laid naked in this burning
          brass, and so burnt to death. And the parents themselves brought the
          child to this offering, however sweet and pleasant a child it might
          be. And thus the innocent child was tormented till it died, without
          any regard to its piteous cries. And it has been the manner of some
          nations, to offer in sacrifice the fairest and best beloved child that
          they had. And thus many thousands of poor babes have been offered up.
          So strong has been the tendency of the hearts of men to delusion, that
          it has thus overcome those strong natural affections which men have to
          the fruit of their own bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          And many of these delusions have been against men’s natural love of
          their own ease, and aversion to pain. Many have worshipped their
          idols, and do so to this day, with such rites as are most painful and
          tormenting, cutting, gashing, and mangling their own flesh. Thus they
          sottishly worshipped Baal of old. “And they cried aloud, and cut
          themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood
          gushed out upon them.” (1 Kin. 18:28). And it is still the custom in
          some nations grievously to torment themselves, to kindle a fire to
          scorch their own bodies in a most miserable manner, and to put
          themselves to various and long-continued torments to please their
          idols. And it is the manner in some countries for persons, on certain
          occasions, to kill themselves, yea, to put themselves to cruel deaths,
          to cast themselves into great fires, and there burn themselves to
          death. How powerful must be the delusions of the human mind, and how
          strong the tendency of the heart to carry them such a length, and so
          to overcome the tenderest feelings of human nature!
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The extreme blindness of the mind of man will appear further, if
          we consider how general gross ignorance and delusion has been. It has
          for the most part prevailed through the greater part of the world. For
          most of the time from Noah’s flood to the coming of Christ, all
          nations, except the children of Israel, were overspread with gross
          heathenish darkness; being given up to the most vain and ridiculous
          notions, and all manner of superstitious, barbarous, absurd, and
          unnatural practices. And, for the greater part of the time since, most
          nations of the world have been covered with gross darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it is at this day. Many nations are under popish darkness, and are
          in such gross delusions that they worship the Virgin Mary, and a great
          multitude of dead men, whom their church has canonized for saints,
          some real saints, and others abominably wicked men. So they worship
          the bread in the sacrament, and account it not only the real body of
          Christ, but real Christ in body and soul, and divinity. They carry a
          wafer, a small piece of bread, in procession, fall down before it,
          adore it, and account it Christ himself, both in his divine and human
          nature. And yet believe that the body of Christ is in heaven, and in
          ten thousand different places on earth at the same time. They think
          they can do works of supererogation; that is, more good works than
          they are obliged to do, whereby they bring God into debt to them. They
          whip themselves, and put themselves to other ridiculous penances and
          sufferings, whereby they think they appease the anger of God for their
          sins. And they pay money to the priests to buy the pardon of their
          sins. Yea, they buy indulgences for future crimes, or pardon for sins
          before they commit them. They think they defend themselves from evil
          spirits, by sprinkling holy water. They pay money to buy the souls of
          their departed friends out of purgatory. They worship the relics of
          dead saints, such as pieces of their bones, their teeth, their hair,
          pieces of their garments, and the like. And innumerable other such
          foolish delusions are they under.
        </p>
        <p>
          A great part of the nations of the world are Mahometans; many of the
          articles of whose belief are too childish and ridiculous to be
          publicly mentioned in solemn assembly. — But the greater part of the
          inhabitants of the world are to this day gross, barbarous heathens,
          who have not the knowledge of the true God, but worship idols and
          devils, with all manner of absurd and foolish rites and ceremonies,
          and are destitute of even common civility: multitudes of nations being
          like beasts in human shape. — Now this barbarous ignorance and gross
          delusion being of such great extent and continuance, shows that the
          cause is general, and that the defect is in the corrupted nature of
          mankind, man’s natural blindness and proneness of his heart to
          delusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The sottish blindness and folly of the heart of men appears in
          their being so prone to fall into such gross delusions, soon after
          they have been favored with clear light. Were not the minds of men
          exceeding dark, they never would entertain such absurd notions at all.
          For they are as contrary as possible to reason. Much less would they
          fall into them after they had once been instructed in the truth. For,
          were it not very strange and great sottishness indeed, they would —
          when they come to be informed of the truth, and have opportunity to
          compare it with those gross errors — behold such a reasonableness in
          the truth, and such absurdity in those errors, that they would never
          be in danger of being deluded by them any more. But yet so it is.
          Mankind, after they have been fully instructed, and have lived in
          clear light, have, time after time, presently lost the knowledge of
          the truth, and have exchanged it for the most barbarous and brutish
          notions.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it was early after the flood, whereby the wicked world, those that
          were visibly so, were destroyed; and none were left but those who
          professed the true religion. And they had such an eminently holy man
          as Noah to instruct them. And though the true God had so wonderfully
          and astonishingly manifested himself in that great work of vengeance
          against his enemies; yet the posterity of Noah, in great part,
          presently lost the knowledge of the true God, and fell away to
          idolatry, and that even while Noah was living. And the ancestors of
          Abraham were tainted with that idolatry, even Terah his own father.
          “And Joshua said unto all the people, thus saith the Lord God of
          Israel, your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time,
          even Terah the father of Abraham, and father of Nachor: and they
          served other gods. And I took your father Abraham from the other side
          of the flood,” etc. (Jos. 24:2, 3, 4). It seems as though Abraham was
          called away from his father’s house, and from his own country, for
          this reason that the country was overrun with idolatry.
        </p>
        <p>
          And even many of the posterity of Abraham and Isaac — Abraham’s
          posterity by Hagar and Keturah, and that part of Isaac’s posterity
          which were of Esau — though the true religion was so thoroughly taught
          and practiced in the houses of those holy patriarchs, and God had from
          time to time so wonderfully and miraculously manifested himself to
          them, yet — soon cast off the true God, and fell away to idolatry.
          For, not very long after, we read of the posterity of Jacob as being
          the only people of God, that he had in all the earth. — And so the
          people of that part of the land of Canaan, who were under that holy
          king Melchizedeck, soon totally cast off the worship of the one only
          true God, which he taught and maintained. For before Joshua brought in
          the children of Israel, the inhabitants of that land were wholly given
          to idolatry. So the people of the land of Uz, who were under the
          government of so great and holy a man as Job, soon lost the knowledge
          of the true God, and all those religious truths which were then known
          among them, and sunk into gross idolatry.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the posterity of Jacob, themselves — though God had manifested
          himself to them, and had wrought such wonders for them in the time of
          Jacob and Joseph, yet — presently fell to worship the gods of Egypt.
          This appears from the words of Joshua, “Put away the gods which your
          fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt.” (Jos.
          24:14). And how soon did they fall to worship a golden calf in the
          wilderness, in the midst of the wonderful and miraculous
          manifestations of the one only true God! And notwithstanding idolatry
          was so strictly forbidden, and the folly and wickedness of it so
          clearly manifested, in the law of Moses and in God’s providence. Yet,
          how soon did they fall into idolatry after they were brought into the
          land of Canaan! And when God raised up eminent men, judges to instruct
          and govern them, and reclaim them from their idolatrous practices,
          from time to time. Though they professed to be convinced of their
          foolish delusion, yet they would soon fall again into the most sottish
          idolatry. And this they did soon after such great light as they
          enjoyed in the time of Samuel, David, and Solomon. And so, from time
          to time, down to the Babylonish captivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in the apostles’ times, when such great things were done to rouse
          the attention of mankind, and such great light was spread over many
          nations, multitudes, after they had been instructed in the Christian
          religion by the apostles and others, fell away into the grossest
          heresies, and embraced the most corrupt and absurd notions. — After
          the Roman empire had been converted from heathenism to Christianity,
          and the light of the gospel had driven out the sottish ignorance and
          gross absurdities of pagan idolatry, in which they had continued so
          long, they soon began to fall away from the truth into antichristian
          superstition and idolatry, in which are opinions and practices no less
          absurd than those of the heathen. And a great part of the Christian
          world fell away to Mahometanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          And since the reformation, wherein God wonderfully restored gospel
          light in a great part of the Christian world, which was but about two
          hundred years ago, many are fallen away again, some to popery, some to
          gross heresies, and some to atheistical principles. So that the
          reformed church is greatly diminished. — And as to our nation in
          particular, which has been a nation favored with light, since the
          reformation, above most, if not any in the world; how soon has it in
          great part fallen away! A great part of it to atheism, deism, and
          gross infidelity. And others to Arminianism, and to the Socinian and
          Arian heresies, to believe that Christ is a created dependent God. And
          to hold other foolish absurdities! And many have of late openly
          disputed and denied the moral evil of some of the greatest and most
          heinous vices.
        </p>
        <p>
          These things show how desperately prone mankind are to blindness and
          delusion, how addicted they are to darkness. — God now and then, by
          his instructions lifts up some nations out of such gross darkness. But
          then, how do they sink down into it again, as soon as his hand is
          withdrawn! Like a heavy stone, which, though it may be forced upwards,
          yet sinks down again. And will continue to sink lower and lower with a
          swift progress, if there be nothing to restrain it. That is the woeful
          tendency of the mind of man since the fall, notwithstanding his noble
          powers and faculties; even to sink down into a kind of brutality, to
          lose and extinguish all useful light, and to sink lower and lower into
          darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The extreme and brutish blindness that possesses the hearts of men
          naturally, appears in their being so confident in gross errors and
          delusions. Some things mentioned already show how confident and
          assured they are, particularly, their running such great ventures as
          offering up their children and cutting and mangling themselves.
          Multitudes live and die in the most foolish and absurd notions and
          principles, and never seem to make any doubt of their being in the
          right.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mahometans seem to make no doubt but that, when they die, they
          shall go to such a paradise as Mahomet has promised them. Where they
          shall live in all manner of sensual pleasures, and shall spend their
          time in gratifying the lusts of the flesh. Mahomet promised them that
          all who die in war for the defense of the Mahometan religion, shall go
          to this paradise. And they make no doubt of it. Therefore, many of
          them, as it were, willingly rush on upon the point of the sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          The papists, many of them at least, make no doubt of the truth of
          those foolish notions of a purgatory, and the power of the priests to
          deliver them out of it, and give them eternal life. And therefore will
          not spare vast sums of money to purchase deliverance from those
          imaginary torments. How confident are many heretics in the grossest
          heresies! and how bold are many deists in their infidelity!
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The desperateness of that blindness which is in the heart of man,
          appears, in that no nation or people in the world ever have had any
          remedy or deliverance from such gross ignorance and delusion, from
          themselves. No instance can be mentioned of any people whatsoever, who
          have once fallen into heathenish darkness, or any other gross
          superstitions and ridiculous opinions in religion, that ever had any
          remedy by any wisdom of their own. Or that have, of themselves, grown
          wiser by the improvement of their own faculties, and by instructing
          one another. Or that ever had any remedy at all, by the teaching of
          any wise men, who did not professedly act as moved and directed of
          God, and did not declare, that they had their instructions, in the
          first place, from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus in the heathen world. Before Christ’s time, the whole world,
          except the Jews, lay in their darkness for a great many hundred years,
          even beyond all time of which they had any certain history among them.
          And there was no remedy, nor any appearance of a remedy; they
          continued, ages after ages, waxing worse and worse, sinking deeper and
          deeper. Among all the many nations in the world, no one ever bethought
          themselves, and emerged out of their brutish darkness. There were
          indeed some nations that emerged out of slavery, cast off the yoke of
          their enemies, grew great, and conquered great part of the world. But
          they never conquered the blindness of their own hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were some nations who excelled in other knowledge, as the Greeks
          and Romans. They excelled in policy, and in the form of their civil
          government. They had wise political rulers. They had excellent laws
          for regulating their civil state, many of which have been imitated, as
          a pattern, by many Christian nations ever since. They excelled many
          other nations in arts, government, and civility, almost as much as men
          in common do beasts. Yet they never could deliver themselves from
          their heathenism. Though they were so wise in other things, yet in
          matters of religion they were very absurd and brutish. For even the
          Greeks and Romans, in their most flourishing state, worshipped
          innumerable gods. And some to whom they ascribed great vices. And some
          they worshipped with most obscene and horrid rites. To some they
          offered human sacrifices. The Romans had a temple dedicated to the
          furies, which they worshipped. And they had a multitude of childish
          notions and fables about their gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          And though there were raised up some wise men and philosophers among
          the Greeks and Romans, who borrowed some things concerning the true
          God from the Jews; yet their instructions never were effectual to
          deliver any one people, or even one city or town, from their barbarous
          heathenism, or so much as to get any one society, or company of men,
          to unite in the public worship of the true God. And these philosophers
          themselves had many grossly absurd opinions, mingled with those scraps
          of truth which they had gathered up.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the Jews, when fallen away to idolatry, as they often did, never
          recovered of themselves. Never any remedy appeared, unless God raised
          up, and extraordinarily moved, some person to reprove and instruct
          them. — And in this age of knowledge, an age wherein learning is
          carried to a great height, even many learned men seem to be carried
          away with the gross errors and fooleries of the popish religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Europe is a part of the world the most famed for arts and sciences of
          any. And these things have been carried to a much greater height in
          this age than in many others. Yet many learned men in Europe at this
          day, who greatly excel in human arts and literature, are still under
          popish darkness. A deceived heart has turned them aside. Nor do they
          seem to have any power to deliver their souls. Nor does it come into
          their minds that there is a lie in their right hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many men in France and in other countries, who are indeed men of great
          learning, knowledge, and abilities, yet seem really to think that the
          church of Rome is the only true church of Christ. And are zealous to
          uphold and propagate it. And though now, within this hundred years,
          human learning has been very much promoted, and has risen to a greater
          height than ever in the world. And has greatly increased not only in
          our nation, but in France and Italy, and other popish countries. Yet
          there seems to be no such effect of it, as any considerable turning
          from popish delusions. But the church of Rome has rather increased of
          late, than otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in England, a land wherein learning flourishes as much as in any
          in the world, and which is perhaps the most favored with light of any,
          there are many men of vast learning, and great and strong reason, who
          have embraced, and do at this day embrace, the gross errors of the
          Arians and Deists. Our nation, in all its light and learning, if full
          of infidels, and those that are further from Christianity than the
          very Mahometans themselves. Of so little avail is human strength, or
          human reason and learning, as a remedy against the extreme blindness
          of the human mind. The blindness of the mind, or an inclination to
          delusion in things of religion is so strong that is will overcome the
          greatest learning, and the strongest natural reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men, if let alone, will not help one another. Nor will they help
          themselves. The disease always proves without remedy, unless God
          delivers. This was observed of old. “And none considereth in his
          heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have
          burnt part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the
          coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make
          the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of
          a tree? He feeds on ashes: a deceived heart has turned him aside, that
          he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right
          hand? (Isa. 44:19, 20).
        </p>
        <p>
          If God lets men alone, no light arises. But the darkness grows thicker
          and thicker. How is it now, at this very day, among all the nations
          where the light of the gospel has not come? Many of whose ancestors,
          without doubt, have been in the midnight darkness of heathenism for
          above three thousand years. And not one people have delivered
          themselves, who have not had the light of the gospel. And this is not
          owing to their want of as good natural abilities as we have. Nor is it
          because they have an inclination more to neglect their natural
          abilities, or make a worse improvement of them than we.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. The extreme blindness of man’s heart, in matters of religion,
          appears by men falling into gross delusions, or continuing in them, at
          the same time that they have been under great means of instruction
          from God. We have many instances of this; as Rachel in Jacob’s family;
          and the Israelites in the wilderness, etc. These last had great means
          of instruction. Yet they set up the golden calf, etc. And after
          Joshua’s time, they persisted in their delusions and folly, from time
          to time, even under the reproofs of the prophets, and even in such
          horrid delusions, so contrary to natural affection, as offering their
          children in sacrifice to Moloch, burning them alive, in a most cruel
          manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the time of Christ and the apostles, the Jews had great means of
          instruction, and most of the nations of the world were put under great
          advantages to come to the knowledge of the truth. Yet what was the
          effect? It would be easy to pursue these remarks respecting the
          papists in the time of the reformation, and since — the Arians and
          Deists in our day, etc. — but what has been said may be quite
          sufficient, if the reader will but indulge reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. The exceedingly great blindness of men, in things of religion,
          appears in the endless disputes and controversies, that there have
          been, and are, among men, about those things which concern religion. —
          Of old, the wise men and philosophers among the heathen, were, so to
          speak, infinitely divided among themselves. Varro, who was one of
          them, reckons up several hundred opinions about that one point,
          Wherein man’s happiness consisted? And they were continually in
          disputes one with another. But the effect of their disputes was not
          any greater union, or any better agreement in their opinions. They
          were as much divided after they had disputed many ages, as they were
          at first. Yea, much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          So there have long been disputes in the Christian world about opinions
          and principles in religion. There is a vast variety of sects and
          opinions. And disputes have been carried on, age after age, with great
          warmth, and thousands of volumes have been written one against
          another. And all these disputes have not terminated the differences,
          but they still subsist as much as ever. Yea, they increase and
          multiply more and more. Instead of ending controversies by disputing,
          one dispute only lays a foundation for another. And thus the world
          goes on jangling and contending, daily writing and printing. Being as
          it were deluged with controversial books. And all to no purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The increase of human learning does not bring these controversies to
          an issue, but does really increase and multiply them. There probably
          never was a time in our nation wherein there was such a vast variety
          of opinions in matters of religion, as at this day. Every now and
          then, a new scheme of things is broached, and various and contrary
          opinions are mixed and jumbled, divided and subdivided. And every new
          writer is willing to have the credit of some new notion.
        </p>
        <p>
          And after this manner does this miserable world go on in endless
          confusion, like a great multitude of fool-hardy persons, who go on in
          the dark, stumbling and justling one against another, without
          perceiving any remedy for their own, or affording any for their
          neighbor’s, calamity. — Thus I have shown how the extreme blindness
          that possesses the hearts of men is manifest in what appears in their
          profession.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>
          Men’s extreme blindness manifested by inward experience, and
          especially in their practices under the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I COME now to show, how this is manifest in those things that are
          found by inward experience, and are visible in men’s practices under
          the light of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. This appears in their being so prone to be deceived so many ways,
          or being liable to such a multiplicity of deceits. There are thousands
          of delusions in things which concern the affairs of religion, that men
          commonly are led away with, who yet live under the light of the
          gospel. — They are many ways deceived about God. They think him to be
          an exceeding diverse kind of being from what he is, altogether such an
          one as themselves (Psa. 50:21). They are deceived about his holiness,
          they do not realize it, that he is such a holy being as he indeed is,
          or that he hates sin with such a hatred as he declares he does. They
          are not convinced of his truth, or that he certainly will fulfill his
          threatenings or his promises. They are not convinced of his justice in
          punishing sin, as he does. They have very wrong notions of Christ.
          They are not convinced of his ability to save them, or of the
          sufficiency of his sacrifice and righteousness, nor of his willingness
          to receive them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men are commonly subject to a great many errors about their duty. They
          are ready to bring their principles to agree with their practices,
          instead of bringing their practices to their principles, as they ought
          to do. They will put innumerable false glosses on the rules of God’s
          Word, to bend them to a compliance with their lusts. And so they “put
          darkness for light, and light for darkness; bitter for sweet, and
          sweet for bitter.”
        </p>
        <p>
          They are subject to deceits and delusions about the things of this
          world. They imagine that there is happiness and satisfaction to be
          found in the profits, pleasures, and honors, which are to be had here.
          They believe all the deluding flatteries and promises of a vain world.
          And they will hold that deceit and grand delusion, that these things
          are the highest good. And will act accordingly; will choose these
          things for their portion. And they will hold and practice upon that
          error, that these things are of long continuance, and are to be
          depended upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are greatly deceived about the things of another world. They
          undervalue that heavenly glory, which is promised to the saints. And
          are not much terrified with what they hear of the damnation of hell.
          They cannot realize it, that its torments are so dreadful as they
          hear, and are very ready to imagine that they are not eternal, but
          will some time or other have an end.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are deceived about the state of good men. They think they are not
          happy, but live a melancholy life. And they are deceived about the
          wicked. They envy the state of many of them as accounting them well
          off. “They call the proud happy (Mal. 3:15), and bless the covetous,
          whom God abhors.” (Psa. 10:3). And they strive a great deal more after
          such enjoyments as these have, than after such as are the portion of
          the godly.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are subject to a thousand deceits and delusions about themselves.
          They think themselves wise, when they are fools. They are deceived
          about their own hearts. They think them much better than they really
          are. They think they see many good things in themselves, when indeed
          there is nothing good there. They appear lovely in their own eyes,
          when their hearts are like the inside of a grave, full of dead men’s
          bones and rotten flesh, crawling worms, and all uncleanness. Or
          rather, the inward vault of hell, that is a habitation of devils and
          every foul spirit. Those things in their hearts are highly esteemed by
          them, which are an abomination in the sight of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men are very prone to be deceived about their own state, to think
          themselves something when they are nothing, and to suppose themselves
          “rich and increased in goods, and to have need of nothing, when they
          are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.” They are
          greatly deceived about the principles they act from. They think they
          are sincere in that in which there is no sincerity. And that they do
          those things from love to God, which they do only from love to
          themselves. They call mere speculative or natural knowledge, spiritual
          knowledge; and put conscience for grace; a servile, for a childlike
          fear; and common affections, that are only from natural principles,
          and have no abiding effect, for high discoveries, and eminent actings
          of grace. Yea, it is common with men to call their vicious
          dispositions by the name of some virtue. They call their anger and
          malice, zeal for a righteous cause, or zeal for the public good. And
          their covetousness, frugality.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are vastly deceived about their own righteousness. They think
          their affections and performances lovely to God, which are indeed
          hateful to him. They think their tears, reformations, and prayers,
          sufficient to make atonement for their sins, when indeed if all the
          angels in heaven should offer themselves in sacrifice to God, it would
          not be sufficient to atone for one of their sins. They think their
          prayers and works, and religious doings a sufficient price to purchase
          God’s favor and eternal glory. When, as they perform them, they do
          nothing but merit hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are greatly deceived about their strength. They think they are
          able to mend their own hearts, and work some good principles in
          themselves. When they can do no more towards it, than a dead corpse
          does towards raising itself to life. They vainly flatter themselves,
          they are able to come to Christ, when they are not. They are greatly
          deceived about the stability of their own hearts. They foolishly think
          their own intentions and resolutions of what good they will do
          hereafter, to be depended on. When indeed there is no dependence at
          all to be had on them. They are greatly deceived about their
          opportunities. They think that the long continuance of their
          opportunity is to be depended on, and that tomorrow it is to be
          boasted of. When indeed there is the utmost uncertainty of it. They
          flatter themselves that they shall have a better opportunity to seek
          salvation hereafter, than they have now. When there is no probability
          of it, but a very great improbability.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are greatly deceived about their own actions and practices. Their
          own faults are strangely hid from their eyes. They live in ways that
          are very unbecoming Christians, but yet seem not to be at all sensible
          of it. Those evil ways of theirs, which are very plain to others, are
          hid from them. Yea, those very things, which they themselves account
          great faults in others, they will justify themselves in. Those things
          for which they will be very angry with others, they at the same time
          do themselves, and oftentimes in a much higher degree, and never once
          think of it. While they are zealous to pull the mote out of their
          brother’s eye, they know not that a beam is in their own eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those sins that they commit, which they are sensible are sins, they
          are woefully deceived about. They call great sins, little ones. And in
          their own imaginations, find out many excuses, which make the guilt
          very small, while the many heinous aggravations are hid from their
          eyes. They are greatly deceived about themselves, when they compare
          themselves with others. They esteem themselves better than their
          neighbors, who are indeed much better than themselves. They are
          greatly deceived about themselves, when they compare themselves with
          God. They are very insensible of the difference there is between God
          and them, and act in many things as if they thought themselves his
          equals. Yea, as if they thought themselves above him. Thus manifold
          are the deceits and delusions that men fall into.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The desperate blindness that is natural to men appears in their
          being so ignorant and blind in things that are so clear and plain.
          Thus if we consider how great God is, and how dreadful sin against him
          must be, and how much sin we are guilty of, and of what importance it
          is that his infinite Majesty should be vindicated; how plain is it,
          that man’s righteousness is insufficient! And yet how greatly will men
          confide in it! How will they ascribe more to it, than can be ascribed
          to the righteousness of the sinless and glorious angels of heaven.
          What can be more plain in itself, than that eternal things are of
          infinitely greater importance than temporal things? And yet how hard
          is it thoroughly to convince men of it! How plain is it, that eternal
          misery in hell is infinitely to be dreaded! And yet how few appear to
          be thoroughly convinced of this! How plain is it, that life is
          uncertain! And yet how much otherwise do most men think! How plain is
          it, that it is the highest prudence in matters of infinite concern to
          improve the first opportunity, without trusting to another! But yet
          how few are convinced of this! How reasonable is it, considering that
          God is a wise and just being, to suppose that there shall be a future
          state of rewards and punishments, wherein every man shall receive
          according to his works! And yet, how does this seem like a dream to
          most men!
        </p>
        <p>
          What can be in itself more plain and manifest, and easily to be known
          by us, if it were not for a strange blindness, than we are to
          ourselves, who are always with, never absent from ourselves; always in
          our own view, before our own eyes; who have opportunity to look into
          our own hearts, and see all that passes there? And yet what is there
          that men are more ignorant of, than they are of themselves! There are
          many vicious practices, the unlawfulness of which is very plain, the
          sins are gross, and contrary not only to the Word of God, but to the
          light of nature. And yet men will often plead, there is no harm in
          such sins. Such as, many acts of gross uncleanness; and many acts of
          fraud, injustice and deceitfulness; and many others that might be
          mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no one thing whatsoever more plain and manifest, and more
          demonstrable, than the being of a God. It is manifest in ourselves, in
          our own bodies and souls, and in everything about us wherever we turn
          our eye, whether to heaven, or to the earth, the air, or the seas. And
          yet how prone is the heart of man to call this into question! So
          inclined is the heart of man to blindness and delusion, that it is
          prone to even atheism itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The great blindness of the heart of man appears, in that so
          little a thing will deceive him, and confound his judgment. A little
          self-interest, or only the bait of some short gratification of a
          sensual appetite, or a little stirring of passion, will blind men’s
          eyes, and make them argue and judge most strangely and perversely, and
          draw the most absurd conclusion, such as, if they were indifferent,
          they would see to be most unreasonable. The devil finds easy work to
          deceive them a thousand ways; an argument of the great weakness and
          blindness of our minds. As a little child, weak in understanding, is
          very easily deceived.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The woeful blindness that possesses the hearts of men naturally,
          appears in their being all totally ignorant of that in God, which they
          had most need to know; viz. the glory and excellency of his nature.
          Though our faculties, which we have above the beasts, were chiefly
          given us that we might know this, and though without this knowledge
          all other will signify nothing to us, and our faculties are as capable
          of it, as of any other knowledge whatsoever — and which is as plainly
          and abundantly manifested as anything whatsoever, innumerable ways,
          both in the word and works of God — yet all men naturally are totally
          ignorant of this. As ignorant as one born blind is of colors. Natural
          men of the greatest abilities and learning, are as ignorant of it as
          the weakest and the most unlearned. Yea, as ignorant as the very
          stocks and stones. For they see, and can see nothing at all of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. It appears, in that they are so blind in those same things in
          religious matters, which they are sufficiently sensible of in other
          matters. In temporal things they are very sensible that it is a point
          of prudence to improve the first opportunity in things of great
          importance. But in matters of religion, which are of infinitely the
          greatest importance, they have not this discernment. In temporal
          matters they are sensible that it is a great folly long to delay and
          put off, when life is in danger, and all depends upon it. But in the
          concerns of their souls, they are insensible of this truth. So in the
          concerns of this world, they are sensible it is prudence to improve
          times of special advantage, and to embrace a good offer when made
          them. They are sensible that things of long continuance are of greater
          importance, than those of short duration. Yet in religious concerns,
          none of these things are sensibly discerned. In temporal things they
          are sufficiently sensible, that it is a point of prudence to lay up
          for hereafter, in summer to lay up for winter, and to lay up for their
          families, after they are dead. But men do not generally discern the
          prudence of making a proper provision for a future state. — In matters
          of importance in this world, they are sensible of the wisdom of taking
          thorough care to be on sure grounds. But in their soul’s concerns they
          see nothing of this. Our Savior observed this to be the case with the
          Jews when he was upon earth. “Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face
          of the sky, and of the earth: but how is it that ye do not discern
          this time?” (Luke 12:56)
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The desperate blindness that naturally possesses the hearts of men
          under the gospel, appears in their remaining so stupidly insensible
          and deceived, under so great means of instruction and conviction. If
          they were brought up under heathenish darkness, it would not be so
          full a demonstration of it. But thus they remain, though under the
          clearest light, under the glorious light of the gospel, where they
          enjoy God’s own instructions in his word, in a great fullness and
          plainness, and have the evidence and truth of things set before them
          from time to time in the plainest manner. They have the arguments of
          God’s being and perfection, and of another world. They are told how
          eternal things are of greater importance than temporal, and of what
          importance it is to escape eternal misery. How much it is worth while
          to take pains for heavenly glory, and how vain their own righteousness
          is. But yet to what little purpose!
        </p>
        <p>
          And they have not only great means of instruction in God’s Word, but
          also in providence. They have the evidence of the shortness and
          uncertainty of life. “He seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool
          and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.” Yet
          “their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever,
          and their dwelling-places to all generations: they call their lands
          after their own names. nevertheless man being in honor, abideth not:
          he is like the beasts that perish. This their way is their folly: yet
          their posterity approve their sayings.” They find the world is vain
          and unsatisfactory. They find the great instability and treachery of
          their own hearts, and how their own good intentions and resolutions
          are not to be depended on. They often find by experience that their
          attempts to make them better, fail. But, alas! With what small effect!
        </p>
        <p>
          Such abundant evidence is there, both in what appears in the open
          profession of men, and also by what is found in their inward
          experience, and is evident in their practice, of the extreme and
          brutish ignorance and blindness, which naturally possess their hearts.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IV</p>
        <p>Practical inferences and application of the subject.</p>
        <p>
          HAVING shown how the truth of the doctrine is evident, both by what
          appears in men’s open profession, and by those things which are found
          by inward experience, and are manifest by what is visible in men’s
          practice, I proceed to improve the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. By this we may see how manifest are the ruins of the fall of man.
          It is observable in all the kinds of God’s creatures that we behold,
          that they have those properties and qualities, which are every way
          proportioned to their end. So that they need no more, they stand in
          need of no greater degree of perfection, in order well to answer the
          special use for which they seem to be designed. The brute creatures,
          birds, beasts, fishes, and insects, though there be innumerable kinds
          of them, yet all seem to have such a degree of perception and
          perfection given them, as best suits their place in the creation,
          their manner of living, and the ends for which they were made. There
          is no defect visible in them. They are perfect in their kind. There
          seems to be nothing wanting, in order to their filling up their
          allotted place in the world. And there can be no reasonable doubt but
          that it was so at first with mankind. It is not reasonable to suppose,
          that God would make many thousands of kinds of creatures in this lower
          world, and one kind the highest of them all, to be the head of the
          rest, and that all the rest should be complete in their kinds, every
          way endowed with such qualifications as are proportioned to their use
          and end. And only this most noble creature of all, left exceeding
          imperfect, notoriously destitute of what he principally stands in need
          of to answer the end of his being. The principal faculty by which God
          has distinguished this noble creature from the rest, is his
          understanding. But would God so distinguish man in his creation from
          other creatures, and then seal up that understanding with such an
          extreme blindness, as to render it useless, as to the principal ends
          of it, and wholly to disenable him from answering the ends of an
          intelligent creature, and to make his understanding rather a misery
          than a blessing to him, and rendering him much more mischievous than
          useful? Therefore, if the Scripture had not told us so, yet we might
          safely conclude, that mankind are not now, as they were made at first.
          But that they are in a fallen state and condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. From what has been said, plainly appears the necessity of divine
          revelation. The deists deny the Scripture to be the Word of God, and
          hold that there is no revealed religion, that God has given mankind no
          other rule but his own reason, who is sufficient, without any word or
          revelation from heaven, to give man a right understanding of divine
          things, and of his duty. But how is it proved in fact? How much trial
          has there been, whether man’s reason, without a revelation, would be
          sufficient or not! The whole world, excepting one nation, had the
          trial till the coming of Christ. And was not this long enough for
          trial, whether man’s reason alone was sufficient to instruct him?
          Those nations, who all that time lay in such gross darkness, and in
          such a deplorable helpless condition, had the same natural reason that
          the deists have. And during this time, there was not only one man, or
          a succession of single persons, that had the trial, whether their own
          reason would be sufficient to lead them to the knowledge of the truth.
          But all nations, who all had the same human faculties that we have. If
          human reason is really sufficient, and there be no need of anything
          else, why has it never proved so? Why has it never happened, that so
          much as one nation, or one city or town, or one assembly of men, have
          been brought to tolerable notions of divine things, unless it be by
          the revelation contained in the Scriptures? If it were only one nation
          that had remained in such darkness, the trial might not be thought so
          great, because one particular people might be under some
          disadvantages, which were peculiar. But thus it has been with all
          nations, except those which have been favored with the Scriptures, and
          in all ages. Where is any people, who to this day have ever delivered
          themselves by their own reason, or have been delivered without light
          fetched from the Scriptures, or by means of the gospel of Jesus
          Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
          If human reason is sufficient without the Scripture, is it not strange
          that, in these latter ages — since navigation has been so improved,
          and America and many other parts of the world have been discovered,
          which were before unknown — no one nation has anywhere been found
          already enlightened, and possessed of true notions about the Divine
          Being and his perfections, by virtue of that human reason they have
          been possessed of so many thousand years? The many poor, barbarous
          nations here, in America, had the faculty of reason to do what they
          pleased with, before the Europeans came hither, and brought over the
          light of the gospel. If human reason alone was sufficient, it is
          strange, that no one people were found, in any corner of the land, who
          were helped by it, in the chief concern of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          There has been a great trial, as to what men’s reason can do without
          divine help, in those endless disputes that have been maintained. If
          human reason alone could help mankind, it might be expected that these
          disputes would have helped them, and have put an end to men’s
          darkness. The heathen philosophers had many hundreds of years to try
          their skill in this way. But all without effect. That divine
          revelation, which the church of God has been possessed of, has been in
          the world “as a light shining in a dark place.” (2 Peter 1:19) It is
          the only remedy which God has provided for the miserable, brutish
          blindness of mankind, a remedy without which this fallen world would
          have sunk down forever in brutal barbarism without any remedy. It is
          the only means that the true God has made successful in his
          providence, to give the nations of the world the knowledge of himself;
          and to bring them off from the worship of false gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          If human reason be the only proper means, the means that God has
          designed for enlightening mankind, is it not very strange, that it has
          not been sufficient, nor has answered this end in any one instance?
          All the right speculative knowledge of the true God, which the deists
          themselves have, has been derived from divine revelation. How vain is
          it to dispute against fact, and the experience of so many thousand
          years! And to pretend that human reason is sufficient without divine
          revelation, when so many thousand years’ experience, among so many
          hundreds of nations of different tempers, circumstances, and
          interests, has proved the contrary! One would think all should
          acknowledge, that so long a time is sufficient for a trial, especially
          considering the miseries that the poor nations of the world have been
          under all this while, for want of light: the innumerable temporal
          calamities and miseries — such as sacrificing children, and many other
          cruelties to others, and even to themselves — besides that eternal
          perdition, which we may reasonably suppose to be the consequence of
          such darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This doctrine should make us sensible, how great a mercy it is to
          mankind, that God has sent his own Son into the world, to be the light
          of the world. — The subject shows what great need we stand in of some
          teacher to be sent from God. And even some of the wiser men among the
          heathen saw the need of this. They saw that they disputed and jangled
          among themselves without coming to a satisfying discovery of the
          truth; and hence they saw, and spoke of, the need there was of a
          teacher sent from heaven. And it is a wonderful instance of divine
          mercy that God has so beheld us in our low estate, as to provide such
          a glorious remedy. He has not merely sent some created angel to
          instruct us, but his own Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, and
          of the same nature and essence with him. And therefore infinitely
          better acquainted with him, and more sufficient to teach a blind
          world. He has sent him to be the light of the world, as he says of
          himself, “I am come a light into the world.” (John 12:46) When he
          came, he brought glorious light. It was like the day-spring from on
          high, visiting a dark world, as Zacharias observes (Luke 1:77, 78,
          79). After Christ came, then the glorious gospel began to spread
          abroad, delivering those “that had sitten in darkness, and in the
          region of the shadow of death.”
        </p>
        <p>
          What reason have we to rejoice, and praise God, that he has made such
          excellent provision for us, and has set so glorious a sun in our
          firmament, such a “Sun of righteousness,” after we had extinguished
          the light which at first enlightened us, and had, as it were, brought
          the world into that state, in which it was when “without form, and
          void, and darkness was on the face of it.” (Jer. 4:22, 23) — The glory
          of that light which God has sent into the world is fully answerable to
          the grossness of that darkness which filled it. For Christ who came to
          enlighten us is truth and light itself, and the fountain of all light.
          “He is the light, and in him is no darkness at all.” (1 John 1:5)
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Hence we may learn, what must be the thing which will bring to
          pass those glorious days of light, which are spoken of in God’s Word.
          — Though mankind be fallen into such darkness, and the world be mostly
          in the kingdom of darkness; yet the Scripture often speaks of a
          glorious day, wherein light shall fill the earth. “For behold the
          darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but the
          Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. And
          the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of
          thy rising.” (Isa. 60:2, 3.) “And he will destroy in this mountain,
          the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is
          spread over all nations.” (Isa. 25:7) “The knowledge of God shall fill
          the earth, as the waters cover the sea.” (Isa. 11:9)
        </p>
        <p>
          By what we have heard, we may on good grounds conclude, that whenever
          this is accomplished, it will not be effected by human learning, or by
          the skill or wisdom of great men. What has been before observed of
          this learned age, is a presumptive evidence of it, wherein spiritual
          darkness increases with the increase of learning. God will again make
          foolish the wisdom of this world. And will, as it were, say in his
          providence, “Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the
          disputer of this world?”
        </p>
        <p>
          When this shall be accomplished, it will be by a remarkable pouring
          out of God’s own Spirit, with the plain preaching of the gospel of his
          Son, the preaching of the spiritual, mysterious doctrines of Christ
          crucified, which to the learned men of this world are foolishness.
          Those doctrines, which are the stumbling-block of this learned age.
          “Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of
          hosts.” It will not be by the enticing words of man’s wisdom, but by
          the demonstration of the Spirit and of power. Not by the wisdom of
          this world, nor by the princes of this world, that come to nought. But
          by the gospel, that contains the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
          hidden wisdom, which none of the princes of this world, who have
          nothing to enlighten them but their own learning, know anything of.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Spirit of God, who searches all things, even the deep things of
          God, must reveal it. For let natural men be never so worldly wise and
          learned, they receive not the things of the Spirit. They are
          foolishness to them. Nor can they know them, because they are
          spiritually discerned. This great effect, when it is accomplished,
          will be a glorious effect indeed. And it will be accomplished in such
          a manner, as most remarkably to show it to be the work of God, and his
          only. It will be a more glorious work of God than that which we read
          of in the beginning of Genesis. “And the earth was without form and
          void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of
          God moved upon the face of the waters: and God said, Let there be
          light, and there was light.” (Gen. 1:2, 3)
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Hence we may learn the misery of all such persons, as are under the
          power of that darkness which naturally possesses their hearts. There
          are two degrees of this misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that of which all who are in a natural condition are the
          subjects. The doctrine shows that all such as are in a natural
          condition, are in a miserable condition. For they are in an extremely
          dark and blind condition. It is uncomfortable living in darkness. What
          a sorrowful state would we all be in, if the sun should no more rise
          upon us, and the moon were to withdraw her shining, and stars to be
          put out, and we were to spend the rest of our time in darkness! The
          world would soon perish in such darkness. It was a great plague in
          Egypt, when they had a total darkness for three days. They who are
          deprived of sight, are deprived of the most noble of the senses. They
          have no benefit of eternal light, one of the most excellent and
          needful of all the things which God has made in the visible creation.
          But they who are without spiritual sight and light, are destitute of
          that which is far more excellent and necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          That natural men are not sensible of their blindness, and the misery
          they are under by reason of it, is no argument that they are not
          miserable. For it is very much the nature of this calamity to be hid
          from itself, or from those who are under it. Fools are not sensible of
          their folly. Solomon says, “the fool is wiser in his own conceit, than
          seven men that can render a reason.” (Pro. 26:16) The most barbarous
          and brutish heathens are not sensible of their own darkness, are not
          sensible but that they enjoy as great light, and have as good
          understanding of things, as the most enlightened nations in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, another degree of this misery is of those who are judicially
          given up of God, to the blindness of their own minds. The Scripture
          teaches us that there are some such. “What then; Israel hath not
          obtained that which he seeketh for, but the election hath obtained it,
          and the rest were blinded.” (Rom. 11:7) “But their minds were blinded;
          for until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away.” (2 Cor.
          3:14) “And he said, Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, and
          understand not; and see ye indeed, and perceive not. Make the heart of
          this people fat, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they
          see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with
          their hearts, and convert and be healed.” (Isa. 6:6, 10) This
          judgment, when inflicted, is commonly for the contempt and abuse of
          light which has been offered, for the commission of presumptuous sins,
          and for being obstinate in sin, and resisting the Holy Ghost, and many
          gracious calls and counsels, warnings and reproofs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who the particular persons are, that are thus judicially given up of
          God to the blindness of their minds, is not known to men. But we have
          no reason to suppose that there are not multitudes of them, and most
          in places of the greatest light. There is no manner of reason to
          suppose that this judgment, which is spoken of in Scripture, is in a
          great measure peculiar to those old times. As there were many who fell
          under it in the times of the prophets of old, and of Christ and his
          apostles. So doubtless there are now also. And though the persons are
          not known, yet doubtless there may be more reason to fear it
          concerning some than others. All who are under the power of the
          blindness of their own minds are miserable. But such as are given up
          to this blindness, are especially miserable. For they are reserved,
          and sealed over to the blackness of darkness forever.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION V</p>
        <p>Address to sinners.</p>
        <p>
          THE consideration of what has been said of the desperate blindness
          which possesses the hearts of us all naturally, may well be terrifying
          to such as are yet in a Christless condition, in this place of light,
          where the gospel has been so long enjoyed, and where God has in times
          past so wonderfully poured out his Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          And let such persons, for their awakening, consider the following
          things:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that they are blinded by the god of this world. Their blindness
          is from hell. This darkness which natural men are under, is from the
          prince of darkness. This the apostle says expressly of those who
          remain in unbelief and blindness under the gospel. “But if our gospel
          be hid, it is hid from them that are lost; in whom the God of this
          world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not.” (2 Cor. 4:3,
          4) They belong to the kingdom of darkness. In that darkness which
          reigns in their souls, the devil reigns. And he holds his dominion
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, consider how God in his word manifests his abhorrence and
          wrath towards those who remain so sottishly blind and ignorant, in the
          midst of light. How does God speak of them! “Have all the workers of
          iniquity no knowledge?” (Psa. 14:4) “Forty years long was I grieved
          with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their
          heart, and they have not known my ways. Unto whom I sware in my wrath,
          that they should not enter into my rest.” (Psa. 95:10, 11) “The ox
          knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but Israel doth not
          know, my people doth not consider. Ah, sinful nation! — they have
          provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger.” (Isa. 1:3, 4) “It is a
          people of no understanding; therefore he that made them will not have
          mercy on them, and he that formed them will show them no favour.”
          (Isa. 27:10, 11) “My people is foolish, they have not known me, they
          are sottish children, and they have no understanding: they are wise to
          do evil, but to do good they have non knowledge.” (Jer. 4:22) “Declare
          this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in the house of Judah,
          saying, Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding,
          which have eyes and see not, which have ears and hear not. Fear ye not
          ME, saith the Lord; will ye not tremble at MY presence?” (Jer. 5:20,
          21, 22)
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, consider how much willfulness there is in your ignorance.
          Sinners are ready wholly to excuse themselves in their blindness;
          whereas, as observed already, the blindness that naturally possesses
          the hearts of men, is not a merely negative thing. But they are
          blinded by “the deceitfulness of sin.” (Heb. 3:13) There is a
          perverseness in their blindness. There is not a mere absence of light,
          but a malignant opposition to the light. As God says, “they know not,
          neither will they understand, they walk on in darkness.” (Psa. 82:5)
          Christ observes, “that every one that doeth evil, hateth the light,
          neither cometh to the light.” And that “this is their condemnation,
          that light is come into the world, yet men loved darkness rather than
          light.” (John 3:19, 20) And I may appeal to your own consciences,
          whether you have no willfully rejected the many instructions you have
          had, and refused to hearken? Whether you have not neglected to seek
          after the light, and neglected your Bible? Whether you have not been a
          very negligent hearer of the word preached, and neglected other proper
          means of knowledge? Whether you have not neglected to cry to God for
          that wisdom which you need? Yea, have you not resisted the means of
          knowledge? Have you not resisted and quenched the motions of the
          Spirit, which at times you have had? And taken a course to make
          yourself more and more stupid, by stifling the convictions of your own
          conscience, and doing contrary to the light thereof; whereby you have
          done those things that have tended to sear your conscience, and make
          yourself more and more senseless and sottish?
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, consider what is the course that God will take to teach those
          who will not be taught by the instructions of his word. He will teach
          them by briers and thorns, and by the flames of hell. Though natural
          men will remain to all eternity ignorant of the excellency and
          loveliness of God’s nature, and so will have no spiritual knowledge;
          yet God in another world will make them thoroughly to understand many
          things, which senseless unawakened sinners are sottishly ignorant of
          in this world. Their eyes in many respects shall be thoroughly opened
          in hell. Their judgments will be rectified. They shall be of the same
          judgment with the godly. They shall be convinced of the reality of
          those things which they would not be convinced of here: as the being
          of God, his power, holiness, and justice, that the Scriptures are the
          Word of God, that Christ is the Son of God, and that time is short and
          uncertain. They will be convinced of the vanity of the world, of the
          blessed opportunity they had in the world, and how much it is men’s
          wisdom to improve their time. We read of the rich man, who was so
          sottishly blind in this world, that “in hell he lift up his eyes, and
          saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.” (Luke 16:23) With
          many men, alas! the first time they open their eyes is in hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          God will make all men to know the truth of those great things which he
          speaks of in his word, one way or another. For he will vindicate his
          own truth. He has undertaken to convince all men. They who will not be
          convinced in this world, by the gentle and gracious methods which God
          uses with them now, shall be convinced hereafter by severe means. If
          they will not be convinced for salvation, they shall be convinced by
          damnation. God will make them know that he is the Lord. And he will
          make them know that he bears rule. “Consume them in wrath, that they
          may not be; and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, unto the ends
          of the earth.” (Psa. 59:13) “Let them be confounded and troubled for
          ever: yea, let them be put to shame, and perish. That men may know
          that thou, whose name is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the
          earth.” (Psa. 83:17, 18)
        </p>
        <p>
          What great care we had need all have, that we be not deceived in
          matters of religion. If our hearts are all naturally possessed with
          such an extreme brutish ignorance and blindness in things of religion,
          and we are exceedingly prone to delusion, then surely great care ought
          to be taken to avoid it. For that we are naturally prone to delusion,
          shows our danger. But the greater our danger of any calamity is, the
          greater had our watchfulness need to be. — Let us therefore be hence
          warned to take heed that we be not deceived about our duty, about our
          own hearts, about our ways, about our state, and about our
          opportunities. Thousands are deceived in these things, and thousands
          perish by that means. Multitudes fall on our right hand and on our
          left, and are ruined eternally by their delusion in these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          How foolish a thing it is for men to lean to their own understanding,
          and trust their own hearts. If we are so blind, then our own wisdom is
          not to be depended on, and that advice of the wise man is most
          reasonable. “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to
          thine own understanding.” (Pro. 3:5) “And he that trusteth in his own
          heart, is a fool.” (Pro. 28:26) — They therefore are fools, who trust
          to their own wisdom, and will question the mysterious doctrines of
          religion, because they cannot see through them, and will not trust to
          the infinite wisdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us therefore become fools. Be sensible of our own natural
          blindness and folly. There is a treasure of wisdom contained in that
          one sentence; “If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world,
          let him become a fool, that he may be wise.” (1 Cor. 3:18) Seeing our
          own ignorance, and blindness, is the first step towards having true
          knowledge. “If any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth
          nothing yet as he ought to know.” (1 Cor. 8:2)
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us ask wisdom of God. If we are so blind in ourselves, then
          knowledge is not to be sought for out of our own stock, but must be
          sought from some other source. And we have no where else to go for it,
          but to the fountain of light and wisdom. True wisdom is a precious
          jewel. And none of our fellow-creatures can give it us, nor can we buy
          it with any price we have to give. It is the sovereign gift of God.
          The way to obtain it is to go to him sensible of our weakness, and
          blindness, and misery on that account. “If any lack wisdom, let him
          ask of God.” (Jam. 1:5).
