          Matthew 7:14, “Few there be that find it.”<br />
          Doc[trine.] ’Tis a hard thing to find the right way to Heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. There is a way to Heaven.<br />
          God has opened a door.<br />
          II. There is but one right way.<br />
          III. ’Tis a hard thing to find this one right way.
        </p>
        <p>Appears: In that there are so few that find the way.</p>
        <p>
          Tho[ugh] all have so much need to find.<br />
          Tho[ugh] so many desire to find and seek after it.<br />
          Tho[ugh] so many think they have found.<br />
          …………….so many are mistaken.
        </p>
        <p>
          That many of those that do find it, first take a great deal of
          pains.<br />
          Some for a long time.<br />
          Many prayers.<br />
          Many difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason: Negatively, not that [God] hasn’t [has not] called us.<br />
          “ “ very plain in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reasons:<br />
          Many wrong ways.<br />
          Like traveling through a great wilderness.<br />
          Full of difficulties…dangers….<br />
          But one right way.<br />
          [A] narrow way.<br />
          Many wrong ways.<br />
          Mention some of the wrong ways.<br />
          Do right in some things only.<br />
          Outward Religion only.<br />
          Affections that go away.<br />
          Religious out of regard to men.<br />
          Religious only out of fear of hell.<br />
          ……..from self-love.<br />
          Don’t love God for Himself.<br />
          Trust in their own righteousness.<br />
          Depend on the good opinion of others.<br />
          Apt to think themselves convicted when they are not.<br />
          High pride: apt to think well of themselves.<br />
          A little good looks great.<br />
          Don’t see what is bad.<br />
          How many things men often think are Conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Men’s own lust blind[s] ’em.<br />
          The way is good and plain.<br />
          Right way is what men don’t like.<br />
          Up-hill.<br />
          Contrary to all their lusts.<br />
          ….. to their pride.<br />
          ….. to their worldliness.<br />
          …………….. sensuality.<br />
          …………….. slothfulness.<br />
          Enmity against God.<br />
          Wrong ways are<br />
          Easy.<br />
          Broad.<br />
          Down-hill.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Devils.<br />
          Blind them and deceive them.
        </p>
        <p>4. Things of this world blind ’em.</p>
        <p>5. Wicked men implead (?) ’em.</p>
        <p>
          Applica[tion.]<br />
          What a great mercy to have the Word of God.<br />
          Mercy that God has appointed ministers.<br />
          Great need of Prayer —<br />
          Never without God’s help.<br />
          Don’t trust… v. 22…<br />
          What need of God’s power and striving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Directions.<br />
          Pray earnestly.<br />
          Not trust…..[As above, v. 22.]<br />
          Take advice.<br />
          Begin soon.<br />
          Hold on and hold out.<br />
          Don’t take hope too soon.<br />
          In every thing follow the Word of God.<br />
          You need to be much concerned.
