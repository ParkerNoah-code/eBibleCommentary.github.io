          Genesis 6:22, “Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him,
          so did he.”
        </p>
        <p>CONCERNING these words, I would observe three things:</p>
        <p>
          1. What it was that God commanded Noah, to which these words refer. It
          was the building of an ark according to the particular direction of
          God, against the time when the flood of waters should come; and the
          laying up of food for himself, his family, and the other animals,
          which were to be preserved in the ark. We have the particular commands
          which God gave him respecting this affair, from the 14th verse, “Make
          thee an ark of gopher wood,” &amp;c
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We may observe the special design of the work which God had
          enjoined upon Noah: it was to save himself and his family, when the
          rest of the world should be drowned. See ver. 17, 18. We may observe
          Noah’s obedience. He obeyed God: thus did Noah. And his obedience was
          thorough and universal: according to all that God commanded him, so
          did he. He not only began, but he went through his work, which God had
          commanded him to undertake for his salvation from the flood. To this
          obedience the apostle refers in Heb. 11:7, “By faith Noah, being
          warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an
          ark to the saving of his house.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE.</p>
        <p>
          We should be willing to engage in and go through great undertakings,
          in order to our own salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The building of the ark, which was enjoined upon Noah, that he and his
          family might be saved, was a great undertaking: the ark was a building
          of vast size; the length of it being three hundred cubits, the breadth
          of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. A cubit, till
          of late, was by learned men reckoned to be equal to a foot and a half
          of our measure. But lately some learned men of our nation have
          travelled into Egypt, and other ancient countries, and have measured
          some ancient buildings there, which are of several thousand years
          standing, and of which ancient histories give us the dimensions in
          cubits; particularly the pyramids of Egypt, which are standing entire
          at this day. By measuring these, and by comparing the measure in feet
          with the ancient accounts of their measure in cubits, a cubit is found
          to be almost two and twenty inches. Therefore learned men more lately
          reckon a cubit much larger than they did formerly. So that the ark,
          reckoned so much larger every way, will appear to be almost of double
          the bulk which was formerly ascribed to it According to this
          computation of the cubit, it was more than five hundred and fifty feet
          long, about ninety feet broad, and about fifty feet in height.
        </p>
        <p>
          To build such a structure, with all those apartments and divisions in
          it which were necessary, and in such a manner as to be fit to float
          upon the water for so long a time, was then a great undertaking. It
          took Noah, with all the workmen he employed, a hundred and twenty
          years, or thereabouts, to build it For so long it was, that the Spirit
          of God strove, and the long-suffering God waited on the old world, as
          you may see in Gen. 4:3: “My Spirit shall I not always strive with
          man; yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.” All this while
          the ark was a preparing, as appears by 1 Pet. 3:20: “When once the
          long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a
          preparing.” It was a long time that Noah constantly employed himself
          in this business. Men would esteem that undertaking very great, which
          should keep them constantly employed even for one half of that time.
          Noah must have had a great and constant care upon his mind for these
          one hundred and twenty years, in superintending this work, and in
          seeing that all was done exactly according to the directions which God
          had given him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only was Noah himself continually employed, but it required a
          great number of workmen to be constantly employed, during all that
          time, in procuring, and collecting, and fitting the materials, and in
          putting them together in due form. How great a thing was it for Noah
          to undertake such a work! For beside the continual care and labor, it
          was a work of vast expense. It is not probable that any of that wicked
          generation would put to a finger to help forward such a work, which
          doubtless they believed was merely the fruit of Noah’s folly, without
          full wages. Noah must needs have been very rich, to be able to bear
          the expense of such a work, and to pay so many workmen for so long a
          time. It would have been a very great expense for a prince; and
          doubtless Noah was very rich, as Abraham and Job were afterwards. But
          it is probable that Noah spent all his worldly substance in this work,
          thus manifesting his faith in the word of God, by selling all he had,
          as believing there would surely come a flood, which would destroy all;
          so that if he should keep what he had, it would be of no service to
          him. Herein he has set us an example, showing us how we ought to sell
          all for our salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noah’s undertaking was of great difficulty, as it exposed him to the
          continual reproaches of all his neighbors, for that whole one hundred
          and twenty years. None of them believed what he told them of a flood
          which was about to drown the world. For a man to undertake such a vast
          piece of work, under notion that it should be the means of saving him
          when the world should be destroyed, it made him the continual
          laughing-stock of the world. When he was about to hire workmen,
          doubtless all laughed at him, and we may suppose, that though the
          workmen consented to work for wages, yet they laughed at the folly of
          him who employed them. When the ark was begun, we may suppose that
          every one that passed by and saw such a huge bulk stand there, laughed
          at, it, calling it Noah’s folly.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these days, men are with difficulty brought to do or submit to that
          which makes them the objects of the reproach of all their neighbors.
          Indeed if while some reproach them, others stand by them and honor
          them, this will support them. But it is very difficult for a man to go
          on in a way wherein he makes himself the laughing stock of the whole
          world, and wherein he can find none who do not despise him. Where is
          the man that can stand the shock of such a trial for twenty years?<br />
          But in such an undertaking as this, Noah at the divine direction,
          engaged and went through it, that himself and his family might be
          saved from the common destruction which was shortly about to come on
          the world. He began, and also made an end: “According to all that God
          commanded him, so did he.” Length of time did not weary him: he did
          not grow weary of his vast expense. He stood the shock of the derision
          of all his neighbors; and of all the world year after year: he did not
          grow weary of being their laughing-stock, so as to give over his
          enterprise; but persevered in it till the ark was finished. After
          this, he was at the trouble and charge of procuring stores for the
          maintenance of his family, and of all the various kinds of creatures,
          for so long a time. Such an undertaking he engaged in and went through
          in order to a temporal salvation. How great an undertaking then should
          men be willing to engage in and go through in order to their eternal
          salvation! A salvation from an eternal deluge; from being overwhelmed
          with the billows of God’s wrath of which Noah’s flood was but a
          shadow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall particularly handle this doctrine under the three following
          propositions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. There is a work or business which must be undertaken and
          accomplished by men, if they would be saved.<br />
          II. This business is a great undertaking.<br />
          III. Men should be willing to enter upon and go through this
          undertaking though it be great, seeing it is for their own
          salvation.<br />
          Proposition. There is a work or business which men must enter upon and
          accomplish, in order to their salvation.-Men have no reason to expect
          to be saved in idleness, or to go to heaven in a way of doing nothing.
          No; in order to it, there is a great work, which must be not only
          begun, but finished-I shall speak upon this proposition, in answer to
          two inquiries.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. What is this work or business which must be undertaken and
          accomplished in order to the salvation of men?<br />
          Answer. It is the work of seeking salvation in a way of constant
          observance of all the duty to which God directs its in his word. If we
          would be saved, we must seek salvation. For although men do not obtain
          heaven of themselves; they do not go thither accidentally, or without
          any intention or endeavors of their own. God, in his word, hath
          directed men to seek their salvation as they would hope to obtain it.
          There is a race that is set before them, which they must run, and in
          that race come off victors, in order to their winning the prize.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scriptures have told us what particular duties must be performed
          by us in order to our salvation. It is not sufficient that men seek
          their salvation on in the observance of some of those duties; but they
          must be observed universally. The work we have to do is not an
          obedience only to some, but to all the commands of God; a compliance
          with every institution of worship; a diligent use of all the appointed
          means of grace; a doing of all duty towards God and towards man.-It is
          not sufficient that men have some respect to all the commands of God,
          and that they may be said to seek their salvation in some sort of
          observance of all the commands; but they must be devoted to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          They must not make this a business by the by, or a thing in which they
          are negligent and careless, or which they do with a slack hand; but it
          must be their great business, being attended to as their great
          concern. They must not only seek, but strive; they must do what their
          hand findeth to do with their might, as men thoroughly engaged in
          their minds, and influenced and set forward by great desire and strong
          resolution. They must act as those that see so much of the importance
          of religion above all other things, that every thing else must be as
          an occasional affair, and nothing must stand in competition with its
          duties. This must be the one thing they do; Phil. 3:13, “This one
          thing I do.”-It must be the business to which they make all other
          affairs give place, and to which they are ready to make other things a
          sacrifice. They must be ready to part with pleasures and honor, estate
          and life, and to sell all, that they may successfully accomplish this
          business.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is required of every man, that he not only do something in this
          business, but that he should devote himself to it; which implies that
          he should give up himself to it, all his affairs, and all his temporal
          enjoyments. This is the import of taking up the cross, of taking
          Christ’s yoke upon us, and of denying ourselves to follow Christ. The
          rich young man, who came kneeling to Christ to know what he should do
          to he saved, Mark 10:17, in some sense sought salvation but did not
          obtain it. In some sense he kept all the commands from his youth up;
          but was not cordially devoted to this business. He had not made a
          sacrifice to it of all his enjoyments, as appeared when Christ came to
          try him; he would not part with his estate for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not only necessary that men should seem to he very much engaged,
          and appear as if they were devoted to their duty for a little while;
          but there must be a constant devotedness, in a persevering way, as
          Noah was to the business of the building the ark, going on with that
          great, difficult, and expensive affair, till it was finished, and till
          the flood came. Men must not only be diligent in the use of the means
          of grace, and be anxiously engaged to escape eternal ruin, till they
          obtain hope and comfort; but afterwards they must persevere in the
          duties of religion, till the flood come, the flood of death. Not only
          must the faculties, strength, and possessions of men be devoted to
          this work, but also their time and their lives; they must give up
          their whole lives to it, even to the very day when God causes the
          storms and floods to come. This is the work or business which men have
          to do in order to their salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inquiry 2. Why is it needful that men should undertake to go through
          such a work in order to their salvation?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer 1. Not to merit salvation, or to recommend them to the saving
          mercy of God. Men are not saved on the account of any work of theirs,
          and yet they are not saved without works. If we merely consider what
          it is for which, or on the account of which, men are saved, no work at
          all in men is necessary to their salvation. In this respect they are
          saved wholly without any work of theirs: Tit. iii. 5, “Not by works of
          righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved
          us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.”
          We must indeed be saved on the account of works; but not our own. It
          is on account of the works which Christ hath done for us. Works are
          the fixed price of eternal life; it is fixed by an eternal,
          unalterable rule of righteousness. But since the fall there is no hope
          of our doing these works, without salvation offered freely without
          money and without price. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Though it be not needful that we do any thing to merit salvation,
          which Christ hath fully merited for all who believe in him; yet God,
          for wise and holy ends, hath appointed, that we should come to final
          salvation in no other way, but that of good works done by us. God did
          not save Noah on account of the labor and expense he was at in
          building the ark. Noah’s salvation from the flood was an instance of
          the free and distinguishing mercy of God. Nor did God stand in need of
          Noah’s care, or cost, or labor, to build an ark. The same power which
          created the world, and which brought the flood of waters upon the
          earth, could have made the ark in an instant, without any care or cost
          to Noah, or any of the labor of those workmen who were employed for so
          long a time. Yet God was pleased to appoint, that Noah should be saved
          in this way. So God hath appointed that man should not be saved
          without his undertaking and doing this work of which I have been
          speaking; and therefore we are commanded “to work out our own
          salvation with fear and trembling,” Philip. 2:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many wise ends to be answered by the establishment of such a
          work as prerequisite to salvation. The glory of God requires it. For
          although God stand in no need of any thing that men do to recommend
          them to his saving mercy, yet it would reflect much on the glory of
          God’s wisdom and holiness, to bestow salvation on men in such a way as
          tends to encourage them in sloth and wickedness; or in any other way
          than that which tends to promote diligence and holiness. Man was made
          capable of action, with many powers of both body and mind fitting him
          for it. He was made for business and not idleness and the main
          business for which he was made, was that of religion. Therefore it
          becomes the wisdom of God to bestow salvation and happiness on man in
          such a way as tends most to promote his end in this respect, and, to
          stir him up to a diligent use of his faculties and talents.
        </p>
        <p>
          It becomes the wisdom of God so to order it, that things of great
          value and importance should not be obtained without great labor and
          diligence. Much human learning and great moral accomplishments are not
          to be obtained without care and labor. It is wisely so ordered, in
          order to maintain in man a due sense of the value of those things
          which are excellent. If great things were in common easily obtained,
          it would have a tendency to cause men to slight and undervalue them.
          Men commonly despise those things which are cheap, and which are
          obtained without difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the work of obedience performed by men, be not necessary in
          order to merit salvation; yet it is necessary in order to their being
          prepared for it. Men cannot be prepared for salvation without seeking
          it in such a way as hath been described. This is necessary in order
          that they have a proper sense of their own necessities, and
          unworthiness; and in order that they be prepared and disposed to prize
          salvation when bestowed, and be properly thankful to God for it. The
          requisition of so great a work in order to our salvation is no way
          inconsistent with the freedom of the offer of salvation; as after all
          it is both offered and bestowed without any respect to our work, as
          the price or meritorious cause of our salvation, as I have already
          explained. Besides, salvation bestowed in this way is better for us,
          more for our advantage and happiness both in this and the future
          world, than if it were given without this requisition.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Proposition. This work or business, which must be done in order to
          the salvation of men, is a great undertaking. It often appears so to
          men upon whom it is urged. Utterly to break off from all their sins,
          and to give up themselves forever to the business of religion, without
          making a reserve of any one lust, submitting to and complying with
          every command of God, in all cases, and persevering therein, appears
          to many so great a thing, that they are in vain urged to undertake it.
          In so doing it seems to them, that they should give up themselves to a
          perpetual bondage. The greater part of men therefore choose to put it
          off, and keep it at as great a distance as they can. They cannot bear
          to think of entering immediately on such a hard service, and rather
          than do it, they will run the risk of eternal damnation, by putting it
          off to an uncertain future opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the business of religion is far from really being as it
          appears to such men, or the devil will be sure, if he can, to
          represent it in false colors to sinners, and make it appear as black
          and as terrible as he can; yet it is indeed a great business, a great
          undertaking, and it is fit that all who are urged to it should count
          the cost beforehand, and be sensible of the difficulty attending it.
          For though the devil discourages many from this undertaking, by
          representing it to be more difficult than it really is; yet with
          others he takes a contrary course and flatters them it is a very easy
          thing, a trivial business, which may be done at any time when they
          please, and so emboldens them to defer it from that consideration. But
          let none conceive any other notion of that business of religion, which
          is absolutely necessary to their salvation, than that it is a great
          undertaking. It is so on the following accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is a business of great labor and care. There are many commands
          to be obeyed, many duties to be done, duties to God, duties to our
          neighbor, and duties, to ourselves. There is much opposition in the
          way of these duties from without. There is a subtle and powerful
          adversary laying all manner of blocks in the way. There are
          innumerable temptations of Satan to be resisted and repelled. There is
          great opposition from the world, innumerable snares laid, on every
          side, many rocks and mountains to be passed over, many streams to be
          passed through, and many flatteries and enticements from a vain world
          to be resisted. There is a great opposition from within; a dull and
          sluggish heart, which is exceedingly averse from that activity in
          religion which is necessary; a carnal heart, which is averse from
          religion and spiritual exercises, and continually drawing the contrary
          way; and a proud and a deceitful heart, in which corruption will be
          exerting itself in all manner of ways. So that nothing can be done to
          any effect without a most strict and careful watch, great labor and
          strife.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is a constant in business.-In that business which requires great
          labor, men love now and then to have a space of relaxation, that they
          may rest from their extraordinary labor. But this is a business which
          must be followed every day. Luke ix. 23, ” If any man will come after
          me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow me.”
          We must never give ourselves any relaxation from this business; it
          must be continually prosecuted day after day. If sometimes we make a
          great stir and bustle concerning religion, but then lay all aside to
          take our ease, and do so from time to time, it will be of no good
          effect; we had even as good do nothing at all. The business of
          religion so followed is never like to come to any good issue, nor is
          the work ever like to be accomplished to any good purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is a great undertaking, as it is an undertaking of great
          expense.-We must, therein sell all: we must follow this business at
          the expense of all our unlawful pleasures and delights, at the expense
          of our carnal ease, often at the expense of our substance, of our
          credit among men, the good will of our neighbors, at the expense of
          all our earthly friends, and even at the expense of life itself.
          Herein it is like Noah’s undertaking to build the ark, which, as hath
          been shown was a costly undertaking: it was expensive to his
          reputation among men, exposing him to be the continual laughing-stock
          of all his neighbors and of the whole world: and it was expensive to
          his estate, and probably cost him all that he had.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Sometimes the fear, trouble, and exercise of mind, which are
          undergone respecting this business, and the salvation of the soul, are
          great and long continued, before any comfort is obtained. Sometimes
          persons in this situation labor long in the dark, and sometimes, as it
          were, in the very fire, they having great distress of conscience,
          great fears, and many perplexing temptations, before they obtain light
          and comfort to make their care and labor more easy to them. They
          sometimes earnestly, and for a long time, seek comfort, but find it
          not, because they seek it not in a right manner, nor in the right
          objects. God therefore hides his face. They cry, but God doth not
          answer their prayers. They strive, but all seems in vain. They seem to
          themselves not at all to get forward, or nearer to a deliverance from
          sin: but to go backward, rather than forward. They see no glimmerings
          of light: things rather appear darker and darker. Insomuch that they
          are often ready to be discouraged, and to sink under the weight of
          their present distress, and under the prospect of future misery. In
          this situation, and under these views, some are almost driven to
          despair. Many, after they have obtained some saving comfort, are again
          involved in darkness and trouble. It is with them as it was with the
          Christian Hebrews, Heb. 10:32, “After ye were illuminated ye endured a
          great fight of afflictions. Some through a melancholy habit and
          distemper of body, together with Satan’s temptations, spend a great
          part of their lives in distress and darkness, even after they have had
          some saving comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It is a business which, by reason of the many difficulties, snares,
          and dangers that attend it, requires much instruction, consideration,
          and counsel. There is no business wherein men stand in need of counsel
          more than in this. It is a difficult undertaking, a hard matter to
          proceed aright in it. There are ten thousand wrong ways, which men may
          take; there are many labyrinths wherein many poor souls are entangled
          and never find the way out ; there are many rocks on which thousands
          of souls have suffered shipwreck, for want of, having steered aright.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men of themselves know not how to proceed in this business, any more
          than the children of Israel in the wilderness knew where to go without
          the guidance, of the pillar of cloud and fire. There is great need
          that they search the Scriptures, and give diligent heed to the
          instructions and directions contained in them, as to a light shining
          in a dark place and that they ask counsel of those skilled in these
          matters. And there is no business in which men have so much need of
          seeking to God by prayer, for his counsel, and that he would lead them
          in the right way, and show them the strait gate. ” For strait is the
          gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be
          that find it;” yea, there are none that find it without direction from
          heaven. The building of the ark was a work of great difficulty on this
          account, that Noah’s wisdom was not sufficient to direct him how to
          make such a building as should be a sufficient security against such a
          flood, and which should be a convenient dwelling-place for himself,
          his family, and all the various kinds of beasts and birds, and
          creeping things. Nor could he ever have known how to construct this
          building, had not God directed him.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. This business never ends till life ends. They that undertake this
          laborious, careful, expensive, self-denying business, must not expect
          to rest from their labors, till death shall have put an end to them.
          The long continuance of the work which Noah undertook was what
          especially made it a great undertaking. This also was what made the
          travel of the children of Israel through the wilderness appear so
          great to them, that it was continued for so long a time. Their spirits
          failed, they were discouraged, and had not a heart to go through with
          so great an undertaking. But such is this business that it runs
          parallel with life, whether it be longer or shorter. Although we
          should live to a great age, our race and warfare will not be finished
          till death shall come. We must not expect that an end will be put to
          our labor, and care, and strife, by any hope of a good estate which we
          may obtain. Past attainments and past success will not excuse us from
          what remains for the future, nor will they make future constant labor
          and care unnecessary to our salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Men should be willing to engage in and go through this business,
          however great and difficult it may seem to them, seeing it is for
          their own salvation. Because,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. A deluge of wrath will surely come. The inhabitants of the old
          world would not believe that there would come such a flood of waters
          upon the earth as that of which Noah told them, though he told them
          often; neither would they take any care to avoid the destruction. Yet
          such a deluge did come; nothing of all those things of which Noah had
          forewarned them, failed.<br />
          So there will surely come a more dreadful deluge of divine wrath on
          this wicked world. We are often forewarned of it in the Scriptures,
          and the world, as then, doth not believe any such thing. Yet the
          threatening will as certainly be accomplished, as the threatening
          denounced against the old world. A day of wrath is coming; it will
          come at its appointed season; it will not tarry, it<br />
          shall not be delayed one moment beyond its appointed time.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. All such as do not seasonably undertake and go through the great
          work mentioned will surely be swallowed up in this deluge. When the
          floods of wrath shall come, they will universally overwhelm the wicked
          world: all such as shall not have taken care to prepare an ark, will
          surely be swallowed up in it; they will find no other way of escape.
          In vain shall salvation be expected from the hills, and from the
          multitude of mountains; for the flood shall be above the tops of all
          the mountains. Or if they shall hide themselves in the caves and dens
          of the mountains, there the waters of the flood will find them out,
          and there shall they miserably perish. As those of the old world who
          were not in the ark perished, Gen. 7:21, 23, so all who shall not have
          secured to themselves a place in the spiritual ark of the gospel,
          shall perish much more miserably than the old world. Doubtless the
          inhabitants of the old world had many contrivances to save themselves.
          Some, we may suppose, ascended to the tops of their houses, being
          driven out of one story to another, till at last they perished. Others
          climbed to the tops of high towers; who yet were washed thence by the
          boisterous waves of the rising flood. Some climbed to the tops of
          trees; others to the tops of mountains, and especially of the highest
          mountains. But all was in vain; the flood sooner or later swallowed
          them all up; only Noah and his family, who had taken care to prepare
          an ark, remained alive. So it will doubtless be at the end of the
          world, when Christ shall dome to judge the world in righteousness.
          Some, when they shall look up and see him coming in the clouds of
          heaven, shall hide themselves in closets, and secret places in their
          houses. Others flying to the caves and dens of the earth, shall
          attempt to hide themselves there. Others shall call upon the rocks and
          mountains to fall on them, and cover them from the face of him that
          sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.-So it will be
          after the sentence is pronounced, and wicked men see that terrible
          fire coming, which is to burn this world forever, and which will be a
          deluge of fire, and will burn the earth even to the bottoms of the
          mountains, and to its very centre. Deut. 32:22, “For a fire is kindled
          in mine anger, and shall burn to the lowest hell, and shall consume
          the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the
          mountains.” I say, when the wicked shall, after the sentence, see this
          great fire beginning to kindle, and to take hold of this earth; there
          will be many contrivances devised by them to escape, some flying to
          caves and holes in the earth, some hiding themselves in one place, and
          some in another. But let them hide themselves where they will, or let
          them do what they will, it will be utterly in vain. Every cave shall
          burn as an oven, the rocks and mountains shall melt with fervent heat,
          and if they could creep down to the very centre of the earth, still
          the heat would follow them, and rage with as much vehemence there, as
          on the very surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when wicked men, who neglect their great work in their lifetime,
          who are not willing to go through the difficulty and labor of this
          work, draw near to death, they sometimes do many things to escape
          death, and put forth many endeavors to lengthen out their lives at
          least a little longer. For this end, they send for physicians, and
          perhaps many are consulted, and their prescriptions are punctually
          observed. They also use many endeavors to save their souls from hell.
          They cry to God;. they confess their past sins; they promise future
          reformation; and, Oh what would they not give for some small addition
          to their lives, or some hope of future happiness! But all proves in
          vain: God hath numbered their days and finished them; and as they have
          sinned away the day of grace, they must even bear the consequence, and
          forever lie down in sorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The destruction, when it shall come, will be infinitely terrible.
          The destruction of the old world by the flood was terrible; but that
          eternal destruction which is coming on the wicked is infinitely more
          so. That flood of waters was but an image of this awful flood of
          divine vengeance. When the waters poured down, more like spouts or
          cataracts, or the fall of a great river, than like rain; what an awful
          appearance was there of the wrath of God! This however but an image of
          that terrible outpouring of the wrath of God which shall be forever,
          yea forever and ever, on wicked men. And when the fountains of the
          great deep were broken up, and the waters burst forth out of the
          ground though they had issued out of the womb (Job38:8), this was an
          image of the mighty breakings forth of God’s wrath, which shall be,
          when the flood gates of wrath shall be drawn up. How may we suppose
          that the wicked of the old world repented that they had not hearkened
          to the warnings which Noah had given them, when they saw these
          dreadful things, and saw that they must perish! How much more will you
          repent your refusing to hearken to the gracious warnings of the
          gospel, when you shall see the fire of God’s wrath against you,
          pouring down from heaven, and bursting on all sides out of bowels of
          the earth!
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Though the work which is necessary in order to man’s salvation be a
          great work, yet it is not impossible. What was required of Noah,
          doubtless appeared a very great and difficult undertaking. Yet he
          undertook it with resolution, and he was carried through it. So if we
          undertake this work with the same good will and resolution, we shall
          undoubtedly be successful. However difficult it be, yet multitudes
          have gone through it, and have obtained salvation by the means. It is
          not a work beyond the faculties of our nature, nor beyond the
          opportunities which God giveth us. If men will but take warning, and
          hearken to counsel, if they will but be sincere and in good earnest,
          be seasonable in their work, take their opportunities, use their
          advantages be steadfast, and not wavering; they shall not fail.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION.</p>
        <p>
          The use I would make of this doctrine, is to exhort all to undertake
          and go through this great work, which they have to do in order to
          their salvation, and this let the work seem ever so great and
          difficult. If your nature be averse to it, and there seems to be very
          frightful things in the way, so that your heart is ready to fail at
          the prospect; yet seriously consider what has been said, and act a
          wise part. Seeing it is for yourselves, for your own salvation; seeing
          it is for so great a salvation, for your deliverance from eternal
          destruction; and seeing it is of such absolute necessity in order to
          your salvation, that the deluge of divine wrath will come, and there
          will be no escaping it without preparing an ark; is it not best for
          you to undertake the work, engage in it with your might, and go
          through it, though this cannot be done without great labor, care, and
          difficulty, and expense?<br />
          I would by no means flatter you concerning this work, or go about to
          make you believe, that you shall find an easy light business of it:
          no, I would not have you expect any such thing. I would have you sit
          down and count the cost; and if you cannot find it in your hearts to
          engage in a great, hard, laborious, and expensive undertaking, and to
          persevere in it to the end of life, pretend not to be religious.
          Indulge yourselves in your ease; follow your pleasures; eat, drink,
          and be merry; even conclude to go to hell in that way, and never make
          any more pretenses of seeking your salvation. Here consider several
          things in particular.<br />
          1. How often you have been warned of the approaching flood of God’s
          wrath. How frequently you have been told of hell, heard the
          threatenings of the word of God set before you, and been warned to
          flee from the wrath to come. It is with you as it was with the
          inhabitants of the old world. Noah warned them abundantly of the
          approaching flood, and counseled them to take care for their safety, 1
          Pet. 3:19, 20. Noah warned them in words; and he preached to them. He
          warned them also in his actions. His building the ark, which took him
          so long a time, and in which he employed so many hands, was a standing
          warning to them. All the blows of the hammer and axe, during the
          progress of that building, were so many calls and warnings to the old
          world, to take care for their preservation from the approaching
          destruction. Every knock of the workmen was a knock of Jesus Christ at
          the door of their hearts: but they would not hearken. All these
          warnings, though repeated every day, and continued for so long a time,
          availed nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, is it not much so with you, as it was with them? How often have
          you been warned! How have you heard the warning knocks of the gospel,
          Sabbath after Sabbath, for these many years! Yet how have some of you
          no more regarded them than the inhabitants of the old world regarded
          the noise of the workmen’s tools in Noah’s ark!
        </p>
        <p>
          Objection. But here possibly it may be objected by some, that though
          it be true they have often been told of hell, yet they never saw any
          thing of it, and therefore they cannot realize it that there is any
          such place. They have often heard of hell, and are told that wicked
          men, when they die, go to a most dreadful place of torment; that
          hereafter there will be a day of judgment, and that the world will be
          consumed by fire. But how do they know that it is really so? How do
          they know what becomes of those wicked men that die? None of them come
          back to tell them. They have nothing to depend on but the word which
          they hear. And how do they know that all is not a cunningly-devised
          fable?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer. The sinners of the old world had the very same objection
          against what Noah told them of a flood about to drown the world. Yet
          the bare word of God proved to be sufficient evidence that such a
          thing was coming. What was the reason that none of the many millions
          then upon earth believed what Noah said, but this, that it was a
          strange thing, that no such thing had ever before been known? And what
          a strange story must that of Noah have appeared to them, wherein he
          told them of a deluge of waters above the tops of the mountains!
          Therefore it. is said, Heb. 11:7, that “Noah was warned of God of
          things not seen as yet.” It is probable, none could conceive how it
          could be that the whole world should be drowned in a flood of waters;
          and all were ready to ask, where there was water enough for it; and by
          what means it should be brought upon the earth. Noah did not tell them
          how it should be brought to pass; he only told them that God had said
          that it should be: and that proved to be enough. The event showed
          their folly in not depending on the mere word of God, who was able,
          who knew how to bring it to pass, and who could not lie.
        </p>
        <p>
          In like manner the word of God will prove true, in threatening a flood
          of eternal wrath to overwhelm all the wicked. You will believe it when
          the event shall prove it, when it shall be too late to profit by the
          belief. The word of God will never fail; nothing is so sure as that:
          heaven and earth shall pass away, but the word of God shall not pass
          away. It is firmer than mountains of brass. At the end, the vision
          will speak and not lie. The decree shall bring forth, and all wicked
          men shall know that God is the Lord, that he is a God of truth, and
          that they are fools who will not depend on his word. The wicked of the
          old world counted Noah a fool for depending so much on the word of
          God, as to put himself to all the fatigue and expense of building the
          ark; but the event showed that they themselves were the fools, and
          that he was wise.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Consider that the Spirit of God will not always strive with you;
          nor will his long suffering always wait upon you. So God said
          concerning the inhabitants of the old world, Gen. 4:3 “My Spirit shall
          not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh; yet his days
          shall be a hundred and twenty years.” All this while God was striving
          with them. It was a day of grace with them, and God’s long-suffering
          all this while waited upon them: 1 Peter 3:20, “Which sometime were
          disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of
          Noah, while the ark was a preparing.” All this while they had an
          opportunity to escape, if they would but hearken and believe God. Even
          after the ark was finished, which seems to have been but little before
          the flood came, still there was an opportunity; the door of the ark
          stood open for some time. There was some time during which Noah was
          employed in laying up stores in the ark. Even then it was not too
          late; the door of the ark yet stood open.-About a week before the
          flood came, Noah was commanded to begin to gather in the beasts and
          birds. During this last week still the door of the ark stood open. But
          on the very day that the flood began to come, while the rain was yet
          withheld, Noah and his wife, his three sons, and their wives, went
          into the ark; and we are told, Gen. 7:16, that “God shut him in. Then
          the day of God’s patience was past; the door of the ark was shut; God
          himself, who shuts and no man opens, shut the door. Then all hope of
          their escaping the flood was past; it was too late to repent that they
          had not hearkened to Noah’s warnings, and had not entered into the ark
          while the door stood open.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Noah and his family had entered into the ark, and God had shut
          them in, after the windows of heaven were opened, and they saw how the
          waters were poured down out of heaven, we may suppose that many of
          those who were near came running to the door of the ark, knocking, and
          crying most piteously for entrance. But it was too late; God himself
          had shut the door, and Noah had no license, and probably no power, to
          open it. We may suppose, they stood knocking and calling, Open to us,
          open to us; O let us in; we beg that we may be let in. And probably
          some of them pleaded old acquaintance with Noah; that they had always
          been his neighbors, and had even helped him to build the ark. But all
          was in vain. There they stood till the waters of the flood came, and
          without mercy swept them away from the door of the ark.

        <p>
          So it will be with you, if you continue to refuse to hearken to the
          warnings which are given you. Now God is striving with you; now he is
          warning you of the approaching flood, and calling upon you Sabbath
          after Sabbath. Now the door of the ark stands open. But God’s Spirit
          will not always strive with you; his long-suffering will not always
          wait upon you. There is an appointed day of God’s patience, which is
          as certainly limited as it was to the old world. God hath set your
          bounds, which you cannot pass. Though now warnings are continued in
          plenty, yet there will be last knocks and last calls, the last that
          ever you shall hear. When the appointed time shall be elapsed, God
          will shut the door, and you shall never see it open again; for God
          shutteth, and no man openeth.-If you improve not your opportunity
          before that time, you will cry in vain, “Lord, Lord, open to us,”
          Matt. 25:11, and Luke 23:25, &amp;c. While you shall stand at the door
          with your piteous cries, the flood of God’s wrath will come upon you,
          overwhelm you, and you shall not escape. The tempest shall carry you
          away without mercy, and you shall be forever swallowed up and lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Consider how mighty the billows of divine wrath will be when they
          shall come. The waters of Noah’s flood were very great. The deluge was
          vast; it was very deep; the billows reached fifteen cubits above the
          highest mountains; and it was an ocean which had no shore; signifying
          the greatness of that wrath which is coming on wicked men in another
          world, which will be like a mighty flood of waters overwhelming them,
          and rising vastly high over their heads, with billows reaching to the
          very heavens. Those billows will be higher and heavier than mountains
          on their poor souls. The wrath of God will be an ocean without shores,
          as Noah’s flood was: it will be misery that will have no end. The
          misery of the damned in hell can be better represented by nothing,
          than by a deluge of misery, a mighty deluge of wrath, which will be
          ten thousand times worse than a deluge of waters; for it will be a
          deluge of liquid fire, as in the Scriptures it is called a lake of
          fire and brimstone.-At the end of the world all the wicked shall be
          swallowed up in a vast deluge of fire, which shall be as great and as
          mighty as Noah’s deluge of water. See 2 Pet. 3:5, 6, 7. After that the
          wicked will have mighty billows of fire and brimstone eternally
          rolling over their poor souls, and their miserable tormented bodies.
          Those billows may be called vast liquid mountains of fire and
          brimstone. And when one billow shall have gone over their heads,
          another shall follow, without intermission, giving them no rest day
          nor night to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This flood of wrath will probably come upon you suddenly, when you
          all think little of it, and it shall seem far from you. So the flood
          came upon the old world. See Matt. 24:36, &amp;c. Probably many of
          them were surprised in the night by the waters bursting suddenly in at
          their doors, or under the foundations of their houses, coming in upon
          them in their beds. For when the fountains of the great deep were
          broken up, the waters, as observed before, burst forth in mighty
          torrents. To such a sudden surprise of the wicked of the old world in
          the night, probably that alludes in Job 27:20, “Terrors take hold on
          him as waters; a tempest stealeth him away in the night.” So
          destruction is wont to come on wicked men, who hear many warnings of
          approaching destruction, and yet will not be influenced by them. For
          “he that is often reproved, and hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be
          destroyed, and that without remedy,” Prov. xxix. 1. And “when they
          shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them,
          as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape,” 1
          Thess. 5:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. If you will not hearken to the many warnings which are given you of
          approaching destruction, you will be guilty of more than brutish
          madness. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib.”
          They know upon whom they are dependent, and whom they must obey, and
          act accordingly. But you, so long as you neglect your own salvation,
          act as if you knew not God, your Creator and Proprietor, nor your
          dependence upon him. The very beasts, when they see signs of an
          approaching storm, will betake themselves to their dens for shelter.
          Yet you, when abundantly warned of the approaching storm of divine
          vengeance, will not fly to the hiding-place from the storm, and the
          covert from the tempest. The sparrow, the swallow, and other birds,
          when they are forewarned of approaching winter, will betake themselves
          to a safer climate. Yet you who have been often forewarned of the
          piercing blasts of divine wrath, will not, in order to escape them,
          enter into the New Jerusalem, of most mild and salubrious air, though
          the gate stands wide open to receive you. The very ants will be
          diligent in summer to lay up for winter: yet you will do nothing to
          lay up in store a good foundation against the time to come. Balaam’s
          ass would not run upon a drawn sword, though his master, for the sake
          of gain, would expose himself to the sword of God’s wrath; and so God
          made the dumb ass, both in words and actions, to rebuke the madness of
          the prophet, 1 Pet. ii. 16. In like manner, you, although you have
          been oft warned that the sword of God’s wrath is drawn against you,
          and will certainly be thrust through you, if you proceed in your
          present course, still proceed, regardless of the consequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          So God made the very beasts and birds of the old world to rebuke the
          madness of the men of that day: for they, even all sorts of them, fled
          to the ark while the door was yet open: which the men of that day
          refused to do; God hereby, thus signifying, that their folly was
          greater than that of the very brute creatures.-Such folly and madness
          are you guilty of; who refuse to hearken to the warnings that are
          given you of the approaching flood of the wrath of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have been once more warned to-day, while the door of the ark yet
          stands open. You have, as it were, once again heard the knocks of the
          hammer and axe in the building of the ark, to put you in mind that a
          flood is approaching. Take heed therefore that you do not still stop
          your ears, treat these warnings with a regardless heart, and still
          neglect the great work which you have to do lest the flood of wrath
          suddenly come upon you, sweep you away, and there be no remedy.
