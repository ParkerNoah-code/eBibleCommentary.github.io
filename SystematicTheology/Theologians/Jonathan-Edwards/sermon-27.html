        <p>Luke 17:32, “Remember Lot’s wife.”</p>
        <p>
          CHRIST here foretells his coming in his kingdom, in answer to the
          question which the Pharisees asked him, viz. When the kingdom of God
          should come. And in what he says of his coming, he, evidently has
          respect to two things; his coming at the destruction of Jerusalem, and
          his coming at the end of the world. He compares his coming at those
          times to the coming of God in two remarkable judgments that were past.
          First, [he compares] to that in the time of the flood; “and as it was
          in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of
          Man.” Next, he compares it to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah;
          “likewise also, as it was in the days of Lot, even thus shall it be in
          the day when the Son of man is revealed.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he immediately proceeds to direct his people how they should
          behave themselves at the appearance of the signal of that day’s
          approach, referring especially to the destruction of Jerusalem. “In
          that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the
          house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the
          field, let him likewise not return back.” In which words Christ shows
          that they should make the utmost haste to flee and get out of the city
          to the mountains, as he commands. Mat. 24:15, etc. “When ye therefore
          shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the
          prophet stand in the holy place, then let them which be in Judea flee
          to the mountains; let him which is in the housetop not come down to
          take anything out of the house, neither let him which is in the field
          turn back to take his clothes.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Jerusalem was like Sodom, in that it was devoted to destruction by
          special divine wrath; and indeed to a more terrible destruction than
          that of Sodom. Therefore the like direction is given concerning
          fleeing out of it with the utmost haste, without looking behind, as
          the angel gave to Lot, when he bid him flee out of Sodom. Gen. 19:17,
          “Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all
          the plain.” And in the text, Christ enforces his counsel by the
          instance of Lot’s wife. He bids them remember her, and take warning by
          her, who looked back as she was fleeing out of Sodom, and became a
          pillar of salt.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be inquired why Christ gave this direction to his people to flee
          out of Jerusalem, in such exceeding haste, at the first notice of the
          signal of her approaching destruction; I answer, it seems to be,
          because fleeing out of Jerusalem was a type of fleeing out of a state
          of sin. Escaping out of that unbelieving city typified an escape out
          of a state of unbelief. Therefore they were directed to flee without
          staying to take anything out of their houses, to signify with what
          haste and concern we should flee out of a natural condition, that no
          respect to any worldly enjoyment should prevent us one moment, and
          that we should flee to Jesus Christ, the refuge of souls, our strong
          rock, and the mount of our defense, so as, in fleeing to him, to leave
          and forsake heartily all earthly things.
        </p>
        <p>
          This seems to be the chief reason also why Lot was directed to make
          such haste, and not to look behind. Because his fleeing out of Sodom
          was designed on purpose to be a type of our fleeing from that state of
          sin and misery in which we naturally are.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          We ought not to look back when we are fleeing out of Sodom. The
          following reasons may be sufficient to support this doctrine:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That Sodom is a city full of filthiness and abominations. It is
          full of those impurities that ought to be had in the utmost abhorrence
          and detestation by all. The inhabitants of it are a polluted company.
          They are all under the power and dominion of hateful lusts. All their
          faculties and affections are polluted with those wile dispositions
          that are unworthy of the human nature, that greatly debase it, that
          are exceedingly hateful to God, and that dreadfully incense his anger.
          Every kind of spiritual abomination abounds in it. There is nothing so
          hateful and abominable but that there it is to be found, and there it
          abounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sodom is a city full of devils and all unclean spirits. There they
          have their rendezvous, and there they have their dominion. There they
          sport, and wallow in filthiness, as it is said of mystical Babylon,
          Rev. 18:2. Babylon is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of
          every foul spirit, and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird. —
          Who would be of such a society? Who would not flee from such a city
          with the utmost haste, and never look back upon it, and never have the
          least inclination of returning?
        </p>
        <p>
          Some in Sodom may seem to carry a fair face, and make a fair outward
          show. But if we could look into their hearts, they are everyone
          altogether filthy and abominable. We ought to flee from such a city,
          with the utmost abhorrence of the place and society, with no desires
          to dwell longer there, and never to discover the least inclination to
          return to it. But [we] should be desirous to get to the greatest
          possible distance from it, that we might in no wise be partakers in
          her abominations.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We ought not to look back when fleeing out of Sodom, because Sodom
          is a city appointed to destruction. The cry of the city hath reached
          up to heaven. The earth cannot bear such a burden as her inhabitants
          are. She will therefore disburden herself of them, and spew them out.
          God will not suffer such a city to stand; he will consume it. God is
          holy, and his nature is infinitely opposite to all such uncleanness.
          He will therefore be a consuming fire to it. The holiness of God will
          not suffer it to stand, and the majesty and justice of God require
          that the inhabitants of that city who thus offend and provoke him be
          destroyed. And God will surely destroy them. It is the immutable and
          irreversible decree of God. — He hath said it, and he will do it. The
          decree is gone forth, and so sure as there is a God, and he is
          almighty, and able to fulfill his decrees and threatenings, so surely
          will he destroy Sodom. Gen. 19:12, 13, “Whatsoever thou hast in this
          city, bring them out of this place; for we will destroy this place,
          because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord,
          and the Lord has sent us to destroy it.” And in verse 14, “Up, get ye
          out of this place, or the Lord will destroy this city.”
        </p>
        <p>
          This city is an accursed city; it is destined to ruin. — Therefore, as
          we would not be partakers of her curse, and would not be destroyed, we
          should flee out of it, and not look behind us. Rev. 18:4, “Come out of
          her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
          receive not her plagues.”
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We ought not to look back when fleeing out of Sodom, because the
          destruction to which it is appointed is exceedingly dreadful; it is
          appointed to utter destruction, to be wholly and entirely consumed. It
          is appointed to suffer the wrath of the great God, which is to be
          poured down from God upon it, like a dreadful storm of fire and
          brimstone. This city is to be filled full of the wrath of God.
          Everyone that remains in it shall have the fire of God’s wrath come
          down on his head and into his soul. He shall be full of fire and full
          of the wrath of the Almighty. He shall be encompassed with fire
          without and full of fire within. His head, his heart, his bowels, and
          all his limbs shall be full of fire, and not a drop of water to cool
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor shall he have any place to flee to for relief. Go where he will,
          there is the fire of God’s wrath. His destruction and torment will be
          inevitable. — He shall be destroyed without any pity. He shall cry
          aloud, but there shall be none to help, there shall be none to regard
          his lamentations, or to afford relief. The decree is gone forth, and
          the days come when Sodom shall burn as an oven, and all the
          inhabitants thereof shall be as stubble. As it was in the literal
          Sodom, the whole city was full of fire. In their houses there was no
          safety, for they were all on fire. And if they fled out into the
          streets, they also were full of fire. Fire continually came down out
          of heaven everywhere. — That was a dismal time. What a cry was there
          then in that city, in every part of it! But there was none to help.
          They had no where to go where they could hide their heads from fire.
          They had none to pity or relieve them. If they fled to their friends,
          they could not help them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, with what haste should we flee from a city appointed to such a
          destruction! And how should we flee without looking behind us! How
          should it be our whole intent to get at the greatest distance from a
          city in such circumstances! How far should we be from thinking at all
          of returning to a city which has such wrath hanging over it!
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The destruction to which Sodom is appointed is an universal
          destruction. None that stay in it shall escape. None will have the
          good fortune to be in any by-corner, where the fire will not search
          them out. All sorts, old and young, great and small, shall be
          destroyed. There shall be no exception of any age, or any sex, or any
          condition, but all shall perish together. Gen. 19:24, 25, “Then the
          Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the
          Lord out of heaven, and he overthrew those cities and all the plain,
          and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the
          ground.” We therefore must not delay or look behind us; for there is
          no place of safety in Sodom, nor in all the plain on which Sodom is
          built. The mountain of safety is before us, and not behind us.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The destruction to which Sodom is appointed is an everlasting
          destruction. This is said of the literal Sodom, that it suffered the
          vengeance of eternal fire. Jude 7, “Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and
          the cities about them, in like manner, giving themselves over to
          fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an
          example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.” The destruction
          that Sodom and Gomorrah suffered was an eternal destruction. Those
          cities were destroyed, and have never been built since, and are not
          capable of being rebuilt; for the land on which they stood at the time
          of their destruction sunk, and has ever since been covered with the
          lake of Sodom or the Dead sea, or as it is called in Scripture, the
          Salt sea. This seems to have been thus ordered on purpose to be a type
          of the eternal destruction of ungodly men. So that fire by which they
          were destroyed is called eternal fire, because it was so typically, it
          was a type of the eternal destruction of ungodly men; which may be in
          part what is intended, when it is said in that text in Jude, that they
          were set forth for an example, or for a type or representation of the
          eternal fire in which all the ungodly are to be consumed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sodom has in all ages since been covered with a lake which was first
          brought on it by fire and brimstone, to be a type of the lake of fire
          and brimstone in which ungodly men shall have their part forever and
          ever, as we read Rev. 20:15, and elsewhere. — We ought not therefore
          to look back when fleeing out of Sodom, seeing that the destruction to
          which it is appointed is an eternal destruction; for this renders the
          destruction infinitely dreadful.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Sodom is a city appointed to swift and sudden destruction. The
          destruction is not only certain and inevitable, and infinitely
          dreadful, but it will come speedily. “Their judgment lingereth not,
          and their damnation slumbereth not;” 2 Pet. 2:3. And so Deu. 32:35,
          “The day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come
          upon them make haste.” — The storm of wrath, the black clouds of
          divine vengeance, even now every moment hang over them, just ready to
          break forth and come down in a dreadful manner upon them. God hath
          already whet his sword and bent his bow, and made ready his arrow on
          the string, Psa. 7:12. Therefore we should make haste, and not look
          behind us. For if we linger and stop to look back, and flee not for
          our lives, there is great danger that we shall be involved in the
          common ruin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The destruction of Sodom is not only swift, but will come suddenly and
          unexpectedly. — It seems to have been a fair morning in Sodom before
          it was destroyed, Gen. 19:23. It seems that there were no clouds to be
          seen, no appearance of any storm at all, much less of a storm of fire
          and brimstone. The inhabitants of Sodom expected no such thing. Even
          when Lot told his sons-in-law of it, they would not believe it, Gen.
          19:14. — They were making merry. Their hearts were at ease, they
          though nothing of such a calamity at hand. But it came at once, as
          travail upon a woman with child, and there was no escaping. As verse
          28, 29 [says], “They did eat, they drank; they bought, they sold; they
          planted, they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom, it
          rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So it is with wicked men. Psa. 73:19, “How are they brought into
          desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.” — If
          therefore we linger and look back, we may be suddenly overtaken and
          seized with destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. There is nothing in Sodom that is worth looking back upon. All
          the enjoyments of Sodom will soon perish in the common destruction;
          all will be burnt up. And surely it is not worth the while to look
          back on things that are perishing and consuming in the flames, as it
          is with all the enjoyments of sin. They are all appointed to the fire.
          Therefore it is foolish for any who are fleeing out of Sodom to hanker
          any more after them. For when they are burnt up, what good can they
          do? And is it worth the while for us to return back for the sake of a
          moment’s enjoyment of them, before they are burnt, and so expose
          ourselves to be burnt up with them?
        </p>
        <p>
          Lot’s wife looked back, because she remembered the pleasant things
          that she left in Sodom. She hankered after them. She could not but
          look back with a wishful eye upon the city, where she had lived in
          such ease and pleasure. Sodom was a place of great outward plenty.
          They ate the fat, and drank the sweet. The soil about Sodom was
          exceedingly fruitful. It is said to be as the garden of God, Gen.
          13:10. And fullness of bread was one of the sins of the place, Eze.
          16:49.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here Lot and his wife lived plentifully; and it was a place where the
          inhabitants wallowed in carnal pleasures and delights. But however
          much it abounded in these things, what were they worth now, when the
          city was burning? Lot’s wife was very foolish in lingering in her
          escape, for the sake of things which were all on fire. — So the
          enjoyments, the profits, and pleasures of sin, have the wrath and
          curse of God on them. Brimstone is scattered on them. Hell-fire is
          ready to kindle on them. It is not therefore worth while for any
          person to look back after such things.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. We are warned by messengers sent to us from God to make haste in
          our flight from Sodom, and not to look behind us. God sends to us his
          ministers, the angels of the churches, on this grand errand, as he
          sent the angels to warn Lot and his wife to flee for their lives, Gen.
          19:15, 16. — If we delay or look back, now that we have had such fair
          warning, we shall be exceedingly inexcusable and monstrously foolish.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          The use that I would make of this doctrine, is to warn those who are
          in a natural condition to flee out of it, and by no means to look
          back. While you are out of Christ you are in Sodom. The whole history
          of the destruction of Sodom, with all its circumstances, seems to be
          inserted in the Scriptures for our warning, and is set forth for an
          example, as the apostle Jude says; It in a lively manner typifies the
          case of natural men, the destruction of those that continue in a
          natural state, and the manner of their escape who flee to Christ. The
          psalmist, when speaking of the appointed punishment of ungodly men,
          seems evidently to refer to the destruction of Sodom. Psa. 11:6, “Upon
          the wicked God shall rain snares, fire, and brimstone, and a horrible
          tempest: This shall be the portion of their cup.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider therefore, you that are seeking an interest in Christ, you
          are to flee out of Sodom. Sodom is the place of your nativity, and the
          place where you have spent your lives. You are citizens of that city
          which is full of filthiness and abomination before God, that polluted
          and accursed city. You belong to that impure society. You not only
          live among them, but you are of them, you have committed those
          abominations, and have so provoked God as you have heard. It is you
          that I have all this while been speaking of under this doctrine. You
          are the inhabitants of Sodom. Perhaps you may look on your
          circumstances as not very dreadful; but you dwell in Sodom. — Though
          you may be reformed, and appear with a clean outside, and a smooth
          face to the world; yet as long as you are in a natural condition, you
          are impure inhabitants of Sodom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world of mankind is divided into two companies, or, as I may say,
          into two cities. There is the city of Zion, the church of God, the
          holy and the beloved city. And there is Sodom, that polluted and
          accursed city, which is appointed to destruction. You belong to the
          latter of these. How much soever you may look upon yourselves as
          better than some others, you are of the same city; the same company
          with fornicators, and drunkards, and adulterers, and common swearers,
          and highwaymen, and pirates, and Sodomites. How much soever you may
          think yourselves distinguished, as long as you are out of Christ, you
          belong to the very same society. You are of the company, you join with
          them, and are no better than they, any otherwise than as you have
          greater restraints. You are considered in the sight of God as fit to
          be ranked with them. You and they are altogether the objects of
          loathing and abhorrence, and have the wrath of God abiding on you. You
          will go with them and be destroyed with them, if you do not escape
          from your present state. Yea, you are of the same society and the same
          company with the devils, for Sodom is not only the city of wicked men,
          but it is the hold of every foul spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          You belong to that city which is appointed to an awful, inevitable,
          universal, swift, and sudden destruction; a city that hath a storm of
          fire and wrath hanging over it. Many of you are convinced of the awful
          state you are in while in Sodom, and are making some attempts to
          escape from the wrath which hangs over it. Let such be warned by what
          has been said, to escape for their lives, and not to look back. Look
          not back, unless you choose to have a share in the burning tempest
          that is coming down on that city. — Look not back in remembrance of
          the enjoyments which you have had in Sodom, as hankering after the
          pleasant things which you have had there, after the ease, the
          security, and the pleasure which you have there enjoyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember Lot’s wife, for she looked back, as being loth utterly and
          forever to leave the ease, the pleasure, and plenty which she enjoyed
          in Sodom, and as having a mind to return to them again; remember what
          became of her. — Remember the children of Israel in the wilderness,
          who were desirous of going back again into Egypt. Num. 11:5, “We
          remember the flesh which we did eat in Egypt freely, the cucumbers,
          and the melons, and the leeks and onions, and the garlick.” Remember
          what was the issue. You must be willing forever to leave all the ease,
          and pleasure, and profit of sin, to forsake all the salvation, as Lot
          forsook all, and left all he had, to escape out of Sodom.
        </p>
        <p>
          And further to enforce this warning, let me entreat all you who are in
          this state to consider the several things which I shall now mention.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The destruction of which you are in danger is infinitely more
          dreadful than that destruction of the literal Sodom from which Lot
          fled. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in a storm of fire and
          brimstone was but a shadow of the destruction of ungodly men in hell,
          and is no more to it than a shadow or a picture is to a reality, or
          than painted fire is to real fire. The misery of hell is set forth by
          various shadows and images in Scripture, as blackness of darkness, a
          never-dying worm, a furnace of fire, a lake of fire and brimstone, the
          torments of the valley of the son of Hinnom, a storm of fire and
          brimstone. The reason why so many similitudes are used is because none
          of them are sufficient. Anyone does but partly and very imperfectly
          represent the truth, and therefore God makes use of many.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have therefore much more need to make haste in your escape, and
          not look behind you, than Lot and his wife had when they fled out of
          Sodom. For you are every day and every moment in danger of a thousand
          times more dreadful storm coming on your heads, than that which came
          on Sodom, when the Lord rained brimstone and fire from the Lord out of
          heaven upon them. So that it will be vastly more sottish in you to
          look back than it was in Lot’s wife.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The destruction of which you are in danger is not only greater
          than the temporal destruction of Sodom, but greater than the eternal
          destruction of the inhabitants of Sodom. For however well you may
          think you have behaved yourselves, you who have continued impenitent
          under the glorious gospel, have sinned more, and provoked God far
          more, and have greater guilt upon you, than the inhabitants of Sodom;
          although you may seem to yourselves, and perhaps to others, to be very
          harmless creatures. Mat. 10:15, “Verily I say unto you, it shall be
          more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for
          that city.”
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Multitudes, while they have been looking back, have been suddenly
          overtaken and seized by the storm of wrath. The wrath of God hath not
          delayed, while they have delayed; it has not waited at all for them to
          turn about and flee; but has presently seized them, and they have been
          past hope. When Lot’s wife looked back, she was immediately destroyed.
          God had exercised patience toward her before. When she lingered at the
          setting out, the angels pressed her, and her husband and children, to
          make haste. Not only so, but when they yet delayed, they brought her
          forth, and set her without the city, the Lord being merciful to her.
          But now when, notwithstanding this mercy, and the warnings which had
          been given her, she looked back, God exercised no more patience
          towards her, but proceeded immediately to put her to death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now God has in like manner been merciful to you. You in time past have
          been lingering; you have been warned by the angel of your danger, and
          pressed to make haste and flee; yet you have delayed. And now at
          length God hath as it were laid hold on you, by the convictions of his
          spirit, to draw you out of Sodom; and therefore remember Lot’s wife.
          If now, after all, you should look back, when God hath been so
          merciful to you, you will have reason to fear, that God will suddenly
          destroy you. Multitudes, when they have been looking back, and putting
          off to another time, have never had another opportunity; they have
          been suddenly destroyed, and that without remedy.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. If you look back, and live long after it, there will be great
          danger that you will never get any further. The only way to seek
          salvation is to press forward with all your might, and still to look
          and press forward, never to stand still or slacken your pace. When
          Lot’s wife stopped in her flight and stood still in order that she
          might look, her punishment was, that there she was to stand forever;
          she never got any further; she never got beyond that place. But there
          she stood as a pillar of salt, a durable pillar and monument of wrath,
          for her folly and wickedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it was very often with backsliders, though they may live a
          considerable time after. When they look back, after they have been
          taking pains for their salvation, they lose all, they put themselves
          under vast disadvantages. By quenching the Spirit of God, and losing
          their convictions, they dreadfully harden their own hearts, and
          stupefy their souls. They make way for discouragements, dreadfully
          strengthen and establish the interest of sin in their hearts, many
          ways give Satan great advantages to ruin them, and provoke God
          oftentimes utterly to leave them to hardness of heart. When they come
          to look back, their souls presently become dead and hard like the body
          of Lot’s wife. And though they live long after, they never get any
          further. It is worse for them than if they were immediately damned.
          When persons in fleeing out of Sodom look back, their last case is far
          worse than the first; Mat. 12:43, 44, 45. And experience confirms,
          that none ordinarily are so hard to be brought to penance as
          backsliders.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. It may well stir you up to flee for your lives, and not to look
          behind you, when you consider how many have lately fled to the
          mountains, while you yet remain in Sodom. To what multitudes hath God
          given the wisdom to flee to Christ, the mountain of safety! They have
          fled to the little city Zoar, which God will spare and never destroy.
          How many have you seen of all sorts resorting out of Sodom thither, as
          believing the Word of God by the angels, that God would surely destroy
          that place. They are in a safe condition. They are got out of the
          reach of the storm. The fire and brimstone can do them no hurt there.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you yet remain in that cursed city among that accursed company.
          You are yet in Sodom, which God is about so terribly to destroy, where
          you are in danger every minute of having snares, fire, and brimstone,
          come down on your head. — Though so many have obtained, yet you have
          not obtained deliverance. Good has come but you have seen none of it.
          Others are happy, but no man knows what will become of you. You have
          no part nor lot in the glorious salvation of souls, which has lately
          been among us. — The consideration of this should stir you up
          effectually to escape, and in your escape to press forward — still to
          press forward — and to resolve to press forward forever, let what will
          be in the way, to hearken to no temptation, and never to look back, or
          in any wise slacken or abate your endeavors as long as you live, but
          if possible to increase in them more and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Backsliding after such a time as this, *1* will have a vastly
          greater tendency to seal a man’s damnation than at another time. The
          greater means men have, the louder calls and the greater advantages
          they are under, the more dangerous is backsliding, the more it has a
          tendency to enhance guilt, to provoke God, and to harden the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          We, in this land of light, have long enjoyed greater advantages than
          most of the world. But the advantages which persons are under now for
          their salvation, are perhaps tenfold what they have been at such times
          as we have ordinarily lived in. And backsliding will be proportionably
          the greater sin, and the more dangerous to the soul. You have seen
          God’s glory and his wonders amongst us, in a most marvelous manner. —
          If therefore you look back after this, there will be great danger that
          God will swear in his wrath, that you shall never enter into his rest;
          as God sware concerning them that were for going back into Egypt,
          after they had seen the wonders which God wrought for Israel. Num.
          14:22, 23, “Because all those men that have seen my glory and my
          miracles that I did in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and have tempted
          me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; surely
          they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither
          shall any of them that provoked me see it.” — The wonders that we have
          seen among us of late, have been of a more glorious nature than those
          that the children of Israel saw in Egypt and in the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. We know not but that great part of the wicked world are, at this
          day, in Sodom’s circumstances, when Lot fled out of it; having some
          outward, temporal destruction hanging over it. It looks as if some
          great thing were coming; the state of things in the world seems to be
          ripe for some great revolution. The world has got to such a terrible
          degree of wickedness, that it is probable the cry of it has reached up
          to heaven. And it is hardly probable that God will suffer things to go
          on, as they now do, much longer. It is likely that God will ere long
          appear in awful majesty to vindicate his own cause. And then none will
          be safe that are out of Christ. Now therefore everyone should flee for
          his life, and escape to the mountain, lest he be consumed. We cannot
          certainly tell what God is about to do, but this we may know, that
          those who are out of Christ are in a most unsafe state.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. To enforce this warning against looking back, let me beseech you
          to consider the exceeding proneness to it there is in the heart. The
          heart of man is a backsliding heart. There is in the heart a great
          love and hankering desire after the ease, pleasure, and enjoyments of
          Sodom, as there was in Lot’s wife, by which persons are continually
          liable to temptations to look back. The heart is so much towards
          Sodom, that it is a difficult thing to keep the eye from turning that
          way, and the feet from tending thither. When men under convictions are
          put upon fleeing, it is a mere force. It is because God lays hold on
          their hands, as he did on Lot’s and his wife’s, and drags them so far.
          But the tendency of the heart is to go back to Sodom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Persons are very prone to backsliding also through discouragement. The
          heart is unsteady, soon tired, and apt to listen to discouraging
          temptations. A little difficulty and delay soon overcome its feeble
          resolutions. And discouragement tends to backsliding. It weakens
          persons’ hands, lies as a dead weight on their hearts, and makes them
          drag heavily; and if it continue long, it very often issues insecurity
          and senselessness. Convictions are often shaken off that way. They
          begin first to go off with discouragement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Backsliding is a disease that is exceeding secret in its way of
          working. It is a flattering distemper. It works like a consumption,
          wherein persons often flatter themselves that they are not worse, but
          something better, and in a hopeful way to recover, till a few days
          before they die. So backsliding commonly comes on gradually, and
          steals on men insensibly, and they still flatter themselves that they
          are not backslidden. — They plead that they are seeking yet, and they
          hope they have not lost their convictions. And by the time they find
          it out, and cannot pretend so any longer, they are commonly so far
          gone, that they care not much if they have lost their convictions. And
          when it is come to that, it is commonly a gone case as to those
          convictions. Thus they blind themselves, and keep themselves
          insensible of their own disease, and so are not terrified with it, nor
          awakened to use means for relief, till it is past cure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is that backsliding commonly comes upon persons that have for
          some time been under any considerable convictions, and afterwards lose
          them. Let the consideration of this your danger excite you to the
          greatest care and diligence to keep your hearts, and to watchfulness
          and constant prayer against backsliding. And let it put you upon
          endeavors to strengthen your resolutions of guarding against
          everything that tends to the contrary, that you may indeed hold out to
          the end, for then shall you know, if you follow on to know the Lord.
