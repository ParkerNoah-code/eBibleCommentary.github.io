          Ezekiel 15:2-4, “Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree?
          Or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest? Shall wood be
          taken thereof to do any work? Or will men take a pin of it to hang any
          vessel thereon? Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; The fire
          devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burnt: Is it
          meet for any work?”
        </p>
        <p>
          The visible church of God is here compared to the vine tree, as is
          evident by God’s own explanation of the allegory, in verses 6, 7, and
          8. “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, As the vine tree among the
          trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will
          I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem,” &amp;c. And it may be understood
          of mankind in general. We find man often in scripture compared to a
          vine. So in chapter 32 of Deuteronomy, “Their vine is the vine of
          Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of
          gall.” And Psalm 53:8. “Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt;” verse
          14. “Look down from heaven, behold, and visit this vine.” And Song of
          Solomon 2:15. “The foxes that spoil the vines; for our vines have
          tender grapes.” Isaiah v. at the beginning, “My beloved hath a
          vineyard, and he planted it with the choicest vine.” Jeremiah 2:2l. “I
          had planted thee a noble vine.” Hosea 10:1. “Israel is an empty vine.”
          So in chapter 15 of John, visible Christians are compared to the
          branches of a vine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Man is very fitly represented by the vine. The weakness and dependence
          of the vine on other things which support it, well represents to us
          what a poor, feeble, dependent creature man is, and how, if left to
          himself, he must fall into mischief, and cannot help himself. The
          visible people of God are fitly compared to a vine, because of the
          care and cultivation of the husbandman, or vine dresser. The business
          of husbandmen in the land of Israel was very much in their vineyards,
          about vines; and the care they exercised to fence them, to defend
          them, to prune them, to prop them up, and to cultivate them, well
          represented that merciful care which God exercises towards his visible
          people; and this latter is often in scripture expressly compared to
          the former.
        </p>
        <p>In the words now read is represented,</p>
        <p>
          1. How wholly useless and unprofitable, even beyond other trees, a
          vine is, in case of unfruitfulness: “What is a vine tree more than any
          tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?” i.e.
          if it do not bear fruit. Men make much more of a vine than of other
          trees; they take great care of it, to wall it in, to dig about it, to
          prune it, and the like. It is much more highly esteemed than any one
          of the trees of the forest; they are despised in comparison with it.
          And if it bear fruit, it is indeed much preferable to other trees; for
          the fruit of it yields a noble liquor; as it is said in Jotham’s
          parable, Judges 9:13. “And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my
          wine, which cheereth God and man?”<br />
          But if it bear no fruit, it is more unprofitable than the trees of the
          forest; for the wood of them is good for timber; but the wood of the
          vine is fit for no work; as in the text, “Shall wood be taken thereof
          to do any work? Or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel
          thereon?”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The only thing for which a vine is useful, in case of barrenness,
          viz. for fuel: “Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel.” It is
          wholly consumed; no part of it is worth a saving, to make any
          instrument of it, for any work.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE.</p>
        <p>
          If men bring forth no fruit to God, they are wholly useless, unless in
          their destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the proof of this doctrine, I shall show,<br />
          1. That it is very evident, that there can be but two ways in which
          man can be useful, viz. either in acting, or in being acted upon, and
          disposed of.<br />
          2. That man can no otherwise be useful actively than by bringing forth
          fruit to God.<br />
          3. That if he bring not forth fruit to God, there is no other way in
          which he can be passively useful, but in being destroyed.<br />
          4. In that way he may be useful without bearing fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. There are but two ways in which man can be useful, viz. either in
          acting or being acted upon. If man be an useful sort of creature, he
          must be so either actively or passively: There is no medium. If he be
          useful to any purpose, he must be so either in acting himself, or else
          in being disposed of by some other; either in doing something himself
          to that purpose, or else in having something done upon him by some
          other to that purpose. What can be more plain, than that if man do
          nothing himself, and nothing be done with him or upon him by any
          other, he cannot be any way at all useful? If man do nothing himself
          to promote the end of his existence, and no other being do any thing
          with him to promote this end, then nothing will be done to promote
          this end; and so man must be wholly useless. So that there are but two
          ways in which man can be useful to any purpose, viz. either actively
          or passively, either in doing something himself, or in being the
          subject of something done to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Man cannot be useful actively, any otherwise than in bringing
          forth fruit to God, than in serving God, and living to his glory. This
          is the only way wherein he can be useful in doing; and that for this
          reason, that the glory of God is the very thing for which man was
          made, and to which all other ends are subordinate. Man is not an
          independent being, but he derives his being from another; and
          therefore hath his end assigned him by that other: And he that gave
          him his being, made him for the end now mentioned. This was the very
          design and aim of the Author of man, this was the work for which he
          made him, viz. to serve and glorify his Maker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other creatures are made for inferior purposes. Inferior creatures
          were made for inferior purposes. But it is to be observed, that man is
          the creature that is highest, and nearest to God, of any in this lower
          world; and therefore his business is with God, although other
          creatures are made for lower ends. There my be observed a kind of
          gradation, or gradual ascent, in the order of the different kinds of
          creatures, from the meanest clod of earth to man, who hath a rational
          and immortal soul. A plant, an herb, or tree, is superior in nature to
          a stone or clod, because it hath a vegetable life. The brute creatures
          are a degree higher still; for they have sensitive life. But man,
          having a rational soul, is the highest of this lower creation, and is
          next to God; therefore his business is with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things without life, as earth, water, &amp;c. are subservient to
          things above them, as the grass, herbs and trees. These vegetables are
          subservient to that order of creatures which is next above them, the
          brute creation; they are for food to them. Brute creatures, again, are
          made for the use and service of the order above them; they are made
          for the service of mankind. But man being the highest of this lower
          creation, the next step from him is to God. He therefore is made for
          the service and glory of God. This is the whole work and business of
          man; it is his highest end, to which all other ends are subordinate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it had not been for this end, there never would have been any such
          sort of creature as man; there would have been no occasion for it.
          Other inferior ends may be answered as well, without any such creature
          as man. There would have been no sort of occasion for making so noble
          a creature, and endowing him with such faculties, only to enjoy
          earthly good, to eat, and to drink, and to enjoy sensual things. Brute
          creatures, without reason, are capable of these things, as well as
          man; Yea, if no higher end be aimed at than to enjoy sensitive good,
          reason is rather an hindrance than an help. It doth but render man the
          more capable of afflicting himself with care, and fears of death, and
          other future evils, and of vexing himself with many anxieties, from
          which brute creatures are wholly free, and therefore can gratify their
          senses with less molestation. Besides, reason doth but make men more
          capable of molesting and impeding one another in the gratification of
          their senses. If man have no other end to seek but to gratify his
          senses, reason is nothing but an impediment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore if man be not made to serve and glorify his Creator, it is
          wholly to no purpose that such a creature is made. Doubtless then the
          all wise God, who doth all things in infinite wisdom, hath made man
          for this end. And this is agreeable to what he hath taught us in many
          places in the scriptures. This is the great end for which man was
          made, and for which he was made such a creature as he is, having a
          body and soul, bodily senses, and rational powers. For this is he
          placed in such circumstances as he is, and the earth is given him for
          a possession. For this he hath dominion given him over the rest of the
          creatures of this world. For this the sun shines on him, and the moon
          and stars are for signs and seasons to him, and the rain falls on him,
          and the earth yields him her increase.
        </p>
        <p>
          All other ends of man are subordinate to this. There are inferior ends
          for which man was made. Men were made for one another; made for their
          friends and neighbors, and for the good of the public. But all these
          inferior ends are designed to be subordinate to the higher end of
          glorifying God; and therefore man cannot be actively useful, or
          actively answer any purpose, otherwise than by actively glorifying
          God, or bringing forth fruit to God. Because,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That is not actively useful which doth not actively answer its end.
          That which doth not answer its end is in vain; for that is the meaning
          of the proposition, that any thing is in vain. So that which doth not
          actively answer its end, is, as to its own activity, in vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That is as to its own activity altogether useless which actively
          answers only subordinate ends, without answering the ultimate end; and
          that because the ultimate end is the end of subordinate ends. The
          notion of a supreme end is, that it is the end of all inferior ends.
          Subordinate ends are to no purpose, only as they stand related to the
          highest end. The very notion of a subordinate end is, that it is in
          order to a further end. Therefore these inferior ends are good for
          nothing though they be obtained, unless they also obtain their end.
          Inferior ends are not aimed at for their own sake, but only for the
          sake of the ultimate end. Therefore he that fails of his great end of
          all, doth as much altogether fail of his end, and is as much to no
          purpose, as if he did not obtain his subordinate end.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will illustrate this by two or three examples. The subordinate end
          of the underpinning of an house is to support the house; and the
          subordinate end of the windows is to let in the light. But the
          ultimate end of the whole is the benefit of the inhabitants.
          Therefore, if the house be never inhabited, the whole is in vain. The
          underpinning is in vain, though it be ever so strong and support the
          building ever so well. The windows also are wholly in vain, though
          they be ever so large and clear, and though they obtain the
          subordinate end of letting in the light: They are as much in vain, as
          if they let in no light.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the subordinate end of the husbandman in ploughing and sowing, and
          well manuring his field is, that it may bring forth a crop. But his
          more ultimate end is, that food may be provided for him and his
          family. Therefore though his inferior end be obtained, and his field
          bring forth ever so good a crop, yet if after all it be consumed by
          fire, or otherwise destroyed, he ploughed and sowed his field as much
          in vain, as if the seed had never sprung up.<br />
          So if man obtain his subordinate ends ever so fully; yet if he
          altogether fail of his ultimate end, he is wholly an useless creature.
          Thus if men be very useful in temporal things to their families, or
          greatly promote the temporal interest of the neighborhood, or of the
          public; yet if no glory be brought to God by it, they are altogether
          useless. If men actively bring no glory to God, they are, as to their
          own activity, altogether useless, how much soever they may promote the
          benefit of one another. How much soever one part of mankind may
          subserve another; yet if the end of the whole be not answered, every
          part is useless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus if the parts of a clock subserve ever so well one to another,
          mutually to assist each other in their motions; one wheel moving
          another ever so regularly; yet if the motion never reach the hand or
          the hammer, it is altogether in vain, as much as if it stood still. As
          in a clock one wheel moves another, and that another, till at last the
          motion comes to the hand and hammer, which immediately respect the eye
          and the ear, otherwise all the motions are in vain; so it is in the
          world, one man was made to be useful to another, and one part of
          mankind to another; but the use of the whole is to bring glory to God
          the maker or else all is in vain; and however a man may serve among
          his fellow creatures, in a private or public capacity, upon the whole
          he is in vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may perhaps be objected, that a wicked man may, by being
          serviceable to the public, be useful to many who do bring forth fruit
          to God, and thus glorify him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer 1. If he be so, he is no further useful than he brings glory to
          God. It all hath an ultimate respect to that glory that is brought to
          God, and is useful no further; as the motion of no one wheel of a
          clock is any further useful, than as it finally respects the right
          pointing of the hand, and striking of the hammer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer 2. When it is thus, wicked men are useful only accidentally,
          and not designedly. Although a wicked man may, by being serviceable to
          good men, do what will be an advantage to them to their bringing forth
          fruit to God; yet that serviceableness is not what he aims at; this is
          not his end; he doth not look so far for an ultimate end. And how ever
          this end be obtained, no thanks are due to him; it is as to him
          accidental. He is only the occasion, and not the designing cause of
          it. That fruit which is brought forth to the glory of God, is not
          brought forth by him, but by others.<br />
          The usefulness of such a man, being not designed, is not to be
          attributed to him as though it were his fruit. He is not useful as a
          man, or as a rational creature, because he is not so designedly. He is
          useful as things without life may be. Things without life may he
          useful to put the godly under advantages to bring forth fruit, as the
          timber and stones with which his house is built, the wool and flax
          with which he is clothed; but the fruit which is brought forth to
          God’s glory, cannot be said for all that to be the fruit of these
          lifeless things, but of the godly man who makes use of them. So it is
          when wicked men put the godly under advantages to glorify God, as
          Cyrus, and Artaxerxes, and others have done.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. If men bring not forth fruit to God, there is no other way in
          which they can be useful passively, but in being destroyed. They are
          fit for nothing else.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They are not fit to be suffered to continue always in this world.
          God suffers them to live for the present, but it is only for a certain
          season. They are here in a transitory state. It is not fit that this
          world should be the constant abode of those who bring forth no fruit
          to God. It is not fit that the barren tree should be allowed always to
          stand in the vineyard. The husbandman lets it stand for a while, till
          he digs about it, dungs it, and proves it to be incurable, or till a
          convenient time to cut it down come; but it is not fit that such a
          tree should stand here always. It is not fit that they who bring forth
          no fruit to God, should be suffered to live always in a world which is
          so full of the goodness of God, or that his goodness should be spent
          upon them forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          This world, though it is fallen, and is under a curse, and is a
          miserable place to what it once was, yet is full of the streams of
          divine goodness. But it is not fit that those who bring forth no fruit
          to God, should always be continued in partaking of these streams.
          There are these three different states ; a state wherein is nothing
          but good, which is the state of the blessed in heaven; a state wherein
          is a mixture of good and evil, which is the earthly state ; and a
          state wherein is nothing but evil, which is the state of eternal
          destruction and damnation. Now they that bring forth no fruit to God,
          are not fit for either of the former; it is not fit that they should
          be continued in the enjoyment of any of the goodness of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not fit that an unprofitable, unfruitful creature, who will not
          glorify his Creator, should always live here to devour the fruits of
          the earth, and consume the fruits of divine bounty; to have the good
          things of this life, as God’s wool and his flax, his corn, and wine,
          and oil, spent with him in vain. While a man lives in this world, the
          other creatures of the world are subjected to him. The brute creatures
          serve him with their labor and with their lives. The sun, moon, and
          stars, the clouds, fields and trees, all serve him. But it is not fit
          that these creatures should always be made to serve him, who brings
          forth no fruit to the Creator. Why should God always keep his
          creatures in subjection to that man, who will not be subject to him?
          Why should the creation be always kept in such bondage, as to be
          subject to wicked men? The creatures are made subject to vanity for a
          little time; God hath subjected them to wicked men, and given them for
          their use. This however he would not have done, but as it is only for
          a little while; and the creatures can bear it through the hope of
          approaching deliverance; and otherwise it would have been intolerable.
          Romans 8:20. “For the creature was made subject to vanity, not
          willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The creature doth, as it were, groan by reason of this subjection to
          wicked men, although it be but for a while. Romans 8:22. “For we know
          that the whole creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together
          until now.” Therefore surely it would be no way fit that wicked men,
          who do no good, and bring forth no fruit to God, should live here
          always, to have the various creatures subservient to them, as they are
          now. The earth can scarcely bear wicked men during that short time for
          which they stay here, but is ready to spew thee out. It is no way fit,
          therefore, that it should be forced to bear them always.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men who bring forth no fruit to God are cumberers of the ground. Luke
          13:7 “And it is not meet that they should be suffered to cumber the
          ground always.” God cannot be glorified in this way of disposing of
          unfruitful persons. If such men should be suffered to live always in
          such a state as this, it would be so far from being to the glory of
          God, that it would be to the disparagement of the wisdom of God, to
          continue them in a state so unsuitable for them, forever spending the
          fruits of his bounty in vain upon them. It would also be a
          disparagement to his justice; for this is a world where, “all things
          come alike to all, and there is one event to the righteous and to the
          wicked.” If there were no other state but this for wicked men to be
          in, justice could not possibly take place. It would also reflect upon
          the holiness of God. Forever to uphold this world for an habitation of
          such persons, and forever to continue the communications of his bounty
          and goodness to them, would appear as though he were disposed to
          countenance and encourage sin and wickedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If men do not bring forth fruit to God, they are not fit to be
          disposed of in heaven. Heaven, above all others, is the most improper
          place for them. Every thing appertaining to that state is unsuitable
          for them. The company is most unsuitable. The original inhabitants of
          that world are the angels. But what a disagreeable union would that
          be, to unite wicked men and angels in the same society? The
          employments of that world are unsuitable. The employments are serving
          and glorifying God. How unsuitable then would it be to plant barren
          trees in that heavenly paradise, trees that would bring forth no fruit
          to the divine glory? The enjoyments of heaven are unsuitable. The
          enjoyments are holy and spiritual enjoyments, the happiness of
          beholding the glory of God, and praising his name, and the like. But
          these enjoyments are as unsuitable as can be to the carnal earthly
          minds of wicked men. They would be no enjoyments to them; but on the
          contrary would be most disagreeable, and what they cannot relish, but
          entirely nauseate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design of heaven is unsuitable to them. The design of God in
          making heaven was, that it might be a place of holy habitation, for
          the reward of the righteous, and not an habitation for wicked men. It
          would greatly reflect on the wisdom of God to dispose of wicked men
          there; for it would be the greatest confusion. But God is not the
          author of confusion, I Corinthians 14:33. It would be contrary to the
          holiness of God, to take wicked men so near to himself into his
          glorious presence, to dwell forever in that part of the creation which
          is, as it were, his own palace, and to sit at his table. We read in
          Psalm 5:4. “Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness,
          neither shall evil dwell with thee.” Therefore it would doubtless be
          impossible that the end of the existence of wicked men should be in
          any wise answered by the placing of them in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Men who bring forth no fruit to God, yet in suffering destruction
          may be useful. Although they be not useful actively, or by any thing
          which they do; yet they may be useful in what they may suffer; just as
          a barren tree, which is no way useful standing in the vineyard, yet
          may be good fuel, and be very useful in the fire. God can find use for
          the most wicked men; he hath his use for vessels of wrath as well as
          for vessels of mercy; as in an house there is use for vessels unto
          dishonor, as well as for vessels unto honor. 2 Timothy 2:0. “In a
          great house there are not only vessels of gold, and of silver, but
          also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.”
          Proverbs 16:4. “The Lord hath made all things for himself; yea, even
          the wicked for the day of evil.” I shall briefly take notice of what
          ends God accomplishes by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Unfruitful persons are of use in their destruction for the glory of
          God’s justice. It was the will of God to glorify his justice, as well
          as his mercy, on his creatures. The vindictive justice of God is a
          glorious attribute, as well as his mercy; and the glory of this
          attribute appears in the everlasting destruction and ruin of the
          barren and unfruitful.<br />
          The glory of divine justice in the perdition of ungodly men appears
          wonderful and glorious in the eyes of the saints and angels in heaven.
          Hence we have an account, that they sing praises to God, and extol his
          justice at the sight of the awful judgments which he inflicts on
          wicked men. Revelation 16:5, “Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art
          and wast, and art to come, because thou hast judged thus; for they
          have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them
          blood to drink; for they are worthy:” And Revelation 19:1, 2: “And
          after these things I heard a great voice, saying, Alleluia: Salvation,
          and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God; for true and
          righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great whore, which
          did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood
          of his servants at her hand.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Unfruitful persons in their destruction are of use for God to
          glorify his majesty upon them. The awful majesty of God remarkably
          appears in those dreadful and amazing punishments which he inflicts on
          those who rise up against him, and contemn him. A sense of the majesty
          of an earthly prince is supported very much by a sense of its being a
          dreadful thing to affront him. God glorifies his own majesty in the
          destruction of wicked men; and herein he appears infinitely great, in
          that it appears to be an infinitely dreadful thing to offend him. How
          awful doth the majesty of God appear in the dreadfulness of his anger!
          This we may learn to be one end of the damnation of the wicked, from
          Romans 9:22. “What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his
          power known, endured with much long suffering the vessels of wrath
          fitted to destruction?”<br />
          It is often spoken of God, that he is a terrible God. It is a part of
          the majesty and glory of God, that he is a terrible God. God tells
          Pharaoh, that for this cause he raised him up, that he might show his
          power in him, and that his name might be declared through all the
          earth, in his destruction. Exodus 9:15, 16; and again, chapter 14:17:
          “I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his
          chariots, and upon his horsemen.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The destruction of the unfruitful is of use, to give the saints a
          greater sense of their happiness, and of God’s grace to them. The
          wicked will be destroyed and tormented in the view of the saints, and
          other inhabitants of heaven. This we are taught in Revelation 14:10.
          “The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured
          out without mixture, into the cup of his indignation ; and he shall be
          tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy angels,
          and in the presence of the Lamb.” And in Isaiah 66:24. “And they shall
          go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed
          against me : For their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be
          quenched, and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When the saints in heaven shall look upon the damned in hell, it will
          serve to give them a greater sense of their own happiness, seeing how
          vastly different their case is from their own. The view of the doleful
          condition of the damned will make them the more prize their own
          blessedness. When they shall see how dreadful the anger of God is, it
          will make them the more prize his love. They will rejoice so much the
          more that they are not the objects of God’s anger, but of his favor;
          that they are not the subjects of his dreadful wrath, but are treated
          as his children, are taken near to him, to dwell in the everlasting
          embraces of his love.
        </p>
        <p>
          When they shall see the misery of the damned, it will give them a
          greater sense of the distinguishing grace and love of God to them,
          that God should from all eternity set his love on them, and make so
          great a difference between them and others who are of the same species
          with them, are no worse by nature than they, and have deserved no
          worse of God than they. When they shall look upon the misery of the
          damned, and consider how different their own state is from theirs, and
          that it is only free and sovereign grace that makes the difference,
          what a great sense will this give them of the wonderful grace of God
          to them! And how will it heighten their praises! With how much greater
          admiration and exultation of soul will they sing of the free and
          sovereign grace of God to them!
        </p>
        <p>
          When they shall look upon the damned, and see their misery, how will
          heaven ring with the praises of God’s justice towards the wicked, and
          his grace towards the saints! And with how much greater enlargement of
          heart will they praise Jesus Christ their Redeemer, that ever he was
          pleased to set his love upon them, his dying love! And that he should
          so distinguish them as to spill his blood, and make his soul an
          offering, to redeem them from that so great misery, and to bring them
          to such exceeding happiness!
        </p>
        <p>
          With what love and ecstasy will they sing that song in Revelation 5:9.
          10. “Thou art worthy: For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God
          by thy blood, out of every tongue, and kindred, and people, and
          nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests.” One end
          which the apostle mentions why God appointed vessels of wrath, is the
          more to make known the wonderfulness of his mercy towards the saints.
          In Romans 9:22, 23. there are two ends mentioned: “What if God,
          willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with
          much long suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?” That
          is one end, then another is mentioned immediately after: “And that he
          might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy,
          which he had afore prepared unto glory ?”
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          I. Hence we may learn, how just and righteous God is in the
          destruction of those who bring forth no fruit to God. Seeing there is
          no other way in which they can be useful, or in which the end of their
          being can be obtained, certainly it is most just that God should thus
          dispose of them. Why should God be frustrated of his end through their
          perverseness? If men will not do the work for which he hath made and
          fitted them; if they, through a spirit of opposition and rebellion
          against God, refuse; yet why should God suffer himself to be
          disappointed of his end in making them? It doth not become the
          infinite greatness and majesty of God, to suffer himself to be
          disappointed and frustrated by the wickedness and perverseness of
          sinful worms of the dust. If God should suffer this, it would seem to
          argue, either a want of wisdom in God to fix upon a good end, or a
          want of power to accomplish it.
        </p>
        <p>
          God made all men that they might be useful; and if they will not be
          useful in their conduct and actions, how just is it that God should
          make them useful in their sufferings! God made all men for his own
          glory; and if they, contrary to the revealed will of God, refuse to
          glorify him actively and willingly, how just is it that God should
          glorify himself upon them in what he doth with them!
        </p>
        <p>
          It hath been shown, that there is no other way wherein this can be
          done, but by their destruction. Surely, therefore, it must be just and
          righteous that God should destroy them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men are under no natural necessity of being put to this use of
          glorifying God in their sufferings. God gives them opportunity of
          glorifying him in doing, in bringing forth fruit, puts them under
          advantages for it, and uses many means to bring them to it. But if
          they will not be useful this way, it is very just that God should make
          them useful in the only remaining way in which they can be useful,
          viz. in their destruction. God is not forward to put them to this use.
          He tells us, that he hath “no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but
          that the wicked turn from his way, and live;” Ezekiel 33:11. God
          represents the destruction of sinners as a work to which he is
          backward; yet it is meet that they should be destroyed, rather than
          that they should be suffered to frustrate God of the end of their
          being. Who can blame the husbandman for cutting down and burning a
          barren tree, after he hath digged about it, and dunged it, and used
          all proper means to make it fruitful?<br />
          Let those among us consider this, who have lived all their lives
          hitherto unprofitably, and never have brought forth any fruit to God’s
          glory, notwithstanding all the means that have been used with them.
          Consider how just it would be if God should utterly destroy you, and
          glorify himself upon you in that way; and what a wonder of patience it
          is, that God hath not done it before now.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This subject ought to put you upon examining yourselves, whether
          you be not wholly useless creatures. You have now heard, that those
          who bring forth no fruit to God, are, as to any good they do, wholly
          useless. Inquire, therefore, whether you have ever in your lives
          brought forth any fruit to God. Have you ever done any thing from a
          gracious respect to God, or out of love to God? By only seeking your
          worldly interest, you do not bring forth fruit to God. It is toot
          bringing forth fruit to God, for you to come to public worship on the
          Sabbath, to pray in your families, and other such like things, merely
          in compliance with the general custom. It is not to bring forth fruit
          to God, that you be sober, moral and religious, only to be seen of
          men, or out of respect to your own credit and honor. How is that for
          God which is only for the sake of custom, or the esteem of men?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not to bring forth fruit to God, for men to pray, and read, and
          hear, and to be strict and diligent in religious and moral duties,
          merely from the fear of hell. What thanks are due to you for not
          loving your own misery, and for being willing to take some pains to
          escape burning in hell to all eternity? There is ne’er a devil in hell
          but would gladly do the same. Hosea 10:1. “Israel is an empty vine; he
          bringeth forth fruit unto himself.”<br />
          There is no fruit brought forth to God, where there is nothing done in
          any wise from love to God, or from any true respect to him. God
          looketh at the heart. He doth not stand in need of our services,
          neither is he benefited by any thing that we can do. He doth not
          receive any thing of us, because it benefits him, but only as a
          suitable testimony of our love and respect to him. This is the fruit
          that he seeks. Men themselves will not accept of those shows of
          friendship, which they think are hypocritical, and come not from the
          heart. How much less should God, who searcheth the hearts and trieth
          the reins of the children of men! John 4:23. “God is a spirit, and
          they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.”<br />
          Inquire, therefore, whether you ever in your lives did the least thing
          out of love to God. Have you not done all for yourselves? Zechariah
          7:5, 6. “When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month,
          even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even unto me?
          And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did ye not eat for
          yourselves, and drink for yourselves? ”
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Another use of this subject may be of conviction and humiliation
          to those who never have brought forth any fruit to God. If, upon
          examination, you find that you have never in all your lives done any
          thing out of a true respect to God, then it hath been demonstrated,
          that, as to any thing which you do, you are altogether useless
          creatures. And consider, what a shameful thing it is for such rational
          beings as you are, and placed under such advantages for usefulness,
          yet to be wholly useless, and to live in the world to no purpose!
        </p>
        <p>
          We esteem it a very mean character in any person, that he is a
          worthless, insignificant person; and to be called so is taken as a
          great reproach. But consider seriously, whether you can clear
          yourselves of this character. Set reason to work; can you rationally
          suppose, that you do in any measure answer the end for which God gave
          you your being, and made you of a nature superior to the beasts? But
          that you may be sensible what cause you have to be ashamed of your
          unprofitableness, consider the following things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How much God hath bestowed upon you, in the endowments of your
          nature. God hath made you rational, intelligent creatures, hath
          endowed you with noble powers, those endowments wherein the natural
          image of God consists. You are vastly exalted in your nature above
          other kinds of creatures here below. You are capable of a thousand
          times as much as any of the brute creatures. He hath given you a power
          of understanding, which is capable of vastly extending itself, of
          looking back to the beginning of time, and of considering what was
          before the world was, and of looking forward beyond the end of time.
          It is capable of extending beyond the utmost limits of the universe;
          and is a faculty whereby you are akin to angels, and are capable even
          of knowing God, of contemplating the divine Being, and his glorious
          perfections, manifested in his works and in his word. You have souls
          capable of being the habitation of the Holy Spirit of God, and his
          divine grace. You are capable of the noble employments of angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          How lamentable and shameful it is, that such a creature should be
          altogether useless, and live in vain! How lamentable that such a noble
          and excellent piece of divine workmanship should fail of its end, and
          be to no purpose! Was it ever worth while for God to make you such a
          creature, with such a noble nature, and so much above other kinds of
          creatures, only to eat, and drink, and gratify your sensual appetites?
          How lamentable and shameful to you, that such a noble tree should be
          more useless than any tree of the forest; that man, whom God hath thus
          set in honor, should make himself more worthless than the beasts that
          perish!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How much God hath done for you in the creation of the world. He
          made the earth, and seas, and all the fulness of them, for the use of
          man, and hath given them to him. Psalm 115:16. “The earth hath he
          given to the children of men.” He made the vast variety of creatures
          for man’s use and service. Genesis 1:28. “Have dominion over the fish
          of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing
          that moveth upon the earth.” For the same purpose he made all the
          plants, and herbs, and trees of the field. Genesis 1:29. “I have given
          you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth,
          and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree, yielding seed; to
          you it shall be for meat.” He made the sun in the heavens, that
          glorious luminary, that wonderful globe of light, to give light to
          man, and to constitute the difference between day and night. He also
          made the moon, and the vast multitude of stars, for the use of man, to
          be to him for signs and seasons.

          What great provision hath God made for man! What a vast variety of
          good things for food, and otherwise to be for his convenience, to put
          him under advantages to be useful! How lamentable is it, that after
          all these things he should be an useless creature in the world!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. How much is done for you in the course of God’s common providence!
          Consider how nature is continually laboring for you. The sun is, at it
          were, in a ferment for mankind, unweariedly running his course from
          year to year, and from day to day, and spending his rays upon man, to
          put him under advantage to be useful; every day giving him light that
          he may have opportunity to behold the glorious wisdom of God, and to
          see and serve God. The winds and clouds are continually laboring for
          you, and the waters are going in a constant circulation, ascending in
          the air from the seas, descending in rain, gathering in streams and
          rivers, returning to the sea, and again ascending and descending, for
          you. The earth is continually laboring to bring forth her fruit for
          your support. The trees of the field are laboring and spending their
          strength for you. And how many of the poor brute creatures are
          continually laboring for you, and spending their strength for you! How
          much of the earth is spent upon you! How many of God’s creatures are
          devoured by you! How many of the lives of the living creatures of God
          are destroyed for your sake, for your support and comfort!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, how lamentable will it be, if, after all, you be altogether
          useless, and live to no purpose! What mere cumberers of the ground
          will you be! Agreeably to Luke 13:7. Nature, which thus continually
          labors for you, will be burdened with you. This seems to be what the
          apostle means, Romans 7:20, 21, 22, where he tells us, that the
          creation is made subject to vanity, and brought into the bondage of
          corruption; and that the whole creation groans, and travails in pain,
          under this bondage.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. How much is done for you in the use of the means of grace. How much
          hath God done to provide you with suitable means and advantages for
          usefulness! How many prophets hath God sent into the world, in
          different ages, inspiring them with his Holy Spirit, and enabling them
          to work many miracles to confirm their word, whereby you now have the
          written word of God to instruct you!
        </p>
        <p>
          How great a thing hath God done for you, to give you opportunity and
          advantage to be useful, in that he hath sent his own Son into the
          world! He who is really and truly God, united himself to the human
          nature, and became a man, to be a prophet an teacher to you and other
          sinners. Yea, he laid down his life to make atonement for sin, that
          you might have encouragement to serve God with hopes of acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
          How many ordinances have been instituted for you! How much of the
          labor of the ministers of God hath been spent upon you! Is not that
          true concerning you which is written in Isaiah 5 at the beginning,
          concerning the vineyard planted in a very fruitful hill, and fenced
          and cultivated with peculiar care and pains, which yet proved
          unfruitful? How much hath the dresser of the vineyard digged about the
          barren tree, and dunged it, and yet it remains barren!
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider what a shame it is that you should live in vain, when all the
          other creatures, that are inferior to you, do glorify their Creator,
          according to their nature. You who are so highly exalted in the world,
          are more useless than the brute creation; yea, than the meanest worms,
          or things without life, as earth and stones: For they all do answer
          their end, in the way in which nature hath fitted them for it; none of
          them fail of it. They are all useful in their places, all render their
          proper tribute of praise to their Creator; while you are mere
          nuisances in the creation, and burdens to the earth; as any tree of
          the forest is more useful than the vine, if it bear not fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Let me, in a farther application of this doctrine, exhort you by
          all means to bring forth fruit to God. Let it be your constant
          endeavor to be in this way actively useful in the world. Here consider
          three things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. What an honor it will be to such poor creatures as you are, to
          bring forth fruit to the divine glory. What is such a poor worm as
          man, that he should be enabled to bring forth any fruit to God! It is
          the greatest honor of the nature of man, that God hath given him a
          capacity of glorifying the great Creator. It is what no other creature
          in this lower world can do, in the same manner as man. There is no
          creature in the visible world that is capable of actively glorifying
          God, but man.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In bringing forth fruit to God, you will be so profitable to none
          as to yourselves; you cannot thereby be profitable to God. Job 22:2.
          “Can a man be profitable to God?” You may thereby be profitable to
          your fellow creatures; yet not so much as to yourselves. The fruit
          which you bring forth to God will be a greater benefit to yourselves
          than to any one living. You will be more useful to yourselves than to
          any one else.<br />
          Although you are under a natural obligation to bring forth fruit to
          God, yet God doth not require it of you without a reward. He will
          richly reward you for it. In requiring you to bring forth fruit to
          him, he doth but require you to bring forth fruit to your own
          happiness. You will taste the sweetness of your own fruit. It will be
          most profitable for you in this world to bring forth fruit to God; it
          will be exceedingly to your benefit while here. It will be pleasant to
          you to lead a fruitful and holy life; the pleasure will be beyond the
          labor. Beside this, God hath promised to such a life everlasting
          rewards, unspeakable, infinite benefits. So that by it you will
          infinitely advance your own interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If you remain thus unprofitable, and be not actively useful, surely
          God will obtain his end of you, in your destruction. He will say
          concerning the barren tree, “Cut it down, why cumbereth it the
          ground?” Christ, in John 15:6, tells us, “if a man abide not in me, he
          is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and
          cast them into the fire, and they are burned.” This is spoken of the
          barren branches in the vine. How would you yourselves do in such a
          case with a barren tree in an orchard, or with weeds and tares in your
          fields? Doubtless, it were in your power, you would utterly destroy
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          God will have his end; he will accomplish it. Though all men and
          devils unite their endeavors, they cannot frustrate God in any thing;
          and “though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished;”
          Proverbs 11:1. God hath sworn by his great name, that he will have his
          glory of men, whether they will actively glorify him or no. Numbers
          14:21, 22, 23. “But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled
          with the glory of the Lord. Because all those men which have seen my
          glory, and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and
          have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my
          voice; surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their
          fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me, see it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “The ax lieth at the root of the trees; and every tree which bringeth
          not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire;” Matthew
          3:10. The end of those men who bring forth nothing but briers and
          thorns is to be burned, as in Hebrews 6:7, 8. “For the earth which
          drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs
          meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: But
          that which beareth thorns and briers, is rejected, and is nigh unto
          cursing; whose end is to be burned.” So we read of the tares, Matthew
          13:30. “Let both grow together until the harvest ; and in the time of
          harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares,
          and bind them in bundles to burn them;” and in verses 40, 41, 42, “As
          therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it
          be at the end of the world. The Son of man shall send forth his
          angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that
          offend, and them which do iniquity, and shall cast them into a furnace
          of fire: There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So it is said of the chaff, Matthew 3:12. “Whose fan is in his hand,
          and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the
          garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
        </p>
        <p>
          If you continue not to bring forth any fruit to the divine glory, as
          you have hitherto done, hell will be the only fit place for you. It is
          a place prepared on purpose to be a receptacle of such persons. In
          hell nature ceases to labor any more for sinners: The sun doth not run
          his course to shine upon them, the earth doth not bring forth her
          fruit to be consumed upon them there. There they will have no
          opportunity to consume the fruits of divine goodness on their lusts.
          In hell they can prejudice or encumber nothing, upon which God sets
          any value. There the faithful servants and ministers of God will no
          longer spend their strength in vain upon them. When the barren tree is
          in the fire, the servants of the husbandman are freed from any further
          labor or toil in digging about it, and manuring it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In hell they will no more have opportunity to clog and discourage the
          flourishing of religion, and to destroy much good, as they often do in
          this world. In hell they will no more have opportunity to corrupt
          others by their ill example. In hell they will no more have it in
          their power to offend the godly; they may hurt and torment one
          another; but the godly will be out of their reach. In hell there will
          be no ordinances, no Sabbaths, no sacraments, no sacred things, for
          them to profane and defile by their careless and hypocritical
          attendance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hell, therefore, if you remain unfruitful and cumberers of the ground,
          will be the fittest place for you, and there you will surely have your
          portion assigned you. There God will get himself honor upon you; there
          he will magnify himself in your ruin, in the presence of the holy
          angels, and in the presence of the Lamb; and will be praised upon that
          account by the saints, at the day of judgment; and by all the host of
          heaven throughout everlasting ages.
