        <p>Exodus 20:15, “Thou shalt not steal.”</p>
        <p>
          This is one of the ten commandments which constitute a summary of
          man’s duty, as revealed by God. God made many revelations to the
          children of Israel in the wilderness by Moses. But this made in the
          ten commandments is the chief. Most of those other revelations
          contained ceremonial or judicial laws; but this contains the moral
          law. The most of those other laws respected the Jewish nation; but
          here is a summary of laws binding on all mankind. Those were to last
          till Christ should come, and have set up the Christian church. These
          are of perpetual obligation, and last to the end of the world. God
          everywhere, by Moses and the prophets, manifests a far greater regard
          to the duties of these commands than to any of the rites of the
          ceremonial law.
        </p>
        <p>
          These commands were given at Mount Sinai, before any of the precepts
          of the ceremonial or judicial laws. They were delivered by a great
          voice out of the midst of fire, which made all the people in the camp
          tremble, and afterwards were engraven on tables of stone, and laid up
          in the ark; the first table containing the four first commandments;
          which teach our duty to God; the second table containing the six last,
          which teach our duty to man. The sum of the duties of the first table
          is contained in that which Christ says is the first and great
          commandment of the law; Mat. 22:37, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
          with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” The
          sum of what is required in the second table, is what Christ calls the
          second command, like unto the first; verse 39, “The second is like
          unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the commands of this second table of the law, the first (which is
          the fifth of the ten), refers to that honor which is due to our
          neighbor; the second respects his life; the third his chastity; the
          fourth his estate; the fifth his good name; the sixth and last
          respects his possessions and enjoyments in general. It is that command
          which respects our neighbor’s estate, and which is the fourth command
          of the second table, and the eighth of the whole decalogue, on which I
          am now to insist. And here I shall make the command itself, as the
          words of it lie before us in the decalogue, my subject: and as the
          words of the commandment are in the form of a prohibition, forbidding
          a certain kind of sin. So I shall consider particularly what it is
          that this command forbids. The sin that is forbidden in this command
          is called stealing; yet we cannot reasonably understand it only of
          that act, which in the more ordinary and strict sense of the word, is
          called stealing. But the iniquity which this command forbids, may be
          summarily expressed thus: — An unjust usurping of our neighbor’s
          property, without his consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          So much is doubtless comprehended in the text; yet this comprehends
          much more than is implied in the ordinary use of the word, stealing;
          which is only a secret taking of that which is another’s from his
          possession, without either his consent or knowledge. But the ten
          commands are not to be limited to the strictest sense of the words,
          but are to be understood in such a latitude, as to include all things
          that are of that nature or kind. Hence Christ reproves the Pharisees’
          interpretation of the sixth command, Mat. 5:21, 22; and also their
          interpretation of the seventh command; see verse 27, 28; by which it
          appears that the commands are not to be understood as forbidding only
          these individual sins, which are expressly mentioned, in the strictest
          sense of the expressions; but all other things of the same nature or
          kind. — Therefore, what is forbidden in this command is all unjust
          usurpation of our neighbor’s property. Here it may be observed, that
          an unjust usurpation of our neighbor’s property is twofold; it may be,
          either by withholding what is our neighbor’s, or by taking it from
          him.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>The dishonesty of withholding what is our neighbor’s.</p>
        <p>
          There are many ways in which persons may unjustly usurp their
          neighbor’s property, by withholding what is his due. But I shall
          particularize only two things.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the unfaithfulness of men in not fulfilling their engagements.
          Ordinarily when men promise anything to their neighbor, or enter into
          engagements by undertaking any business with which their neighbor
          entrust them, their engagements invest their neighbor with a right to
          that which is engaged; so that if they withhold it, they usurp that
          which belongs to their neighbor. So, when men break their promises,
          because they find them to be inconvenient, and they cannot fulfill
          them without difficulty and trouble; or merely because they have
          altered their minds since they promised. They think they have not
          consulted their own interest in the promise which they have made, and
          that if they had considered the matter as much before they promised as
          they have since, they should not have promised. Therefore they take
          the liberty to set their own promises aside. Besides, sometimes
          persons violate this command, by neglecting to fulfill their
          engagements, through a careless, negligent spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          They violate this command, in withholding what belongs to their
          neighbor, when they are not faithful in any business which they have
          undertaken to do for their neighbor. If their neighbor [has] hired
          them to labor for him for a certain time, and they be not careful well
          to husband the time; if they be hired to a day’s labor, and be not
          careful to improve the day, as they have reason to think that he who
          hired justly expected of them; or if they be hired to accomplish such
          a piece of work, and be not careful to do it well, do it not as if it
          were for themselves, or as they would have others do for them, when
          they in like manner betrust them with any business of theirs; or if
          they be entrusted with any particular affair, which they undertake,
          but use not that care, contrivance, and diligence, to manage it so as
          will be to the advantage of him who entrusts them, and as they would
          manage it, or would insist that it should be managed, if the affair
          was their own: in all these cases the unjustly withhold what belongs
          to their neighbor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, another way in which men unjustly withhold what is their
          neighbor’s is in neglecting to pay their debts. Sometimes this
          happens, because they run so far into debt that they cannot reasonably
          hope to be able to pay their debts; and this they do, either through
          pride and affectation of living above their circumstances, or through
          a grasping, covetous disposition, or some other corrupt principle.
          Sometimes they neglect to pay their debts from carelessness of spirit
          about it, little concerning themselves whether they are paid or not,
          taking no care to go to their creditor, or to send to him. And if they
          see him from time to time, they say nothing about their debts.
          Sometimes they neglect to pay their debts, because it would put them
          to some inconvenience. The reason why they do it not, is not because
          they cannot do it, but because they cannot do it so conveniently as
          they desire. And so they rather choose to put their creditor to
          inconvenience by being without what properly belongs to him, than to
          put themselves to inconvenience by being without what doth not belong
          to them, and what they have no right to detain. In any of these cases
          they unjustly usurp the property of their neighbor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes persons have that by them with which they could pay their
          debts if they would. But they want to lay out their money for
          something else, to buy gay clothing for their children, or to advance
          their estates, or for some such end. They have other designs in hand,
          which must fail, if they pay their debts. When men thus withhold what
          is due, they unjustly usurp what is not their own. Sometimes they
          neglect to pay their debts, and their excuse for it is that their
          creditor doth not need it; that he hath a plentiful estate, and can
          well bear to lie out of his money. But if the creditor be ever so
          rich, that gives no right to the debtor to withhold from him that
          which belongs to him. If it be due, it ought to be paid. For that is
          the very notion of its being due. It is no more lawful to withhold
          from a man what is his due, without his consent, because he is rich
          and able to do without it, than it is lawful to steal from a man
          because he is rich, and able to bear the loss.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>The dishonesty of unjustly taking a neighbor’s property.</p>
        <p>
          The principal ways of doing this seem to be these four, by negligence,
          by fraud, by violence, or by stealing strictly so called.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the first way of unjustly depriving our neighbor of that which
          is his, is by negligence, by carelessly neglecting that which is
          expected by neighbors, one of another, and is necessary to prevent our
          neighbor’s suffering in his estate by us, or by anything that is ours:
          and necessary in order that neighbors may live one by another, without
          suffering in their lawful interests, rights, and possessions, one by
          another.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, when proper care is not taken by men to prevent their
          neighbor’s suffering in the produce of his fields or enclosures, from
          their cattle, or other brute creatures; which may be either through
          negligence with regard to their creatures themselves, in keeping those
          that are unruly, and giving them their liberty, though they know that
          they are not fit to have their liberty, and are commonly wont to break
          into their neighbor’s enclosures greatly to his damage; or through a
          neglect of that which is justly expected of them, to defend others’
          fields from suffering by the neighborhood of their own. In such cases
          men are guilty of unjustly taking from their neighbor what is his
          property.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is said in the law of Moses, Exo. 22:5, “If a man shall cause a
          field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall
          feed in another man’s field; of the best of his own field, and of the
          best of his vineyard, shall he make restitution.” Now a man may be
          unjustly the cause of his neighbor’s field or vineyard being eaten,
          either by putting in his beast, and so doing what he should not do; or
          by neglecting to do what he should do, to prevent his beast from
          getting into his field. What is said in the 144th Psalm, and two last
          verses, supposes that a people who carry themselves as becomes a
          people whose God is the Lord, will take thorough care that beasts do
          not break into their neighbor’s enclosures. “That our oxen may be
          strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that
          there be no complaining in our streets. Happy is that people that is
          in such a case; yea happy is that people whose God is the Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, taking away that which is our neighbor’s by fraud, or by
          deceiving him, is another mode of usurping our neighbor’s property.
          This is the case when men in their dealings take advantage of their
          neighbor’s ignorance, or oversight, or mistake, to get something from
          him; or when they make their gains, by concealing the defects of what
          they sell, putting off bad for good, though this be not done by
          speaking falsely, but only by keeping silence. Or when they take a
          higher price than what they sell is really worth, and more than they
          could get for it if the concealed defects were known. Or when they
          sell that for good, which indeed is not merchantable, which is
          condemned in Amos 8:6, “Yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat.”
        </p>
        <p>
          If a man puts off something to another with defects that are
          concealed, knowing that the other receives it as good, and pays such a
          price for it, under a notion of its having no remarkable defect but
          what he sees, and takes the price which the buyer under that notion
          offers; the seller knows that he takes a price of the buyer for that
          which the buyer had not of him; for the buyer is deceived, and pays
          for those things which he finds wanting in what he buys. It is just
          the same thing, as if a man should take a payment that another offers
          him, through a mistake, for that which he never had of him, thinking
          that he had it of him, when he had it not.
        </p>
        <p>
          So a man fraudulently takes away that which is his neighbor’s, when he
          gets his money from him by falsely commending what he hath to sell,
          above what he knows to be the true quality of it; and attributes those
          good qualities to it which he knows it has not. Or if he does not
          that, yet sets forth the good qualities in a degree beyond what he
          knows to be the true degree; or speaks of the defects and ill
          qualities of what he has to sell, as if they were much less than he
          knows they are. Or on the contrary, when the buyer will cry down what
          he is about to buy, contrary to his real opinion of the value of it. —
          These things, however common they be in men’s dealings one with
          another, are nothing short of iniquity, and fraud, and a great breach
          of this commandment, upon which we are discoursing. Pro. 20:14, “It is
          nought, it is nought, saith the buyer; but when he is gone his way
          then he boasteth.” — Many other ways there are whereby men deceive one
          another in their trading, and whereby they fraudulently and unjustly
          take away that which is their neighbor’s.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, another mode of unjustly invading and taking away our
          neighbor’s property, is by violence. This violence may be done in
          different degrees. — Men may take away their neighbor’s goods either
          by mere open violence, either making use of superior strength,
          forcibly taking away anything that is his; or by express or implicit
          threatenings forcing him to yield up what he has into their hands; as
          is done in open robbery and piracy. Or, by making use of some
          advantages which they have over their neighbor, in their dealings with
          him, constrain him to yield to their gaining unreasonably of him; as
          when they take advantage of their neighbor’s poverty to extort
          unreasonably from him for those things that he is under a necessity of
          procuring for himself or family. This is an oppression against which
          God hath shown a great displeasure in his word. Lev. 25:14, “And if
          thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour,
          ye shall not oppress one another.” Pro. 22:22, 23, “Rob not the poor,
          because he is poor, neither oppress the afflicted in the gate; for the
          Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled
          them.” And Amos 4:1, 2, “Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are
          in the mount of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the
          needy, the Lord hath sworn in his holiness, that he will take you away
          with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When the necessity of poor indigent people is the very thing whence
          others take occasion to raise the price of provisions, even above the
          market; this is such an oppression. There are many poor people whose
          families are in such necessity of bread, that they in their extremity
          will give almost any price for it, rather than go without it. Those
          who have to sell, though hereby they have an advantage in their hands,
          yet surely should not take the advantage to raise the price of
          provisions. We should doubtless think we had just cause to complain,
          if we were in such necessity as they are, and were reduced to their
          straits, and were treated in this manner. And let us remember, that it
          is owing only to the distinguishing goodness of God to us, that we are
          not in their circumstances. And whatever our present circumstances
          are, yet we know not but that the time may still come when their case
          may be ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men may oppress others, though they be not poor, if they will take
          advantage of any particular necessities of their neighbor,
          unreasonably to extort from him. The case may be so at particular
          seasons, that those who are not poor, may stand in particular and
          extraordinary need of what we have, or what we can do for them. So
          that it would be greatly to their disadvantage or loss to be without
          it. Now to take advantage of their urgent circumstances, to get from
          them an unreasonable price, is a violent dealing with our neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very unreasonable to say, Such men are so rich, and get money so
          much more easily than I, that it is no hurt for me to take advantage
          when they are in special need, and make them give me, for work that I
          do for them, a great deal more than I would desire to ask of other
          men. Let such consider, whether, if they should by any means hereafter
          get forward in the world, and come to have plentiful estates, they
          would like that persons should act upon such principles towards them.
          That men are rich, gives us no more right to take away from them what
          is theirs in this way, than it does to steal from them because they
          come easily by their property, and can do without it better than we.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, another thing that is a kind of violent taking from our
          neighbor what is his, is taking the advantage of the law to gain from
          others, when their cause in honesty and conscience is just and good.
          The circumstances of mankind, their rights, possessions, and dealings
          one with another, are so various, that it is impossible that any body
          of human laws should be contrived to suit all possible cases and
          circumstances. Hence the best laws may be abused and perverted to
          purposes contrary to the general design of laws, which is to maintain
          the rights and secure the properties of mankind. Human laws have a
          regard due to them, but always in subordination to the higher laws of
          God and nature. Therefore when it so happens, that we have an
          advantage by the law, to gain what the laws of moral honesty allow
          not, it is an oppression and violence to take the advantage. That
          human laws allow it, will not excuse us before God, the Judge of the
          world, who will judge us another day by his own laws and not by the
          laws of the commonwealth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, the fourth way of unjustly taking from our neighbor that which
          is his, is stealing so called. All unjust ways of taking away, or
          invading, or usurping what is our neighbor’s, are called stealing in
          the most extensive use of the word, and all in included in the
          expression in this command. Yet the word stealing, as it is more
          commonly used, is not of so great extent, and intends not all unjust
          invasion of our neighbor’s property, but only a particular kind of
          unjust taking. So that in common speech when we speak of fraudulent
          dealings, of extortion, unfaithfulness in our trust, and of stealing,
          we understand different sins by these expressions, though they are an
          usurpation of what is our neighbor’s.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stealing, strictly so called, may be thus defined. A designed taking
          of our neighbor’s goods from him, without his consent or knowledge. It
          is not merely a withholding of what is our neighbor’s, but a taking
          away. And therein it differs from unfaithfulness in our undertakings
          and betrustments, and also from negligence in the payment of debts. It
          is a designed or willful depriving of our neighbor of what is his, and
          so differs from wronging our neighbor in his estate through
          carelessness or negligence. It is taking of our neighbor’s goods
          without his knowledge. It is a private, clandestine taking away, and
          so differs from robbery by open violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          So also it differs from extortion, for in that the person knows what
          is taken from him. The aim of him that takes is no other than that he
          should know it; for he makes use of other means than his ignorance, to
          obtain what is his neighbors, viz. violence to constrain him to give
          it up. So also it differs from fraudulent dealing or trading. For
          though in fraudulent dealing, the lawful possessor doth not understand
          the ways and means, by which he parts with his goods, and by which his
          neighbor becomes possessed of them; yet he knows the fact; the
          deceiver designedly conceals the manner only. But in stealing,
          strictly so called, he that takes, intends not that it shall be known
          that he takes. It also differs from extortion and fraudulent dealing,
          in that it is wholly without the consent of the owner. For in
          extortion, though there be no free consent; yet the consent of the
          owner is in some sort gained, though by oppressive means. So in
          fraudulent dealing consent is in some sort obtained, though it be by
          deceit. But in stealing no kind of consent is obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
          A person may steal from another, yet not take his goods without the
          knowledge of the owner; because he may know of it accidentally, he may
          see what is done, unawares to the thief. Therefore I have defined
          stealing, a designed taking without the consent or knowledge of the
          owner. If it be accidentally known, yet it is not known in the design
          and intention of the thief. The thief is so far at least private in
          it, that he gives no notice to the owner at the time. It must be also
          without the consent of the owner. A person may take without the
          knowledge of the owner, and yet not take without his consent. The
          owner may not know of his taking at the time, or of his taking any
          particular things; yet there may be his implicit consent. There may
          have been a general consent, if not expressed, yet implied. The
          circumstances of the affair may be such, that his consent may well be
          presumed upon, either from an established custom, allowed by all, or
          from the nature of the case; the thing being of such a nature, that it
          may well be presumed that none would refuse their consent; as in the
          case of a person’s accidentally passing through his neighbor’s
          vineyard in Israel, and eating his fill of grapes; or from the
          circumstances of the persons, as is the case, in many instances, of
          the freedom which near neighbors and intimate friends often take, and
          of that boldness which they use with respect to each other’s goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all such cases, though the owner [does] not particularly know what
          is done, yet he that takes, does it not with any contrived designed
          concealment. And though there is no express, particular consent, yet
          there is a consent either implied, or justly presumed upon. And he
          that takes, doth not designedly do it without consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may happen in some cases, that one may take the goods of another
          both without his knowledge and consent, either explicit or implicit,
          but through mistake; yet he may not be guilty of stealing. Therefore
          the design of him who takes must come into consideration. When he
          designedly takes away that which is his neighbor’s, without his
          consent or knowledge, then he steals. So that if it should happen,
          that he has both his consent and knowledge, without his design, he
          steals. And if it so happen that he takes without either his
          neighbor’s consent or knowledge, and yet without his own design, he
          steals not. I desire therefore that this, which I take to be the true
          definition of theft or stealing, may be borne in mind, viz. a designed
          taking of our neighbor’s goods, without his consent or knowledge;
          because it is needful to clear up many things which I have yet to say
          on this subject.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>Dishonest excuses.</p>
        <p>
          Here I shall particularly take notice of some things, by which persons
          may be ready to excuse themselves, in privately taking their
          neighbor’s good, which however cannot be a just excuse for it, nor
          will they make such a taking to be stealing.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that the person whose goods are privately taken, owes or is in
          debt to him that takes them. Some may be ready to say that they do not
          take that which is their neighbor’s, they take that which is their
          own, because as much is due to them, their neighbor owes them as much,
          and unjustly detains it, and they know not whether ever they shall get
          their due of him. Their neighbor will not do them right, and therefore
          they must right themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          But such pleas as these will not justify a man in going in a private
          and clandestine manner to take away anything of his neighbor’s from
          his possession, without his consent or knowledge; his doing this is
          properly stealing. For though something of his neighbor’s, which is as
          valuable as what he takes, may be due to him; that doth not give him
          such a right to his neighbor’s goods, that he may take anything that
          is his, according to his own pleasure, and at what time and in what
          manner he pleases. That his neighbor is in debt to him, doth not give
          him a right to take it upon himself to be his own judge, so that he
          may judge for himself, which of his neighbor’s goods shall be taken
          from him to discharge the debt; and that he may act merely according
          to his own private judgment and pleasure in such a case, without so
          much as acquainting his neighbor with the affair.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to warrant such a proceeding as this, everything that his
          neighbor has, must be his. A man may not take indifferently what he
          pleases out of a number of goods, without the consent or knowledge of
          any other person, unless all is his own, to be disposed of as he
          pleases. Such a way of using goods according to our own pleasure,
          taking what we will, and at what time we will, can be warranted by
          nothing but a dominion over the whole. And though he who is in debt
          may be guilty of great injustice in detaining what is due to another;
          yet it doth not thence follow, but that he that takes from him, may
          also be guilty of great injustice towards him. The course he takes to
          right himself may be very irregular and unreasonable; and such a
          course, that if universally allowed and pursued in such cases, would
          throw human society into confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          When men obtain a property in any of the professions of this life,
          they are at the same time also invested with a right to retain a
          possession of them, till they are deprived of them in some fair and
          regular proceeding. Every man has a right to hold his estate, and keep
          possession of his properties, so that no other can lawfully use them
          as his own, until he either parts with them of his own accord, or
          until it be taken from him according to some established rule, in a
          way of open justice. Therefore he who, under pretense of having just
          demands upon his neighbor, privately takes his goods without his
          consent, takes them unjustly, and is guilty of stealing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, much less will it make such a private taking not to be
          stealing, that he who takes, has, in way of kindness or gift, done for
          the person from whom he takes, as much is equivalent to the value of
          what he takes. If a man do his neighbor some considerable kindness,
          whether in labor, or in something that he gives him, what he does or
          gives is supposed to be done voluntarily, and he is not to make his
          neighbor debtor for it. And therefore if anything be privately taken
          away, upon any such consideration, it is gross stealing.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, when any person needs to have any services done for him,
          where a considerable number of hands are necessary; it is common for
          the neighborhood to meet together and join in helping their neighbor,
          and frequently some provision is made for their entertainment. If any
          person who hath assisted on such an occasion, and is a partaker at
          such an entertainment, shall think within himself, the service I have
          done is worth a great deal more than what I shall eat and drink here,
          and therefore shall take liberty privately to take of the provision
          set before him, to carry away with him, purposely concealing the
          matter from him who hath entertained him, this is gross stealing. And
          it is a very ridiculous plea which they make to excuse so unmanly and
          vile an act.
        </p>
        <p>
          Persons in such cases may say to themselves, that the provision is
          made for them, and set before them; that it is a time wherein
          considerable liberty is given, and they think, seeing they have done
          so much for their host, they may take something more than they eat and
          drink there. But then let them be open in it; let them acquaint those
          with it who make the entertainment; and let it not be done in any
          wise, in a secret, clandestine manner, with the least design or
          attempt to avoid their notice. On the contrary, let care be taken to
          give them notice and obtain their consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          When persons do such things in a private manner, they condemn
          themselves by their own act. Their doing what they do secretly, shows
          that they are conscious to themselves, that they go beyond what it is
          expected they should do, and do what would not be allowed, if it were
          known. Such an act, however light they may make of it, is abominable
          theft, and what any person of religion or any sense of the dignity of
          their own nature, would to the greatest degree abhor and detest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, it is not sufficient to make a private taking without consent
          not to be stealing, that it is but a small matter that is taken. If
          the thing be of little value, yet if it be worth a purposed concealing
          from the owner, the value is great enough to render the taking of it
          proper theft. If it be pretended that the thing is of so small
          consequence, that it is not worth asking for; then surely it is not
          worth a purposed concealing from the owner, when it is taken. He who,
          under this pretense, conceals his taking, in the very act contradicts
          his own pretense; for his action shows that he apprehends, or at least
          suspects, that, as small a matter as it is, the owner would not like
          the taking of it, if he knew it; otherwise the taker would not desire
          to conceal it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The owner of the goods, and not other people, is the proper judge,
          whether what he owns be of such a value, that it is worth his while to
          keep it, and to refuse his consent to the taking of it from him. He
          who possesses, and not he who takes away, has a right to judge of what
          consequence his possessions are to him. He has a right to set what
          value he pleases on them, and to treat them according to that value.
          Besides, merely that a thing is of small value, cannot give a right to
          others, purposely and designedly to take it away, without the
          knowledge or consent of the owner. Because if this only gives a right,
          then all have a right to take things of small value; and at this rate
          a great number of persons, each of them taking from a man that which
          is of small value, might take away all he has.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, it will not justify persons, in purposely taking such
          things as fruit from the trees, or gardens, or fields of their
          neighbors, without their knowledge or consent, that the things which
          they take are things of small value. Nor is that sufficient to render
          such an act not an act of theft properly so called. This shows also
          that the smallness of the value of what is privately taken at feasts
          and entertainments, doth not render the taking of such things not
          stealing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The small value of a thing may in some cases justify an occasional
          taking of things, so far as we may from thence, and from what is
          generally allowed, reasonably presume that the owner gives his
          consent. But if that be the case, and persons really take, as
          supposing that the owner consents to such occasional taking, then he
          that takes will not at all endeavor to do what he does secretly, nor
          in any measure to avoid notice. But merely the smallness of the value
          of a thing, can never justify a secret taking of what is another’s.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IV</p>
        <p>The subject applied. — The dishonest warned.</p>
        <p>
          The first use I would make of this doctrine, is to warn against all
          injustice and dishonesty, as to what appertains to our neighbor’s
          temporal goods or possessions. Let me warn all to avoid all ways of
          unjustly invading or usurping what is their neighbor’s, and let me
          press that exhortation of the apostle, Rom. 12:17, “Provide things
          honest in the sight of all men;” which implies, that those things
          which we provide for ourselves, and use as our own, should be such as
          we come honestly by; and especially that we should avoid all
          clandestine or underhand ways of obtaining anything that is our
          neighbor’s, either by fraudulent dealing, or by that taking without
          our neighbor’s knowledge and consent, of which we have been speaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I warn you to beware of dishonesty in withholding what is your
          neighbor’s, either by unfaithfulness to your trust in any business
          which you undertake, or by withholding your neighbor’s just and honest
          dues. Consider that saying of the apostle, Rom. 13:8, “Owe no man any
          thing, but to love one another.” Be also warned against wronging your
          neighbor or injuring him in his enclosures, or in any of his just
          rights and properties, through careless neglect of what is reasonably
          expected by neighbors one of another, in order that they may live one
          by another without mutual injury. Let all beware that they bring not
          guilt on their souls in the sight of God, by taking an advantage to
          oppress any person. Especially beware of taking advantage of others’
          poverty to extort from them. For God will defend their cause, and you
          will be no gainers by such oppression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beware also of all injustice by deceitful and fraudulent dealing. You
          doubtless meet with abundance of temptation to fraud, and have need to
          keep a strong guard upon yourselves. There are many temptations to
          falsehood in trading, both about what you would buy and what you have
          to sell. There are, in buying, temptations to do as in Pro. 20:14, “It
          is nought, it is nought, saith the buyer.” There are many temptations
          to take indirect courses, to blind those with whom you deal, about the
          qualities of what you have to sell, to diminish the defects of your
          commodities, or to conceal them, and to put off things for good, which
          are bad. And there are doubtless many other ways that men meet with
          temptations to deceive others, which your own experience will better
          suggest to you than I can.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here I shall take occasion to speak of a particular kind of fraud,
          which is very aggravated, and is rather a defrauding of God than man.
          What I mean is, the giving of that which is bad for good in public
          contributions. Though it be matter of great shame and lamentation that
          it should be so, yet it is to be feared, from what has sometimes been
          observed, that there are some who, when there is a public contribution
          to be made for the poor, or some other pious and charitable use,
          sometimes take that opportunity to put off their bad money. That which
          they find, or think, their neighbors will refuse to take at their
          hands, because they will have opportunity to see what is offered them,
          and to observe the badness of it, even that they therefore take
          opportunity to put off to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hereby they endeavor to save their credit; for they apprehend that
          they shall be concealed. They appear with others to go to the
          contribution, as it is not known, but that they put in that which is
          good. But they cheat the church of God, and defraud the expectations
          of the poor, or rather, they lie to God, for those who receive what is
          given, stand as Christ’s receivers, and not as acting for themselves
          in this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          They that do thus, do that which is very much of the same nature with
          that sin, against which God denounces that dreadful curse in Mal.
          1:14, “Cursed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male, and
          voweth and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great
          King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the
          heathen.” That hath in his flock a male, i.e. That has in his flock
          that which is good and fit to be offered to God. For it was the male
          of the flock principally that was appointed, in the law of Moses, to
          be offered in sacrifice. He has in his flock that which is good, but
          he vows and sacrifices to the Lord “the torn, the lame, and the sick.”
          As it is said in the foregoing verse; ye said also, “Behold what a
          weariness is it, and ye have snuffed at it, saith the Lord of hosts;
          and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus
          ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hands? Saith the
          Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Contributions in the Christian church come in the room of sacrifices
          in the Jewish church. Mercy comes in the room of sacrifice. And what
          is offered in the way of mercy is as much offered to God, as the
          sacrifices of old were. For what is done to the poor is done to
          Christ, and he that hath pity on the poor, lendeth to the Lord; Pro.
          19:17. The Jews that offered the sick and lame of the flock, knew that
          if they had offered it to their governor, and had attempted to put it
          off, as part of the tribute or public taxes due to their earthly
          rulers, it would not be accepted, and therefore they were willing to
          put it off to God. “And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not
          evil? And if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? Offer it now
          unto thy governor, will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person?
          Saith the Lord of hosts.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So those persons who purposely put bad money into contributions, know
          that what they put in would not be accepted if they should offer to
          pay their public taxes. Yea, they know that their neighbors would not
          accept it at their hands; and therefore they are willing to save
          themselves, by putting it off to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This practice has also very much of the nature of the sin of Ananias
          and Sapphira. What they offered was by way of contribution for
          charitable uses. The brethren sold what they had, and brought it into
          a common stock, and put all under the care of deacons, that the poor
          might every one be supplied. Ananias and Sapphira brought a part of
          their possessions, and put it into the common stock. And their sin
          was, that they put it in for more than it really was. It was but a
          part of what they had, and they put it in, and would have it accepted,
          as if it had been all. So those among us, of whom I am speaking, put
          off what they put into the charitable stock, for more than it is. For
          they put it in, under the notion that it is something of some value.
          They intend it shall be so taken by the church that sees them go to
          the contribution, when indeed they put in nothing at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ananias and Sapphira were charged with lying to God, and doing an act
          of fraud towards God himself, in what they did. Acts 5:4, “Whilst it
          remained, was it not thine own? And after it was sold, was it not in
          thine own power? Why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?
          Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.” So those who knowingly put
          bad money for good into a contribution for a charitable use, as much
          as in them lies commit an act of fraud and deceit towards God. For the
          deacons who receive what is contributed, receive it not in their own
          names, but as Christ’s receivers. I hope these things may be
          sufficient to deter every reader from ever daring to do such a thing
          for the future.

          Again, another thing I would warn you against, is, stealing, properly
          and strictly so called; or designedly taking away any of your
          neighbor’s goods without his consent or knowledge. And especially I
          would now take occasion to warn against a practice which is very
          common in the country, particularly among children and young people;
          and that is, stealing fruit from their neighbor’s trees or enclosures.
          There is a licentious liberty taken by many children and young people,
          in making bold with their neighbor’s fruit. And it is to be feared,
          that they are too much countenanced in it by their parents and many
          elder people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am sensible, that the great thing which is pleaded, and made very
          much the ground of this liberty which is taken and so much tolerated,
          is a very abusive and unreasonable construction and application of
          that text of Scripture in Deu. 23:24, “When thou comest into thy
          neighbour’s vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill. But thou
          shalt not put any in thy vessel.” Because this text seems to be so
          much mistaken and misimproved, I shall therefore endeavor particularly
          to state the matter of persons taking their neighbor’s fruit, and to
          set it in a just and clear light as concerning this text.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was to eat their fill of grapes when they occasionally came into or
          passed through their neighbor’s vineyard, and not that they should go
          thither on purpose to eat grapes. This is manifest by the manner of
          expression; “When thou comest into thy neighbour’s vineyard, thou
          mayest eat;” i.e. when thou art come thither on some other occasion.
          If God had meant to give them leave to come thither on purpose, for no
          other end, it would not have been expressed so; but rather thus, Thou
          mayest come into thy neighbour’s vineyard, and eat grapes thy fill. —
          Such were the circumstances of that people, and vineyards among them
          were so common, that there was no danger that this liberty would be
          attended with ill consequence. It is manifest throughout the history
          of Israel, that vineyards among them were so common that the people in
          general had them. Every husbandman among them was a vine-dresser; and
          a great part of the business of a husbandman among them, consisted in
          dressing and taking care of his vineyards. Grapes seem to have been
          the most common sort of fruit that they had. Besides, there was no
          liberty given for persons to go on purpose to a vineyard to eat the
          fruit of it. So that there was no danger of neighbors suffering one by
          another, by any such liberty. — The liberty did not tend to any such
          consequence, as the flocking of a great number to eat grapes, whereby
          the fruit of the vineyard might be much diminished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such were the circumstances of the case, that the consent of the
          owners of vineyards in general might well be presumed upon, though no
          such express liberty had been given. You may remember that in the
          definition of stealing, I observed, that explicit consent is not
          always necessary; because the case may be so circumstanced, that
          consent may be well presumed on. And the reason why consent might well
          be presumed on in the case of eating grapes, of which we are now
          speaking, is, that there could be no sensible injury, nor any danger
          of any ill consequences, by which a man would sensibly suffer in the
          benefit of his vineyard. Hence it is the more easy to determine, what
          would and what would not be justified by this text, among us. Suppose
          a particular person among us had a vineyard of the same kind with
          those which the children of Israel had, it would not justify others in
          using the same liberty when occasionally passing through it; because
          it would be a rare thing, and the rarity and scarcity of the fruit
          would render it of much greater value. Besides, if one man [was]
          distinguished by such a possession, to allow of such a liberty would
          have a much greater tendency to ill consequences, than if they were
          common, as they were in the land of Canaan. There would be danger of
          many persons falsely pretending, and making occasions, to pass through
          the vineyard, for the sake of such rare fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor would it be a parallel case, if men in general among us had each
          of them a few vines. That would be a very different thing from persons
          in general having large vineyards. Nor would this text, in such a
          case, warrant men’s eating their fill of grapes when occasionally
          passing by. — And though all in general had vineyards, as they had in
          the land of Canaan, this text would not justify men in going into
          their neighbor’s vineyard on purpose to eat the fruit. No such liberty
          is given in the text. If there had been such liberty, it might have
          been of ill consequence. For the sake of saving their own grapes, men
          might make a practice of going and sending their children into their
          neighbor’s vineyard, to eat their fill from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the liberty given in this text to the children of Israel, seems to
          be very parallel with the liberty taken among us, to take up an apple
          or two and eat, as we are occasionally passing through a neighbor’s
          orchard; which, as our circumstances are, we may do, and justly
          presume that we have the owner’s consent. This is a liberty that we
          take, and find no ill consequences. It was very much so with vineyards
          in the land of Canaan, as it is with orchards among us. Apples in some
          countries are a rare fruit. And there it would by no means be
          warrantable for persons to take the same liberty when occasionally
          passing by their neighbor’s apple tree, which we warrantably take
          here, when going through a neighbor’s orchard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The consideration of these things will easily show the great abuse
          that is made of this text, when it is brought to justify such a
          resorting of children and others to their neighbor’s fruit trees, as
          is sometimes, on purpose to take and eat the fruit. Indeed this
          practice is not only not justified by the law of Moses, but it is in
          itself unreasonable, and contrary to the law of nature. The
          consequences of it are pernicious, so that a man can have no
          dependence on enjoying the fruit of his labor, or the benefit of his
          property in those things, which possibly he may very much value. He
          can have no assurance but that he shall be mainly deprived of what he
          has, and that others will not have the principal benefit of it; and so
          that his end in planting and cultivating that from which he expected
          those fruits of the earth, which God hath given for the use, comfort,
          and delight of mankind, will not be in the main frustrated.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION V</p>
        <p>An exhortation to honesty.</p>
        <p>
          Under this use, I shall confine myself to two particulars, many other
          things having been already spoken to.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I shall hence take occasion to exhort parents to restrain the
          children from stealing, and particularly from being guilty of theft in
          stealing the fruits of their neighbor’s trees or fields. Christian
          parents are obliged to bring up their children in the nurture and
          admonition of the Lord. But how much otherwise do they act, who bring
          them up in theft! And those parents are guilty of this, who — though
          they do not directly teach them to steal, by example and setting them
          about it, yet — tolerate them in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parents should take effectual care, not only to instruct their
          children better, and to warn them against any such thievish practices,
          but also thoroughly to restrain them. Children who practice stealing,
          make themselves vile. Stealing, by the common consent of mankind, is a
          very vile practice. Therefore those parents that will not take
          thorough care to restrain their children from such a practice, will be
          guilty of the same sin which God so highly resented, and awfully
          punished, in Eli, of which we read, 1 Sam. 3:13, “For I have told him,
          that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he
          knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them
          not.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, I exhort those who are conscious in themselves that they have
          heretofore wronged their neighbor to make restitution. This is a duty
          the obligation to which is exceedingly plain. If a person was wronged
          in taking away anything that was his, certainly he is wronged also in
          detaining it. And all the while that a person, who has been guilty of
          wronging his neighbor, neglects to make restitution, he lives in that
          wrong. He not only lives impenitent as to that first wrong of which he
          was guilty, but he continually wrongs his neighbor. A man who hath
          gotten anything from another wrongfully, goes on to wrong him every
          day that he neglects to restore it, when he has opportunity to do it.
          The person injured did not only suffer wrong from the other when his
          goods were first taken from him, but he suffers new injustice from him
          all the while they are unjustly kept from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore I counsel you who are conscious that you have heretofore
          wronged your neighbor, either by fraud, or oppression, or
          unfaithfulness, or stealing, whether lately or formerly, though it may
          have been a great while ago, speedily to go and make restitution for
          all the wrong your neighbor has suffered at your hands. That it was
          done long ago, doth not quit you from obligation to restore. This is a
          duty with which you must comply; you cannot be acquitted without it.
          As long as you neglect it, it will be unreasonable in you to expect
          any forgiveness of God. For what ground can you have to think that God
          will pardon you, as long as you willfully continue in the same wrong,
          and wrong the same many still every day, by detaining from him that
          which is his? You in your prayers ask of God, that he would forgive
          all your sins; but your very prayers are mockery, if you still
          willfully continue in those sins. — Indeed, if you go and confess your
          faults to your neighbor, and he will freely acquit you from making
          restitution, you will be acquitted from the obligation. For in so
          doing, your neighbor gives you what before was his. But otherwise you
          cannot be acquitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would leave this advice with all, for direction in their behavior on
          their deathbeds. Indeed you should not by any means put it off till
          you come to die; and you will run the most fearful risk in so doing.
          But if you will not do it now, while you are in health, I will leave
          it with you to remember, when you shall come to lie on your deathbeds.
          Doubtless, then if you have the use of your reason, you will be
          concerned for the salvation of your poor souls. And let this be one
          thing then remembered, as absolutely necessary in order to your
          salvation, that before you die, you must make restitution for whatever
          wrong you shall have done any of your neighbors; or at least leave
          orders that such restitution be made. Otherwise you will, as it were,
          go out of the world, and go before your great Judge, with stolen goods
          in your hands. And certainly it will not be very comfortable or safe,
          to bring them into his infinitely holy and dreadful presence, when he
          sits on his throne of judgment, with his eyes as a flame of fire,
          being more pure than to look on iniquity; when he is about to sentence
          you to your everlasting unalterable state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone here present, who has been guilty of wronging his neighbor,
          and has not made restitution, must die. Let all such therefore
          remember this counsel now given them, on the day when death shall
          approach, if they shall be so foolish as to neglect it till that time.
