          Hebrews 13:8, “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The exhortation which the apostle gives the Christian Hebrews in the
          verse preceding this is to remember and follow the good instructions
          and examples of their ministers. “Remember them who have the rule over
          you, who have spoken unto you the Word of God; whose faith follow,
          considering the end of their conversation.” The last part of this
          exhortation is to follow their faith. By following their faith, the
          apostle seems to intend adhering to the Christian faith and those
          wholesome doctrines which their pastors taught them and not depart
          from them, as many in that day had done, to heretical tenets. And the
          enforcement of the doctrine is in these words, “Considering the end of
          their conversation, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for
          ever.” Christ is the end of their conversation, he is the end of their
          conversation in their office, the end of the doctrines which they
          taught, and the end of all their administrations, and all their labors
          in all their work. And as he was so, they ought to follow their faith,
          or cleave steadfastly to the doctrines they had taught them, and not
          depart to other doctrines. For Jesus Christ was the same, yesterday,
          today, and forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they still professed to be Christians or the followers of Jesus
          Christ, then they should still cleave to the same doctrines that they
          were taught in their first conversion. They should still follow the
          faith of them who had first indoctrinated them in Christianity. For
          Jesus Christ was the same now that he was then, and therefore,
          Christianity was obviously the same thing. It was not one thing now
          and another when they were first converted, or even like to any other
          thing than it always had been. Surely therefore, when Christ and
          Christianity were thus unchangeable, he would therefore have them not
          fickle and changeable in their faith, not depart from their former
          faith, nor be carried about with divers and strange doctrines, as it
          follows in the next verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it is said that Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever,
          by yesterday is meant all time past; by today, the time present; and
          by forever, all that is future, from the present time to eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctrine. Jesus Christ is the same now that he ever has been and ever
          will be.
        </p>
        <p>Christ is thus unchangeable in two respects.</p>
        <p>
          I. In his divine nature. As Christ is one of the persons of the
          Trinity, he is God, and so has the divine nature, or the Godhead
          dwelling in him, and all the divine attributes belong to him, of which
          immutability or unchangeableness is one. Christ in his human nature
          was not absolutely unchangeable, though his human nature, by reason of
          its union with the divine, was not liable to those changes to which it
          was liable, as a mere creature. As for instance, it was indestructible
          and imperishable. Having the divine nature to uphold it, it was not
          liable to fall and commit sin, as Adam and the fallen angels did, but
          yet the human nature of Christ, when he was upon earth, was subject to
          many changes. It had a beginning. It was conceived in the womb of the
          Virgin. It was in a state of infancy, and afterwards changed from that
          state to a state of manhood, and this was attended not only with a
          change on his body, by his increasing in stature, but also on his
          mind. For we read that he not only increased in stature but also in
          wisdom. Luke 2:52. And the human nature of Christ was subject to
          sorrowful changes, though not to sinful ones. He suffered hunger, and
          thirst, and cold. And at last he suffered dreadful changes by having
          his body tortured and destroyed, and his soul poured out unto death.
          And afterwards became subject to a glorious change at his resurrection
          and ascension. And that his human nature was not liable to sinful
          changes, as Adam’s or the angels’, was not owing to anything in his
          human nature, but to its relation to the divine nature which upheld
          it. But the divine nature of Christ is absolutely unchangeable, and
          not liable to the least alteration or variation in any respect. It is
          the same now as it was before the world was created. It was the same
          after Christ’s incarnation as before, when Christ was born in a
          stable, and laid in a manger, and underwent many changes on earth, and
          at last suffered that dreadful agony in the garden, and suffered on
          the cross. It made no real alteration in the divine nature. And
          afterwards when Christ was glorified, and sat on the right hand of the
          Majesty of high, it made no alteration in his divine nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Christ is unchangeable in his office. He is unchangeable as the
          Mediator and Savior of his church and people. That unchangeableness of
          Christ in his office of Mediator, appears in several things.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, this office never ceases to give place to any other to come in
          his room. Christ is the only Mediator between God and man, that ever
          has been or ever shall be. He is an everlasting Savior. There have
          been typical mediators, many that have continued but a little while,
          and then have passed away, and others have come in their room. But the
          great antitype continues forever. There have been prophets, that have
          been raised up, and these have died, and others have succeeded them.
          Moses was not suffered to continue by reason of death. And the
          dispensation which he introduced was abolished to give place to
          another which Christ should introduce. Moses gives place to Christ,
          but Christ never gives place to any other. John the Baptist was a
          great prophet. He was Christ’s forerunner; like the morning star, the
          forerunner of the sun, he shone bright a little while, but his
          ministry by degrees ceased, and gave way to the ministry of Christ, as
          the morning star by little and little goes out as the sun rises. John
          3:30. John the Baptist says, “He must increase, but I must decrease.”
          But Christ’s ministry never ceases. So the ancient legal priests, they
          had but a changeable and short-lived priesthood. Aaron died, and his
          son Eleazar succeeded in his room. And so there were many priests, one
          after another. But Christ continues a priest forever. Heb. 7:23, 24.
          And they truly were many priests; and they were not suffered to
          continue by reason of death. But Christ, because he continueth ever,
          hath an unchangeable priesthood. These legal priests succeeded one
          another by inheritance. The father died and the son succeeded him, and
          then he died and his son succeeded him. But it is observed that
          Christ, in his priesthood, “is without father and without mother,
          without descent.” He had no ancestor that went before him in his
          priesthood, or any posterity that should succeed him in it. It that
          respect, Melchizedek is a type of Christ, of whom the Scriptures give
          us an account, that he was a priest, but seems not to have been a
          priest by inheritance, as the sons of Aaron were: as Heb. 7:3,
          “without father, and without mother, and without descent, having
          neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but made like unto the Son
          of God, abideth a priest continually:” And therefore it is said of
          Christ, Psa. 110:4, “The Lord hath sworn and will not repent. Thou art
          a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.” Those things that
          appertain to Christ’s priesthood are everlasting. The tabernacle at
          which the priests of old officiated was a tabernacle that men pitched,
          and therefore a tabernacle that was taken down. It was the holy of
          holies of old. But Christ is a minister of the true tabernacle and the
          true sanctuary, which the Lord has built, and not man. Heb. 8:2. The
          holy of holies he entered into was heaven. He is priest in a
          tabernacle which shall never be taken down, and in a temple that shall
          never be demolished. So the altar on which he offers incense, the
          priestly garments or robes in which he officiates, are not of a
          corruptible nature. And so Christ is everlasting with reference to his
          kingly office. David and Solomon were great kings, and eminent types
          of Christ. But death put an end of their kingdom and greatness.
          Earthly monarchies that ever have been, those that have ruled over the
          bigger part of the known world, as particularly the Grecian and Roman
          monarchies, they have come to an end, but Christ’s is an everlasting
          Kingdom, his throne is forever and ever. Heb. 1:8, “Thy throne, O God,
          is for ever and ever; a sceptre righteousness is the sceptre of thy
          kingdom.” Though all other kingdoms shall be demolished, Christ’s
          kingdom shall stand forever. Dan. 7:13, 14.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, Christ is at all times equally sufficient for the office he
          has undertaken. He undertook the office from eternity, and he was
          sufficient for it from eternity. He has been in the exercise of his
          office from the fall of man, and remains equally sufficient throughout
          all ages. His power and his wisdom, his love, his excellency, and
          worthiness is at all times equally sufficient for the salvation of
          sinners, and for the upholding and glorifying of believers. He is
          forever able to save, because he lives forever. His life is an endless
          and unchangeable life. He is made not after the law of a carnal
          commandment, but after the power of an endless life. Heb. 7:16. He is
          at all times equally accepted as a Mediator in the sight of the
          Father, who is ever well pleased in him. He is always equally worthy
          and lovely in his eyes. He is daily his delight, rejoicing always
          before him. The sacrifice that he has offered, and the righteousness
          that he has performed, is at all times equally sufficient. His blood
          is as sufficient to cleanse away sin now, as when it was warm from his
          wounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, he is now, and ever will be, the same that he ever has been in
          the disposition and will which he exercises in his office. He is not
          changeable in his disposition, as men are that are called to any
          office or business, which causes them to appear and act very
          differently in their offices at some times, from what they do at
          others. But Jesus Christ is, in this respect, the same yesterday,
          today, and forever. He is ever disposed to execute his office in a
          holy manner. He ever has been, still is, and ever will be disposed to
          execute it so as to glorify his Father, to discountenance sin, and to
          encourage holiness. He ever exercised the same grace and mercy in his
          office. He undertook the office of a Mediator from eternity with
          delight. He then delighted in the thoughts of saving sinners, and he
          still delights in it. He never has altered from the disposition to
          accomplish it. When man actually fell and became a rebel and an enemy,
          an enemy to his Father and himself; still it was his delight to do the
          part of a Mediator for him. And when he came into the world, and came
          to his last agony, when the bitter cup that he was to drink was set
          before him, and he had an extraordinary view of it, so that the sight
          of it made “his soul exceeding sorrowful even unto death,” and caused
          him to “sweat as it were great drops of blood;” still he retained his
          disposition to do the part of a Mediator for sinners, and delighted in
          the thoughts of it. So, even when he was enduring the cross, the
          salvation of sinners was a joy set before him, Heb. 12:2. And he never
          alters from his readiness to receive and embrace all that do in faith
          come to him. He is always equally willing to receive such. His love is
          unchangeable. He loved from eternity. Jer. 31:3. He loved with an
          everlasting love; and it will be to eternity. John 13:1, “Having loved
          his own he loved them unto the end.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever, as the end
          which he aims at in his office. His supreme end in it is the glory of
          God, as particularly in vindicating the honor of his majesty, justice,
          and holiness, and the honor of his holy law. For this end did he
          undertake to stand as a Mediator between God and man, and to suffer
          for men, viz. that the honor of God’s justice, majesty, and law may be
          vindicated in his sufferings. And he also undertook the office to
          glorify the free grace of God. And his special end in his undertaking
          was the salvation and happiness of the elect. These two ends he has in
          his eye in all parts of the work of his office. And these two ends he
          unchangeably aims at. These he sought on entering into covenant with
          the Father from eternity. These he has sought from the beginning of
          the world to this time, and these he ever will seek. He does not
          sometimes pursue one end, and then alter his mind and pursue another.
          But he ever pursues the same ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, Christ ever acts by the same rules in the execution of his
          mediatorial office.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rules that Christ acts by, in the execution of his office, are
          contained in a twofold covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The covenant of redemption, or the eternal covenant that was
          between the Father and the Son, wherein Christ undertook to stand as
          Mediator with fallen man, and was appointed thereto of the Father. In
          that covenant, all things concerning Christ’s execution of his
          mediatorial office were agreed between Christ and his Father, and
          established by them. And this covenant or eternal agreement is the
          highest rule that Christ acts by in his office. And it is a rule that
          he never in the least departs from. He never does anything, more or
          less, than is contained in that eternal covenant. Christ does the work
          that God gave him to do in that covenant, and no other. He saves
          those, and those only, that the Father gave him in that covenant to
          save. And he brings them to such a degree of happiness as was therein
          agreed. To this rule, Christ is unchangeable in his regard. It stands
          good with Christ in every article of it, yesterday, today, and
          forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Another covenant that Christ has regard to in the execution of his
          mediatorial office is that covenant of grace which God established
          with man. Though indeed this be less properly the rule by which Christ
          acts as Mediator than the covenant of redemption, yet it may be called
          a rule. God does, as it were, make his promises which he makes to his
          creatures, his rule to act by: i.e. all his actions are in an exact
          conformity to his promises, and he never departs in the least degree
          from them, as is the case with men with regard to what they make the
          rule of their actions. Yet it is not a rule to God in the same sense
          as a rule is to a created agent, which must be considered as something
          antecedent to the purposes of the agent, and that by which his
          purposes are regulated. But God’s promises are consequent on his
          purposes, and are no other than the expressions of them. And the
          covenant of grace is not essentially different from the covenant of
          redemption. It is but an expression of it. It is only that covenant of
          redemption partly revealed to mankind for their encouragement, faith,
          and comfort. And therefore the fact that Christ never departs from the
          covenant of redemption, infers that he will never depart from the
          covenant of grace. For all that was promised to men in the covenant of
          grace was agreed on between the Father and the Son in the covenant of
          redemption. However, there is one thing wherein Christ’s
          unchangeableness in his office appears: that he never departs from the
          promises that he has made to man. There is the same covenant of grace
          in all ages of the world. The covenant is not essentially different
          now from what it was under the Old Testament, and even before the
          flood. And it always will remain the same. It is therefore called an
          everlasting covenant, Isa. 55:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as Christ does not alter his covenant, so he unchangeably fulfills
          it. He never departs in the least jot or tittle. Though he has given
          exceedingly great and precious promises to those that believe in him,
          he ever fulfills them all. Heaven and earth shall sooner pass away,
          than one jot or one tittle of his promises shall fail, till all be
          fulfilled. It is especially on account of his unchangeableness with
          respect to his promises, that he styles himself, “I am that I am,” and
          is called “Jehovah,” Exo. 3:14, and 6:3. Christ revealed himself to
          the children of Israel, in their Egyptian bondage, by this name, to
          encourage the people that he would fulfill his promises made to
          Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth, He is in many respects unchangeable in the acts which he
          exercises in his office. He is unchangeable in his acceptance of those
          that believe in him, and never will reject them. And he is
          unchangeable in his complacency and delight in them. He is
          unchangeable in his intercession for his church and people. He ever
          lives to make intercession. Heb. 7:25. His intercession before God in
          heaven is a continual intercession. It is a constant presentation of
          his will before the Father for the salvation and happiness of those
          that are his in the virtue of his blood. And as Christ is unchangeable
          in his intercession, so he is unchangeable in upholding and preserving
          those that are his, and ordering all things for their good, until they
          are brought to his heavenly glory. He is constant and unchangeable in
          taking care of them in all respects, and will hereafter receive them
          to a constant and unchangeable enjoyment of himself.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          I. We learn from the truth taught in the text, how fit Christ was to
          be appointed as the surety of fallen man. Adam, the first surety of
          mankind, failed in his work, because he was a mere creature, and so a
          mutable being. Though he had so great a trust committed to him, as the
          care of the eternal welfare of all his posterity, yet, not being
          unchangeable, he failed, and transgressed God’s holy covenant. He was
          led aside, and drawn away by the subtle temptation of the devil. He
          being a changeable being, his subtle adversary found means to turn him
          aside, and so he fell, and all his posterity fell with him. It
          appeared, therefore, that we stood in need of a surety that was
          unchangeable, and could not fail in his work. Christ, whom God
          appointed to this work, to be to us a second Adam, is such an one that
          is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and therefore was not
          liable to fail in his undertaking. He was sufficient to be depended on
          as one that would certainly stand all trials, and go through all
          difficulties, until he had finished the work that he had undertaken,
          and actually wrought out eternal redemption for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This truth may be well applied to the awakening of those who
          profess to be Christians, and this on several accounts. You may be
          hence assured that Christ will fulfill his threatenings that he has
          denounced against unbelievers. There are many awful threatenings which
          Christ has denounced against wicked men. Christ has threatened woe to
          this wicked world, Mat. 18:7, and has declared concerning all, that do
          not believe, that they shall be damned. This is that which Christ gave
          in charge to his disciples before his ascension, when he sent them
          forth to preach and teach all nations. Mark 16:15, 16, “Go ye into all
          the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth
          shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned.” So Christ
          declares that every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be
          hewn down, and cast into the fire. Mat. 7:18. And he has especially
          threatened an awful punishment to gospel sinners. He has declared that
          every branch in him that beareth not fruit shall be cut off, and cast
          forth, and gathered up and burnt. And that, however wicked men and
          false Christians may dwell among the godly, as tares grow among wheat,
          yet when the harvest comes, and the wheat is gathered into the barn,
          the tares shall be gathered into bundles and burnt. Mat. 13:30. And in
          the explication of the parable, he says that, at the day of judgment,
          “the Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out
          of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity, and
          shall cast them into a furnace of fire, where shall be wailing and
          gnashing of teeth,” verse 41, 42. So he declares in Mat. 7:22-23,
          concerning those visible Christians that say to him, “Lord, Lord,” and
          that do not do the will of his Father which is in heaven, that he will
          hereafter profess unto them, that he never knew them, and that he will
          say unto them, “Depart from me, ye that work iniquity;” and that those
          that build their house on the sand shall fall, and that great shall be
          their fall; and that such as these shall see many coming from the
          east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and
          sitting down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of
          God, and themselves thrust out. And he teaches in his parables that
          unprofitable servants, and those that as professing Christians come to
          the gospel feast without the wedding garment, shall be bound hand and
          foot and cast into outer darkness, where shall be weeping and gnashing
          of teeth. He often denounces woe on hypocrites, and threatens
          concerning such as begin a life of religion and do not finish, and are
          not thorough and persevering in it, that they shall come to shame.
          That those who are foolish virgins, that take their lamps and take no
          oil with them, shall at last be shut from the marriage when others
          enter in with the bridegroom, and that when they come to the door,
          they shall find it shut, and shall cry, “Lord, Lord, open to us,” in
          vain. And that at the day of judgment, Christ shall separate the
          righteous from the wicked, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the
          goats, setting the righteous on the right hand, and the wicked on the
          left. And that he shall say to the wicked, “Depart, accursed, into
          everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.” And that the
          wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment. And particularly he
          has threatened concerning them that have not a spirit of self-denial,
          that do not cut off a right hand or a right foot, nor pluck out a
          right eye, that they shall go with two hands, or two feet, or two
          eyes, into hell-fire, into the fire that never shall be quenched,
          where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And that those
          that have not a spirit to sell all for his sake, and that do not in
          comparison of him hate father, and mother, and wife, and every earthly
          relative and earthly possession, shall not be acknowledged of him as
          his disciples. And concerning those that are ashamed of religion
          before men, that of them will he be ashamed before his Father and
          before the angels. And concerning those that are of a revengeful
          spirit, and not of a spirit of forgiveness, that they shall not be
          forgiven: and concerning all that are of a malicious spirit, and not
          of a spirit of Christian love and meekness, that are of an angry,
          wrathful, and scornful disposition, that say to their brother, “Raca,”
          or “Thou fool;” that they shall be in danger of everlasting punishment
          proportioned to the heinousness of their crimes. And concerning
          worldly-minded men, he has declared that ‘tis impossible for those
          that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God. Concerning such
          he has said, “Woe unto you that are rich, for ye have received your
          consolation; and woe unto you that are full, for ye shall hunger.” And
          concerning such as are addicted to carnal mirth and jollity, he says,
          “Woe unto you that laugh now, for ye shall mourn and weep.” And he has
          abundantly declared concerning gospel sinners, that their punishment
          shall be far more dreadful than that of the worst of the heathen. That
          it shall be more tolerable even for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
          judgment, than for them. And he has declared that those, that are once
          cast into hell, shall in no wise come out thence, until they have paid
          the uttermost farthing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such things as these did Christ threaten against the ungodly when he
          was here upon earth. And by the doctrine of the text you learn that he
          now is and ever will be the same that he was then. He has not at all
          altered, no, nor ever will. But these dreadful things that he has
          threatened, he will surely fulfill. Christ was no more disposed to
          threaten than to fulfill his threatenings. Christ is as holy, and his
          nature and will is as ever to sin now as ever it was. And he is as
          strictly just now as he was then.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, let no Christless person flatter himself, that, continuing
          such, he shall by any means escape punishment. Christ’s threatenings
          are the threatenings of one, that is the same yesterday, today, and
          forever. And what he has threatened with his mouth he will fulfill
          with his hands. When Christ appears at the day of judgment, and you
          shall stand at his bar to be judged, you will find him in judging,
          just what he was, and just what you find him in your Bibles, in
          threatening.
        </p>
        <p>III. The truth in the text may be applied by way of reproof.</p>
        <p>
          First, to those that have been heretofore under awakenings, but have
          now become senseless and careless. This doctrine shows your folly. You
          act as if Christ were altered, as though he were not now so dreadful a
          Judge, and his displeasure not so much to be feared, as heretofore.
          Time was when you were afraid of the displeasure and wrath of Christ.
          You were afraid of the dreadful sentence from his mouth, “Depart, ye
          cursed, into everlasting fire.” And why is it so much otherwise with
          you now? Is not the wrath of this Judge as much to be dreaded now, as
          ever it was? Time was, when those threatenings, that Christ has
          denounced against sinners, were terrible things to you. And why do you
          make so light of them now? Is this your great Judge grown weaker than
          he was, and less able to fulfill his threatenings? Are you less in his
          hands than you were, or do you imagine that Christ is become more
          reconciled to sin, and has not such a disposition to execute vengeance
          for it as he had?
        </p>
        <p>
          Time was, that you seemed to feel yourself to be in lamentable
          circumstances that you had not an interest in Christ, and to have a
          great mind to get an interest in him. You sought it, and prayed to God
          daily for it, and took considerable pains, and went and asked others
          what you should do to obtain an interest in Christ. Why is it that you
          are so much more careless about it now? Is Christ altered? Is an
          interest in him less valuable, or less necessary, now, than it was
          then? Was acceptance with him worth earnestly seeking, and praying,
          and striving for then, and is it good for nothing now? Did you stand
          in great need of it then, and can you do well enough without it now?
        </p>
        <p>
          Time was when you seemed to be much concerned about your having been
          guilty of so much sin against God and Christ, and, it may be, wept
          about it in your prayers. But now, you are not concerned about it. The
          thought of your having so often and so greatly offended him does not
          so much trouble you, but that you can be easy and quiet, and have your
          heart taken up about one vanity or another, without being very much
          disturbed with the thoughts of your sins. Then you used to be careful
          to avoid sin. You were watchful to avoid those things that were
          forbidden in God’s holy word. You were careful that you did not sin by
          profaning the Sabbath, or by unsuitably spending the time in God’s
          house, or by neglecting the duties of reading and prayer. You were
          careful of your behavior among men, lest you should transgress. If you
          suspected anything to be sinful then, you dared not do it. But now
          there is no such care upon your spirit, there is no such watch
          maintained, you have no such guard upon you. But when you are tempted
          to do or omit anything, it is not a thought coming with weight upon
          your heart, “Is this sinful or not?” “Is this contrary to the mind and
          will of God, or not?” You do not dwell long on such kind of thoughts
          as these. You are grown very bold, and live in neglects and practices
          that are sinful, and that you have light enough to know to be so. Just
          as if you thought that Christ’s disposition with respect to sin was
          altered, and that he was less an enemy to sin now than he was then.
          Instead of being less an enemy to sin than you then thought he was,
          and instead of being a less dreadful Judge of ungodly men than you
          then imagined, or had a sense of in your heart, he is a thousand times
          more so. For then, when you was most awakened and convinced, you
          conceived but very little of what is in reality. You apprehended very
          imperfectly the enmity of Christ’s nature against sin, and the
          dreadfulness of his wrath against the ungodly. It was but a little
          sense you had of it. His wrath is infinitely more dreadful than ever
          you have yet had any conception of.
        </p>
        <p>
          And though Christ be unchangeable, yet you are not. You are changed
          for the worse since the time when you were awakened. Christ is equally
          an enemy of sin, and you are become more sinful than you then were.
          Christ’s wrath is in itself equally dreadful as it then was. But you
          have far more reason to dread it than you had then, for you are in
          much greater danger of it. And, if you do not repent, [you] are much
          nearer to the execution of it. And not only so, but you are now
          exposed to much more of that wrath. Christ’s wrath hung over your head
          then, and so it does now, but with this difference, that now much more
          of that wrath hangs over you than did then. You hung over the pit of
          hell then, and so you do now. But with this difference, that you have
          ever since been kindling and enraging the flames of that fiery gulf
          over which you hang, so that they are vastly fiercer than they were
          then. And the moth of time has been nibbling at that slender thread
          ever since, and has much nearer gnawed it off than it had then. And
          your heart is far more hardened than it was. And the devil has faster
          hold of you, and the way to escape is more blocked up. And your case
          upon many accounts is inexpressibly more doleful, however much more
          careless and unconcerned you are about your own circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, this doctrine reproves all that have entered into the bonds of
          the Christian covenant, and have proved false to it. If Christ be the
          same yesterday, today, and forever, and is always the same towards us
          in fulfilling as he is in promising, then surely we ought to be so
          towards him. If he never breaks covenant with his people, then they
          are greatly to be reproved who are false and treacherous in their
          dealings with him. Therefore this reproves a covenant people that
          depart from Christ, and break covenant with him, as we in this land
          have done, having greatly revolted and degenerated both from the pure
          profession and religious practice of the first times of the country.
          Though Christ and his doctrine, and the religion that he taught, are
          always the same, yet this country has great multitudes in it that are
          driven to and fro by every wind of doctrine, and has now for a long
          time been exceedingly corrupted by the prevalency of many evil customs
          and practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          And by this doctrine is every particular person reproved that does not
          take care to keep covenant with Christ. We are in general under the
          solemn bonds of our baptismal covenant. And that covenant that was
          sealed in our baptism, most of us have explicitly owned, and expressly
          and solemnly promised to walk in, in a way of obedience to all the
          commands of God, as long as we live. And have, time after time, in the
          most solemn manner, sealed this covenant anew, by taking the body and
          blood of Christ upon it at the Lord’s supper. They bring dreadful
          guilt on themselves who are not careful to fulfill such vows. They
          that have solemnly vowed to obey Christ in all his commandments as
          long as they live, and have sealed these vows by eating and drinking
          at the Lord’s upper with far greater solemnity than if they sealed it
          with as many solemn oaths, yet live in ways of sin, live in the
          neglect of several commanded duties, and in the commission of
          forbidden sin, or at least do not make it the care of their lives
          strictly to keep Christ’s commands, surely such persons render
          themselves very guilty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, this doctrine reproves those that have been seemingly pious and
          have fallen away to ways of sin. Who these persons are, their own
          consciences are better able to judge than those that are about them.
          There are many here present, that in times past have been seemingly
          pious and let everyone inquire at the mouth of his own conscience
          whether his seeming piety holds on, whether it be not come to an end.
          If you find reason, by a serious and strict examination, to conclude
          that you are one of them, consider how vile is your treatment of him
          who is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and who never is false
          to any to whom he once manifests his favor. How greatly does God
          complain of such short-lived religion in the Scriptures! Hos. 6:4, “O
          Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto
          thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it
          goeth away.” Psa. 78:56-57, “They tempted and provoked the most high
          God, and kept not his testimonies, but turned back and dealt
          unfaithfully like their fathers; they were turned aside like a
          deceitful bow.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, hereby the truly godly are greatly to be reproved for their
          declension. There are many such here, as I charitably hope, and many
          of them I fear have been guilty of great declension in religion.
          Formerly they were lively and animated in religion, now they are dull
          and indifferent. Formerly their hearts went up on high after God, but
          now after the world. They carried themselves for a while very
          exemplary, but have since behaved in such a manner as to wound
          religion. Why will you be guilty of such a departure from your
          Redeemer, who changes not with regard to you? His love he formerly
          manifested towards you, but it does not change. It has ever held up to
          the same height. His faithfulness never has failed to you. Why then
          does your love so languish towards him, and why are you so unfaithful
          to him? He keeps up the same care and watchfulness towards you, to
          preserve you, to provide for you, to defend you from your enemies, and
          why will you suffer your care and strictness to serve and please
          Christ, and honor him, to fail in any measure?
        </p>
        <p>
          When you were first converted, your heart seemed to be wrapt up in
          love to Christ, and delight in him and his praises. You were then
          continually meditating on Christ and the things of Christ, and your
          meditations on him were sweet. And you were then much in speaking of
          those things, and you delighted to speak of them. And why is it so
          much otherwise with you now? Is Christ less excellent than he was
          then? Is he less worthy of your love?
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, this doctrine affords matter of reproof to us of this town, for
          our declining is much from what we have lately been. That we have
          exceedingly declined in religion is most manifest and what all
          confess. A little while ago Christ was the great object of regard
          among us. The hearts of the people in general were greatly engaged
          about Christ, as though Christ had been all, and the world nothing.
          There was then a great deal of conversation among all sorts of
          persons, and in all companies, of Christ. They who thought they had no
          interest in Christ were full of concern how to obtain an interest in
          him. And they were almost ready to neglect their worldly concerns, as
          though Christ was all they needed. And with regard to those that
          thought they had obtained an interest in Christ, their thoughts and
          their conversation seemed also to be very much taken up about Christ.
          They were much engaged in talking of the excellency of Christ, and
          seemed to be full of the grace and dying love of Christ. And one and
          another of you expressed the strong sense you had of one perfection
          and excellency and another of Christ, and of the glory of the works
          that he has done, and of the sweetness of the words that he speaks.
          The town seemed to be full of the praises of Christ. You expressed to
          one another how you earnestly longed to praise him and bless his name
          forever and ever, and how you desired that others should help you to
          praise him. The benefits procured by Christ were then greatly valued
          in the town, and both Christ and his benefits were then precious among
          us. And multitudes seemed to be concerned what they should do for the
          honor of Christ, how they should live to his glory, and do something
          for the advancement of his kingdom in the world. But now, how much
          otherwise is it. How little is Christ set by, in comparison of what he
          has been. How much is he neglected, how much is he dropped out of
          people’s common discourse and conversation! How have many of you left
          off earnestly following after Christ, to pursue after the world. One
          to pursue after riches, another to be engrossed by amusement and
          diversion, another by fine clothes and gay apparel. And all sorts,
          young and old, have gone their way wandering in a great measure from
          Christ: as though Christ was not as excellent now as he was then, as
          though his grace and dying love were not as wonderful now as they were
          then, as though Christ were not now as much preferable to the world,
          as worthy to be loved, and to be praised, to be thought of, and talked
          of; and as though he was not as worthy that we should be concerned to
          honor him, and live to his praise, as ever he was. If Christ be as
          much altered as the town is altered, he is altered very much indeed.
          Are we so foolish as to think that he, that is the same yesterday,
          today, and forever, is so much altered from what he was three years
          ago?
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The truth taught in the text may be applied by way of
          encouragement.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, to sinners whose minds are burdened and exercised with concern
          about the state of their souls, to come to Christ, and put their trust
          in him for salvation. If Christ is now and ever will be the same that
          he ever was, then here is great encouragement for you to come to him,
          as will appear by considering two things:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How Christ has invited you to come to him with promises that he
          will accept of you if you do so. Christ in his word often invites
          those that are in your circumstances, whether we consider your
          circumstances as a lost sinner, or as a sinner under anxiety and
          concern about your condition. If we consider your circumstances merely
          as a lost sinner, Christ invites you. For he is often inviting and
          calling on sinners to come to him. Pro. 8:4, “Unto you, O men, I call,
          and my voice is to the sons of men.” And chap. 9:4, 5, “Whoso is
          simple, let him turn in hither; and ye that want understanding, come,
          eat of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have mingled.” Rev.
          3:20, “Behold, I stand at the door and knock.” Rev. 22:17, “The Spirit
          and the bride say, Come.” Or if we consider your circumstances as a
          sinner burdened in your soul with concern about your condition, such
          are especially invited by Christ. Mat. 11:28, “Come unto me, all ye
          that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” And Isa.
          55:1, “Ho every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.” And John
          7:37, “If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.” That Christ
          is the same yesterday, today, and forever, shows what a joint
          encouragement these invitations are for you to come to Christ in two
          ways:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It shows that as Christ invited such sinners, when these
          invitations were spoken and penned, so he does now, for he is the same
          now that he was then. So that you are to look on the invitations that
          you find in your Bible, not only as invitations that were made then
          when they were first spoken or written, but that are made now. Christ
          makes them now as much as he made them then. Those invitations which
          proceeded out of Christ’s mouth when he was on earth are made to you
          now as much as if they now this moment proceeded from Christ’s mouth.
          For there is no alteration in Christ. He is the same as ever he has
          been. So that when you read or hear any of the invitations of Christ,
          you may look upon them as if they now came from his blessed lips.

        <p>
          (2.) It shows that if you come to Christ, he will surely prove to be
          the same in accepting that he is in inviting. Christ will be
          consistent with himself. He will not appear one way in calling and
          inviting you, and then another way in his treatment of you when you
          come to accept of his invitation. Christ will not appear with two
          faces, with a pleasant winning face in inviting, and with a frowning
          countenance in his treatment of persons that come at his call. For he
          is ever the same. You see that Christ is exceedingly gracious and
          sweet in his invitations. And he surely will be as gracious and sweet
          in his acceptance of you, if you close with his call. And then Christ
          does not merely invite, he also promises, that if you accept of his
          invitation, he will not reject you. John 6:37, “Him that cometh unto
          me I will in no wise cast out.” He that is the same yesterday, today,
          and forever, will be found the same in fulfilling that he is in
          promising.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How Christ has treated those that have come to him heretofore.
          Christ in times past has graciously received those that have come to
          him. He has made them welcome. He has embraced them in the arms of his
          love. He has admitted them to a blessed and eternal union with himself
          and has given them a right to all the privileges of the sons of God.
          And he is the same still that he has been heretofore. We have an
          account in Scripture of many that came to him. We have an account in
          the history of Christ’s life of many that accepted his calls, and we
          have an account in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, of multitudes
          that believed in him. But we read of none that ever were rejected by
          him. And we ourselves have seen many that we have reason to think
          Christ has accepted on their coming to him, many that have been great
          sinners, many that have been old hardened sinners, many that had been
          backsliders, and many that had been guilty of quenching the Spirit of
          God. And he is the same still. He is as ready to receive such sinners
          now as he was then. Christ never yet rejected any that came to him. He
          has always been the same in this respect. He is so now, and so he
          surely will be still.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, there is in this doctrine great encouragement to all persons
          to look to Christ under all manner of difficulties and afflictions,
          and that especially from what appeared in Christ when he was here. We
          have an account in the history of Christ of great numbers under a
          great variety of afflictions and difficulties, resorting to him for
          help. And we have no account of his rejecting one person who came to
          him in a friendly manner for help, under any difficulty whatever. But
          on the contrary, the history of his life is principally filled up with
          miracles that he wrought for the relief of such. When they came to
          him, he presently relieved them, and always did it freely without
          money or price. We never read of his doing anything for any person as
          hired to it, by any reward that was offered him. And he helped persons
          fully, he completely delivered them from those difficulties under
          which they labored. And by the doctrine of the text we learn that
          though he is not now upon earth, but in heaven, yet he is the same
          that he was then. He is as able to help, and he is as ready to help
          under every kind of difficulty. Here is great encouragement for
          persons who are sick to look to Christ for healing, and for their near
          friends to carry their case to Christ; for how ready was Christ, when
          on earth, to help those that looked to him under such difficulties!
          And how sufficient did he appear to be for it, commonly healing by
          laying on his hand, or by speaking a word! And we read of his healing
          all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
          Persons under the most terrible and inveterate diseases were often
          healed. And Christ is the same still. And here is great encouragement
          for mourners to look to Christ for comfort. We read of Christ’s
          pitying such, as in the case of the widow of Nain, Luke 7:12, 13 etc.
          “And so he wept with those that wept, and groaned in spirit, and wept
          with compassion for Martha and Mary, when he saw their sorrow for the
          loss of their brother Lazarus, John 11:32, etc. And he is the same
          still. He is as ready to pity those that are in affliction now as he
          was then.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here is great encouragement for those that are exercised with the
          temptations of Satan. For how often do we read of Christ casting out
          Satan from those of whom he had the strongest possession! And Christ
          is the same still. And whoever are under spiritual darkness, from the
          consideration of their own sinfulness, have encouragement hence to
          look to Christ for comfort. For if they do so, he will be ready to say
          to them, as he did to the paralytic, “Son, be of good cheer; thy sins
          are forgiven thee.” For he is still the same that he was then.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The truth taught in the text may be applied by way of consolation
          to the godly. You may consider that you have in him an unchangeable
          Savior, who, as he has loved you and undertaken for you from eternity,
          and in time has died for you before you were born, and has since
          converted you by his grace, and brought you out of a blind, guilty,
          and undone condition, savingly home to himself; so he will carry on
          his work in your heart; he will perfect what is yet lacking in you, in
          order to your complete deliverance from sin, and death, and all evil,
          and to your establishment in complete and unalterable blessedness.
          From the unchangeableness of your Savior, you may see how he thinks of
          that chain in Rom. 8:29, 30, “For whom he did foreknow them he also
          did predestinate, and whom he did predestinate them he also called,
          and whom he called them he also justified, and whom he justified them
          he also glorified.” The Savior has promised you very great and
          precious blessings in this world. And things which eye has not seen,
          nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, in the world to come.
          And from his unchangeableness you may be assured that the things which
          he has promised he will also perform.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may from this doctrine see the unchangeableness of his love. And
          therefore, when you consider how great love he seemed to manifest,
          when he yielded himself up to God a sacrifice for you, in his agony
          and bloody sweat in the garden, and when he went out to the place of
          his crucifixion bearing his own cross, you may rejoice that his love
          now is the same that it was then.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so when you think of past discoveries which Christ has made of
          himself in his glory, and in his love to your soul, you may comfort
          yourself that he is as glorious, and his love to you is as great, as
          it was in the time of these discoveries.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may greatly comfort yourself that you have an unchangeable friend
          in Christ Jesus. Constancy is justly looked upon as a most necessary
          and most desirable qualification in a friend. That he be not fickle,
          and so that his friendship cannot be depended on as that of a steady
          sure friend. How excellent his friendship is, you may learn from his
          manner of treating his disciples on earth, whom he graciously treated
          as a tender father his children, meekly instructing them, most
          friendly conversing with them, and being ready to pity them, and help
          them, and forgive their infirmities. And then you may consider this
          doctrine, and how it thence appears that he is the same still that he
          was then, and ever will be the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the unchangeableness of your Savior, you may be assured of your
          continuance in a state of grace. As to yourself, you are so
          changeable, that, if left to yourself, you would soon fall utterly
          away. There is no dependence on your unchangeableness. But Christ is
          the same, and therefore, when he has begun a good work in you he will
          finish it. As he has been the author, he will be the finisher of your
          faith. Your love to Christ is in itself changeable. But his to you is
          unchangeable, and therefore he will never suffer your love to him
          utterly to fail. The apostle gives this reason why the saints’ love to
          Christ cannot fail, viz. that his love to them never can fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the unchangeableness of Christ you may learn the unchangeableness
          of his intercession, how he will never cease to intercede for you. And
          from this you may learn the unalterableness of your heavenly
          happiness. When once you have entered on the happiness of heaven, it
          never shall be taken from you, because Christ, your Savior and friend,
          who bestows it on you, and in whom you have it, is unchangeable. He
          will be the same forever and ever, and therefore so will be your
          happiness in heaven. As Christ is an unchangeable Savior, so he is
          your unchangeable portion. That may be your rejoicing, that however
          your earthly enjoyments may be removed, Christ can never fail. Your
          dear friends may be taken away and you suffer many losses. And at last
          you must part with all those things. Yet you have a portion, a
          precious treasure, more worth, ten thousand times, than all these
          things. That portion cannot fail you, for you have it in him, who is
          the same yesterday, today, and forever.
