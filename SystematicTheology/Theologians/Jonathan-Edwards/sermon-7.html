          Ezekiel 22:14, “Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong
          in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the Lord save spoken it,
          and will do it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          IN the former part of this chapter, we have a dreadful catalogue of
          the sins of Jerusalem; as you may see from the first to the thirteenth
          verse. In the thirteenth, which is the verse preceding the text, God
          manifests his great displeasure and fearful wrath against them for
          those their iniquities. “Behold, I have smitten mine hand at thy
          dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been
          in the midst of thee.” The expression of God’s smiting his hand,
          signifies the greatness of his anger, and his preparing himself, as it
          were to execute wrath answerable to their heinous crimes. It is an
          allusion to what we sometimes see in men when they are surprised, by
          seeing or hearing of some horrid offence, or most intolerable injury,
          which very much stirs their spirits, and animates them with high
          resentment; on such an occasion they will rise up in wrath and smite
          their hands together, as an expression of the heat of their
          indignation, and full resolution to be avenged on those who have
          committed the injury; as in chap. 21:7. ” I will also smite mine hands
          together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the Lord have said it,”
        </p>
        <p>Then, in the text, the punishment of that people is represented.</p>
        <p>
          1. The nature of their punishment is more generally represented in
          that therein God will undertake to deal with them: God here threatens
          to deal with the sinners in Jerusalem. The prophets could do nothing
          with them. God had sent them one after another; but those sinners were
          too strong for them, and beat one, and killed another. Therefore now
          God himself undertakes to deal with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Their punishment is more particularly represented in three things,
          viz. The intolerableness, the remedilessness, and the unavoidableness
          of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) The intolerableness of it: Can thine heart endure?<br />
          (2.) The remedilessness, or the impossibility of their doing any thing
          for their own relief: Can thine hands be strong?<br />
          (3.) The unavoidableness of it: I the Lord have spoken it, and will do
          it.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          Since God hath undertaken to deal with impenitent sinners, they shall
          neither shun the threatened misery, nor deliver themselves out of it,
          nor can they bear it.
        </p>
        <p>In handling this doctrine, I shall,</p>
        <p>
          1. Show what is implied in God’s undertaking to deal with impenitent
          sinners.<br />
          2. That therefore they cannot avoid punishment.<br />
          3. That they cannot in any measure deliver themselves from it, or do
          any thing for their own relief under it.<br />
          4. That they cannot bear it.<br />
          5. I shall answer an inquiry; and then proceed to the use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I shall show what is implied in God’s undertaking to deal with
          impenitent sinners…Others are not able to deal with them. They baffle
          all the means used with them by those that are appointed to teach and
          to rule over them. They will not yield to parents, or to the counsels,
          warning, or reproofs of ministers. They prove obstinate and
          stiff-hearted. Therefore God undertakes to deal with them This implies
          the following things:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That God will reckon with them, and take of them satisfaction to
          his justice. In this world God puts forth his authority to command
          them; and to require subjection to him. In his commands he is very
          positive, strictly requiring of them the performance of such and such
          duties, and as positively forbidding such and such things which were
          contrary to their duty. But they have no regard to these commands. God
          continues commanding, and they continue rebelling. They make nothing
          of God’s authority. God threatens, but they despise his threatening
          They make nothing of dishonoring God; they care not how much their
          behavior is to the dishonor of God. He offers them mercy, if they will
          repent and return; but they despise his mercy as well as his wrath.
          God calleth, but they refuse. Thus they are continually plunging
          themselves deeper and deeper in debt, and at the same time imagine
          they shall escape the payment of the debt, and design entirely to rob
          God of his due.
        </p>
        <p>
          But God hath undertaken to right himself. He will reckon with them; he
          hath undertaken to see that the debts due to him are paid. All their
          sins are written in his book; not one of them is forgotten, and every
          one must be paid. If God be wise enough, and strong enough, he will
          have full satisfaction: he will exact the very uttermost farthing. He
          undertakes it as his part, as what belongs to him, to see himself
          righted, wherein he hath been wronged Deut. 22:35. “To me belongeth
          vengeance.” Ibid. vii. 10. “He will not be slack to him that hateth
          him; he will repay him to his face.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He hath undertaken to vindicate the honor of his Majesty. His
          Majesty they despise. They hear that he is a great God; but they
          despise his greatness; they look upon him worthy of contempt, and
          treat him accordingly. They hear of him by the name of a great King;
          but his authority they regard not, and sometimes trample upon it for
          years together. But God hath not left the honor of his Majesty wholly
          to their care. Though they now trample it in the dust, yet that is no
          sign that it will finally be lost. If God had left it wholly in their
          hands, it would indeed be lost. But God doth not leave his honor and
          his glory with his enemies; it is too precious in his eyes to be so
          neglected. He hath reserved the care of it to himself: He will see to
          it that his own injured Majesty is vindicated. If the honor of God,
          upon which sinners trample, finally lie in the dust, then it will be
          because he is not strong enough to vindicate himself. He hath sworn
          that great oath in Numbers 14:2 1. “As truly as I live, all the earth
          shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Sinners despise his Son, and trample him under their feet. But he will
          see, if he cannot make the glory of his Son appear, with respect to
          them; that all the earth may know how evil a thing it is to despise
          the Son of God. God intends that all men and angels, all heaven and
          all earth, shall see whether he be sufficient to magnify himself upon
          sinners who now despise him. He intends that the issue of things with
          respect to them shall be open, that all men may see it.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. He hath undertaken to subdue impenitent sinners. Their hearts while
          in this world are very unsubdued. They lift up their heads and conduct
          themselves very proudly and contemptuously, and often sin with an high
          hand. They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongues
          walk through the earth. They practically say as Pharaoh did, “Who is
          the Lord? I know not the Lord, neither will I obey his voice.” Job
          21:4 1. “They say to God, Depart from us, for we desire not the
          knowledge of thy ways.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Some, who cover their sin with specious show, who put on a face of
          religion, and a demure countenance and behavior, yet have this spirit
          secretly reigning in their breasts. Notwithstanding all their fair
          show, and good external carriage, they despise God in their hearts,
          and have the weapons of war about them, though they are secret
          enemies, and carry their swords under their skirts. They have most
          proud, stubborn, and rebellious hearts, which are ready to rise in
          opposition, to contend with him, and to find fault with his
          dispensations. Their hearts are full of pride, enmity, stubbornness,
          and blasphemy, which work in them many ways, while they sit under the
          preaching of the word, and while the spirit of God is striving with
          them; and they always continue to oppose and resist God as long as
          they live in the world; they never lay down the weapons of their
          rebellion.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But God hath undertaken to deal with them and to subdue them; and
          those proud and stubborn hearts, which will not yield to the power of
          God’s word, shall be broken by the power of his hand. If they will not
          be willing subjects to the golden sceptre, and will not yield to the
          attractives of his love, they shall be subject to the force of the
          iron rod, whether they will or no.
        </p>
        <p>
          Them that proudly set up their own righteousness, and their own wills
          against God, God hath undertaken to bring down; and without doubt, it
          will be done. He hath undertaken to make those who are now regardless
          of God, regard him. They shall know that he is Jehovah. Now they will
          not own that he is the Lord; but they shall know it, Isa. 26:11.
          “Lord, when thine hand is lifted up, they will not see: But they shall
          see.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Now wicked men not only hate God, but they slight him; they are not
          afraid of him. But, he will subdue their contempt. When he shall come
          to take them in hand, they will hate him still; but they will not
          slight him; they will not make light of his power as they now do; they
          will see and feel too much of the infinity of his power to slight it
          They are now wont to slight his wrath; but then they will slight it no
          more, they will be infinitely far from it, they will find by
          sufficient experience that his wrath is not to be slighted: They will
          learn this to their cost, and they never will forget it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. God hath undertaken to rectify their judgments. Now they will not
          be convinced of those things which God tells them in his word.
          Ministers take much pains to convince them, but all is in vain.
          Therefore God will undertake to convince them, and he will do it
          effectually. Now they will not be convinced of the truth of divine
          things. They have indeed convincing arguments set before them; they
          hear and see enough to convince them; yet so prone are they to
          unbelief and Atheism, that divine things never seem to them to be
          real. But God will hereafter make them seem real.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now they are always doubting of the truth of the Scriptures,
          questioning whether they be the word of God, and whether the
          threatenings of Scripture be true. but God hath undertaken to convince
          them that those threatenings are true, and he will make them to know
          that they are true, so that they will never doubt any more for ever.
          They will be convinced by dear experience….Now they are always
          questioning whether there be any such place as hell. They hear much
          about it, but it always seems to them like a dream. But God will make
          it seem otherwise than a dream….Now they are often told of the vanity
          of the world; but we may as well preach to the beasts, to persuade
          them of the vanity of earthly things. But God will undertake to
          convince them of this; he will hereafter give them a thorough
          conviction of it, so that they shall have a strong sense of the vanity
          of all these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now ministers often tell sinners of the great importance of an
          interest in Christ, and that that is the one thing needful. They are
          also told the folly of delaying the care of their souls, and how much
          it concerns them to improve their opportunity. But the instructions of
          ministers do not convince them, therefore God will undertake to
          convince them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Impenitent sinners, while in this world, hear how dreadful hell is.
          But they will not believe that it is so dreadful as ministers
          represent. They cannot think that they shall to all eternity suffer
          such exquisite and horrible torments. But they shall be taught and
          convinced to purpose, that the representations ministers give of those
          torments, agreeable to the word of God, are no bugbears; and that the
          wrath of God is indeed as dreadful as they declare. Since God hath
          undertaken to deal with sinners, and to rectify their judgments in
          these matters, and he will do it thoroughly; for his work is perfect;
          when he undertakes to do things, he doth not do them by halves;
          therefore before he shall have done with sinners, be will convince
          them effectually, so that they shall never be in danger of relapsing
          into their former errors any more. He will convince them of their
          folly and stupidity in entertaining such notions as they now
          entertain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus God hath undertaken to deal with obstinate unbelievers. They
          carry things on in great confusion; but we need not be dismayed at it:
          Let us wait, and we shall see that God will rectify things. Sinners
          will not always continue to rebel and despise with impunity. The honor
          of God will in due time be vindicated; and they shall be subdued and
          convicted, and shall give an account. There is no sin, not so much as
          an idle word that they shall speak, but they must give an account of
          it; Matt. 12: 36. And their sins must be fully balanced, and
          recompensed, and satisfaction obtained. Because judgment against their
          evil works is not speedily executed, their hearts are fully set in
          them to do evil. Yet God is a righteous judge; he will see that
          judgment is executed in due time.
        </p>
        <p>I come now,</p>
        <p>
          II. To show, that therefore impenitent sinners shall not avoid their
          due punishment….God hath undertaken to inflict it; he hath engaged to
          do it; he takes it as his work, as what properly belongs to him, and
          we may expect it of him. If he hath sworn by his life, that he will do
          it; and if he hath power sufficient; if he is the living God,
          doubtless we shall see it done. And that God hath declared that he
          will punish impenitent sinners, is manifest from, many scriptures; as
          Deut. 32:41. “I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward
          them that hate me.” Deut. vii. 10. “He will not be slack to him that
          hateth him: He will repay him to his face.” Exod. 34:7. “That will by
          no means clear the guilty.” Nahum 1:3. “The Lord is slow to anger, and
          great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked. “God saith in
          the text, “I the Lord hath spoken it, and will do it;” which leaves no
          room to doubt of the actual fulfillment of the threatening in its
          utmost extent….Some wicked men have flattered themselves, that
          although God hath threatened very dreadful things to wicked men for
          their sins, yet in his heart he never intends to fulfill his
          threatenings, but only to terrify them, and make them afraid, while
          they live. But would the infinitely holy God, who is not a man that he
          should lie, and who speaketh no vain words, utter himself in this
          manner: I the Lord have spoken it, and will do it; I have not only
          threatened, but I will also fulfill my threatenings; when at the same
          time these words did not agree with his heart, but he secretly knew
          that though he had spoken, yet he intended not to do it? Who is he
          that dares to entertain such horrid blasphemy in his heart?
        </p>
        <p>
          No; let no impenitent sinner flatter himself so vainly and foolishly.
          If it were indeed only a man, a being of like impotency and mutability
          with themselves, who had undertaken to deal with them; they might
          perhaps with some reason flatter themselves; that they should find
          some means to avoid the threatened punishment. But since an
          omniscient, omnipotent, immutable God hath undertaken, vain are all
          such hopes.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no hope that possibly they may steal away to heaven, though
          they die unconverted. There is no hope that they can deceive God by
          any false show of repentance and faith, and so be taken to heaven
          through mistake; for the eyes of God are as a flame of fire; they
          perfectly see through every man; the inmost closet of the heart is all
          open to him
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no hope of escaping the threatened punishment by sinking into
          nothing at death, like brute creatures Indeed, many wicked men upon
          their deathbeds wish for this. If it were so, death would be nothing
          to them in comparison with what it now is. But all such wishes are
          vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no hope of their escaping without notice, when they leave the
          body. There is no hope that God, by reason of the multiplicity of
          affairs which ho hath to mind, will happen to overlook them, and not
          take notice of them, when they come to die; and so that their souls
          will slip away privately, and hide themselves in some secret corner,
          and so escape divine vengeance.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no hope that they shall be missed in a crowd at the day of
          judgment, and that they can have opportunity to hide themselves in
          some cave or den of the mountains, or in any secret hole of the earth;
          and that while so doing, they will not be minded, by reason of the
          many things which will be the objects of attention on that
          day….Neither is there any hope that they will be able to crowd
          themselves in among the multitude of the saints at the right hand of
          the Judge, and so go to heaven undiscovered….Nor is there any hope
          that God will alter his mind, or that he will repent of what he hath
          said; for he is not the son of man that lie should repent. Hath he
          said, and shall he not do it? Hath he spoken, and shall he not make it
          good? When did God ever undertake to do any thing and fail?
        </p>
        <p>I come now,</p>
        <p>
          III. To show, that as impenitent sinners cannot shun the threatened
          punishment; so neither can they do any thing to deliver themselves
          from it, or to relieve themselves under it. This is implied in those
          words of the text, Can thine hand. be strong? It is with our hands
          that we make and accomplish things for ourselves. But the wicked in
          hell will have no strength of hand to accomplish any thing at all for
          themselves, or to bring to pass any deliverance, or any degree of
          relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They will not he able in that conflict to overcome their enemy, and
          so to deliver themselves. God, who will then undertake to deal with
          them, and will gird himself with might to execute wrath, will be their
          enemy, and will act the part of an enemy with a witness; and they will
          have no strength to oppose him. Those who live negligent of their
          souls under the light of the gospel, act as if they supposed, that
          they should be able here after to make their part good with God. 1
          Cor. 10:22. “Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than
          he? “…But they will have no power, no might to resist that
          omnipotence, which will be engaged against them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They will have no strength in their hands to do any thing to
          appease God, or in the least to abate the fierceness of his wrath.
          They will not be able to offer any satisfaction: they will not be able
          to procure God’s pity. Though they cry, God will not hear them. They
          will find no price to offer to God, in order to purchase any favor, or
          to pay any part of their debt.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They will not be able to find any to befriend them, and intercede
          with God for them. They had the offer of a mediator often made them in
          this world; but they will have no offers of such a nature in hell.
          None will befriend them. They will have no friend in HELL; all there
          will be their enemies. They will have no friend in heaven: ‘None of
          the saints or angels will befriend them; or if they should, it would
          be to no purpose. There will be no creature that will have any power
          to deliver them, nor will any ever pity them.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Nor will they ever be able to make their escape. They will find no
          means to break prison and flee. In hell, they will be reserved in
          chains of darkness for ever and ever. Malefactors have often found
          means to break prison, and escape the hand of, civil justice. But none
          ever escaped out of the prison of hell, which is God’s prison. It is a
          strong prison: it is beyond any finite power, or the united strength
          of all wicked men and devils, to unlock, or break open the door of
          that prison. Christ hath the key of hell; “he shuts and no man opens.”
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Nor will they ever be able to find any thing to relieve them in
          hell. They will never find any resting place there; any place of
          respite; any secret corner, which will be cooler than the rest, where
          they may have a little respite, a small abatement of the extremity of
          their torment. They never will be able to find any cooling stream or
          fountain, in any part of that world of torment; no, nor so much as a
          drop of water to cool their tongues. They will find no company to give
          them any comfort, or to do them the least good. They will find no
          place, where they can remain, and rest, and take breath for one
          minute: For they will be tormented with fire and brimstone; and will
          have no rest day nor night for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus impenitent sinners will be able neither to shun the punishment
          threatened, nor to deliver themselves from it, nor to find any relief
          under it.
        </p>
        <p>I come now,</p>
        <p>
          IV. To show, that neither will they be able to bear it. Neither will
          their bands be strong to deliver themselves from it, nor will their
          hearts be able to endure it. It is common with men, when they meet
          with calamities in this world, in the first place to endeavor to shun
          them. But if they find, that they cannot shun them, then after they
          are come, they endeavor to deliver themselves from them as soon as
          they can; or at least, to order things so, as to deliver themselves in
          some degree. But if they find that they can by no means deliver
          themselves, and see that the case is so that they must bear them; then
          they set themselves to bear them: they fortify their spirits, and take
          up a resolution, that they will support themselves under them as well
          as they can.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it will be utterly in vain for impenitent sinners to think to do
          thus with respect to the torments of hell. They will not be able to
          endure them, or at all to support themselves under them: the torment
          will be immensely beyond their strength. What will it signify for a
          worm, which is about to be pressed under the weight of some great
          rock, to be let fall with its whole weight upon it, to collect its
          strength, to set itself to bear up the weight of the rock, and to
          preserve itself from being crushed by it? Much more in vain will it be
          for a poor damned soul, to endeavor to support itself under the weight
          of the wrath of Almighty God. What is the strength of man, who is but
          a worm, to support himself against the power of Jehovah, and against
          the fierceness of his wrath? What is man’s strength, when set to bear
          up against the exertions of infinite power? Matt. 21:. 44, “Whosoever
          shall fall on this stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall
          fall, it will grind him to powder.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When sinners hear of hell torments, they sometimes think with
          themselves: Well, if it shall come to that, that I must go to hell, I
          will bear it as well as I can: as if by clothing themselves with
          resolution and firmness of mind, they would be able to support
          themselves in some measure; when, alas! they will have no resolution,
          no courage at all. However they shall have prepared themselves, and
          collected their strength; yet as soon as they shall begin to feel that
          wrath, their hearts will melt and be as water. However before they may
          seem to harden their hearts, in order to prepare themselves to bear,
          yet the first moment they feel it, their hearts will become like wax
          before the furnace. Their courage and resolution will be all gone in
          an instant; it will vanish away like a shadow in the twinkling of an
          eye. The stoutest and most sturdy will have no more courage than the
          feeblest infant: let a man be an infant, or a giant, it will be all
          one. They will not be able to keep alive any courage, any strength,
          any comfort, any hope at all.
        </p>
        <p>I come now as was proposed,</p>
        <p>
          V. To answer an inquiry which may naturally be raised concerning these
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inquiry. Some may be ready to say, If this be the case, if impenitent
          sinners can neither shun future punishment, nor deliver themselves
          from it, nor bear it; then what will become of them?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer. They will wholly sink down into eternal death. There will be
          that sinking of heart, of which we now cannot conceive. We see how it
          is with the body when in extreme pain. The nature of the body will
          support itself for a considerable time under very great pain, so as to
          keep from wholly sinking. There will be great struggles, lamentable
          groans and panting, and it may be convulsions. These are the
          strugglings of nature to support itself under the extremity of the
          pain. There is, as it were, a great lothness in nature to yield to it;
          it cannot bear wholly to sink.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yet sometimes pain of body is so very extreme and exquisite, that
          the nature of the body cannot support itself under it; however loath
          it may be to sink, yet it cannot bear the pain; there are a few
          struggles, and throes, and pantings, and it may be a shriek or two,
          and then nature yields to the violence of the torments, sinks down,
          and the body dies. This is the death of the body. So it will be with
          the soul in hell; it will have no strength or power to deliver itself
          and its torment and horror will be so great, so mighty, so vastly
          disproportioned to its strength, that having no strength in the least
          to support itself, although it be infinitely contrary to the nature
          and inclination of the soul utterly to sink; yet it will sink, it will
          utterly and totally sink, without the least degree of remaining
          comfort, or strength, or courage, or hope. And though it will never be
          annihilated, its being and perception will never be abolished, yet
          such will be the infinite depth of gloominess that it will sink into,
          that it will be in a state of death, eternal death.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nature of man desires happiness; it is the nature of the soul to
          crave and thirst after well-being; and if it be under misery, it
          eagerly pants after relief; and the greater the misery is, the more
          eagerly doth it struggle for help. But if all relief be withholden,
          all strength overborne, all support utterly gone; then it sinks into
          the darkness of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can conceive but little of the matter; we cannot conceive what that
          sinking of the soul in such a case is. But to help your conception,
          imagine yourself to be cast into a fiery oven, or of a great furnace,
          where your pain would be as much greater than that occasioned by
          accidentally touching a coal of fire, as the heat is greater. Imagine
          also that your body were to lie there for a quarter of an hour, all
          the while full of quick sense; what horror would you feel at the
          entrance of such a furnace! And how long would that quarter of an hour
          seem to you! And after you had endured it for one minute, how
          overbearing would it be to you to think that you had it to endure the
          other fourteen!
        </p>
        <p>
          But what would be the effect on your soul, if you knew you must lie
          there enduring that torment to the full for twenty-four hours! And how
          much greater would be the effect, if you knew you must endure it for a
          whole year; and how vastly greater still, if you knew you must endure
          it for a thousand years! O then, how would your heart sink, if you
          thought, if you knew, that you must bear it forever and ever! That
          there would be no end! That after millions of millions of ages, your
          torment would be no nearer to an end, than ever it was; and that you
          never, never should be delivered!
        </p>
        <p>
          But your torment in hell will be immensely greater than this
          illustration represents. How then will the heart of a poor creature
          sink under it! How utterly inexpressible and inconceivable must the
          sinking of the soul be in such a case!<br />
          This is the death threatened in the law. This is dying in the highest
          sense of the word. This is to die sensibly; to die and know it; to be
          sensible of the gloom of death. This is to be undone; this is worthy
          of the name of destruction. This sinking of the soul under an infinite
          weight, which it cannot bear, is the gloom of hell. We read in
          Scripture of the blackness of darkness; this is it, this is the very
          thing. We read in Scripture of sinners being lost, and of their losing
          their souls: this is the thing intended; this is to lose the soul:
          they that are the subjects of this are utterly lost.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          This subject may be applied in a use of awakening to impenitent
          sinners. What hath been said under this doctrine is for thee, O
          impenitent sinner, O poor wretch, who art in the same miserable state
          in which thou camest into the world, excepting that thou art loaded
          with vastly greater guilt by thine actual sins. These dreadful things
          which thou hast heard are for thee, who art yet unconverted, and still
          remainest an alien and stranger, without Christ and without God in the
          world. They are for thee, who to this day remainest an enemy to God,
          and a child of the devil, even in this remarkable season, when others
          both here and elsewhere, far and near, are flocking to Christ; for
          thee who hearest the noise, the fame of these things, but knowest
          nothing of the power of godliness in thine own heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whoever thou art, whether young or old, little or great, if thou art
          in a Christless, unconverted state, this is the wrath, this is the
          death to which thou art condemned. This is the wrath that abideth on
          thee; this is the hell over which thou hangest, and into which thou
          art ready to drop every day and every night.
        </p>
        <p>
          If thou shalt remain blind, and hard, and dead in sin a little longer,
          this destruction will come upon thee: God hath spoken and he will do
          it. It is vain for thee to flatter thyself with hopes that thou shalt
          avoid it, or to say in thine heart, perhaps it will not be; perhaps it
          will not be just so; perhaps things have been represented worse than
          they are. If thou wilt not be convinced by the word preached to thee
          by men in the name of God, God himself will undertake to convince
          thee, Ezekiel 14:. 4, 7, 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doth it seem to thee not real that thou shalt suffer such a dreadful
          destruction, because it seems to thee that thou dust not deserve it?
          And because thou dust not see any thing so horrid in thyself, as to
          answer such a dreadful punishment? Why is it that thy wickedness doth
          not seem bad enough to deserve this punishment? The reason is, that
          thou lovest thy wickedness; thy wickedness seems good to thee; it
          appears lovely to thee; thou dust not see any hatefulness in it, or to
          be sure, any such hatefulness as to answer such misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          But know, thou stupid, blind, hardened wretch, that God doth not see,
          as thou seest with thy polluted eyes: thy sins in his sight are
          infinitely abominable.-Thou knowest that thou hast a thousand and a
          thousand times made light of the Majesty of God. And why should not
          that Majesty, which thou hast thus despised, be manifested in the
          greatness of thy punishment? Thou hast often heard what a great and
          dreadful God Jehovah is; but thou hast made so light of it, that thou
          hast not been afraid of him, thou hast not been afraid to sin against
          him, nor to go on day after day, by thy sins, to provoke him to wrath,
          nor to cast his commands under foot, and trample on them. Now why may
          not God, in the greatness of thy destruction, justly vindicate and
          manifest the greatness of that Majesty, which thou hast despised?
        </p>
        <p>
          Thou hast despised the mighty power of God; thou hast not been afraid
          of it. Now why is it not fit that God should show the greatness of his
          power in thy ruin? What king is there who will not show his authority
          in the punishment of those subjects that despise it! And who will not
          vindicate his royal majesty in executing vengeance on those that rise
          in rebellion? And art thou such a fool as to think that the great King
          of heaven and earth, before whom all other kings are so many
          grasshoppers, will not vindicate his kingly Majesty on such
          contemptuous rebels as thou art?-Thou art very much mistaken if thou
          thinkest so. If thou be regardless of God’s Majesty, be it known to
          thee, God is not regardless of his own Majesty; he taketh care of the
          honor of it, and he will vindicate it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think it not strange that God should deal so severely with thee, or
          that the wrath which thou shalt suffer should be so great. For as
          great as it is, it is no greater than that love of God which thou hast
          despised. The love of God, and his grace, condescension, and pity to
          sinners in sending his Son into the world to die for them, is every
          whit as great and wonderful as this inexpressible wrath. This mercy
          hath been held forth to thee, and described in its wonderful greatness
          hundreds of times, and as often hath it been offered to thee; but thou
          wouldst not accept Christ; thou wouldst not have this great love of
          God; thou despisedst God’s dying love; thou trampledst the benefits of
          it under foot. Now why shouldst thou not have wrath as great as that
          love and mercy which thou despisest and rejectest? Doth it seem
          incredible to thee, that God should so harden his heart against a poor
          sinner, as so to destroy him, and to bear him down with infinite power
          and merciless wrath? And is this a greater thing than it is for thee
          to harden thy heart, as thou hast done, against infinite mercy, and
          against the dying love of God?
        </p>
        <p>
          Doth it seem to thee incredible, that God should be so utterly
          regardless of the sinner’s welfare, as so to sink him into an infinite
          abyss of misery? Is this shocking to thee? And is it not at all
          shocking to thee, that thou shouldst be so utterly regardless as thou
          hast been of the honor and glory of the infinite God?<br />
          It arises from thy foolish stupidity and senselessness, and is because
          thou hast a heart of stone, that thou art so senseless of thine own
          wickedness as to think thou hast not deserved such a punishment, and
          that it is to thee incredible that it will be inflicted upon thee.-But
          if, when all is said and done, thou be not convinced, wait but a
          little while, and thou wilt be convinced: God will undertake to do the
          work which ministers cannot do. -Though judgment against thine evil
          works be not yet executed, and God now let thee alone, yet he will
          soon come upon thee with his great power, and then thou shalt know
          what God is, and what thou art.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flatter not thyself, that if these things shall prove true, and the
          worst shall come, thou wilt set thyself to bear it as well as thou
          canst. What will it signify to set thyself to bear, and to collect thy
          strength to support thyself, when thou shalt fall into the hands of
          that omnipotent King, Jehovah? He that made thee, can make his sword
          approach unto thee. His sword is not the sword of man, nor is his
          wrath the wrath of man. If it were, possibly stoutness might be
          maintained under it. But it is the fierceness of the wrath of the
          great God, who is able to baffle and dissipate all thy strength in a
          moment. He can fill thy poor soul with an ocean of wrath, a deluge of
          fire and brimstone; or he can make it ten thousand times fuller of
          torment than ever an oven was full of fire; and at the same time, can
          fill it with despair of ever seeing an end to its torment, or any rest
          from its misery: and then where will be thy strength? What will become
          of thy courage then? What will signify thine attempts to bear?
        </p>
        <p>
          What art thou in the hands of the great God, who made heaven and earth
          by speaking a word? What art thou, when dealt with by that strength,
          which manages all this vast universe, holds the globe of the earth,
          directs all the motions of the heavenly bodies from age to age, and,
          when the fixed time shall come, will shake all to pieces? There are
          other wicked beings a thousand times stronger than thou: there are the
          great leviathans, strong and proud spirits, of a gigantic stoutness
          and hardiness. But how little are they in the hands of the great God!
          They are less than weak infants; they are nothing, and less than
          nothing in the hands of an angry God, as will appear at the day of
          judgment. Their hearts will be broken; they will sink; they will have
          no strength nor courage left; they will be as weak as water; their
          souls will sink down into an infinite gloom, an abyss of death and
          despair. Then what will become of thee, a poor worm, when thou shalt
          fall into the hands of that God, when he shall come to show his wrath,
          and make his power known on thee?
        </p>
        <p>
          If the strength of all the wicked men on earth, and of all the devils
          in hell, were united in one, and thou wert possessed of it all; and if
          the courage, greatness, and stoutness of all their hearts were united
          in thy single heart, thou wouldst be nothing in the hands of Jehovah.
          If it were all collected, and thou shouldst set thyself to bear as
          well as thou couldst, all would sink under his great wrath in an
          instant, and would be utterly abolished: thine hands would drop down
          at once and thine heart would melt as wax.-The great mountains, the
          firm rocks, cannot stand before the power of God; as fast as they
          stand, they are tossed hither and thither, and skip like lambs, when
          God appears in his anger. He can tear the earth in pieces iii a
          moment; yea, lie can shatter the whole universe, and dash it to pieces
          at one blow. How then will thine hands be strong, or thine heart
          endure?
        </p>
        <p>
          Thou canst not stand before a lion of the forest; an angry wild beast,
          if stirred up, will easily tear such a one as thou art in pieces. Yea,
          not only so, but thou art crushed before the moth. A very little
          thing, a little worm or spider, or some such insect, is able to kill
          thee. What then canst thou do in the hands of God? It is vain to set
          the briers and thorns in battle array against glowing flames; the
          points of thorns, though sharp, do nothing to withstand the fire.
        </p>

          Some of you have seen buildings on fire; imagine therefore with
          yourselves, what a poor hand you would make at fighting with the
          flames, if you were in the midst of so great and fierce a fire. You
          have often seen a spider, or some other noisome insect, when thrown
          into the midst of a fierce fire, and have observed how immediately it
          yields to the force of the flames. There is no long struggle, no
          fighting against the fire, no strength exerted to oppose the heat, or
          to fly from it; but it immediately stretches forth itself and yields;
          and the fire takes possession of it, and at once it becomes full of
          fire. Here is a little image of what you will be the subjects of in
          hell, except you repent and fly to Christ. However you may think that
          you will fortify yourselves, and bear as well as you can; the first
          moment you shall be cast into hell, all your strength will sink and be
          utterly abolished. To encourage yourselves, that you will set
          yourselves to bear hell torments as well as you can, is just as if a
          worm, that is about to be thrown into a glowing furnace, should swell
          and fortify itself and prepare itself to fight the flames.

          What can you do with lightnings? What doth it signify to fight with
          them? What an absurd figure would a poor weak man make, who, in a
          thunder-storm, should expect a flash of lightning on his head or his
          breast, and should go forth sword in hand to oppose it; when a stream
          of brimstone would, in an instant, drink up all his spirits and his
          life, and melt his sword!<br />
          Consider these things, all you enemies of God, and rejecters of
          Christ, whether you be old men or women, Christless heads of families,
          or young people and wicked children. Be assured, that if you do not
          hearken and repent, God intends to show his wrath, and make his power
          known upon you. He intends to magnify himself exceedingly in sinking
          you down in hell. He intends to show his great majesty at the day of
          judgment, before a vast assembly, in your misery; before a greater
          assembly many thousand fold than ever yet appeared on earth; before a
          vast assembly of saints, and a vast assembly of wicked men, a vast
          assembly of holy angels, and before all the crew of devils. God will
          before all these get himself honor in your destruction; you shall be
          tormented in the presence of them all. Then all will see that God is a
          great God indeed; then all will see how dreadful a thing it is to sin
          against such a God, and to reject such a Saviour, such love and grace,
          as you have rejected and despised. All will be filled with awe at the
          great sight, and all the saints and angels will look upon you, and
          adore that majesty, and that mighty power, and that holiness and
          justice of God, which shall appear in your ineffable destruction and
          misery.

          It is probable that here are some, who hear me this day, who at this
          very moment are unawakened, and are in a great degree careless about
          their souls. I fear there are some among us who are most fearfully
          hardened: their hearts are harder than the very rocks. It is easier to
          make impressions upon an adamant than upon their hearts. I suppose
          some of you have heard all that I have said with ease and quietness:
          it appears to you as great big sounding words, but doth not reach your
          hearts. You have heard such things many times: you are old soldiers,
          and have been too much used to the roaring of heaven’s cannon, to be
          frighted at it. It will therefore probably be in vain for me to say
          any thing further to you; I will only put you in mind that ere long
          God will deal with you. I cannot deal with you, you despise what I
          say; I have no power to make you sensible of your danger and misery,
          and of the dreadfulness of the wrath of God. The attempts of men in
          this way have often proved vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, God hath undertaken to deal with such men as you are. It is
          his manner commonly first to let men try their utmost strength:
          particularly to let ministers try, that thus he may show ministers
          their own weakness and impotency; and when they have done what they
          can, and all fails, then God takes the matter into his own hands. So
          it seems by your obstinacy, as if God intended to undertake to deal
          with you. He will undertake to subdue you; he will see if he cannot
          cure you of your senselessness and regardlessness of his threatenings.
          And you will be convinced; you will be subdued effectually: your
          hearts will be broken with a witness; your strength will be utterly
          broken, your courage and hope will sink. God will surely break those
          who will not bow. God, having girded himself with his power and wrath,
          hath heretofore undertaken to deal with many hard stubborn, senseless,
          obstinate hearts; and he never failed, he always did his work
          thoroughly.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will not be long before you will be wonderfully changed. You who
          now hear of hell and the wrath of the great God, and sit here in these
          seats so easy and quiet, and go away so careless; by and by will
          shake, and tremble, and cry out, and shriek, and gnash your teeth, and
          will be thoroughly convinced of the vast weight and importance of
          these great things, which you now despise.
