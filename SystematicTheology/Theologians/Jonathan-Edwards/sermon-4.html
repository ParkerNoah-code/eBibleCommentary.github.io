          Matthew 11:16-19, “But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is
          like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their
          fellows, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced;
          we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. For John came
          neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. The Son of
          man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous,
          and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is
          justified of her children.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THE occasion of this discourse was John’s sending to Christ two of his
          disciples, saying, “Art thou he that should come, or look we for
          another?” When the messengers had gone back, Christ enters into a
          discourse with the multitude concerning John, of which the verses read
          are a part, in which Christ reproves the unreasonableness of the Jews
          in rejecting God’s messengers. We may observe in the words the
          following things:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The messengers of God that are here instanced in that they had been
          rejected, viz. John the Baptist and Christ. The former is spoken of in
          the context as being on some accounts the greatest of all the prophets
          that ever came before Christ, as you may see, verses 9-11, “But what
          went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than
          a prophet. For this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
          messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
          Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath
          not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is
          least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.” The latter, even
          Christ, was the great prophet of God, the Head and Lord of the
          prophets, God’s only-begotten Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. In what the unreasonableness of their rejecting these messengers
          of God appears, viz. in their inconsistency with themselves in those
          objections which they made against them. And here we may observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the nature of their objections against these two messengers of
          God. They objected against their manner of living with respect to
          their meat and drink.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the different manner of living of those two messengers of God.
          Christ came eating and drinking, but John came neither eating nor
          drinking, i.e. John lived on a very coarse and spare diet, as we read,
          Mat. 3:4, “And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a
          leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild
          honey.” He carefully abstained from that free use of pleasant meats
          and drinks that others allowed themselves in. But Christ came eating
          and drinking, i.e. freely using the comforts and enjoyments of life,
          taking indifferently all kinds of food or drink that were wholesome,
          comfortable, and lawful. This diverse manner of living of John the
          Baptist and Christ was agreeable to the diverse errands that they came
          upon. John’s errand was to call men to repentance, to awaken them to a
          sense of their sin and misery, to bring them to mourn for their sins,
          and humble themselves before God for them, that they might be prepared
          for the comforts and blessings of the kingdom of heaven that were to
          be introduced by Jesus Christ. A life of abstinence from the pleasant
          things of this world was agreeable to the purpose of awakening the
          soul and of leading it to mourning and humiliation for sin, which it
          was especially John’s business to preach and set an example of.
        </p>
        <p>
          But after John had thus prepared the way with awakenings and
          repentance, then Christ came to administer comfort to those that were
          thus prepared for it, to preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up
          the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the
          opening of the prison to them that are bound, to proclaim the
          acceptable year of the Lord, to comfort those that mourn, to appoint
          unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the
          oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of
          heaviness, that they might be called trees of righteousness, the
          planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified. Isa. 61:1-3. And
          freely eating and drinking, and enjoying the comforts and pleasant
          things of life, [were] agreeable to such an errand as this, and
          therefore Christ, in his first beginning of his public ministry which
          succeeded John’s, declares this to be the business he was come upon.
          Luke 4:16-19, “And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up;
          and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day,
          and stood up for to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of
          the prophet Esaias: and when he had opened the book he found the place
          where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because
          he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me
          to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
          recovering of sight to the blind; to set at liberty them that are
          bruised; to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, their unreasonableness appears in the fact that though the way
          of living of these two persons was in this respect so diverse, yet
          they objected against both. John came neither eating nor drinking. And
          for that they objected against him, and reviled him, as though he was
          one that was very odd and strange, and beside himself, and under the
          influence of a diabolical spirit. This objection seemed to manifest a
          dislike of such a way of living, as though it was their opinion that a
          man ought not to live thus abstemiously, but should eat and drink
          freely as other people did. But yet when Christ came and did that,
          then they objected against that too, and bitterly reproached him for
          that, and called him a glutton, and wine-bibber, a friend of publicans
          and sinners. So that there was no escaping their reproaches. If a man
          of God lived a life of trial and abstinence, they spoke of it as
          matter of great reproach, and yet if he did not so, they made that a
          matter of no less reproach. It was a crime with them for a prophet to
          eat and drink, and it was also a crime to let it alone. So
          inconsistent were they with themselves that there was not such thing
          as a prophet’s suiting them. They condemned the doing of that which at
          the same time they condemned the not doing of, and both they condemned
          with great bitterness, and virulent and contemptuous reproaches. This
          plainly showed that their objections against John the Baptist and
          Christ were but vain pretenses, and that the true reason why they
          disliked them was not the manner of living of either of them with
          respect to eating and drinking, but because they hated their persons
          and the business they came upon. When men have a prejudice against
          other persons they will be ready to find fault with everything in
          them, they will find out bad names for their virtues, and will
          reproach those things in them which they will approve of and commend
          in others to whose persons they have a liking.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The thing to which Christ compares their inconsistency with
          themselves, to wit, to children who meet their companions in the
          streets or market-places, and endeavor to aid them in their play, in
          things of a diverse and contrary nature. For it they pipe unto them
          with notes manifesting cheerfulness and mirth, that does not suit
          them. They refuse to fall in with this, as though they did not like
          such cheerfulness, and as though mourning would suit them better. And
          then, when they see that they took a contrary course, they mourned
          with them, but yet neither do they fall in with that, they do not
          lament with the. So that they comfort them in nothing, neither mirth
          nor mourning.
        </p>
        <p>
          So John the Baptist preaching repentance came with tokens of sorrow
          and mourning, and mean apparel, with a garment of camel’s hair, and
          with a leathern girdle about his loins, and with great abstinence. But
          Christ when he comes, comes eating and drinking with tokens of comfort
          and joy. But neither of them suited them. From the text thus explained
          we shall derive the following.
        </p>
        <p>Doctrine. Wicked men are very inconsistent with themselves.</p>
        <p>They are so in the following respects:</p>
        <p>
          I. The dictates of their darkened understandings are inconsistent with
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>II. Their wills are inconsistent with their reason.</p>
        <p>III. Their wills are inconsistent with themselves.</p>
        <p>IV. Their outward show is inconsistent with their hearts.</p>
        <p>V. Their profession is inconsistent with their practice.</p>
        <p>VI. Their practice is inconsistent with their hopes.</p>
        <p>VII. Their practice is inconsistent with itself.</p>
        <p>
          I. Their understandings are inconsistent with themselves. I do not
          mean that the faculty of reason and understanding is inconsistent with
          itself. For the faculty of understanding with which God has endowed
          man is wholly good and right. It is that wherein the natural image of
          God consists, and is the excellency of man’s nature. And if the
          faculty of reason be duly improved, it will lead men right. Light is
          never inconsistent with itself. But the understandings of natural men
          are perverted and blinded by sin, and are inconsistent with themselves
          in two ways:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, their practical judgment is inconsistent with their own reason.
          By their practical judgment, I mean that judgment which they make of
          things that prevail, so as to determine their actions and govern their
          practice. This in wicked men is in innumerable things contrary to
          their own reason. For, in forming their judgment of things by which
          they govern themselves, they do not inquire at the mouth of reason,
          but at the mouth of their inclinations. Their lusts have a far greater
          hand in the judgments that they make of things, and by which they
          govern themselves, than their reason. As for instance, their practical
          judgment is that the things of this fading world, the enjoyments of
          this short life, are things of greater importance than the things of
          the eternal world; and yet if they inquire at the mouth of their own
          reason, that tells them the contrary. Their reason tells them that it
          is most plain and evident that eternal things, things that are to last
          forever, are of vastly greater importance than the things of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          So their reason tells them that it must needs be the part of wisdom
          and prudence to improve the present time with the utmost diligence and
          earnestness, and to make ready for death. And yet they are not
          convinced of it, but their governing opinion is, that it is best to
          neglect the business of religion for the present, and to enjoy their
          ease, and sloth, and lusts awhile longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their reason tells them, that it is well worth the while for every man
          to deny himself outward pleasure for the good of his soul. But their
          governing opinion or judgment is contrary, viz. that it is not best.
          and that pleasures and the gratification of their lusts are worth more
          than any benefit they would obtain by seeking their salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason of young people tells them that it is their true wisdom to
          improve the time of youth. Reason tells them that life is very
          uncertain. But when such persons hear ministers preach concerning the
          infinite importance of eternal things. the uncertainty of life, the
          peace and comfort that will be found in a state of happier existence
          with God, are told how light a thing the difficulty and sufferings of
          a holy life are in comparison, their reason assents to all this, but
          their practical judgments are the contrary. When a person has lately
          died, either in extreme terror and amazement, under a sense of the
          guilt of a mispent life, or full of joy and comfort, in consequence of
          a life of holy walking with God, their reason tells them that it would
          be well worth their while to labor and deny themselves all their
          lifetime to be ready for death, and to have a solid foundation of
          peace and comfort laid up against such an hour. But yet their practice
          is directly the reverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, some of their judgments of things are inconsistent with
          others. For instance, in temporal things, they judge that the good
          which is of long continuance is to be preferred before that which is
          of short continuance, and that a long-continued calamity is more to be
          dreaded and avoided than a short one. Their governing judgment is thus
          in these things, but yet it is the reverse in spiritual things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, such arguments as they judge to furnish good and clear evidence
          with them in those things that are agreeable to their sinful
          inclination, they think not to have any evidence in those things that
          are contrary to them. In temporal things they think it to be their
          wisdom to improve times of special advantage, and to watch against
          that which might ensnare them, or endanger their welfare, but in other
          things they think the reverse. In these things, and many more that
          might be mentioned, their judgments are inconsistent with themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Their wills are inconsistent with their reason. This inconsistency
          is a consequence of the foregoing. For if their practical judgment be
          contrary to their own reason, it will follow that their wills are
          contrary to their reason. For the will ever follows the dictate of the
          practical judgment.
        </p>
        <p>Their wills are contrary to their reason in two respects.</p>
        <p>
          First, they will those things which their reason tells them are
          inconsistent with their duty. And so they are inconsistent with
          themselves, as their wills are inconsistent with their consciences.
          Conscience is a principle implanted in the heart of every man, and is
          as essential to his nature as the faculty of reason, for it is a
          natural and necessary attendant of that faculty. But the wills of
          wicked men are contrary to it, and inconsistent with it. They choose
          those things which they know to be evil, and ought not to be chosen.
          They choose that which their own reason tells them is unreasonable and
          vile, and unbecoming men, and justly provoking to their Maker, and
          contrary to the end for which they are made.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence arises an inward war in their own minds. Their wills and their
          consciences warring one against another. There is no true peace in
          their hearts, for they are at war with themselves, and therefore they
          are like the troubled sea that cannot rest, unless by a course of
          horrible violations of the dictates of their own conscience, they have
          proceeded so far in their war against their own consciences as to
          stupefy conscience, and lay it as it were dead, which is the case of
          some persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, they will those things which their reason tells them are
          contrary to their own interest, yea, those things which their own
          reason tells them are the way to their ruin and misery. At the very
          same time that wicked men are tempted to commit some sin, and their
          reason then tells them that it will expose them to the eternal wrath
          of God, and that it will therefore be a dreadful folly for them to do
          it, yet they will do it. Or when their reason tells them that the
          course in which they are going leads to destruction, and represents to
          them that it is the greatest folly, yet they will go on in it, and run
          the venture of being everlastingly undone.
        </p>
        <p>
          So inconsistent are they with themselves, that they do and allow that
          of which they hope to repent, they choose that now for choosing which
          at the same time they expect and hope hereafter to charge themselves
          with great folly, and to be convinced that it is folly, and to lament
          and bewail it. Nay, they would not do it if they did not expect
          hereafter to see that it is very foolish in them so to do, and
          heartily to mourn for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this respect they are so inconsistent with themselves that they are
          their own worst enemies. They are inconsistent with themselves, as two
          mortal enemies cannot consist together, or walk together. By choosing
          those things which their own reason tells them is contrary to their
          own interest, and tends to their own undoing, they may be said to hate
          their own souls, and to love their own ruin. Pro. 8:36, “He that
          sinneth against me, wrongeth his own soul; all they that hate me, love
          death.”
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Their wills and dispositions are inconsistent with their wills.
          The Jews would neither have a prophet to come eating and drinking, nor
          would they have him otherwise. They knew not what they would have
          themselves, there was no pleasing them. To eat and drink did not
          please them; that they reproached as drunkenness, and gluttony. Nor
          did it please them any more not to eat nor drink. This they reproached
          no less virulently, as though it were an argument that a man was out
          of his wits, and possessed by the devil. The inconsistency of wicked
          men’s wills with themselves appears in the following things:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, they do, in some respects, choose and refuse the same things.
        </p>
        <p>I shall mention some instances.</p>
        <p>
          1. In some respects, many of them wish to be converted from sin to
          God. They think that they should be ready to give almost all that they
          have in the world to be converted, and they pray to God to convert
          them, and seek for conversion, and take advice to that end, and use a
          great deal of labor for it. But yet if it be considered what
          conversion is, or what is meant by conversion, viz. the being turned
          from all their sins to God. They have no desire to be converted, they
          will not have conversion when it is offered them, when it comes to
          them they are not willing to be saved from sin, for they are not
          willing to part with their sins. When they think of the thing in the
          general, they wish that they were turned from sin. But when it comes
          to particulars, they cannot comply with it, they love their sins too
          well. When a particular lust comes and pleads to be indulged and
          gratified, then in this instance they have no wish to be converted,
          they are not willing to be turned from their sin altogether, they
          cannot bear entirely and forever to renounce and reject it. They have
          a wish to be converted, but not from enjoying their right hands, and
          right eyes. They pray that they may be thoroughly and savingly
          converted, and seem to wish and pray for it. But yet when it comes to
          them, they are not willing for any more than a partial conversion.
          They cannot comply with a thorough conversion, for a thorough
          conversion is a turning from every one of their sins. And that proves
          that they would be willing to be converted from their sins for a
          little while, but to part with them finally is what they cannot find
          it in their hearts to comply with.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Some wicked men do in certain respects desire that a work of
          humiliation may be wrought in them, and yet are utterly opposed to
          humiliation. They do many things that they may be humbled, and pray
          that they may be brought off from their own righteousness, and yet
          would by no means let it go, but are indeed building up their own
          righteousness all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          They seem in some respects to wish that they might submit to the
          justice and sovereignty of God in their condemnation, but yet are
          utterly averse to any such thing as owning God’s justice. They are
          averse to this submission, as appears from their showing such a sprit
          of strife with God. They do not believe that God is just and
          sovereign, and how therefore is it possible that they should desire
          really to submit to God’s justice and sovereignty? They cannot
          heartily and fervently desire to submit to God as just and sovereign,
          when they do not believe that he possesses those attributes, but think
          him unjust and tyrannical.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They in some respects wish that they might come to Christ, but
          indeed are utterly averse to come to him, so that their will is in
          this also inconsistent with itself. They pray that they may come to
          Christ, they are ready to say that they would give all the world for
          an interest in Christ; and yet they will not have an interest in him,
          for that is what is offered them, and what Christ is continually
          inviting and urging them to accept, but they refuse it. It is true
          they like some things in Christ, they like salvation from the pains of
          hell, they like that safety from everlasting misery which they hear is
          to be had in him. But there are other things in him which they do not
          like, his holiness, his salvation from sin, his kingly office, and
          therefore they will not accept him as he is. If they could have a part
          of Christ without the rest they would, but they will not accept of the
          whole of Christ. Indeed they are not willing to come to Christ and
          cordially accept of him as a Savior from hell, for they do not see
          that he is sufficient to save. And besides, they are not convinced
          that they have deserved it. There is no such thing as being cordially
          willing to accept of a Savior, who offered to deliver us from an
          unjust and undeserved punishment. For the hearty accepting of him as a
          Savior from the punishment would be allowing the punishment to be
          just. And God’s offering a Savior from undeserved punishment is an
          imposition upon them. A man therefore can never heartily and sincerely
          accept such an offer. At the same time that natural men seem to wish,
          and pray, and strive to come to Christ, they are in their hearts
          bitter enemies to him. And there is no such thing as a sincere
          willingness to accept of one towards whom at the same time we are
          bitter enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Natural men in some respects are desirous to go to heaven, and yet
          are averse to heaven. They are full of designs as to what they will do
          hereafter that they may go to heaven, but yet have no inclination to
          that wherein heaven really consists. The employments of heaven, which
          consist altogether in holy acts and holy contemplation, in holy
          exercises and holy praises, are that for which they have no desires
          nor inclination. And for the happiness of heaven they have no relish,
          but on the contrary, a dislike and an aversion. For the happiness of
          heaven consists in holy communion with God and Christ, to which their
          natures are opposite. Nor have they any desire for the company of
          heaven. And when it is observed what heaven really is, they choose
          this world before heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. They wish to have salvation from misery, but yet are averse to
          those things wherein salvation consists. And at the same time that
          they pray to Christ to serve them, they undo themselves as fast as
          they can. They spend their time daily in working out their own ruin.
          They pray that they may be delivered from hell, and yet are all the
          while piling up fuel and kindling and blowing the fire. Thus their
          wills are inconsistent with themselves, as they do in some respects
          choose and refuse the same things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, they dislike and refuse spiritual things as they are, and yet
          refuse to have them otherwise. This was the very case with the Jews in
          the text, they would not have a prophet come eating and drinking. If
          he did so, they looked on him very reproachfully. Nor yet would they
          have him not come eating and drinking, for if he did so they called
          him a mad man, and possessed with a devil, which is a lively specimen
          of the inconsistency of wicked men, of which we are speaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will mention several instances of this inconsistency on the part of
          wicked men.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They do not like God as he is, and yet they would not like him if
          he were otherwise. They would not like him if he were otherwise than
          he is in those very things for which they most dislike him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) They dislike God because he is a holy God. This is the main
          foundation of the enmity that wicked men have against God. His perfect
          purity and holiness make them enemies to him, because from this
          perfection of his nature he necessarily hates sin, and so hates their
          sins, which they love, and he will not and cannot allow of any sin in
          them. They are utter enemies to such a holy God. And yet they would
          not like him if they supposed him to be an unholy being, or if they
          supposed him to be at all wanting in perfect holiness, for then he
          could not be depended upon. If he were unholy, they know that if he
          promised them anything they could have no certain dependence upon it,
          for an unholy being is liable to break his promises. If he were unholy
          they could have no dependence on his faithfulness, and therefore they
          would never be willing to give up themselves to him as their God, for
          they would not know how he would dispose of them, what he would do
          with them. If he were to obligate himself by covenant, yet they could
          have no dependence upon it; and therefore they would by no means
          accept of such a God to be their God, to rule over them, and dispose
          of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) They do not like God, because he is a God of justice. This indeed
          is a branch of his holiness, for being strictly and perfectly just, he
          is disposed to execute just punishment on all iniquity. Therefore they
          are exceeding enemies to him, for they are the persons who are
          obnoxious, being those that have committed iniquity, and exposed
          themselves to just punishment. And yet they would not like God if he
          were an unjust God. If he were an unjust being, that would be an
          insuperable objection with them against accepting him as their God,
          for then they would think with themselves, “how do I know how unjustly
          he may deal with me.” And wicked men, however unjust they are, never
          like injustice against themselves. And they never would be persuaded
          to accept of such a God as their Lord and King, for they should then
          expect to be wronged and abused by him. They would dread committing
          themselves into the hands of a God that is infinite in power, and can
          do what he will with them, and has no principle of holiness or justice
          to keep him from using that power in the most unjust and abusive
          manner towards them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though they are enemies to God because of his justice, yet whenever at
          any time they think God deals unjustly, they quarrel with him for it.
          How frequent is it for natural men, when there are any of God’s
          methods of providence, the justice of which they cannot see through,
          to have their hearts swell with enmity, and to be full of blasphemous,
          malignant thoughts against God, if they do no even manifest it
          outwardly by a fretful, discontented behavior, and murmuring speeches?
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) They do not like God because he is an Almighty God and is able to
          destroy them when he pleases. Nor yet would they like him if he were a
          weak being and of but little power. They would on this account refuse
          to close with him as their God, for they would have a God able to do
          great things for them. They wish to have many things done for them,
          and they would have a God that can do them.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) They do not like God because he is an omniscient God, for hereby
          he sees all their wickedness. But yet neither would they like him if
          he did not know all things, for then in many cases he would not know
          what their case is, and what it requires, and what is best for them.
          He might ruin them in the disposal of them through mistake, he might
          not know how to extricate them out of difficulties in which they are
          or may be involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) Natural men oftentimes dislike God in the exercises of his
          infinite sovereign mercy, when it is exercised towards others. They
          are greatly displeased at God’s being so gracious to others. They
          dislike it much that God bestows converting grace upon them and
          pardoning mercy, and a title to eternal life upon them. When they hear
          of their conversion it is unpleasant news, and they find fault with it
          the more when the persons who seem to have received such mercy are
          very unworthy, and have been very great sinners. They think of the
          sins of which they have been guilty, and reckon up all the instances
          of wickedness they can think of, so that the mercy exercised towards
          them is the more displeasing because it appears so great in being
          bestowed on one so unworthy, like the elder brother, Luke 15:30, “But
          as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with
          harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.” And yet they would
          not like God if he were not infinitely merciful, for then they would
          have less hopes of obtaining mercy themselves. They are angry because
          God appears so merciful in the exercises of his grace to others. But
          yet they should have God merciful, and are at the same time afraid
          that he is not merciful enough to be willing to pardon their sins, and
          bestow his blessing on them. Thus natural men do not like God as he
          is, nor yet would they like him if he were otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They do not like men that are holy, nor yet do they like men that
          are wicked. They do not like holy men, for they know that such do not
          approve of that which themselves love, and the lives of the godly are
          a condemnation of the wickedness of their own hearts and lives. Hence
          there is an enmity between the seed of the woman and the seed of the
          serpent. Gen. 3:15, “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman,
          and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head and thou
          shalt bruise his heel.” But although they do not like men if they are
          godly, so neither do they like them if they are ungodly. They are more
          forward than the godly are to reprove others for their vice and
          wickedness, and bitterly to reflect on others for their pride, their
          covetousness, and their idleness. None are more apt to find fault with
          wickedness in others than those who are wicked themselves, and one
          great reason is that other men’s lusts clash with theirs. Thus one
          man’s pride crosses the pride of another, for it is the nature of
          pride to desire to be alone in advancement, to make the person in whom
          it is affect to be a God, to appropriate all power and all honor to
          himself as his own prerogative. But such an aim in one man clashes
          with such an aim in another. Hence there are none that can bear pride
          in others so ill, as those that are very proud themselves, and there
          never are such strife and enmity as between proud, haughty men. Proud
          men love to have others walk humbly before them, and nothing enrages
          them so much as to have others carry themselves proudly. For the same
          reason covetous men dislike covetous men, for this lust clashes with
          the same lust in another. Every covetous man strives to get all into
          his own hands, to get and keep all that he can to himself from his
          neighbor. So the lusts of envy, and malice, and revenge, are hated in
          others by envious and malicious men; because none are so obnoxious to
          malice, and envy, and revenge, as those that have the most of these
          qualities. Hence the wicked world on earth, who are at enmity with the
          church of God for its holiness, do not at all agree together. Though
          they agree in being alike under the power of wickedness, yet how full
          is the world of wicked men of strife and contention, of perpetual
          jars, animosities, and confusion! Rom. 1:29, 30, 31, 32, “Being filled
          with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness,
          maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity;
          whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, inventors of
          evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenant
          breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: who,
          knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are
          worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that
          do them.” So Tit. 3:3, “For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish,
          disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in
          malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.” And hence also it
          comes to pass that devils and wicked men in hell, though they hate
          angels and saints in heaven for their holiness, have yet no love one
          to another. Though they all agree in being perfectly wicked, yet they
          hate one another with implacable hatred, and are continually
          mortifying and tormenting one another so that hell is a world of
          perfect malice and contention.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They refuse to accept of heaven as it is. Yet they would not like
          it if it were otherwise. As has been observed before, they have no
          relish for the holy enjoyments and employments of heaven. They dislike
          heaven for its holiness, and yet they would not like it if it were
          unholy. For then they would be liable to the same troubles and
          vexations in heaven that they meet with in this world. If it were not
          that heaven differs from this world in holiness, it would be as full
          of pride and malice, envy, revenge, contention, injustice, violence,
          and cruelty, as this world is, and so would be as vexatious a world as
          this is. Wicked men are as liable to the trouble and vexation of the
          world, which arise from those things, as godly men, and in some
          respects more so, for they have no divine supports against those
          things, no safer portion to which their hearts betake themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, the things that wicked men choose, imply an inconsistency in
          their own nature. The things which they would have are impossibilities
          and self-contradictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They would have a sufficient Savior, and not a holy one. They would
          not have a holy Savior, because such a Savior does not at all agree
          with their lusts. But yet they would have a sufficient Savior, one
          that is sufficient to save them from hell, and so one that is
          sufficient to make a proper atonement for all their sins, to make full
          satisfaction to the justice of God, that they may escape the penalty
          of that justice. But these things prove a great inconsistency, for how
          is it possible that a Savior, who is not perfectly holy himself,
          should make satisfaction for the unholiness of others? How is it
          possible that one who deserves to suffer the eternal wrath of God
          himself for his own sin, should by his sufferings appease God’s wrath
          for the sin of others?
        </p>
        <p>
          They would have a worthy Savior, as appears in this; when they are
          awakened, and in some measure sensible of their guilt, they dare not
          come to Christ, because they cannot see that he has worthiness enough
          to commend them to God. They are afraid that he is not worthy enough.
          And yet they dislike Christ because he is a holy Savior! And what an
          inconsistency is this! How can he be a worthy Savior, and not a holy
          one? So that their choice does in effect contain this inconsistency in
          it, that they would have a Savior who is infinitely worthy, without
          worthiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They wish for salvation from misery without salvation from sin.
          They do not love misery any better than others, and hope to be saved
          from it. And some of them are in distress for fear of misery. But yet
          they would have it without being parted from their sins, which is in
          its own nature impossible, for the creature that is sinful, must be
          miserable. For misery consists in separation from the fountain of
          happiness, and an enmity between the creature and the chief good. But
          sin implies in its own nature such a separation. It is a separation
          from that God who is the fountain of good, and is enmity against him,
          and therefore necessarily brings enmity from that being against the
          sinner, if it be continued. Sin is the seed of misery. Misery is the
          necessary fruit of it. It is necessary from the nature of God, who,
          being infinitely holy, necessarily hates it, and so necessarily arrays
          himself against that being who remains under the pollution and guilt
          of it. And it is necessary from the nature of man, and the nature of
          sin. Misery is the natural fruit of sin, as the bud and blossom are
          the natural fruit of that on which they grow, and is so spoken of,
          Eze. 7:9, 10, “And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity:
          I will recompense thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations
          that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the Lord
          that smiteth. Behold the day, behold it is come; the morning is gone
          forth; the rod hath blossomed; pride hath budded.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Natural men would be freed from hell without being saved from sin,
          which is an inconsistency and impossibility. For where sin remains the
          reigning power, it will necessarily kindle up the flames of hell, and
          will bring on the torments of hell. Indeed, while men remain in the
          body, in the midst of the carnal objects of this world to engross the
          mind, to please the carnal appetites, to stupefy the conscience, and
          lull the soul asleep, they may avoid the torments of hell for a little
          while. But when the body comes to be dissolved, and all worldly
          objects, diversions, and entertainments come to an end, and the
          polluted and guilty soul comes to be stripped and turned out naked,
          infernal horror and misery will naturally and necessarily arise in
          such a soul. So that there is no such thing as being saved from hell,
          without being saved from sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They desire happiness without holiness. Wicked men have as earnest
          a desire of happiness as others. They are restlessly saying, “Who will
          show us any good?” And yet they are enemies to holiness. Here also
          they are inconsistent with themselves, for there is no such thing as
          happiness without holiness. The happiness of the creature consists in
          holiness. It is as great an inconsistency to suppose that a creature
          should be happy without being holy, as that a man should enjoy all the
          strength, and ease, and activity, and other comforts of health, in
          sore sickness; or that the notes of a tune should be harmonious that
          are disproportionate and discordant. So that they would be happy, and
          yet would not be happy. The thing they choose contains as great an
          inconsistency as if they should choose light or brightness, consisting
          in the blackness of darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, in things that do most nearly concern them, they will neither
          choose nor refuse. The things of religion are things that concern them
          in the highest degree. It is no matter of indifference to them,
          whether they will betake themselves in good earnest to the business of
          religion or not, whether they will obtain heaven, or be content with a
          portion in this life. But yet many natural men seem to remain in
          suspense about these things all the days of their lives. They are
          always at a loss, always halting between two opinions, which Elijah
          reproves, 1 Kin. 18:21, “And Elijah came unto all the people, and
          said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God,
          follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him
          not a word.” No wonder that they had nothing to answer, for their
          unreasonableness and inconsistency too manifestly appeared in it.
          Many, who hear of these subjects from their infancy, never come to a
          thorough conclusion in their own minds, whether they will continue to
          go on in the way to hell, or whether they will do what must be done to
          escape it. They neither resolve that they will forsake all their sins,
          nor yet that they will retain them. They do not determine to hearken
          to the warnings and counsels given to them, nor yet do they fully
          reject them. They have life and death set before them, one or the
          other, but they never come to a determination which they will choose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, in pursuing the objects which they desire, their lusts are
          inconsistent with each other. It has before been shown that the lusts
          of one wicked man clash with those of another. But not only is it
          thus. Some of the lusts of the same person disagree with other lusts
          of his. Often, wicked men’s covetousness clashes with their pride.
          Their pride prompts them to many things that their covetousness
          forbids. It would be agreeable to men’s pride to make a splendid show
          in their houses and apparel, and manner of living, who yet are not
          willing, through their covetousness, to be at the cost of it. So their
          covetousness often thwarts their sensuality. Their sensual disposition
          inclines them to feast their appetites, but their covetousness will
          not allow it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes men’s sloth and idleness clash with their other lusts, with
          their pride, their covetousness, and sensuality. These lusts draw them
          one way to obtain much of the world, in order to pamper and gratify
          them. But their slothfulness draws another, or rather holds them and
          binds their hands from obtaining these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The outward show of wicked men disagrees with their hearts. They
          very often make an appearance that is exceedingly different and
          contrary to what they really are inwardly. They have the clothing of
          sheep, but the nature of wolves, Mat. 7:15. They are like whited
          sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full
          of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. They make a show as
          though they believed the truth of the gospel, and believed that God
          was an infinitely great and an infinitely excellent being. They make a
          show of great respect to God, a show of reverence and love, when
          indeed they have no such thing in their hearts, but the contrary. The
          outward show they make, which is at war with their hearts, consists
          either in their words, or in their behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show they make in words is inconsistent with their hearts. Many of
          them profess to believe that God is an infinitely excellent being,
          when indeed they think that the meanest of their carnal enjoyments is
          more excellent than he. They profess to believe that there is another
          world, a heaven and a hell, when indeed they realize no such thing.
          They profess to believe that Christ is the only Savior, and that they
          can be saved in no other. And yet they all the while believe in their
          hearts that there are other saviors, and particularly that they can be
          saviors for themselves by their own strength and righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          They do abominably dissemble in the profession they make of the favor
          of God, and of love to him, and willingness to obey him, and desire to
          glorify him. They have not a jot of these things in their hearts, but
          are all the while wholly under the influence of vile carnal principles
          in all that they do, and are only aiming at selfish ends and serving
          their lusts in all.
        </p>
        <p>
          So did those Jews dissemble that came to Jeremiah and desired him to
          inquire of the Lord. Jer. 42:20, “For ye dissembled in your hearts,
          when ye sent me unto the Lord your God, saying, Pray for us unto the
          Lord our God; and according unto all that the Lord our God shall say,
          so declare unto us, and we will do it.” So did the Jews of whom we
          read in the test dissemble. They pretended to be enemies of gluttony,
          and drunkenness, and to dislike any such thing as associating with
          sinners. And so made a pretense of zeal against wickedness, in their
          opposition to Christ; when indeed they were actuated by a love to
          wickedness, and were enemies to Christ, for the sake of his holiness.
          So they pretended to be influenced by enmity against the devil in
          their opposition to John the Baptist, who they pretended had a devil;
          when indeed it was not enmity against the devil, but against God. Many
          pretend a great deal of love to God in what they do, when it is only
          love to the world at bottom. Eze. 33:31, “And they come unto thee as
          the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they
          hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they
          show much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The show which they make in their prayers is quite inconsistent with
          their hearts. Their very approach to God in this duty has a show of
          religion in it without the reality. And those things they say in their
          prayers are hypocritical dissembling pretenses. They profess honor,
          reverence, trust, humility, a sense of unworthiness, repentance
          towards God, trust in Christ as a Mediator, a willingness to forsake
          sin, from which they pray to be delivered, and thankfulness for the
          divine mercies. In this manner they resemble the Jews spoken of in
          Isa. 29:13, “Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw
          near me with their mouth; and with their lips do honour me, but have
          removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by
          the precept of men;” and in Psa. 78:36, 37, “Nevertheless they did
          flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their
          tongues. For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
          stedfast in his covenant.” And many of them make a show in words, in
          conversation with their neighbor, that is quite inconsistent with
          their hearts. They are forward in religious conversation, in giving an
          account of their experience in a show of zeal, merely to be seen of
          men, their God is themselves, their own honor, and the esteem of men.
          It is themselves whom they love and honor in everything, and not God.
        </p>
        <p>
          They often make that show in their external behavior that is
          inconsistent with their hearts. Many who are destitute of the least
          spark of love to God, and are at utter enmity with him, will make a
          great show of respect to him in many things in their behavior. They
          may put on a religious saint-like visage, may seem devout in keeping
          the sabbath, and in their attendance on religious duties and the
          ordinances of worship, may in some things be very strict, and may
          appear to do all from a holy respect to God. So it was of old with the
          Israelites. Isa. 58:1, 2, 3, “Cry aloud, spare not; lift up thy voice
          like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house
          of Jacob their sins. Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my
          ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the
          ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they
          take delight in approaching to God. Wherefore have we fasted, say
          they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and
          thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find
          pleasure, and exact all your labours.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So did the Pharisees of old. They made a great show of love and holy
          regard to God in their behavior. They abounded in religious duties,
          they fasted twice a week, and they were very strict in many things.
          They were so in many duties of the moral law, they were not
          extortioners, nor unjust, nor adulterers. And they were exceedingly
          exact in duties of the ceremonial law. They gave tithes of all that
          they possessed, and so exact were they in paying tithes, that they
          tithed all the herbs of their gardens, as mint, anise, and the like,
          and put on an exceedingly religious countenance, and wore a righteous
          garment for a show of great humility. And yet had no love to God in
          their hearts, but were a generation of vipers, and most bitter enemies
          to God and Christ, and cruel persecutors of good men.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The practice of wicked men is often very inconsistent with their
          profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is so, whether we look at the profession which they make in common
          with others who are brought up under the light of the gospel, or at
          the distinguishing and extraordinary profession which some of them
          make.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, if we look at the professions which they make in common with
          the generality of those who are brought up under the gospel. These do
          in general profess that there is a God, an infinitely great and holy
          God, who hates sin, and who is everywhere present, who always sees
          them, has his eye continually upon them, sees what they do in secret
          as well as what is done openly. A God, who not only knows all their
          words and actions, but sees all their thoughts, and who is able to do
          what he pleases with them, and can save or destroy them as he will.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how does the practice of the greater part of them consist with
          their profession when they live in direct opposition to his commands,
          when they live as though there were no God that had the care and
          government of the world, and as though he were not a holy God, but
          altogether such an one as themselves, liking ways of sin as well as
          they, or as though they thought him a weak being, and not able to do
          them any great matter of hurt, or as though they thought they were
          stronger than he, and should be able to make their part good with him
          another day? 1 Cor. 10:22, “Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we
          stronger than he?”
        </p>
        <p>
          How does that wickedness, which many persons who are brought up under
          gospel light commit in secret, those abominable secret practices of
          which many young people are guilty, agree with their professing that
          God is everywhere present? These things they do not commit openly for
          fear of human punishment, or for fear of shame and disgrace among men.
          And yet they commit them boldly, and live on them in the sight of God,
          upon whose favor they profess that their happiness infinitely more
          depends than on the esteem of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          They profess to believe that there is another world, and a future
          judgment, and that they must in a little time stand before the
          judgment-seat of God, to give an account of themselves to him. And
          that then the hidden things of darkness shall be brought to light, and
          the counsels of the heart made manifest. And that then God will call
          them to a strict account of their improvement of their time, and all
          their talents, and that for every idle word men must give account in
          the day of judgment. And that then every man shall have his state
          everlastingly and unalterably fixed by the sentence of the great
          Judge, according to the things done in the body, that they who have
          done well shall be invited into heaven, where they shall enjoy honor,
          and glory, and pleasure unspeakable forevermore, and that they who
          have done evil, shall be sentenced and sent down to hell, into
          everlasting fire, with the devil and his angels, where they shall
          endure unspeakable torments, as in a furnace of fire, without any end,
          or any hope, and that they shall have no rest day nor night; and that
          their souls shall be fixed in one or other of those states in a little
          time, as soon as ever the body dies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now how does their practice consist with such a profession, while they
          live idle, careless lives, little troubling themselves about the good
          of their souls, and have their hearts and pursuits after the vanities
          of the world, just as if they never expected any other world but this,
          going on in sins against the plainest commands, and loudest warnings,
          and fullest light, and conviction of their own conscience? How does
          this consist with the profession of a belief that they must in a
          little time be called to give account of themselves to God? Would any
          spectator who should judge only by their practice, in the least
          imagine that these men expected within a few years to burn in
          everlasting fire, if they did not please and serve an infinitely holy
          God, and to be received to an everlasting paradise of blessedness if
          they did. Could he be persuaded to think that such men are in heart,
          as they profess to be, the followers of the meek, holy, and humble
          Lamb of God, of him who laid down his life for his enemies?
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, if we look at the profession which some of them make of
          special and distinguishing experiences of the influence of God’s grace
          in their hearts, their practice is very inconsistent with their
          profession. Persons may make a profession of such experiences, and yet
          be carnal and wicked men. So did some of the Galatians, of whom the
          apostle was afraid, lest he had bestowed upon them labor in vain. They
          professed great experience of the sweetness and blessedness which is
          to be had in religion, and experienced in the truths of the gospel.
          Gal. 4:11, 15, “I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you
          labour in vain. Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear
          you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out
          your own eyes, and have given them to me.” At their first seeming
          conversion, they appeared to be exceedingly lifted up with their new
          light, and full of joy and comfort, and full of affection. But by this
          expostulation of the apostle it appears that their lives afterwards
          did not well agree with their profession. Some wicked men may profess
          that they have seen their own utter insufficiency and helplessness,
          their own vileness and wickedness, and have been brought to God’s
          footstool self-emptied and self-abased, as wretched, miserable, poor,
          blind, and naked. But yet how ill does their walk and life agree with
          such a profession! In this none appear fuller of themselves than they.
          None seem to manifest more of a spirit of self-sufficiency, and of
          dependence on their own righteousness, or more high conceit of their
          own goodness, or are more ready to say to others, “Stand by thyself,
          come not nigh to me, for I am holier than thou.” None appear in their
          walk and conversation further from lying in the dust as being poor in
          spirit than they. So it was with the Pharisees, they pretended to be
          extraordinarily emptied of themselves, and to have a low thought of
          themselves, in their wearing a rough garment, and in so often keeping
          days of fasting. And yet none were more self-righteous and
          self-sufficient than these very men, who are set forth in sacred
          history as living examples of self-righteousness to all succeeding
          ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          So some of them may profess that they have had great discoveries made
          to their souls of God’s glory and excellency, and that they have seen
          how much more glorious God is than all earthly things. But if it be
          so, why do not they cleave to God, and follow him, rather than other
          things? If they have known God to be so much more excellent than the
          things of the world, because they have had acquaintance with God, why
          do they in their practice cast off God for the sake of the things of
          the world? Why do they in their practice prefer a little of the world,
          a little worldly gain, a little worldly honor, or a little worldly
          convenience or pleasure, before God? Certainly, if God be more
          excellent than the whole world, as they profess that they have seen
          him to be, then surely he is worth more than so small a part of the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          So they may tell what love they have found in their hearts to God, how
          they have found their hearts drawn out in love to him at different
          times. But if they love him so well, why do they take no more care to
          please him? Why are they so careless of his honor, and of their duty
          to him? Why do they allow themselves in practices which they know he
          hates, and utterly forbids?
        </p>
        <p>
          So they may profess that they have seen the truth of the gospel, and
          that they not only think, but know, that the Scripture is the Word of
          God. But if it be so, why do they not take more heed to it? why do
          they live not only as if they were not certain of it, but as if they
          were certain of the contrary? If they know that those commands which
          are in the Bible are the commands of God, then they are worthy of the
          greatest regard. If they know that those promises and threatenings
          which are found there are the promises and threatenings of God, then
          surely they should be of great weight with us. Why do they seem to be
          of so little weight with them?
        </p>
        <p>
          So they may tell how God has manifested his love to their souls, has
          given his Spirit to witness with their spirit that they are the
          children of God, and that they have much communion with God. But if
          God has done such great things for them, and they are admitted to such
          unspeakable privileges above others, surely they ought to do more than
          others. They should not appear more carnal, and careless, and
          unchristian in their temper and walk than other men who make no such
          pretenses. Thus wicked men’s practice is very often inconsistent with
          their profession, agreeably to Tit. 1:16, “They profess that they know
          God, but in works they deny him; being abominable and disobedient, and
          to every good work reprobate.”
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Their practice is inconsistent with their hope of eternal life.
          Men in general who live in Christian countries, hope to go to heaven,
          and there to possess eternal glory with God, and Christ, and holy
          saints and angels, though some of them have a much more confident hope
          than others. Some of them think that God has already made over this
          glory to them by firm promises, they look on heaven as their own, they
          think they belong to that world, and have an inheritance reserved
          there for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the practice of wicked men is very inconsistent with such a hope,
          it is very displeasing to that God, and that glorious Redeemer, with
          whom they hope to spend their eternity in heaven. Though they live
          wickedly, yet they hope in a little time to go to be with an
          infinitely holy God, to be received by him with perfect approbation
          and delight, to be near to him, and to dwell in the courts of his
          love. They hope to enter into that same holy of holies, into which
          Christ the forerunner of saints has entered, and there to dwell, there
          to be as a pillar in the temple of God, to go no more out. Yea, they
          hope there to sit in that heavenly holy of holies, to be admitted to a
          higher privilege than the high priests were of old in the earthly holy
          of holies, who were admitted only to appear in the holy of holies once
          a year. What holiness was expected of the high priests of old who were
          admitted to this privilege! What holiness then may well be expected of
          those who hope to be admitted to a so much greater privilege! Their
          wicked life is very unsuitable to that state of heaven. Those who are
          in heaven are all perfectly holy, and so must they become if ever they
          go to heaven. They will perfectly hate all wickedness, and perfectly
          delight in the contrary. How disagreeable therefore is the hope of
          spending eternity in such a heaven, to their wallowing like swine in
          the filth and mire of sin, and feeding with such eagerness and delight
          on the loathsome objects of their lusts, as worms feed with pleasure
          on the loathsome carcass!
        </p>
        <p>
          Their wicked life is very unfit for the company of heaven, with which
          they must spend an eternity, if ever they arrive there, even with the
          holy angels and saints. Heb. 12:22, 23, “But ye are come unto mount
          Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and
          to an innumerable company of angels; to the general assembly and
          church of the first-born, which are written in heaven, and to God the
          judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect.” How
          disagreeable is a carnal, worldly, sensual, impure life, to a hope of
          being one of such an assembly as this to all eternity!
        </p>
        <p>
          Their wicked life is very disagreeable to the eternal business of
          heaven, which consists in employing their faculties altogether on holy
          objects, in employing their understandings in viewing and
          contemplating the holy perfections of God, and his wonderful works,
          and their wills and affections in loving God, and delighting
          themselves in him, and their whole souls in praising and serving him.
          Rev. 22:3, 4, “And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God
          and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him; and
          they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.”
          How inconsistent is a life spent in this world in the service of lust
          and of the devil, to a hope of spending eternity in such a holy manner
          as this!
        </p>
        <p>
          Their wicked life is unfitted for the pleasure and entertainment of
          heaven, which consist in delighting and rejoicing in God, in loving
          him, and in holy communion with him. How unsuited to a hope of
          enjoying such a happiness as this throughout eternity is it to place
          all one’s delight and happiness here in hoarding up worldly pelf, in
          gratifying the bodily appetites and sensitive desires, and in those
          pleasures that are common to the cattle and the swine?
        </p>
        <p>
          Wicked men hope to spend their eternity in that world, which is a
          world of perfect peace and love, and to dwell there forever, where are
          no jars nor strife, but perfect agreement, harmony, and love forever.
          Yet many of them live a life of malice and contention in this world,
          are very often in one strife or other, and always carry about in their
          breasts a malice and hatred towards some of their neighbors, and
          towards some of those same persons with whom they pretend to hope to
          spend their eternity in such perfect love and amity. If we in our
          thoughts compare the life that many men actually live in this world,
          with that life which they hope to live in another world, how ill do
          they consist together; how disagreeable and shocking is the
          comparison, or the union of them in our thoughts! How many are there
          who now are drunkards or unclean persons, or who live in the neglect
          of secret prayer, and who cast off fear and restrain prayer before
          God. And how many that are mere earth-worms in covetousness and
          eagerness after the world; how many proud men whose God is their
          earthly honor; how many wrathful men who spend their days in hatred of
          their neighbor; how many such are there who hope in a little time to
          be with an infinitely holy God, in his glorious presence, in his holy
          of holies, and with Jesus Christ, and in the arms of his love, and to
          be of the assembly of holy angels and saints in perfect purity,
          holiness, and love, loving, contemplating, and admiring God’s glory,
          and enjoying unspeakable blessedness in communion with God! Thus
          wicked men’s practice disagrees with their hopes.
        </p>
        <p>VII. The practice of wicked men is inconsistent with itself.</p>
        <p>
          First, their practice at one time is inconsistent with their practice
          at another. They are not of a piece with themselves at different
          times, but are such as the apostle James compares to “a wave of the
          sea, driven of the wind and tossed;” and such as he called
          “double-minded.” At one time they are of one mind, with respect to the
          things of religion; and at another, of another; and so have one mind
          against another. It is so with false professors of religion. They are
          not steadfast in God’s covenant, nor in the practice of religion. At
          one time they may seem to be much affected with the things of
          religion, and greatly engaged in their spirits about it, as though
          they could even pluck out their own eyes for God and Christ’s sake,
          may be full of religious conversation, and may seem forward in
          religious deeds. But, if we observe them, all their goodness is as the
          morning cloud, all their religiousness is over, and they appear as
          carnal, and senseless, and as irreligious as ever. Their religious
          affections are all gone, their religious practice is gone, and “it is
          happened unto them according to the true proverb. The dog is turned to
          his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in
          the mire.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So it is with the hearers, that hear the Word of God, and anon with
          joy receive it, but in time of temptation fall away. So it was with
          many of Christ’s followers. They followed him for a while, and by and
          by left him.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were some who seemed to believe in Christ and followed him for a
          while. But Christ did not commit himself to them, he knew they were of
          an unstable mind, and would not be consistent with themselves. Some of
          them were for a while greatly affected with his preaching and with the
          miracles that he wrought, and it is said of them that the glorified
          God who had given such power to men, and said, “Never man spake like
          this man.” John 7:46. And it seems as though some of the same Jews who
          had their affections so raised when Christ was coming into Jerusalem,
          and who cried, “Hosannah to the son of David, blessed is he that
          cometh in the name of the Lord;” did presently after cry, “Crucify
          him, crucify him!” There are many professors like those, and like the
          Israelites, that sang God’s praise, and soon forgat his works, and
          waited not for his counsel, that “turned back, and dealt unfaithfully
          like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.” That
          is, a bow that missed the mark to which it seemed to direct the arrow.
          The arrow seems to be pointed right, as though it would hit the mark,
          but yet the bow unexpectedly tends quite another way.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many disciples like Judas, who was at one time a disciple,
          and a traitor at another. It is commonly so that when false professors
          come to be tried by any remarkable allurements of the world, or by
          special difficulties which they meet with in the way of duty, that
          their practice as such times is quite inconsistent with their practice
          at other times. While times are smooth, and the way plain, and the
          external practice of religion seems to be consistent with their
          worldly interests, they are very religious. But when times are
          changed, and they cannot be religious without seeing them crossed,
          they appear quite another sort of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus their practice at one time is inconsistent with their practice at
          another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, their practice in some things is inconsistent with their
          practice in others at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Their moral and religious practice in some things does not consist
          with their irreligious and impure practice in others. False professors
          are very commonly widely different in this respect from those who are
          sincere and upright. Sincere Christians are universally holy. They
          have regard to all God’s commands. It is their sincere desire, aim,
          and endeavor to do their duty in every respect. But it is generally
          far otherwise with hypocrites. In some things they are like
          Christians, in others like heathens. Sometimes they appear earnestly
          religious in duties that immediately respect God, as in attending
          ordinances, and in appearing devout in external duties of the first
          table. But in duties that respect their neighbor, there is but little
          appearance of Christianity. Some behave themselves like saints in
          God’s house, and like devils at home. Some seem to be very religious
          abroad, in the house of God, and also at the houses of their
          neighbors, at private meetings, and in religious conferences. But if
          you follow them into their own families, and observe their carriage
          there towards those who dwell under the same roof, towards their
          wives, or husbands, or children, or servants, their behavior there
          does not at all consist with the other. So some may carry themselves
          well in their families, and yet are wretchedly negligent of the
          religion of the closet. Some seem to be religious men, who are not
          honest men. Some are honest men, and are not religious. They are
          willing to pay their debts, to speak the truth, and to avoid all
          knavish actions, all low and underground management. But as to
          religion, or to seeking God in the religious use of his ordinances,
          and in reading his holy word, in meditation and prayer, there is but
          little of this to be seen in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some are honest men with respect to strict commutative justice, but
          they are not charitable men. They are selfish, covetous, close, and
          unmerciful. Some seem to be generous and liberal, and yet are very
          proud and haughty. Their honor is their God. Some are very strict and
          exemplary as to all that can be seen of men, but secretly they live in
          some abominable practice. So their practice does not consist with
          itself. It is not of a piece. God complains of this self-inconsistency
          in Israel of old. Hos. 7:8, “Ephraim hath mixed himself among the
          people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.” “He hath mixed himself among
          the people;” that is, he was conversant with the heathen nations, and
          mingled the religion and customs of an Israelite with those of the
          heathen; so that he was inconsistent with himself, he was partly an
          Israelite and partly a heathen. “He is a cake not turned,” alluding to
          their custom of baking cakes on the hearth, or in the sun; where, if
          they were not turned, one side would be baked, and the other raw. So
          they on one side seemed to appear religious, and like saints, but on
          the other, wicked and impure. So it was with the Pharisees. In some
          things they appeared eminently religious, but in others they behaved
          themselves as some of the vilest of me. Mat. 23:14, 23, “Woe unto you,
          scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and
          for a pretence, make long prayers; therefore ye shall receive the
          greater damnation. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
          for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cumin, and have omitted the
          weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought
          ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.” A true saint is
          sanctified throughout, in soul, body, and spirit. He has put off the
          old man with his deeds, and has put on the new man. He is all over a
          new creature. He has not only a new hand and head, but he is a new
          man, all the members are new. But hypocrites are monsters. They have a
          saint’s tongue, and a devil’s heart. The members do not well consist
          together. They are inconsistent with themselves as they go about to
          serve two masters, God and Mammon, which Christ has taught us to be a
          great inconsistency. They are alike inconsistent as the Samaritans
          were, who would serve the God of Israel and their own god too. 2 Kin.
          17:28, etc. “Then one of the priests, whom they had carried away from
          Samaria, came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should
          fear the Lord. Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put
          them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made,
          every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.”
        </p>
        <p>
          There is the like inconsistency in them as was in Judas, who betrayed
          Christ with a kiss. How ill did those two things in Judas consist
          together, his coming to him and kissing him, his seeming to show
          himself his friend, and at the same time betraying him to death! But
          it was not greater inconsistency than is commonly found with
          hypocritical professors, who carry themselves as Christ’s friends, and
          as though he were very dear to them in some things, and yet act the
          part of mortal enemies in others, and by their wicked behavior do
          indeed betray his cause and interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Their wicked practice in one thing is inconsistent with their
          wicked practice in others. It is a common thing for wicked men to
          quarrel with God for permitting those things which they allow
          themselves, and practice with delight. It is common for wicked men to
          ascribe the blame of their wickedness to God, therein following their
          first father, Adam. So men will often lay the blame of their being
          unconverted, and having lived so wicked a life, so carnal, careless,
          and evil a life, to God, and especially under conviction, to quarrel
          with God for it. And yet they approved of those things which they did
          themselves, with full consent and approbation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again. It is common for wicked men to contend with men, and hate
          their neighbor, for doing the same thing that they do themselves, and
          allow in themselves. So an unjust man, a backbiter and reviler, a
          revengeful man, will condemn in others the sin which he allows in
          himself. And so, many other instances might be mentioned. And thus I
          have showed through all the instances proposed, how wicked men are
          inconsistent with themselves.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          I. Hence we may see the woeful ruin which sin has brought on the
          nature of man. Man was not thus in his first estate. If we had nothing
          but the light of nature, or the light of our own reason to guide us,
          that would be sufficient to lead us to conclude that man in his first
          estate was not made thus by his Creator, who has made other things in
          such excellent order and harmony. We see that God hath so made the
          world, that one thing sweetly harmonizes with another, all things are
          adapted to each other, the nature of one thing to the nature of
          another; one thing to be subservient to another; and all things
          subject to the laws that the Creator has fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We therefore, without the Scripture, should have all reason to
          conclude that man, the most noble of all the creatures in the visible
          world, was not made in this state of woeful inconsistency with
          himself; so that all the faculties of his nature are at war with each
          other, and at war with themselves; so that now there is nothing but
          the most dreadful confusion to be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Scripture teaches us plainly that God saw all things that he
          had created and made, and behold, they were very good; and
          particularly that God made man upright, and that it is himself that
          has brought ruin on his own nature. In man’s first estate all things
          were in perfect order in his nature. There shone such a light in his
          understanding as led him to right judgments of things, all the
          dictates of his understanding were consistent one with another. And
          then his reason, the superior faculty, kept its place, and bare rule
          in him over the other faculties, and there was no principle or faculty
          of his nature but what was subject to its dictates, nothing rose up in
          rebellion against it. His will then was agreeable to his reason, and
          agreeable with itself. There was a perfect harmony between his outward
          appearance and his inward character. His mouth and his heart and his
          mouth and practice then agreed together, and his practice then was of
          a piece. Until he ate of the forbidden fruit, all was in perfect
          order, and peace, and decorum, both within and without.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what was the consequence when man hearkened to the devil, and
          rebelled against his Maker? We learn, by what has been said under this
          doctrine, that then the Spirit of God departed from him, and with his
          influence, God’s holy image also, the life, the crown, and glory of
          his nature left him, and all light, and regularity, and order were
          gone, and a worse darkness and confusion succeeded than was in the
          primitive chaos when it was without form and void, and darkness was
          upon the face of the deep. And such is the woeful confusion of the
          nature of all men now in their fallen state. Now their reason
          determines one thing, and their governing practical judgment the
          reverse of it. And their judgment in some things is utterly
          inconsistent with their judgment in others. Now the will is in no
          consistency with the reason, but commonly determines directly contrary
          to its dictates. Men’s wills are in such bondage and slavery to their
          lusts, that they are not only determined contrary to their own
          consciences to choose those things which their reason tells them are
          unjust, and vile, and unbecoming their nature, but also those things
          which their reason at the same time declares to be exceedingly against
          their own highest interest, even so as to tend to their everlasting
          perdition. Yea, their dispositions are not only contrary to their own
          reason and consciences, but contrary to themselves. There is not only
          war between faculty and faculty, but the very same faculty is at war
          with itself, so that they do in some respects choose and refuse the
          same things at the same time. There are some things that they seem
          earnestly to wish for, and yet indeed are at the same time utterly
          averse to and refuse, and will by no means accept of when offered.
          Yea, they will not have them though they are urged, and entreated, and
          pleaded with for years together to accept of them. So inconsistent are
          their dispositions with themselves, that they will not have spiritual
          and divine things as they are, nor yet will they have them otherwise.
          They do not like God as he is, they find abundance of fault with him,
          they are urged to accept of him as their God, but they will by no
          means comply with it. They reject him, and have an enmity against him.
          They love to keep at a distance from him, and to have as little as
          possible to do with him, and will not hearken to him, or submit to
          him, but are ever maintaining a kind of warfare against him, because
          they do not like him as he is. And yet they would not like him if he
          were any otherwise. If it were possible that he could be altered from
          what he is in any respect whatsoever, they would refuse to accept of
          him as their God then. They are enemies to him because he is so holy
          and just a God, and yet they would not like him if he were unholy and
          unjust. They do not like his almighty power, and yet they would not
          like him if he were weak. They also dislike his knowing all things,
          and yet they would dislike him if he were ignorant. They quarrel with
          God for the exercise of his infinite mercy and grace to others, and
          the more for its being so great in some instances, in being exercised
          towards those who are so unworthy. And yet they would not like him if
          he were not infinitely merciful. They would wish him to be merciful
          enough to pardon the most unworthy, and yet sometimes quarrel with him
          because he is no more merciful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now there is a similar inconsistency in them with themselves in that
          they do not like men for being godly. They have an enmity against such
          sort of men. And at the same time, they do not like those who are
          godly, they hate men for being wicked, and will have a bitter spirit
          against them for it. The world in its fallen state cannot agree with
          the church of God. It has always had a spite against it, and has
          almost always from the beginning of the world hitherto been
          persecuting it. And yet neither can they agree among themselves, but
          are at the same time contending and quarreling with one another. And
          as there is no suiting them in this world, so neither is there any
          suiting them in another. They would neither go to heaven, nor to hell.
          They do not like heaven because it is holy. And yet they would not
          like it if it were a world of wickedness. And such is the jarring and
          confusion that is in their disposition, that those things that they do
          choose are impossibilities, and self-contradictions, and
          self-inconsistencies. They would have a sufficient Savior and not a
          holy one. They would have one good, and excellent, and holy enough to
          save them, and yet would not have one with any holiness at all. They
          have a mind to have salvation from misery, without salvation from sin;
          when sin is their misery. They have a mind to have light, and yet to
          keep darkness without light. They would have a light consisting in
          darkness; and sweet, consisting in bitterness; and good, consisting in
          evil. They would have such a sort of happiness as is impossible in its
          own nature. For they would have happiness with unholiness, which is as
          much as to say they would be happy men, and yet remain destroyed and
          ruined. And when life and death are set before them to choose, and
          they are urged to make their choice, and told that they must certainly
          have one or the other, that there is no possibility of avoiding it;
          yet they will come to a deliberate, determinate choice to have neither
          one nor the other. They are always halting between two opinions, they
          are always choosing and yet never come to a choice. Instead of those
          holy principles that man had in his heart at first, that sweetly
          consented one with another, he has now introduced into his soul a
          number of vile and hateful lusts, that clash one with another: pride
          clashing with covetousness, and covetousness thwarting sensuality, and
          sloth crushing all these. And instead of the purity in body and mind,
          which man had at first, he is now, if he has any show of purity,
          become like a whited sepulcher, that is beautifully adorned outside,
          and within full of dead men’s bones, and all uncleanness. Their faces
          disagree with their hearts, and their mouths disagree with their
          hearts. They have the visage and show of saints, and the hearts of
          devils. Their prayers are filled up with thanksgiving, adoration,
          great honor to God, praise and glory to him, a show of humility before
          him, a show of repentance for sin, trust, thankfulness, desire of
          obedience, and trust in Christ alone; when within is nothing but a
          slight and contempt of God, enmity against God, distrust of God,
          pride, self-righteousness, obstinacy, and disobedience, without one
          jot or tittle of honor, or love, or trust, or humility, or repentance,
          or obedience, or any of those things that there is a show of in their
          prayers. And now they say and profess one thing, and practice another.
          They will show one thing to God, and do another, and will live all
          their days in this world carnally, contentious, and alienated from
          God, in the indulgence of brutish lusts and filthiness. And yet hope
          when they die to go to be with him, and in eternal communion with him
          in perfect holiness, and with holy angels, spending an eternity in
          holy contemplation and praise, and to have these things for their
          everlasting happiness. And when they seem to practice well for a time
          it lasts but a little while, but their practice at one time is utterly
          inconsistent with that at another. Yea, if they were narrowly
          observed, their practice at the same time is inconsistent with itself:
          saints at church, and heathen at home; saints before the world,
          heathen in secret; with the tongues and faces of the children of God,
          and with the hearts of the children of the devil.

          Such work has the fall made in the nature of man, such a creature as
          this is man become, instead of shining as at first, in the holy and
          lovely image of God. Thus has the fall of man ruined God’s
          workmanship. And if the fall has thus ruined man, what can be more
          effectually ruined? Does not this show that it is indeed so, that man
          is in a lost and undone condition. And can it be expected that any
          other can ever restore to him the divine image, but only that same God
          that made him at first? And how vain are the attempts of natural men
          to rectify their natures in their own strength, wherein is such woeful
          ruin and confusion! And is there not need of a mighty Savior in order
          to this?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This subject may be applied in the way of conviction to natural
          men, in several particulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, hence you may see your folly. Wisdom is ever consistent with
          itself, and wise men are not wont to act inconsistently.
          Self-inconsistency in temporal things is ever looked upon as a note of
          folly. Those men that talk very inconsistently, are accounted to talk
          very foolishly. And so those men that act inconsistently with
          themselves in temporal matters, are looked upon as acting very
          absurdly and ridiculously, and it is common with men to treat such
          with derision. Certainly, then, to be so exceedingly self-inconsistent
          in such great concerns as we have spoken of, is the highest degree of
          folly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inconsistency of the judgment of wicked men shows their folly. It
          shows the foolishness of those practical judgments they govern
          themselves by, that they make them contrary to the plain dictates of
          their own reason. Men oftentimes count the judgments of others very
          foolish, because they are very inconsistent with other men’s reason,
          though their judgments are formed according to the best light of their
          own reason. But how much more foolish is it for men, in such things as
          infinitely concern them, to make such practical judgments of things as
          are plainly contrary not only to other men’s reason, but to their own;
          so as to determine their will and their practice by those judgments!
          As for instance, when men’s practical judgment and conclusion within
          themselves, by which they determine their choice and practice, is that
          it is best for them for the present, to neglect their souls and seek
          the vanities of this world, which are but for a moment, more than
          their eternal welfare.
        </p>
        <p>
          And how does it show the folly of men’s judgment when some of their
          judgments are inconsistent with others; as when in one thing they will
          judge that a long-continued eternity is of less importance than this
          short and fleeting life! So it shows the great folly of men’s wills
          and dispositions, that they are so inconsistent, that in some respects
          they will both choose and refuse the same things, will wish and pray
          for them, and take pains for them, and yet will not have them when
          offered. How madly would a man be looked upon to act, that should so
          act in temporal concerns, if he was sick and like to perish for want
          of a certain medicine, and should wish and long for that medicine, and
          ask others to seek it for him, and yet when it was bought and offered,
          he should utterly refuse it!
        </p>
        <p>
          What folly does it argue that men’s dispositions are so inconsistent
          with each other, that there is no suiting them with anything! They are
          pleased neither with piping nor mourning, with eating nor fasting.
          They will not have God, or Christ, or heaven as they are, and yet will
          not have either any otherwise. How would men, if they manifested such
          a disposition in temporal things, often be hissed at, as most
          ridiculous, childish, and foolish. Yea, and be accounted to act like
          madmen! And what folly does it discover that they will choose and
          accept of nothing but that which is impossible in its own nature, and
          a self-contradiction, as when they will have happiness without
          holiness! If any man should act thus in temporal things, if he would
          have no house because he could not build one in the air, if he refused
          to go because he could not go without feet, or to see because he could
          not see without eyes, what words would be thought adequate to describe
          his folly! Yet this is the very folly of sinners with regard to their
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          How would men be looked upon if they acted thus in their temporal
          affairs! If they must inevitably perish in the winter if they did not
          labor in the summer, and yet spend all the summer in halting between
          two opinions. Or if they were sick with some deadly disease, and were
          told that they must inevitably die if they did not send for a
          physician, yet were undetermined, and when the distemper increased
          upon them, still continued undetermined, and when it was come to
          extremity, and seemed very near death, still could not come to a
          conclusion; or if a house should be on fire over their heads, and they
          could not make up their minds to flee from under it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what folly does it argue for men, that their practices are so
          inconsistent with their hearts, and that they say one thing and do
          another, and so are unsteady in their practice, and inconsistent with
          themselves at different times! It is looked upon as great folly, and
          what persons are much to be ashamed of, to be so unsteady in temporal
          matters, to undo one day what they did another. And so, in their
          practice in some things to be inconsistent with their practice in
          others. In one thing to act like a friend, and in another like an
          enemy. Persons that do so in temporals are abhorred of men, and looked
          upon as not fit for human society.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, you may hereby be convinced of your misery. A man cannot be
          happy, and cannot but be miserable, with whom it is thus. It shows a
          man to be undone. He, whose nature is brought into such violation, is
          evidently brought into a state of ruin. Where there is such
          self-inconsistency and self-opposition, a man is at war with himself,
          and therefore must be miserable. It is a calamity for a man not to be
          at peace with his neighbor, and to live in contention with those that
          are about him. But certainly it is a much greater calamity for him to
          be at war with himself, to have his judgment at war with his judgment,
          and his will at war with his reason and conscience, and his will at
          war with itself, and one lust thwarting another, and his outward man
          at war with his inward man, his mouth contradicting his heart, his
          practice contradicting his profession, and contradicting itself. It is
          impossible that such a man should enjoy any happiness as long as
          things are thus within him. Do what you will here, you cannot make him
          happy. If you take him and place him in a palace, and set him on a
          throne, and clothe him in the robes of princes, and put a crown of
          gold on his head, and set before him the richest dainties, feed him
          and feast him as much as you will, still he that so disagrees with
          himself, is a miserable wretch. Though he may be stupid, yet it is
          impossible he should enjoy any true peace or rest. How should he, in
          whom all things are in such utter confusion and uproar within, and in
          whom there is so much self-opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          This may convince us of the truth, and show us the reason, of Isa.
          57:20, 21, “But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot
          rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. There is no peace, saith my
          God, to the wicked.”
        </p>
        <p>
          How should he have any peace, who is his own enemy, who chooses and
          practices these things which his own conscience condemns, and which
          his own reason tells him tend to his own ruin? How should he have any
          peace, that hates his own soul and loves his own death, and that has
          one lust holding him one way, and another the contrary, so as in some
          respects to choose and refuse the same thing, to wish for a thing that
          at the same time he hates and refuses, and so goes on from day to day
          in warring against himself?
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, this shows your inexcusableness. By this inconsistency with
          yourself, you are condemned out of your own mouth in that you act
          contrary to your own conscience. Your own conscience condemns you in
          your will and practice being contrary to your own reason. Your own
          reason condemns you in acting contrary to your profession. Your own
          profession condemns you in the sense in which the apostle speaks of a
          heretic as being condemned of himself. Tit. 3:10, 11, “A man that is a
          heretic, after the first and second admonition, reject; knowing that
          he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of
          himself:” i.e. he in departing from his former profession is
          inconsistent with himself. His present heretical tenets are contrary
          to his former solemn profession, and therefore that former profession
          condemns him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider how inexcusable you, who are thus inconsistent with yourself
          in your wickedness, will appear at the last day, when you come to
          stand before the judgment-seat of God, when you are by him called to
          an account for your wicked life, how will your mouth be stopped. When
          you are called to an account why you have preferred things of such
          short and uncertain continuance as the things of this vain world, to
          the great things of the eternal world, what will you have to say for
          yourself, when it shall appear that herein you acted in direct
          opposition to the plain dictates of your own reason, and that this
          choice is inconsistent with the judgment and choice you were wont to
          make in temporal things? And what will you say for yourself when you
          are called to give an account why you rejected God, and Christ, and
          heaven for their holiness; when it so plainly appears that you would
          not like them, and would not have accepted them, if they had been any
          other way than holy?
        </p>
        <p>
          It will then appear that you have voluntarily rejected Christ and his
          great salvation, and refused to accept of heaven, and that you are
          condemned of yourself in it, in that at the same time you evinced the
          great necessity of those things in praying for them, and doing many
          things in order to the obtaining of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it shall then appear how you had a mind to have impossibilities:
          as a sufficiently worthy Savior, and not a holy one; salvation from
          misery, and not salvation from sin, the source of all misery; and
          happiness without holiness. It shall from hence most plainly appear,
          that you did in effect utterly refuse to accept of any Savior or any
          salvation at all, and would not be saved from misery at all, and
          refused to accept of any happiness at all, because you would have no
          salvation, no happiness, but such as was impossible in the nature of
          things, such a salvation as was not and could not be. And then how
          just will it appear to your own conscience, and to the world, that you
          should e’en go without salvation!
        </p>
        <p>
          And when it shall appear how you had life and death set before you,
          and were told the necessity of coming to a choice, and were so often
          urged to it, and had so much opportunity for it, and yet refused. How
          just will it appear that divine justice should make your choice for
          you, when you refused to make any for yourself!
        </p>
        <p>
          And how will you appear condemned out of your own mouth, when you
          shall be called to an account by the Judge, why you so often professed
          to God in your prayers that he was an infinitely great and holy God,
          and yet never feared him. And why you so often said to God that he was
          a sovereign and righteous God, and yet never submitted to him. And why
          you so often said to him that the was an all-sufficient and faithful
          God, and yet never would put your trust in him. And why you so often
          said to him that he was an infinitely glorious, and excellent, and
          good God, and yet never loved him. And why you so often owned that he
          was an infinitely gracious and bountiful God, and what you had
          received abundance of kindness from him, and owned him to be the
          author of all those good things of your life that you enjoy, and yet
          never were truly thankful to him, but improved those things that you
          owned were the gifts of God, against himself who was the giver of
          them. Why you so often owned in your prayers before God that you were
          a poor sinful, vile creature for your sins, and yet never would
          forsake your sins, and begged of God to keep you from sin, and yet
          carelessly and willfully went on in the commission of sin? What will
          you say to such interrogations of the Judge of heaven and earth? Will
          not your mouth be stopped when it shall appear that what has already
          so often proceeded out of your own mouth, does so much condemn you?
          And what will hypocrites and self-pretenders to experiences say, who
          have told what discoveries they had of the glory of God, of Christ,
          and of heaven. When the Judge inquires of them, why they set so light
          by this God, and did so prefer the dust of the earth and the filth of
          sin before him? When those who have often told what love they have
          felt to the Lord Jesus Christ, are asked why they took no more care to
          please and honor him, and why they rather chose from time to time to
          reject him than sacrifice their worldly interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when wicked men are inquired of why, when they professed to believe
          a future state, they took no more pains to prepare for it. Why, when
          they professed to be the followers of Christ the Lamb of God, they
          were no more like him? Why, when they owned him for their head, and
          expressed such wonderful love to him, they could turn and become his
          enemies? Why, when they lived in hope of a life of such unspeakable
          glory in heaven, they set their affections wholly on this world? Why,
          seeing they made such a show of regard to God and their duty at one
          time, they discovered such a total disregard at another? Why, when
          they made such pretenses to religion, and had such appearances of it
          in some things, they were so irreligious and wicked in others? What
          will they answer? Wicked men will appear self-condemned every way:
          their own reason and their own consciences, their own mouths and their
          own actions, have condemned them. Their reason and consciences will
          still condemn them, and God will condemn them, and men and angels will
          and must condemn them. So that they will appear universally condemned,
          they will have nothing to say for themselves, nor will any one have
          anything to say for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, if you are so inconsistent with yourself, you need not wonder
          that God will enter into no friendship with you, or that he does not
          receive you into his favor. Many natural men are ready to wonder that
          god will not receive them into favor — they do so much in religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you consider what has been said, you need not wonder at it. A
          wise man will make no friendship with another who is very inconsistent
          with himself in those things wherein men are concerned with him. He
          will not associate himself with him, nor care to have such to
          communicate with him. For men know that such persons are not to be
          depended on. One does not know where to find them, nor how to suit
          them, and if they will be so inconsistent with themselves, certainly
          they will not be very consistent with others that trust them. God
          therefore justly refuses to receive such persons into union with him.
          It is not consistent with his divine wisdom to give himself to them in
          a covenant relation.
        </p>
        <p>
          No wonder that Christ will not commit himself to such persons as
          these. John 2:23, 24, 25, “Now, when he was in Jerusalem at the
          passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw
          the miracles which he did. But Jesus did not commit himself unto them,
          because he knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of
          man; for he knew what was in man.” Christ knew that there was no
          dependence to be had upon them. He knew they would not prove
          consistent with themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, how vain and inconsistent is the dependence of wicked men on
          themselves! If this be the case with natural men, if all natural men
          are as we have heard, so absurdly inconsistent with themselves, how
          unreasonable is their high thought of themselves, and their trusting
          to their own goodness, to their own prayers, and their other
          performances!
        </p>
        <p>
          And that they do so, is an evident sign of their woeful ignorance of
          themselves. If such persons saw themselves as they are, and to be such
          as we have described them, certainly they would be far from trusting
          in their own excellency and goodness, but would see themselves to be
          polluted, wretched, miserable, lost creatures, and would no more say
          in their hearts, “I am rich, and increased with goods;” but would
          rather condemn themselves, and cry out with self-abhorrence and
          amazement, “Unclean, unclean, undone, undone!”
