          1 Kings 18:21, “And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How
          long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him; but
          if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.”
        </p>
        <p>
          IT is the manner of God, before he bestows any signal mercy on the
          people, first to prepare them for it. And before he removes any awful
          judgments which he hath brought upon them for their sins, first to
          cause them to forsake those sins which procured those judgments. We
          have an instance of this in the context. — It was a time of sore
          famine in Israel. There had been neither rain nor dew for the space of
          three years and six months. This famine was brought upon the land for
          their idolatry. But God was now about to remove this judgment. And
          therefore, to prepare them for it, sends Elijah to convince them of
          the folly of idolatry, and to bring them to repentance for it. — In
          order to this, Elijah by the command of the Lord, goes and shows
          himself to Ahab, and directs him to send and gather all Israel to him
          at mount Carmel, and all the prophets of Baal, four hundred and fifty,
          and the prophets of the groves that ate at Jezebel’s table, four
          hundred, that they might determine the matter and bring the
          controversy to an issue, whether Jehovah or Baal were God. To this
          end, Elijah proposes, that each should take a bullock, that he should
          take one, and the prophets of Baal another, that each should cut his
          bullock to pieces, lay it on the wood, and put no fire under [it]. And
          that the God who should answer by fire should be concluded to be God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text contains an account of what Elijah said to all the people at
          their first meeting, and of their silence. “And Elijah came unto all
          the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? If the
          Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.” To which the
          people, it seems, made no reply. In these words, we may observe:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. How Elijah expostulates with the people about their halting so long
          between two opinions; in which expostulation may be observed:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, what the two opinions were, between which they halted, viz.
          Whether the Lord were God, or whether Baal were God. The case in
          Israel seems to have been this: there were some who were altogether
          for Baal, and wholly rejected the true God; of which number, to be
          sure, were Jezebel and the prophets of Baal. And there were some among
          them who were altogether for the God of Israel, and wholly rejected
          Baal; as God told Elijah, that “he had yet left in Israel seven
          thousand that had not bowed the knee to Baal, and whose mouths had not
          kissed him,” 1 Kin. 19:18.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the rest of the people halted between two opinions. They saw that
          some were for one, and some for the other, and they did not know which
          to choose. And as is commonly the case when difference of opinion
          prevails, there were many who had no religion at all. They were not
          settled in anything. The different opinions prevalent in Israel
          distracted and confounded them. Many who professed to believe in the
          true God were yet very cold and indifferent. And many were wavering
          and unsettled. They saw that the king and queen were for Baal. And
          Baal’s party was the prevailing party. But their forefathers had been
          for the Lord. And they knew not which were right. Thus they halted
          between two opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, in this expostulation is implied the unreasonableness of their
          thus halting between two opinions. “How long halt ye between two
          opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow
          him.” Which implies that they ought to determine one way or the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We may observe their silence on this occasion, “And the people
          answered him not a word”, as being convicted in their own consciences
          of the unreasonableness of their being for so long a time wavering and
          unresolved. They had nothing to reply in excuse for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>Unresolvedness in religion is very unreasonable.</p>
        <p>
          I. Prop. Many persons remain exceedingly undetermined with respect to
          religion. They are very much undetermined in themselves whether to
          embrace religion or to reject it. Many who are baptized, and make a
          profession of religion, and seem to be Christians, are yet in their
          own minds halting between two opinions. They never yet came fully to a
          conclusion whether to be Christians or not. They are taught the
          Christian religion in their childhood, and have the Bible, the word
          preached, and the means of grace, all their days. Yet [they] continue,
          and grow up, and many grow old, in an unresolvedness whether to
          embrace Christianity or not. And many continue unresolved as long as
          they live.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, there are some persons who have never come to a settled
          determination in their own minds whether or [not] there be any truth
          in religion. They hear of the things of religion from their childhood
          all their days; but never come to a conclusion in their own minds
          whether they be real or fabulous. Particularly, some have never come
          to any determination in their own minds whether there be any such
          thing as conversion. They hear much talk about it, and know that many
          pretend to be the subjects of it. But they are never resolved whether
          all be not merely designed hypocrisy and imposture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some never come to any determination whether the Scriptures be the
          Word of God, or whether they be the invention of men; and whether the
          story concerning Jesus Christ be anything but a fable. They fear it is
          true, but sometimes very much doubt of it. Sometimes when they hear
          arguments for it, they assent that it is true. But upon every little
          objection or temptation arising, they call it in question; and are
          always wavering and never settled about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it seems to have been with many of the Jews in Christ’s time. They
          were always at a loss what to make of him, whether he were indeed the
          Christ, or whether he were Elias, or one of the old prophet, or a mere
          impostor. John 10:24, 25, “Then came the Jews round about him, and
          said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the
          Christ, tell us plainly. Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye
          believed not.” Some have never so much as come to a resolution in
          their own minds, whether there be a God or not. They know not that
          there is, and oftentimes very much doubt of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, there are some who never have come to any determination in
          their own minds whether to embrace religion in the practice of it.
          Religion consists not merely, or chiefly, in theory or speculation,
          but in practice. It is a practical thing. The end of it is to guide
          and influence us in our practice. And considered in this view, there
          are multitudes who never have come to a conclusion whether to embrace
          religion or not. It is probably pretty general for men to design to be
          religious some time or other before they die; for none intend to go to
          hell. But they still keep it at a distance. They put it off from time
          to time, and never come to any conclusion which determines them in
          their present practice. And some never so much as fix upon any time.
          They design to be religious some time before they die, but they know
          not when.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many who have always continued unresolved about the
          necessity of striving and being earnestly engaged for salvation. They
          flatter themselves that they may obtain salvation, though they be not
          so earnestly engaged; though they mind the world and their worldly
          affairs more than their salvation. They are often told how necessary
          it is that they make haste and not delay, that they do whatever their
          hand findeth to do with their might, that a dull slack way of seeking
          salvation is never likely to be effectual. But of these things they
          are never thoroughly convinced. Some seem to resolve to be in earnest,
          and seem to set out with some engagedness of mind. But soon fail
          because they have never been fully convinced of its necessity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many have never come to a determination what to choose for their
          portion. There are but two things which God offers to mankind for
          their portion. One is this world, with the pleasures and profits of
          sin, together with eternal misery ensuing. The other is heaven and
          eternal glory, with a life of self-denial and respect to all the
          commands of God. Many, as long as they live, come to no settled
          determination which of these to choose. They must have one or the
          other. They cannot have both. But they always remain in suspense and
          never make their choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          They would fain have heaven and this world too. They would have
          salvation and the pleasures and profits of sin too. But considering
          heaven and the world, as God offers them, they will have neither. God
          offers heaven only with the self-denial and difficulty which are in
          the way to it. And they are not willing to have heaven on these
          conditions. God offers the world and the pleasures of sin to men not
          alone, but with eternal misery in connection with them. And so neither
          are they willing to have the world. They would fain divide heaven from
          the holiness and self-denial which are the way to it, and from the
          holiness which reigns in it, and then they would be glad to have
          heaven. They would fain divide sin from hell, and then they would
          fully determine forever to cleave to sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          But God will not make such a division for them. They must have one or
          the other of these for their portion, as God offers. And therefore
          they never make any choice at all. — Indeed they do practically and in
          effect choose sin and hell. But they do not come to any resolution in
          their own minds which they will have for their portion, whether heaven
          and holiness, or the world and hell. They are always wavering and
          halting between two opinions. Sometimes they seem to determine for the
          one, and sometimes for the other. When they meet with no difficulty or
          temptation and can, as they say, do their duty without hurting
          themselves or much crossing their carnal inclinations, they seem to
          choose heaven and holiness. At other times, wherein they meet with
          difficulty in the way of duty, and great temptations of worldly
          profits or pleasures are laid before them, then they choose the world,
          and let heaven and holiness alone. — There are among us vast
          multitudes before whom these two things have been set hundreds of
          times, who have never to this day come to a determination which to
          have.
        </p>
        <p>
          So they have never yet determined which shall be their master, whether
          God or mammon. There are but few who have undertaken the service of
          God, and are come to a resolution and preparedness of mind to serve
          God and follow Christ at all times, and to whatever difficulties it
          may expose them. Yet, at the same time, neither are they determined
          that they will continue to serve Satan. They are afraid to draw up
          such a conclusion. — Thus many spend their lives without making their
          choice, though they do in the mean time practically choose the service
          of Satan. These are the persons of whom the apostle James speaks in
          chap. 1:8. “The double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.”
        </p>
        <p>
          II. To continue thus undetermined and unresolved in the things of
          religion, is very unreasonable, and that upon the following accounts:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, in the things of religion we are to the highest degree
          interested. The truth or falsehood of the doctrines of religion
          concerns us to the highest degree possible. It is no matter of
          indifference to us whether there be a God or not; or whether the
          Scriptures be the Word of God; or whether Christ be the Son of God; or
          whether there be any such thing as conversion. It makes and infinite
          difference to us, whether these things be so or not. Therefore we are
          under the greatest obligation in point of interest to resolve in our
          minds whether they be true or false. They who are undetermined whether
          there be any truth in religion, and are contented to be so, not
          inquiring, nor thoroughly using the means to be determined, act very
          unreasonably. They remain in doubt whether there be any such thing as
          heaven or hell; are quiet and easy to continue ignorant in this
          matter; are not engaged in their minds to come to a determination; do
          not search and inquire what arguments there are to prove any such
          things; nor diligently weigh and consider the force of them. But
          [they] busy their minds about other things of infinitely less
          importance; and act as if they thought it did not much concern them
          whether there be a future and eternal state.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they think that there is not, yet it is a matter of so great
          importance, that no wise man would rest until he had satisfied
          himself; because if there be such a future state as the Scriptures
          assert, then we must have our part in it, either in a state of eternal
          rewards, or in a state of eternal punishment. — So it is no matter of
          indifference to us what we have for our portion, whether this world
          with hell, or a life of holiness and self-denial with heaven. These
          opposite portions relate, not merely to a few days in this world, but
          to eternity. It is infinite madness therefore not to come to a
          determination.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it is no matter of indifference what master we serve, whether God
          or mammon; or what interest we will pursue, whether our temporal or
          eternal interest; or which we prefer, the commands of God, or our
          pleasures, our ease, and convenience. We ought therefore to come to
          some determination which we will choose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, God hath made us reasonable creatures, and capable of
          rationally determining for ourselves. Doubtless God hath made man
          capable of discovering the truth in matters of religion, of coming to
          a good determination in these questions, whether the Scriptures be the
          Word of God, whether there be a future state, and the like. The
          resolution of these questions, which it so much concerns us to
          determine, is not about our capacities. God hath not set these things
          beyond the extent of our faculties.
        </p>
        <p>
          God hath made us capable of making a wise choice for ourselves, as to
          the life we shall choose to lead. He hath given man so much
          understanding, as to make him capable of determining which is best; to
          lead a life of self-denial, and enjoy eternal happiness, or to take
          our swing in sinful enjoyments, and burn in hell forever. The question
          is of no difficult determination. — It is so far from being a matter
          too hard for our reason, that the reason of a child is sufficient to
          determine this matter. Therefore men in remaining undetermined in
          these matters, do not act as reasonable creatures, but make themselves
          like “the horse and the mule, which have no understanding,” Psa. 32:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, God puts into our hands a happy opportunity to determine for
          ourselves. What better opportunity can a man desire to consult his own
          interest than to have liberty to choose his own portion? God sets life
          and death before us. Deu. 30:19, “I call heaven and earth to record
          this day against you, that I have set before you life and death,
          blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that thou and thy seed
          after thee may live.” See also Eze. 18:31, 32, and chap. 33:11. What
          better opportunity can we desire for securing to ourselves the
          greatest good, than to have eternal life and unchangeable happiness
          set before us, and offered to our choice? Therefore those who neglect
          coming to a resolution, act unreasonably, because they stand so much
          in their own light, and neglect so glorious an opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, the things among which we are to make our choice are but few
          in number. There are but two portions set before us, one of which must
          be our portion; either life or death, either blessing or cursing;
          either a life of universal and persevering obedience, with eternal
          glory, or a worldly, carnal, wicked life, with eternal misery. If
          there were many terms in the offer made us, many things of nearly and
          equal value, one of which we must choose, to remain long in suspense
          and undetermined would be more excusable. There would be more reason
          for long deliberation before we should fix. But there are only two
          terms, there are but two states in another world, in one or the other
          of which we must be fixed to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there are but two states in this world, a state of sin, and a
          state of holiness; a natural state, and a converted state. There is
          but one way in which we can come to life, which renders the
          determination of reason much the easier. There are but two masters, to
          one of which we must be reputed the servants, Baal and Jehovah, God
          and Mammon. There are but two competitors for the possession of us,
          Christ and the devil. — There are but two paths, in one of which you
          are to travel, either in the straight and narrow way which leadeth
          unto life, or the broad way which leadeth unto destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shows the unreasonableness of those who live under light, and
          have the offers of the gospel made to them, and yet remain from year
          to year unfixed and undetermined, halting between two opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, God hath given us all needed helps to determine us. We have all
          needful helps to determine our understanding, as to the truth of the
          things of religion, as whether there be a God, whether the Scriptures
          be the Word of God, whether there be a future state, etc. We are not
          left in the dark as to these things, as the poor heathens are, who are
          under great disadvantages to come to the knowledge of the truth,
          though they be not under an impossibility, for “they may haply feel
          after God and find him,” Acts 17:27. But we have a clear sunshine to
          guide us. We have a particular description of those things which are
          set before us for truth and have great opportunity to examine them.
          The Scripture lies open before us, and all the doctrines of the gospel
          are particularly set forth, with the reasons on which their evidence
          is founded. We may search and try their force and sufficiency, as we
          please.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have great helps to a wise and rational determination in our
          choice; to determine whether it be best for us to choose a life of sin
          or a life of holiness, the service of God or the service of Baal. We
          have very plainly set before us the advantages of both sides. The loss
          and gain are particularly stated. Christ hath dealt by us faithfully,
          and hath told us what we shall get and what we shall lose by being his
          followers. He hath also told us what we shall get and what we shall
          lose by a life of sin. He hath not dealt by us deceitfully. He hath
          not pretended greater advantages in godliness than there really are,
          nor greater disadvantages or dangers in sin. John 14:2, “In my
          Father’s house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told
          you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He hath told us plainly that we must take up the cross daily and
          follow him; that we must hate father and mother, and wife and
          children, and brethren and sisters, and our own life also, in order to
          become his disciples; and that we must cut off our rights hands, and
          pluck out our right eyes, in order to enter into heaven. Thus we have
          a fair opportunity to count the costs on both sides, and are directed
          so to do, Luke 14:28. — How unreasonable therefore is it for men who
          have all these helps and advantages, to remain in suspense, and to
          come to no conclusion whether they will be Christians or heathens,
          whether they will be for God or the devil; though they have lived
          under the preaching of the word and offers of the gospel for many
          years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth, we have no reason to expect to be under better advantages to
          determine hereafter than we are now. We never shall have a clearer
          revelation of gospel truth. Never shall have the advantages and
          disadvantages of both sides more plainly set before us than they are
          already in the Word of God. Nor are we ever [likely] to be under
          better advantages to know what will be best for us, and most for our
          interest. Those therefore who delay, gain nothing by their delays, but
          give Satan more opportunity to darken their minds, to deceive them,
          and lead them astray in their choice. Therefore their delay of coming
          to a resolution is unreasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventh, if they come not to a determination in this life, God will
          determine for them, and will appoint them their portion with the
          wicked. If sinners, by refusing to choose either life or death, either
          heaven or hell, could thereby avoid both, or if in this case the
          matter would remain undetermined, till they should determine it; the
          folly and unreasonableness of delaying a determination would not be so
          great. But that is not the case. If they go on halting between two
          opinions, God will determine for them and that quickly. He will
          determine where their portion shall be, viz. among the unbelievers, in
          the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone forever. God will not
          wait upon them always, to see what they will choose. But he will put
          an issue to the matter by his unalterable sentence. — Therefore it
          becomes all, if they are afraid to have their lot assigned them in
          hell, to come soon to a determination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eighth, delay in this case is unreasonable, because those who delay
          know not how soon the opportunity of choosing for themselves will be
          past. The opportunity will last no longer than life. When once life is
          past, they will no more have the offer made them. The sentence will be
          past. The matter will be closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who delay their choice in this world will be glad to choose
          afterwards. Then they will not be at a loss which to choose; they will
          be able easily to determine. The judgments of sinners, after this
          life, are soon resolved, whether there be any truth in religion or
          not. They can soon determine which is most eligible; a life of
          obedience and self-denial, with heaven for a reward, or a life of
          irreligion and sin, with hell for a punishment. They no longer halt
          between two opinions. But it is too late. Their opportunity is past.
          They would give all the world for another opportunity to choose. They
          would then soon come to a determination. But it will not be granted
          them.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          I. Let this put everyone upon examining himself, whether or no he have
          ever yet come to a full determination in the affair of religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, inquire whether you have yet come to a full determination with
          respect to the truth of the things of religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have you ever been fully convinced? Is it a question which has been
          answered and determined with you, whether there be a future state. Or
          does it yet remain a question with you unresolved? Are you not yet to
          seek whether there be any future state, and whether or no the story
          about Jesus Christ be any more than a fable? Here I desire you to note
          two things:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. If the main reason why you assent to the truth of religion be that
          others believe so and you have been so instructed from your childhood,
          you are of those with whom the truth of religion yet remains
          undetermined. Tradition and education will never fix and settle the
          mind in a satisfactory and effectual belief of the truth. Though men,
          taking religion upon trust, may seem to give a full assent to the
          truth of religion, and not to call it in question; yet such a faith
          will not stand a shock. A temptation easily overthrows it. The reason
          of man in time of trial will not rest on so poor an evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are multitudes who seem to grant the truth of religion, with
          whom the main foundation of their faith is the tradition of their
          fathers, or the profession of their neighbors. And it is to be feared.
          It is so with many who count themselves good Christians. But as to all
          such persons as never have seen any other evidence to satisfy them,
          either of the truth or falsehood of religion, they only halt between
          two opinions. — The same may be said of those who are unstable in
          their disposition with regard to Christ or the things which he taught.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If you are fully come to a determination concerning the things of
          religion, that they are true, they will be of weight with you above
          all things in the world. If you be really convinced that these things
          are no fable, but reality, it is impossible but that you must be
          influenced by them above all things in the world. For these things are
          so great, and so infinitely exceed all temporal things, that it cannot
          be otherwise. He that really is convinced that there is a heaven and
          hell, and an eternal judgment; that the soul, as soon as parted from
          the body, appears before the judgment-seat of God; and that the
          happiness and misery of a future state is as great as the Scriptures
          represents it; or that God is as holy, just, and jealous, as he hath
          declared concerning himself in his word; I say, he that is really
          convinced, and hath settled it with himself, that these things are
          certainly true, will be influenced by them above all things in the
          world. He will be more concerned by far how he shall escape eternal
          damnation, and have the favor of God and eternal life, than how he
          shall get the world, gratify the flesh, please his neighbors, get
          honor, or obtain any temporal advantage whatsoever. His main inquiry
          will not be, what shall I eat, and what shall I drink, etc. but he
          will seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examine yourselves therefore by this: Are not your hearts chiefly set
          upon the world and the things of it? Is it not more your concern,
          care, and endeavor to further your outward interest, than to secure an
          interest in heaven? And is not this the very reason that you have
          never seen the reality of eternal things?
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, inquire whether you have ever yet come to a determination
          about religion with respect to the practice of it; whether you have
          chosen heaven with the way to it, viz. the way of obedience and
          self-denial, before this world and the ways of sin; whether you have
          determined upon it as most eligible, to devote yourselves to the
          service of God. — Here I shall mention three or four things which are
          signs that men halt between two opinions in the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. To put off duty till hereafter. When persons love to keep their
          duty at a distance, engage not in it for the present, but think of
          engaging when they shall be under better conveniences for it; — when
          they are very good intenders concerning what they will do tomorrow,
          but very poor performers today; when they say, as Felix, “Go thy way
          for this time, when I have a convenient season I will call for thee;”
          — it is a sign that they halt between two opinions, and have never as
          yet come to a full determination with respect to the practice of
          religion. Those that have once fully determined that religion is
          necessary and eligible, will not desire to put it off, but will make
          it their present and immediate business.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is a sign of the same thing when persons are strict and
          conscientious in some things, but not universal in their obedience; do
          some duties, but live in the omission of others; avoid some sins, but
          allow themselves in others; are conscientious with respect to the
          duties of worship public and private, but not in their behavior to
          their neighbors; are not just in their dealings, nor conscientious in
          paying their debts; nor do to others as they would that they should do
          to them; but have crooked perverse ways in their dealings among
          mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same may be said when they are just in their dealings and trade
          with men, but are not conscientious in other things “ indulge sensual
          appetite, drink to excess, or allow themselves in wanton practices; or
          are honest and temperate, but licentious in using their tongues,
          backbiting and reproaching their fellowmen,” 2 Tim. 3:6, 7.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is a sign that you halt between two opinions if you sometimes
          are wont to be considerably engaged in religion, but at other times
          neglect it; sometimes forming a resolution to be in good earnest, then
          dropping it again; sometimes seeming to be really engaged in seeking
          salvation, and very earnest in religious duties; at other times wholly
          taken up about the things of the world, while religion is neglected,
          and religious duties are omitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          These things show that you are yet unsettled, have never yet come to a
          full determination concerning religion, but are halting between two
          opinions, and therefore are thus unstable in all your ways, and
          proceed thus by fits and starts in religion. Jam. 1:6, 7, 8, “But let
          him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for he that wavereth is like a
          wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man
          think that he shall receive anything of the Lord. A double-minded man
          is unstable in all his ways.” If your determination were fixed in
          religion, you would be more steady in your practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is a sign that you are halting between two opinions if it be
          your manner to balk your duty whenever any notable difficulty comes in
          the way, considerably cross to your interest, or very inconsistent
          with your ease or convenience, or you temporal honor. Whatever zeal
          you may seem to have, whatever concern about the things of religion.,
          and however strict you be in ordinary, you have never, if this be your
          manner, come to a full determination; have never fully made choice of
          religion and the benefits of it for your only portion; and at best
          have got no further than king Agrippa, who was almost persuaded to be
          a Christian, Acts 26:28. You are in the state of the stony-ground
          hearers, you have no root in yourselves, and like a tree without root,
          are easily blown down by every wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I shall conclude with an earnest exhortation to all, no longer to
          halt between two opinions, but immediately to come to a determination
          whether to be Christians or not. Let me insist upon it, that you now
          make a choice, whether you will have heaven; with a life of universal
          and persevering obedience, for your portion; or hell, with a life
          spent in the pursuit of this world. — Consider those things which have
          been said, showing the unreasonableness of continuing in such
          irresolution about an affair of infinite importance to you, and as to
          which you have so short an opportunity to make your choice. — Consider
          two things in addition to what hath been already said.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, those who live under the gospel, and thus continue undetermined
          about religion, are more abominable to God than the heathen. He hates
          those persons who continue from year to year, under the calls, and
          warnings, and instructions, and entreaties of God’s Word; who yet can
          be brought to nothing; who will come to no determination at all; will
          neither be Christians nor heathens. These are they who are spoken of
          in Rev 3:15, 16, “ I know thy works, that thou are neither cold nor
          hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm,
          and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth.” — And
          Eze. 20:39, “As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord God,
          Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will
          not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your
          gifts, and with your idols.” — These are (2 Tim. 3:7) “ever learning,
          and never coming to the knowledge of the truth.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, if you still refuse to come to a determination whether to be
          Christians or not, how just will it be, if God shall give you no
          further opportunity! If you refuse to make any choice at all-after all
          that hath been done to bring you to it, in setting life and death so
          often before you, in calling and warning you, how just will it be, if
          God shall wait no longer upon you. But shall, by his unalterable
          sentence, determine the case himself, and fix your state with the
          unbelievers, and teach you the truth and eligibleness of religion, by
          sad and fatal experience, when it will be too late for you to choose
          your portion.
