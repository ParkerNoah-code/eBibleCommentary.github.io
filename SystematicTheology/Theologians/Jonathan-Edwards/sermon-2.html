        <h2>The Portion of the Wicked – Romans 2:8, 9</h2>
        <p class="title">Dated November, 1735.</p>
        <p>
          Romans 2:8, 9, “But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey
          the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
          tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of
          the Jew first, and also of the Gentile.”
        </p>
        <p>
          IT is the drift of the apostle in the three first chapters of this
          epistle, to show that both Jews and Gentiles are under sin, and
          therefore cannot be justified by works of law, but only by faith in
          Christ. In the first chapter he had shown that the Gentiles were under
          sin. In this he shows that the Jews also are under sin, and that
          however severe they were in their censures upon the Gentiles, yet they
          themselves did the same things, for which the apostle very much blames
          them. “Therefore, thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
          judgest, for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself;
          for thou that judgest, doest the same things.” And he warns them not
          to go on in such a way, by forewarning them of the misery to which
          they will expose themselves by it, and by giving them to understand,
          that instead of their misery being less than that of the Gentiles, it
          would be the greater, for God’s distinguishing goodness to them above
          the Gentiles. The Jews thought that they should be exempted from
          future wrath because God had chosen them to be his peculiar people.
          But the apostle informs them that there should be indignation and
          wrath, tribulation and anguish, to every soul of man, not only to the
          Gentiles, but to every soul and to the Jews first and chiefly, when
          they did evil, because their sins were more aggravated.
        </p>
        <p>In the text we find,</p>
        <p>
          I. A description of wicked men, in which may be observed those
          qualifications of wicked men which have the nature of a cause, and
          those which have the nature of an effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those qualifications of wicked men here mentioned that have the nature
          of a cause, are their being contentious, and not obeying the truth,
          but obeying unrighteousness. By their being contentious, is meant
          their being contentious against the truth, their quarreling with the
          gospel, their finding fault with its declarations and offers.
          Unbelievers find many things in the ways of God at which they stumble,
          and by which they are offended. They are always quarreling and finding
          fault with one thing or another, whereby they are kept from believing
          the truth and yielding to it. Christ is to them a stone of stumbling,
          and rock of offense. They do not obey the truth, that is, they do not
          yield to it, they do not receive it with faith. That yielding to the
          truth and embracing it, which there is in saving faith, is called
          obeying, in Scripture. Rom. 6:17, “But God be thanked that ye were the
          servants of sin; but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of
          doctrine which was delivered you.” Heb. 5:9, “And being made perfect,
          he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey
          him.” Rom. 1:5, “By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for
          obedience to the faith among all nations for his name.” But they obey
          unrighteousness instead of yielding to the gospel, they are under the
          power and dominion of sin, and are slaves to their lusts and
          corruptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is in those qualifications of wicked men that their wickedness
          radically consists. Their unbelief and opposition to the truth, and
          their slavish subjection to lust, are the foundation of all
          wickedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those qualifications of wicked men, which have the nature of an
          effect, are their doing evil. This is the least of their opposition
          against the gospel, and of their slavish subjection to their lusts,
          that they do evil. Those wicked principles are the foundation, and
          their wicked practice is the superstructure. Those were the root, and
          this is the fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The punishment of wicked men, in which may be also noticed the
          cause and the effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those things mentioned in their punishment that have the nature of a
          cause, are indignation and wrath; i.e. the indignation and wrath of
          God. It is the anger of God that will render wicked men miserable.
          They will be the subjects of divine wrath, and hence will arise their
          whole punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those things in their punishment that have the nature of an effect,
          are tribulation and anguish. Indignation and wrath in God, will work
          extreme sorrow, trouble, and anguish of heart, in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctrine. Indignation, wrath, misery, and anguish of soul, are the
          portion that God has allotted to wicked men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone of mankind must have the portion that belongs to him. God
          allots to each one his portion. And the portion of the wicked is
          nothing but wrath, and distress, and anguish of soul. Though they may
          enjoy a few empty and vain pleasures and delights, for a few days
          while they stay in this world, yet that which is allotted to them by
          the Possessor and Governor of all things to be their portion, is only
          indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish. This is not the
          portion that wicked men choose. The portion that they choose is
          worldly happiness, yet it is the portion that God carves out for them.
          It is the portion that they in effect choose for themselves. For they
          choose those things that naturally and necessarily lead to it, and
          those that they are plainly told, times without number, will issue in
          it. Pro. 8:36, “But he that sinneth against me, wrongeth his own soul;
          all they that hate me love death.” But whether they choose it or not,
          this will and must be the portion to all eternity of all who live and
          die wicked men. Indignation and wrath shall pursue them as long as
          they live in this world, shall drive them out of the world, and shall
          follow them into another world. And there wrath and misery shall abide
          upon them throughout eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The method that I shall take in treating this subject, is to describe
          the wrath and misery of which wicked men shall be the subjects, both
          here and hereafter, in the successive parts and periods of it,
          according to the order of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I shall describe the wrath that often pursues wicked men in this
          life. Indignation and wrath often being with them here.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, God oftentimes in wrath leaves them to themselves. They are
          left in their sins, and left to undo themselves, and work out their
          own ruin. He lets them alone in sin. Hos. 4:17, “Ephraim is joined to
          his idols; let him alone.” He often leaves them to go great lengths in
          sin, and does not afford them that restraining grace that he does to
          others. He leaves them to their own blindness, so that they always
          remain ignorant of God and Christ, and of the things that belong to
          their peace. They are sometimes left to hardness of heart, to be
          stupid and senseless, so that nothing will ever thoroughly awaken
          them. They are left to their own hearts’ lusts, to continue in some
          wicked practices all their days. Some are left to their covetousness,
          some to drunkenness, some to uncleanness, some to a proud,
          contentious, and envious spirit, and some to a spirit of finding fault
          and quarreling with God. God leaves them to their folly, to act
          exceedingly foolishly, to delay and put off the concerns of their
          souls from time to time, never to think the present time the best, but
          always to keep it at a distance, and foolishly to continue flattering
          themselves with hopes of long life, and to put far away the evil day,
          and to bless themselves in their hearts, and say, “I shall have peace,
          though I add drunkenness to thirst.” Some are so left that they are
          miserably hardened and senseless, when others all around them are
          awakened, and greatly concerned, and inquire what they shall do to be
          saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes God leaves men to a fatal backsliding for a misimprovement
          of the strivings of his Spirit. They are let alone, to backslide
          perpetually. Dreadful is the life and condition of those who are thus
          left of God. We have instances of the misery of such in God’s holy
          word, particularly of Saul and Judas. Such are, sometimes, very much
          left to the power of Satan to tempt them, to hurry them on in wicked
          courses, and exceedingly to aggravate their own guilt and misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, indignation and wrath are sometimes exercised towards them in
          this world, by their being cursed in all that concerns them, They have
          this curse of God following them in everything. They are cursed in all
          their enjoyments. If they are in prosperity, it is cursed to them. If
          they possess riches, if they have honor, if they enjoy pleasure, there
          is the curse of God that attends it. Psa. 92:7, “When the wicked
          spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish;
          it is that they may be destroyed forever.”
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a curse of God that attends their ordinary food. Every morsel
          of bread which they eat, and every drop of water which they drink.
          Psa. 69:22, “Let their table become a snare before them; and that
          which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.” They
          are cursed in all their employments, in whatsoever they put their
          hands to: when they go into the field to labor, or are at work at
          their respective trades. Deu. 28:16, “Cursed shalt thou be in the
          city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.” The curse of God remains
          in the houses where they dwell, and brimstone is scattered in their
          habitations. Job 18:15. The curse of God attends them in the
          afflictions which they meet with, whereas the afflictions that good
          men meet with, are fatherly corrections, and are sent in mercy. The
          afflictions which wicked men meet with are in wrath, and come from God
          as an enemy, and are the foretaste of their everlasting punishment.
          The curse of God attends them also in their spiritual enjoyments and
          opportunities, and it would have been better for them not to have been
          born in a land of light. Their having the Bible and the sabbath, is
          only to aggravate their guilt and misery. The Word of God when
          preached to them is a savor of death unto death. Better would it be
          for them, if Christ had never come into the world, if there had never
          been any offer of a Savior. Life itself is a curse to them. They live
          only to fill up the measure of their sins. What they seek in all the
          enjoyments, and employments, and concerns of life is their own
          happiness, but they never obtain it. They never obtain any true
          comfort, all the comforts which they have are worthless and
          unsatisfying. If they lived a hundred years with never so much of the
          world in their possession, their life is all filled up with vanity.
          All that they have is vanity of vanities, they find no true rest for
          their souls, they do but feed on the east wind, they have no real
          contentment. Whatever outward pleasures they may have, their souls are
          starving. They have no true peace of conscience, they have nothing of
          the favor of God. Whatever they do, they live in vain, and to no
          purpose. They are useless in the creation of God, they do not answer
          the end of their being. They live without God, and have not the
          presence of God, nor any communion with him. But on the contrary, all
          that they have and all that they do, does but contribute to their own
          misery, and render their future and everlasting state the more
          dreadful. The best of wicked men live but miserable and wretched
          lives, with all their prosperity. Their lives are most undesirable,
          and whatever they have, the wrath of God abides upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, after a time they must die. Ecc. 9:3, “This is an evil among
          all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto
          all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and
          madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to
          the dead.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Death is a far different thing when it befalls wicked men, from what
          it is when it befalls good men. To the wicked it is in execution of
          the curse of the law, and of the wrath of God. When a wicked man dies,
          God cuts him off in wrath, he is taken away as by a tempest of wrath,
          he is driven away in his wickedness. Pro. 14:32, “The wicked is driven
          away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.” Job
          18:18. “He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of
          the world.” Job 27:21, “The east wind carrieth him away, and he
          departeth, and as a storm, hurleth him out of his place.” Though
          wicked men, while they live, may live in worldly prosperity, yet they
          cannot live here always, but they must die. The place that knoweth him
          shall know him no more, and the eye that hath seen him shall see him
          no more in the land of the living.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their bounds are unchangeably set, and when they are come to those
          bounds they must go, and must leave all their worldly good things. If
          they have lived in outward glory their glory shall not descend after
          them. They get nothing while they live that they can carry away. Ecc.
          5:15, “As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return,
          to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labor, which he may
          carry away in his hand.” He must leave all his substance unto others.
          It they are at ease and quietness, death will put an end to their
          quietness, will spoil all their carnal mirth, and will strip them of
          all their glory. As they came naked into the world, so naked must they
          return, and go as they came. If they have laid up much goods for many
          years, if they have laid in stores, as they hope, for great comfort
          and pleasure, death will cut them off from all. Luke 12:16-20, “And he
          spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man
          brought forth plentifully: and he thought within himself, saying, What
          shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? and he
          said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater;
          and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to
          my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years: take thine
          ease, eat, drink and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool! this
          night thy soul shall be required of thee; then whose shall those
          things be which thou hast provided.” If they have many designs and
          projects in their breasts for promoting their outward prosperity and
          worldly advantage, when death comes, it cuts all off at one blow. Psa.
          146:4, “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that
          very day his thoughts perish.” And so whatever diligence they have had
          in seeking their salvation, death will disappoint all such diligence,
          it will not wait for them to accomplish their designs and fulfill
          their schemes. If they have pleased, and pampered, and adorned their
          bodies, death will spoil all their pleasure and their glory. It will
          change their countenances to a pale and ghastly aspect. Instead of
          their gay apparel and beautiful ornaments, they shall have only a
          winding-sheet. Their house must be the dark and silent grave; and that
          body which they deified, shall turn to loathsome rottenness, shall be
          eaten of worms, and turn to dust. Some wicked men die in youth, wrath
          pursues them, and soon overtakes them. They are not suffered to live
          out half their days. Job 36:14, “They die in youth, and their life is
          among the unclean.” Psa. 55:23, “But thou, O God, shall bring them
          down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not
          live out half their days.” They are sometimes overtaken in the very
          midst of their sin and vanity, and death puts a sudden end to all
          their youthful pleasures. They are often stopped in the midst of a
          career in sin, and then if their hearts cleave ever so fast to those
          things, they must be rent from them. They have no other good but
          outward good, but then they must eternally forsake it. They must close
          their eyes forever on all that has been dear and pleasant to them
          here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, wicked men are oftentimes the subjects of much tribulation and
          anguish of heart on their death-beds. Sometimes the pains of body are
          very extreme and dreadful, and what they endure in those agonies and
          struggles for life, after they are past speaking, and when body and
          soul are rending asunder, none can know. Hezekiah had an awful sense
          of it. He compares it to a lion’s breaking all his bones. Isa. 38:12,
          13, “Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd’s
          tent: I have cut off as a weaver my life; he will cut me off with
          pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. I
          reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones:
          from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.” But this is but
          little to what is sometimes undergone by wicked men in their souls
          when they are on their death-beds. Death appears sometimes with an
          exceedingly terrible aspect to them. When it comes and stares them in
          the face, they cannot bear to behold it. It is always so, if the
          wicked men have notice of the approach of death, and have reason and
          conscience in exercise, and are not either stupid or distracted. When
          this king of terrors comes to show himself to them, and they are
          called forth to meet him, O how do they dread the conflict! But meet
          him they must. “There is no man that hath power over the spirit to
          retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and
          there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver
          those that are given to it.” Death comes to them with all his dreadful
          armor, and his sting not taken away. And it is enough to fill their
          souls with torment that cannot be expressed. It is an awful thing for
          a person to be lying on a sick bed, to be given over by physicians, to
          have friends stand weeping round the bed as expecting to part with
          him, and in such circumstances as those, to have no hope, to be
          without an interest in Christ, and to have the guilt of his sins lying
          on his soul, to be going out of the world without his peace being made
          with God, to stand before his holy judgment-seat in all his sins
          without anything to plead or answer, and to see the only opportunity
          to prepare for eternity coming immediately to an end, after which
          there shall be no more time of probation. But his case will be
          unalterably fixed, and there never will be another offer of a Savior:
          for the soul to come just to the very edge of the boundless gulf of
          eternity, and insensibly to launch forth into it, without any God or
          Savior to take care of it, to be brought to the edge of the precipice,
          and to see himself falling down into the lake of fire and brimstone,
          and to feel that he has no power to stop himself. Who can tell the
          shrinkings and misgivings of heart in such a case? How does he
          endeavor to hang back, but yet he must go on. It is in vain to wish
          for further opportunity! O how happy does he think those that stand
          about him, who may yet live, may have their lives continued longer,
          when he must go immediately into an endless eternity! How does he wish
          it might be with him as with those who have a longer time to prepare
          for their trial! But it must not be so. Death, sent on purpose to
          summon him, will give him no release nor respite. He must go before
          the holy judgment-seat of God as he is, to have his everlasting state
          determined according to his works. To such persons, how differently do
          things appear from what they did in the time of health, and when they
          looked at death as at a distance! How differently does sin look to
          them now, those sins which they used to make light of! How dreadful is
          it now to look back and consider how they have spent their time, how
          foolish they have been, how they have gratified and indulged their
          lusts, and lived in ways of wickedness. How careless they have been,
          and how they have neglected their opportunities and advantages, how
          they have refused to hearken to counsel, and have not repented in
          spite of all the warnings that were given! Pro. 5:11, 12, 13, “And
          thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, and
          say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; and
          have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to
          them that instructed me!”
        </p>
        <p>
          How differently does the world appear to them now! They used to set
          much by it, and have their hearts taken up with it, but what does it
          avail them now? How insignificant are all their riches! Pro. 11:4,
          “Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth
          from death.” What different thoughts have they now of God, and of his
          wrath! They used to make light of the wrath of God, but how terrible
          does it now appear! How does their heart shrink at the thoughts of
          appearing before such a God! How different are their thoughts of time!
          Now time appears precious. O what would they not give for a little
          more time! Some have in such circumstances been brought to cry out, O,
          a thousand worlds for an hour, for a moment! And how differently does
          eternity now appear! Now it is awful indeed. Some have been brought on
          a death-bed to cry out, O that word Eternity! Eternity! Eternity! What
          a dismal gulf does it appear to them, when they come to the very
          brink! They often at such times cry for mercy, and cry in vain. God
          called, and they would not hear. “They set at nought his counsels, and
          would none of his reproofs. Now also he laughs at their calamity, and
          mocks when their fear cometh.” They beseech others to pray for them,
          they send for ministers, but all often fails them. They draw nearer
          and nearer to death, and eternity comes more and more immediately in
          view. And who can express their horror, when they feel themselves
          clasped in the cold arms of death, when their breath fails more and
          more, and their eyes begin to be fixed and grow dim! That which is
          then felt by them, cannot be told nor conceived. Some wicked men have
          much of the horror and despair of hell in their last sickness. Ecc.
          5:17, “All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much
          sorrow and wrath with his sickness.”
        </p>
        <p>II. I shall describe the wrath that attends wicked men hereafter.</p>
        <p>
          First, the soul, when it is separated from the body, shall be cast
          down into hell. There is without doubt a particular judgment by which
          every man is tried at death, beside the general judgment. For the
          soul, as soon as it departs from the body, appears before God to be
          judged. Ecc. 12:7, “Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was;
          and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.” That is, to be
          judged and disposed of by him. Heb. 9:27, “It is appointed unto men
          once to die, but after this the judgment.” But this particular
          judgment is probably no such solemn transaction as that which will be
          at the day of judgment. The soul must appear before God, but not in
          the manner that men shall appear at the end of the world. The souls of
          wicked men shall not go to heaven to appear before God. Neither shall
          Christ descend from heaven for the soul to appear before him. Neither
          is it to be supposed, that the soul shall be carried to any place
          where there is some special symbol of the divine presence, in order to
          be judged. But as God is everywhere present, so the soul shall be made
          immediately sensible of his presence. Souls in a separate state shall
          be sensible of the presence of God and of his operations in another
          manner than we now are. All separate spirits may be said to be before
          God. The saints are in his glorious presence, and the wicked in hell
          are in his dreadful presence. They are said to be tormented in the
          presence of the Lamb. Rev. 14:10, “The same shall drink of the wine of
          the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of
          his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in
          the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.” So
          the soul of a wicked man, at its departure from the body, will be made
          immediately sensible that it is before an infinitely holy and dreadful
          God and his own final Judge. And will then see how terrible a God he
          is, he will see how holy a God he is, how infinitely he hates sin. He
          will be sensible of the greatness of God’s anger against sin, and how
          dreadful is his displeasure. Then will he be sensible of the dreadful
          majesty and power of God, and how fearful a thing it is to fall into
          his hands. Then the soul shall come naked with all its guilt, and in
          all its filthiness, a vile, loathsome, abominable creature, an enemy
          to God, a rebel against him, with the guilt of all its rebellion and
          disregard of God’s commands, and contempt of his authority, and slight
          of the glorious gospel, before God as its Judge. This will fill the
          soul with horror and amazement. It is not to be supposed that this
          judgment will be attended with any voice or any such outward
          transactions as the judgment at the end of the world. But God shall
          manifest himself in his strict justice inwardly, to the immediate view
          of the soul, and to the sense and apprehension of the conscience. This
          particular judgment probably will not hinder, but that the soul shall
          be cast into hell immediately when it goes from the body. As soon as
          ever the soul departs from the body, the soul shall know what its
          state and condition are to be all eternity. As long as there is life,
          there is hope. The man, while he lived, though his case was
          exceedingly dreadful, yet had some hope. When he lay dying, there was
          a possibility of salvation. But when once the union between soul and
          body is broken, then that moment the case becomes desperate, and there
          remains no hope, no possibility. On their death-beds, perhaps, they
          had some hope that God would pity them and hear their cries, or that
          he would hear the prayers of their pious friends for them. They were
          ready to lay hold on something which they had at some time met with,
          some religious affection or some change in their external conduct, and
          to flatter themselves that they were then converted. They were able to
          indulge some degree of hope from the moral lives that they had lived,
          that God would have respect to them and save them, but as soon as ever
          the soul parts from the body, from that moment the case will be
          absolutely determined, there will then be an end forever to all hope,
          to everything that men hang upon in this life. The soul then shall
          know certainly that it is to be miserable to all eternity, without any
          remedy. It shall see that God is its enemy. It shall see its Judge
          clothed in his wrath and vengeance. Then its misery will begin, it
          will that moment be swallowed up in despair. The great gulf will be
          fixed between it and happiness, the door of mercy will be forever shut
          up, the irrevocable sentence will be passed. Then shall the wicked
          know what is before them. Before, the soul was in distress for fear
          how it would be. But now, all its fears shall come upon it. It shall
          come upon it as a mighty flood, and there will be no escaping. The
          soul was full of amazement before through fear. But now, who can
          conceive the amazement that fills it that moment when all hope is cut
          off, and it knows that there never will be any difference!
        </p>
        <p>
          When a good man dies, his soul is conducted by holy angels to heaven.
          Luke 16:22, “And it came to pass that the beggar died, and was carried
          by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died and was
          buried.” So we may well suppose that when a wicked man dies, his soul
          is seized by wicked angels, that they are round his bed ready to seize
          the miserable soul as soon as it is parted from the body. And with
          what fierceness and fury do those cruel spirits fly upon their prey,
          and the soul shall be left in their hands. There shall be no good
          angels to guard and defend it. God will take no merciful care of it.
          There is nothing to help it against those cruel spirits that shall lay
          hold of it to carry it to hell, there to torment it forever. God will
          leave it wholly in their hands, and will give it up to their
          possession, when it comes to die. It shall be carried down into hell,
          to the abode of devils and damned spirits. If the fear of hell on a
          death-bed sometimes fills the wicked with amazement, how will they be
          overwhelmed when they feel its torments, when they shall find them not
          only as great but far greater than their fears! They shall find them
          far beyond what they could conceive of before they felt them, for none
          know the power of God’s anger, but they that experience it. Psa.
          90:11, “Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
          fear, so is thy wrath.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Departed spirits of wicked men are doubtless carried to some
          particular place in the universe, which God has prepared to be the
          receptacle of his wicked, rebellious, and miserable subjects, a place
          where God’s avenging justice shall be glorified, a place built to be
          the prison, and where devils and wicked men are reserved till the day
          of judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, here the souls of wicked men shall suffer extreme and amazing
          misery in a separate state, until the resurrection. This misery is not
          indeed their full punishment, nor is the happiness of the saints
          before the day of judgment their full happiness. It is with the souls
          of wicked men as it is with devils. Though the devils suffer extreme
          torment now, yet they do not suffer their complete punishment, and
          therefore it is said, that they are cast down to hell, and bound in
          chains. 2 Pet. 2:4, “God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast
          them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be
          reserved unto judgment.” Jude 6, “And the angels which kept not their
          first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in
          everlasting chains under darkness, unto the judgment of the great
          day.” They are reserved in the state they are in, and for what are
          they reserved, but for a greater degree of punishment? And therefore
          they are said to tremble for fear. Jam. 2:19, “Thou believest that
          there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe and
          tremble.” Hence when Christ was on earth, the devils were greatly
          afraid that Christ was come to torment them. Mat. 8:29, “And, behold,
          they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son
          of God? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?” Mark 5:7,
          “And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee,
          Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou
          torment me not.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But yet they are there in extreme and inconceivable misery, they are
          there deprived of all good, they have no rest nor comfort, and they
          are subject to the wrath of God. God there executes wrath on them
          without mercy, and they are swallowed up in wrath. Luke 16:24, “And he
          cried, and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me; and send Lazarus,
          that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for
          I am tormented in this flame.” Here we are being told that, when the
          rich man died, he lift up his eyes being in torment, and he tells
          Abraham that he is tormented in a flame. It seems that the flame was
          not only about him, but in him. He therefore asks for a drop of water
          to cool his tongue. This doubtless is to represent to us that they are
          full of the wrath of God as it were with fire, and they shall there be
          tormented in the midst of devils and damned spirits. And they shall
          have inexpressible torment from their own consciences. God’s wrath is
          the fire that never shall be quenched, and conscience is the worm that
          never dies. How much do men suffer from horror of conscience sometimes
          in this world, but how much more in hell! What bitter and tormenting
          reflections will they have concerning the folly they have been guilty
          of in their lives, in so neglecting their souls, when they had such an
          opportunity for repentance; that they went on so foolishly to treasure
          up wrath against the day of wrath, to add to the record of their sins
          from day to day, to make their misery yet greater and greater. How
          they have kindled the fires of hell for themselves, and spent their
          lives in gathering the fuel! They will not be able to help revolving
          such thoughts in their minds. And how tormenting will they be! And
          those who go to hell, never can escape thence. There they remain
          imprisoned till the day of judgment, and their torments remain
          continually. Those wicked men who died many years ago, their souls
          went to hell, and there they are still. Those who went to hell in
          former ages of the world, have been in hell ever since, all the while
          suffering torment. They have nothing else to spend their time in
          there, but to suffer torment, they are kept in being for no other
          purpose. And though they have many companions in hell, yet they are no
          comfort to them, for there is no friend, no love, no pity, no
          quietness, no prospect, no hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, the separate souls of the wicked, besides the present misery
          that they suffer, shall be in amazing fear of their more full
          punishment at the day of judgment. Though their punishment in their
          separate state be exceedingly dreadful, and far more than they can
          bear, though it be so great as to sink and crush them, yet this is not
          all. They are reserved for a much greater and more dreadful punishment
          at the day of judgment. Their torment will then be vastly augmented,
          and continue in that augmentation to all eternity. Their punishment
          will be so much greater then, that their misery in this separate state
          is but as an imprisonment before an execution. They, as well as the
          devils, are bound in chains of darkness to the judgment of the great
          day. Separate spirits are called “spirits in prison.” 1 Pet. 3:19, “By
          which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison.” And if
          the imprisonment be so dreadful, how dreadful indeed will be the
          execution! When we are under any great pain of body at any time, how
          do we dread the least addition to it! Its continuance is greatly
          dreaded, much more its increase. How much more will those separate
          spirits that suffer the torments of hell, dread that augmentation and
          completing of their torment which there will be at the day of
          judgment, when what they feel already is vastly more than they can
          support themselves, when they shall be as it were begging for one drop
          of water to cool their tongues, and when they would give ten thousand
          worlds for the least abatement of their misery! How sinking will it be
          to think that instead of that the day is coming when God shall come
          forth out of heaven to sentence them to a far more dreadful degree of
          misery, and to continue them under it forever! What experience they
          have of the dreadfulness of God’s wrath convinces them fully how
          terrible a thing his wrath is. They will therefore be exceedingly
          afraid of that full wrath which he will execute at the day of
          judgment. They will have no hope of escaping it, they will know
          assuredly that it will come.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fear of this makes the devils, those mighty, proud, and stubborn
          spirits, to tremble. They believe what is threatened, and therefore
          tremble. If this fear overcomes them, how much more will it overwhelm
          the souls of wicked men! All hell trembles at the thoughts of the day
          of judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, when the day of judgment comes they shall rise to the
          resurrection of damnation. When that day comes, all mankind that have
          died from off the face of the earth shall arise; not only the
          righteous, but also the wicked. Dan. 12:2, “And many of them that
          sleep in the dust of the earth, shall awake; some to everlasting life,
          and some to shame and everlasting contempt.” Rev. 20:13, “And the sea
          gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell delivered up the
          dead which were in them: and they were judged, every man according to
          his works.” The damned in hell know not the time when the day of
          judgment will be, but when the time comes it will be made known, and
          it will be the most dreadful news that ever was told in that world of
          misery. It is always a doleful time in hell. The world of darkness is
          always full of shrieks and doleful cries. But when the news is heard,
          that the day appointed for the judgment is come, hell will be filled
          with louder shrieks and more dreadful cries than ever before. When
          Christ comes in the clouds of heaven to judgment, the news of it will
          fill both earth and hell with mourning and bitter crying. We read that
          all the kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him, and so shall
          all the inhabitants of hell, and then must the souls of the wicked
          come up to be united to their bodies, and stand before the Judge. They
          shall not come willingly, but shall be dragged forth as a malefactor
          is dragged out of his dungeon to execution. They were unwilling when
          they died to leave the earth to go to hell, but now they will be much
          more unwilling to come out of hell to go to the last judgment. It will
          be no deliverance to them, it will only be a coming forth to their
          execution. They will hang back, but must come. The devils and damned
          spirits must come up together. The last trumpet will then be heard,
          this will be the most terrible sound to wicked men and devils that
          ever was heard. And not only the wicked, that shall then be found
          dwelling on the earth, shall hear it, but also those that are in their
          graves. John 5:28, 29, “Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in
          the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall
          come forth; they that have done good unto the resurrection of life,
          and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation.” And
          then must the souls of the wicked enter their bodies again, which will
          be prepared only to be organs of torment and misery. It will be a
          dreadful sight to them when they come to their bodies again, those
          bodies which were formerly used by them as the organs and instruments
          of sin and wickedness, and whose appetites and lusts they indulged and
          gratified. The parting of soul and body was dreadful to them when they
          died, but their meeting again at the resurrection will be more
          dreadful. They shall receive their bodies loathsome and hideous,
          agreeably to that shame and everlasting contempt to which they shall
          arise. As the bodies of the saints shall arise more glorious than when
          on earth, and shall be like unto Christ’s glorious body, so we may
          well suppose that the bodies of the wicked will arise proportionably
          more deformed and hideous. Oftentimes in this world a polluted soul is
          hid in a fine and comely body, but it will not be so then when things
          shall appear as they are. The form and aspect of the body shall appear
          as they are, and the form and aspect of the body shall be answerable
          to the hellish deformity of the soul. Thus shall they rise out of
          their graves, and shall lift up their eyes, and see the Son of God in
          the clouds of heaven, in the glory of his Father, with all his holy
          angels with him. Then shall they see their Judge in his awful majesty,
          which will be the most amazing sight to them that ever they saw, and
          will still add new horrors. That awful and terrible majesty in which
          he will appear, and the manifestation of his infinite holiness, will
          pierce their souls. They shall come forth out of their graves all
          trembling and astonished: fearfulness shall surprise them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, then must they appear before their Judge to give up their
          account. They will find no mountains or rocks to fall upon them, that
          can cover them, and hide them from the wrath of the Lamb. Many of them
          will see others at that time, who were formerly their acquaintance,
          who shall appear with glorious bodies, and with joyful countenances
          and songs of praise, and mounting up as with wings to meet the Lord in
          the air, while they are left behind. Many shall see their former
          neighbors and acquaintance, their companions, their brothers, and
          their wives taken and they left. They shall be summoned to go and
          appear before the judgment-seat, and go they must, however unwilling.
          They must stand at Christ’s left hand, in the midst of devils and
          wicked men. This shall again add still further amazement, and will
          cause their horror still to be in a further degree than ever. With
          what horror will that company come together! And then shall they be
          called to their account; then shall be brought to light the hidden
          things of darkness; then shall all the wickedness of their hearts be
          made know; then shall be declared the actual wickedness they have been
          guilty of; then shall appear their secret sins that they have kept hid
          from the eye of the world; then shall be manifested in their true
          light those sins that they used to plead for, and to excuse and
          justify. And then shall all their sins be set forth in all their
          dreadful aggravations, all their filthiness will be brought to light
          to their everlasting shame and contempt. Then it shall appear how
          heinous many of those things were that they in their lifetime made
          light of; then will it appear how dreadful their guilt is in thus
          ill-treating so glorious and blessed a Savior. And all the world shall
          see it, and many shall rise up in judgment against them and condemn
          them. Their companions whom they tempted to wickedness, others whom
          they have hardened in sin by their example, shall rise up against many
          of them; and the heathen that have had no advantages in comparison of
          them, and many of whom have yet lived better lives than they, shall
          rise up against them, and they shall be called to a special account.
          The Judge will reckon with them. They shall be speechless, they shall
          be struck dumb, their own consciences bearing testimony against them,
          and shall cry aloud against them, for they shall then see how great
          and terrible a God he is, against whom they have sinned. Then shall
          they stand at the left hand, while they see others whom they knew on
          earth sitting at the right hand of Christ in glory, shining forth as
          the sun, accepted of Christ, and sitting with him to judge and condemn
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth, then the sentence of condemnation shall be pronounced by the
          Judge upon them. Mat. 25:41, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into
          everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.” This
          sentence will be pronounced with awful majesty, and there shall be
          great indignation, and dreadful wrath shall then appear in the Judge,
          and in his voice, with which he shall pronounce the sentence. What a
          horror and amazement will these words strike into the hearts of the
          wicked, on whom they shall be pronounced! Every word and syllable
          shall be like the most amazing thunder to them, and shall pierce their
          souls like the fiercest lightning. The Judge will bid them depart from
          him. He will drive them from his presence, as exceedingly abominable
          to him, and he shall give them the epithet accursed. They shall be an
          accursed company, and he will not only bid them depart from his
          presence, but into everlasting fire, to dwell there as their only fit
          habitation. And what shows the dreadfulness of the fire, is, that it
          is prepared for the devil and his angels. They shall lie forever in
          the same fire in which the devils, those grand enemies of God, shall
          be tormented. When this sentence shall be pronounced, there shall be
          in the vast company at the left hand, tremblings and mourning, and
          crying, and gnashing of teeth, in a new manner, beyond all that ever
          was before. If the devils, those proud and lofty spirits, tremble many
          ages beforehand at the bare thoughts of this sentence, how ill they
          tremble when it comes to be pronounced! And how, alas, will wicked men
          tremble! Their anguish will be aggravated by hearing that blessed
          sentence pronounced on those who shall be at the right hand, “Come, ye
          blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
          foundation of the world.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventh, then the sentence shall be executed. When the Judge bids them
          depart, they must go; however loth, yet they must go. Immediately upon
          the finishing of the judgment and the pronouncing of the sentence,
          will come the end of the world. The frame of this world shall be
          dissolved. The pronouncing of that sentence will probably be followed
          with amazing thunders, that shall rend the heavens, and shake the
          earth out of its place. 2 Pet. 3:10, “But the day of the Lord will
          come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away
          with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the
          earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burnt up.” Then
          shall the sea and the waves roar, and the rocks shall be thrown down,
          and the mountains shall rend asunder, and there shall be one universal
          wreck of this great world. Then shall the heavens be dissolved, and
          then the earth shall be set on fire. As God in wrath once destroyed
          the world by a flood of water, so now shall he cause it to be all
          drowned in a deluge of fire; and the heavens being on fire, shall be
          dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, 2 Pet. 3:10,
          and that great company of devils and wicked men must then enter into
          those everlasting burnings to which they are sentenced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eighth, in this condition they shall remain throughout the
          never-ending ages of eternity. Their punishment shall be then
          complete, and it shall remain in this completion forever. Now shall
          all that come upon them which they so long trembled for fear of, while
          their souls were in a separate state. They will dwell in a fire that
          never shall be quenched, and here they must wear out eternity. Here
          they must wear out one thousand years after another, and that without
          end. There is no reckoning up the millions of years or millions of
          ages. All arithmetic here fails, no rules of multiplication can reach
          the amount, for there is no end. They shall have nothing to do to pass
          away their eternity, but to conflict with those torments. This will be
          their work forever and ever. God shall have no other use or employment
          for them. This is the way that they must answer the end of their
          being. And they never shall have any rest, nor any atonement, but
          their torments will hold up to their height, and shall never grow any
          easier by their being accustomed to them. Time will seem long to them,
          every moment shall seem long to them, but they shall never have done
          with the ages of their torment.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          I. HENCE what need have we to take care that our foundation for
          eternity be sure! They who build on a false foundation, are not secure
          from this misery. They who build up a refuge of lies, will find that
          their refuge must fail them. Their wall that they have daubed with
          untempered mortar will fall. The more dreadful the misery is, the more
          need have we to see that we are safe from it. It will be dreadful
          indeed to be disappointed in such a case. To please ourselves with
          dreams and vain imaginations of our being the children of God, and of
          going to heaven, and at last to awake in hell, to see our refuge swept
          away, and our hope eternally gone, and to find ourselves swallowed up
          in flames, and to see and endless duration of it before us. How
          dreadful will this be!
        </p>
        <p>
          There will be many that will be thus disappointed. Many shall come to
          the door and shall find it shut, who expected to find it open, and
          shall knock, but Christ will tell them that he knows them not, and he
          will bid them depart, and it will be in vain for them to tell Christ
          what affections they have had, and how religious they were, and how
          well they were accounted of on earth. They shall have no other answer
          but, “Depart from me, I know you not, ye that work iniquity.” Let us
          all consider this, and give all diligence, to see that we build sure
          if by any means we may at last be found in Christ. Let us see to it
          that we are indeed well secured from this dreadful misery. What will
          it avail us to please ourselves with a notion of being converted, and
          being beloved of God. And what will it avail us to have the good
          opinion of our neighbors for a few days, if we must at last be cast
          into hell, and appear at the day of judgment at the left hand, and
          have our eternal portion with unbelievers? A false hope cannot profit
          us, it is a thousand times worse than none. And who are more miserable
          than those who think that God has pardoned their sins, and who expect
          to have a portion with the righteous hereafter, but are all the while
          going headlong down into this dreadful misery? What case can be more
          awful than the case of those who are thus led blindfold to the
          slaughter, promising themselves a happiness that is never like to
          come, but on the contrary are sinking into endless tribulation and
          anguish!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let everyone therefore, who entertains hope of his own state, see to
          it, that he be well built; and let him not rest in past attainment,
          but reach forth towards those things that are before with all his
          might.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Hence we derive an argument for the awakening of ungodly men. This
          indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, is the portion
          allotted to you if you continue in your present condition. Thou art
          the man spoken of; it is to thee that all this misery is assigned by
          the threatening of God’s holy word. It is on thee that this wrath of
          God abides. Thou art now in a state of condemnation to this misery.
          John 3:18, “He that believeth not is condemned already; because he
          hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.” It is
          not already executed upon you, but you are already condemned to it;
          you are not merely exposed to condemnation, but you are under the
          actual sentence of condemnation. This is the portion that is already
          allotted to you by the law and not under grace. This misery is the
          misery into which you are everyday in danger of dropping, you are not
          safe from it one hour. How soon it may come upon you, you know not;
          you hang over it by a thread, that is continually growing more and
          more feeble. This dreadful misery in all its successive parts belongs
          to you, and is your due. Your friends and your neighbors, and all
          around you, if they knew what your condition was, might well lift up a
          loud and bitter cry over you, whenever they behold you, and say, Here
          is an unhappy being condemned to be given up eternally into the hands
          of devils to be tormented by them. Here is a miserable man who is in
          danger every day of being swallowed up in the bottomless gulf of woe
          and misery. Here is a wretched undone creature condemned to lie down
          forever in unquenchable fire, and to dwell in everlasting burnings;
          and he has no interest in a Savior, he has nothing to defend him, he
          has nothing wherewith to appease the wrath of an offended God. Here
          consider two things.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, you have no reason to question whether those future miseries
          and torments which are threatened in God’s Word are realities. Do not
          flatter yourself with thinking that it may not be so. Say not, How do
          I know that there is any such misery to be inflicted in another world;
          how do I know but all is a fable, and that when I come to die there
          will be an end of me, and that it will be with me as it is with the
          beasts. Do not say, How do I know but that all those things are only
          bugbears of man’s inventing. How do I know that the Scriptures, that
          threaten those things, are the Word of God; or if he has threatened
          those things, it may be it is only to frighten men to keep them to
          their duty, it may be he never intends to do as he threatens.
        </p>
        <p>
          I say that there is no ground for any such suspicion, neither is there
          any reason for it; for that there should be no future punishment is
          not only contrary to Scripture, but reason. It is a most unreasonable
          thing to suppose that there should be no future punishment, to suppose
          that God, who had made man a rational creature, able to know his duty,
          and sensible that he is deserving punishment when he does it not;
          should let man alone, and let him live as he will, and never punish
          him for his sins, and never make any difference between the good and
          the bad; that he should make the world of mankind and then let it
          alone, and let men live all their days in wickedness, in adultery,
          murder, robbery, and persecution, and the like, and suffer them to
          live in prosperity, and never punish them; that he should suffer them
          to prosper in the world far beyond many good men, and never punish
          them hereafter. How unreasonable is it to suppose, that he who made
          the world, should leave things in such confusion, and never take any
          care of the government of his creatures, and that he should never
          judge his reasonable creatures! Reason teaches that there is a God,
          and reason teaches that if there be, he must be a wise and just God,
          and that he must take care to order things wisely and justly among his
          creatures. And therefore it is unreasonable to suppose that man dies
          like a beast, and that there is no future punishment. And if there be
          a future punishment, it is unreasonable to suppose that God has not
          somewhere or other given men warning of it, and revealed to them what
          kind of punishment they must expect. Will a wise lawgiver keep his
          subjects in ignorance as to what punishment they must expect for
          breaking his laws? And if God has revealed it, where is it to be found
          but in the Scripture; what revelation have we of a future state if it
          is not there revealed? Where does God tell mankind what kind of
          rewards and punishments they must expect, if not here? And it is
          abundantly manifest by innumerable evidences, that these threatenings
          are the threatenings of God, that this awful book is his revelation.
          And since God has threatened, there is no room to question whether he
          will fulfill; for he hath said it, yea, he hath sworn it, that he will
          repay the wicked to his face according to threatenings, and that he
          will glorify himself in their destruction, and that this heaven and
          earth shall pass away. How foolish then is the thought that God may
          only threaten such punishment to frighten men, and that he never
          intends to execute it! For as surely as God is God, he will do as he
          has said. He will destroy the mountains of iniquity as he has
          threatened, and there shall be no escaping. How vain are the thoughts
          of those who flatter themselves that God will not fulfill his
          threatenings, and that he only frightens and deceives men in them; as
          though God could in no other way govern the world than by making use
          of fallacious tricks and deceits to delude his subjects! Those that
          entertain such thoughts, however they may harden themselves by them
          for the present, will cherish them but a little while. Their
          experience will soon convince them that God is a God of truth, and
          that his threatenings are no delusions. They will be convinced that he
          is a God who will by no means clear the guilty, and that his
          threatenings are substantial, and not mere shadows, when it will be
          too late to escape them. Deu. 29:18-21, “Lest there should be among
          you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this
          day from the Lord our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations;
          lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;
          and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he
          bless himself in his heart, saying , I shall have peace, though I walk
          in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: the
          Lord will not spare him; but then the anger of the Lord and his
          jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are
          written in this book shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out
          his name from under heaven. And the Lord shall separate him unto evil
          out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the
          covenant that are written in this book of the law.” Psa. 50:21, “These
          things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was
          altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set
          them in order before thine eyes.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, there is no reason to suspect that possibly ministers set
          forth this matter beyond what it really is, that possibly it is not so
          dreadful and terrible as is pretended, and that ministers strain the
          description of it beyond just bounds. Some may be ready to think so,
          because it seems to them incredible that there should be so dreadful a
          misery to any creature. But there is no reason for any such thoughts
          as these, if we consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How great a punishment the sins of wicked men deserve. The
          Scripture teaches us that anyone sin deserves eternal death. Rom.
          6:23, “For the wages of sin is death: but the gift of God is eternal
          life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” And that it deserves the eternal
          curse of God. Deu. 27:26, “Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the
          words of this law to do them: and all the people shall say, Amen.” Gal
          3:10, “For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse:
          for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
          things which are written in the book of the law to do them.” Which
          things imply that the least sin deserves total and eternal
          destruction. Eternal death, in the least degree of it, amounts to such
          a degree of misery as is the perfect destruction of the creature, the
          loss of all good, and perfect misery; and so does being accursed of
          God imply it. To be cursed of God, is to be devoted to perfect and
          ultimate destruction. The Scripture teaches that wicked men shall be
          punished to their full desert, that they shall pay all the debt.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There is no reason to think that ministers describe the misery of
          the wicked beyond what it is, because the Scripture teaches us that
          this is one end of ungodly men, to show the dreadfulness and power of
          God’s wrath. Rom. 9:22, “What if God, willing to show his wrath, and
          to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels
          of wrath fitted to destruction.” It is often spoken of as part of the
          glory of God, that he is a terrible and dreadful God. Psa. 68:35, “O
          God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places:” that he is a consuming
          fire. Psa. 66:3, “How terrible art thou in thy works! through the
          greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto
          thee:” and that herein one part of the glory of God is represented as
          consisting, that it is so dreadful a thing to injure and offend God.
          The wrath of a king is as the roaring of a lion, the wrath of a man is
          sometimes dreadful, but the future punishment of ungodly men is to
          show what the wrath of God is. It is to show to the whole universe the
          glory of God’s power. 2 Thes. 1:9, “Who shall be punished with
          everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the
          glory of his power.” And therefore the punishment which we have
          described is not at all incredible, and there is no reason to think
          that it has been in the least described beyond what it really is.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The Scripture teaches that the wrath of God on wicked men is
          dreadful beyond all that we can conceive. Psa. 90:11, “Who knoweth the
          power of thine anger? Even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.” As
          it is but little that we know of God, as we know and can conceive of
          but little of his power and his greatness, so it is but a little that
          we know or can conceive of the dreadfulness of his wrath. And
          therefore there is no reason to suppose that we set it forth beyond
          what it is. We have rather reason to suppose that after we have said
          our utmost and thought our utmost, all that we have said or thought is
          but a faint shadow of the reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are taught that the reward of the saints is beyond all that can be
          spoken or conceived of. Eph. 3:20, “Now unto him that is able to do
          exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think.” 1 Cor. 2:9,
          “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart
          of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.”
          And so we may rationally suppose that the punishment of the wicked
          will also be inconceivably dreadful.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. There is no reason to think that we set forth the misery of hell
          beyond the reality, because the Scripture teaches us that the wrath of
          God is according to his fear. Psa. 90:11. This passage asserts that
          the wrath of God is according to his awful attributes; his greatness
          and his might, his holiness and power. The majesty of God is
          exceedingly great and awful, but according to his awfulness, so is his
          wrath. This is the meaning of the words; and therefore we must
          conclude that the wrath of God is indeed beyond all expressions and
          signification terrible. How great and awful indeed is his majesty, who
          has made heaven and earth, and in what majesty will he come to judge
          the world at the last day! He will come to take vengeance on ungodly
          men. The sight of this majesty will strike wicked men with
          apprehensions and fears of destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The description which I have given of the tribulation and wrath of
          ungodly men, is not beyond the truth, for it is the very description
          which the Scriptures give of it. The Scriptures represent that the
          wicked shall be cast into a furnace of fire; not only a fire, but a
          furnace. Mat. 13:42, “And shall cast them into a furnace of fire;
          there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” Rev. 20:15, “And
          whosoever was not found written in the book of life, was cast into the
          lake of fire.” Psa. 21:8, 9, “Thine hand shall find out all thine
          enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. Thou
          shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger; the Lord
          shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.”
        </p>
        <p>
          If, therefore, I have described this misery beyond the truth, then the
          Scriptures have done the same. It is evident then, that there is no
          reason to flatter yourselves with such imaginations. If God be true,
          you shall find the wrath of God, and your future misery, full as
          great; and not only so, but much greater. You will find that we know
          but little, and have said but little about it, and that all our
          expressions are faint in comparison of the reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Hence may be derived an argument to convince wicked men of the
          justice of God in allotting such a portion to them. Wicked men, when
          they hear it declared how awful the misery is of which they are in
          danger, often have their hearts lifted up against God for it. It seems
          to them very hard for God to deal so with any of his creatures. They
          cannot see why God should be so very severe with wicked men, for their
          sin and folly for a little while in this world. And when they consider
          that he has threatened such punishments, they are ready to entertain
          blasphemous thoughts against him. I would therefore endeavor to show
          you how justly you lie exposed to that indignation and wrath,
          tribulation and anguish, of which you have heard. Particularly I would
          show,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, how just it would be in God forever to leave you to yourself.
          It would be most just in God to refuse to be with you, or help you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have embraced and refused to let go those things which God hates;
          you have refused to forsake your lusts, and to abandon those ways of
          sin that are abominable to him. When God has commanded you to forsake
          them, how have you refused, and still have retained them, and been
          obstinate in it! Neither is your heart yet to this very day diverted
          from sin. But it is dear to you, you allow it the best place in your
          heart, you place it on the throne there. Would it be any wonder
          therefore if God should utterly leave you, seeing you will not leave
          sin? God has often declared his hatred of iniquity; and is it any
          wonder, that he is not willing to dwell with that which is so odious
          to him? Is it not reasonable that God should insist that you should
          part with your lusts in order to your enjoying his presence; and
          seeing you have so long refused, how just would it be if God should
          utterly forsake you? You have retained and harbored God’s mortal
          enemies, sin and Satan. How justly therefore might God stand at a
          distance! Is God obliged to be present with any who harbor his
          enemies, and refuse to forsake them? Would God be unjust, if he should
          leave you utterly to yourself, so long as you will not forsake your
          idols?
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider how just it would be in God to let you alone, since you have
          let God alone. You have not sought God for his presence and help as
          you ought to have done; you have neglected him; and would it not
          therefore be just if he should neglect you? How long have many of you
          lived in neglecting to seek him? How long have you restrained prayer
          before him? Since therefore you refused so much as to seek the
          presence and help of God, and did not think them worth praying to him
          for, how justly might he forever withhold them, and so leave you
          wholly to yourself?
        </p>
        <p>
          You have done what in you lies to drive God away from you, and to
          cause him wholly to leave you. When God in times past has not let you
          alone, but has been unwearied in awakening you, have you not resisted
          the motions and influences of his Spirit; have you not refused to be
          conducted by him, or to yield to him? Zec. 7:11, “But they refused to
          hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that
          they should not hear.” How justly therefore might God refuse to move
          or strive any more! When God has been knocking at your door, you have
          refused to open to him. How just is it therefore that he should go
          away, and knock at your door no more! When the Spirit of God has been
          striving with you, have you not been guilty of grieving the Holy
          Spirit by giving way to a quarreling temper, and by yielding yourself
          a prey to lust? And have not some of you quenched the Spirit, and been
          guilty of backsliding? And is God obliged, notwithstanding all this,
          to continue the striving of his Spirit with you, to be resisted and
          grieved still, as long as you please? On the contrary, would it not be
          just if his Spirit should everlastingly leave you, and let you alone?
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, how just it would be if you should be cursed in all your
          concerns in this world. It would be just if God should curse you in
          everything, and cause everything you enjoy, or are concerned in, to
          turn to your destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          You live here in all the concerns of life as an enemy to God; you have
          used all your enjoyments and possessions against God, and to his
          dishonor. Would it not therefore be just if God should curse you in
          them, and turn them all against you, and to your destruction? What
          temporal blessing has God given you, which you have not used in the
          service of your lusts, in the service of sin and Satan? If you have
          been in prosperity, you have made use of it to God’s dishonor. When
          you have waxed fat, you have forgotten the God that made you. How just
          therefore would it be if God’s curse should attend all your
          enjoyments! Whatsoever employments you have followed, you have not
          served God in them, but God’s enemies. How just therefore would it be
          if you should be cursed in all your employments! The means of grace
          that you have enjoyed, you have not made use of as you ought to have
          done. You have made light of them, and have treated them in a careless
          disregardful manner; you have been the worse and not the better for
          them. You have so attended and used sabbaths, and spiritual
          opportunities, that you have only made them occasions of manifesting
          your contempt of God and Christ, and divine things, by your careless
          and profane manner of attending them. Would it not therefore be most
          just that God’s curse should attend your means of grace, and the
          opportunities which you enjoy for the salvation of your soul?
        </p>
        <p>
          You have improved your time only to heap up provocations and add to
          your transgressions, in opposition to all the calls and warnings that
          could be given you. How just therefore would it be if God should turn
          life itself into a curse to you, and suffer you to live only to fill
          up the measure of your sins!
        </p>
        <p>
          You have, contrary to God’s counsel, made use of your own enjoyments
          to the hurt of your soul, and therefore if God should turn to them to
          the hurt and ruin of your soul, he would but deal with you as you have
          dealt with yourself. God has earnestly counseled you times without
          number to use your temporal enjoyments for your spiritual good, but
          you have refused to hearken to him, you have foolishly perverted them
          to treasure up wrath against the day of wrath, you have voluntarily
          used what God has given you for your spiritual hurt, to increase your
          guilt and wound your own soul. And therefore if Gods curse should
          attend them, so that they should all turn to the ruin of your soul,
          you would but be dealt with as you have dealt with yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, how just would it be in God to cut you off, and put an end to
          your life!
        </p>
        <p>
          You have greatly abused the patience and long-suffering of God which
          have already been exercised towards you. God with wonderful
          long-suffering has borne with you, when you have gone on in rebellion
          against him, and refused to turn from your evil ways. He has beheld
          you going on obstinately in the ways of provocation against him, and
          yet he has not let loose his wrath against you to destroy you, but has
          still waited to be gracious. He has suffered you yet to live on his
          earth, and breathe his air. He has upheld and preserved you, and
          continued still to feed you, and clothe you, and maintain you, and
          still to give you a space to repent; but instead of being the better
          for his patience, you have been the worse, instead of being melted by
          it, you have been hardened, and it has made you the more presumptuous
          in sin. Ecc. 8:11, “Because sentence against an evil work is not
          executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set
          in them to do evil.” You have been guilty of despising the riches of
          his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, instead of being
          led to repent by it. You cannot live one day but as God maintains and
          provides for you; you cannot draw a breath, or live a moment, unless
          God upholds you. For in his hand your breath is, and he holds your
          soul in life, and his visitation preserves your spirit. But what
          thanks has God had of it. How have you, instead of being turned to
          God, been only rendered the more fully set and dreadfully hardened in
          the ways of sin! How just therefore would it be if God’s patience
          should soon be at an end, and he should cease to bear with you any
          longer!
        </p>
        <p>
          You have not only abused his past patience, but have also abused his
          thoughts of future patience. You have flattered yourself that death
          was not near, and that you should live long in the world, and this has
          made you abundantly the more bold in sin. Since therefore such has
          been the use you have made of your expectation of having your life
          preserved, how just would it be in God to disappoint that expectation,
          and cut you short of that long life with which you have flattered
          yourself, and in the thoughts of which you have encouraged yourself in
          sin against him! How just would it be if your breath should soon be
          stopped, and that suddenly, when you think not of it, and you should
          be driven away in your wickedness!
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as you live in sin you do but cumber the ground, you are
          wholly unprofitable, and live in vain. He that refuses to live to the
          glory of God, does not answer the end of his creation, and for what
          should he live? God made men to serve him; to this end he gave them
          life. And if they will not devote their lives to this end, how just
          would it be in God if he should refuse to continue their lives any
          longer! He has planted you in his vineyard, to bear fruit; and if you
          bring forth no fruit, why should he continue you any longer? How just
          would it be in him to cut you down!
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as you live, many of the blessings of God are spent upon you
          from day to day; you devour the fruits of the earth and consume much
          of its fatness and sweetness; and all to no purpose, but to keep you
          alive to sin against God, and spend all in wickedness. The whole
          creation does as it were groan with you. The sun rises and sets to
          give you light, the clouds pour down rain upon you, and the earth
          brings forth her fruits, and labors from year to year to supply you.
          And you in the mean time do not answer the end of Him who has created
          all things. How just therefore would it be if God should soon cut you
          off, and take you away, and deliver the earth from this burden, that
          the creation may no longer groan with you, and cast you out as an
          abominable branch! Luke 13:7, “Then said he unto the dresser of his
          vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this
          fig-tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?”
          John 15:2, 6, “Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh
          away; and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it, that it may
          bring forth more fruit. — If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth
          as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into
          the fire, and they are burned.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, how just would it be if you should die in the greatest horror
          and amazement!
        </p>
        <p>
          How often have you been exhorted to improve your time, to lay a
          foundation of peace and comfort on a death-bed; and yet you have
          refused to hearken! You have been many and many a time reminded that
          you must die, that it was very uncertain when, and that you did not
          know how soon, and have been told how mean and insignificant all your
          earthly enjoyments would then appear, and how unable to afford you any
          comfort on a deathbed.. You have been often told how dreadful it would
          be to lie on a death-bed in a Christless state, having nothing to
          comfort you but your worldly enjoyments. You have been often put in
          mind of the torment and amazement which sinners, who have misspent
          their precious time, are subject to when arrested by death. You have
          been told how infinitely you would then need to have God your friend,
          and to have the testimony of a good conscience, and a well-grounded
          hope of future blessedness. And how often have you been exhorted to
          take care to provide against such a day as this, and to lay up
          treasure in heaven, that you might have something to depend on when
          you parted from this world, something to hope for when all things here
          below fail! But remember how regardless you have been, how dull and
          negligent from time to time, when you have sat under the hearing of
          such things, and still you obstinately refuse to prepare for death,
          and take no care to lay a good foundation against that time. And you
          have not only been counseled, but you have seen others on their
          deathbeds in fear and distress, or have heard of them, and have not
          taken warning. Yea, some of you have been sick yourselves, and have
          been afraid that you were on your death-beds, yet God was merciful to
          you, and restored you, but you did not take warning to prepare for
          death. How justly therefore might you be the subject of that horror
          and amazement, of which you have heard, when you come to die!
        </p>
        <p>
          And not only so, but how industriously have you spent your time in
          treasuring up matter for tribulation and anguish at that time! You
          have not only been negligent of laying a foundation for peace and
          comfort then, but have spent your time continually and unweariedly in
          laying a foundation for distress and horror. How have you gone on from
          day to day, heaping up more and more guilt; more and more wounding
          your own conscience, still increasing the amount of folly and
          wickedness for you to reflect upon! How just therefore would it be
          that tribulation and anguish should then come upon you!
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, how just it is that you should suffer the wrath of God in
          another world!
        </p>
        <p>
          Because you have willfully provoked and stirred up that wrath. If you
          are not willing to suffer the anger of God, then why did you provoke
          him to anger? Why did you act as though you would contrive to make him
          angry with you? Why did you willfully disobey God? You know that
          willful disobedience tends to provoke him who is disobeyed; it is so
          in an earthly king, or master, or father. If you have a servant who is
          willfully disobedient, it provokes your anger. And again, if you would
          not suffer God’s wrath, why have you so often cast a slight on God? If
          anyone casts a slight on men, it tends to provoke them. How much more
          may the Infinite Majesty of heaven be provoked, when he is contemned!
          You have also robbed God of his property, you have refused to give him
          that which is his own. It provokes men when they are deprived of their
          due and they are dealt injuriously by; how much more may God be
          provoked when you rob him!
        </p>
        <p>
          You have also slighted the kindness of God to you, and that the
          greatest love and kindness of which you can conceive. You have been
          supremely ungrateful, and have only abused that kindness. Nothing
          provokes men more than to have their kindness slighted and abused. How
          much more may God be provoked when men requite his infinite mercy only
          with disobedience and ingratitude! If therefore you go on to provoke
          God, and to stir up his wrath, how can you expect any other than to
          suffer his wrath? If then you should indeed suffer the wrath of an
          offended God, remember it is what you have procured for yourself, it
          is a fire of your own kindling.
        </p>
        <p>
          You would not accept of deliverance from God’s wrath, when it has been
          offered to you. When God had in mercy sent his only-begotten Son into
          the world, you refused to admit him. You loved your sins too well to
          forsake them to come to Christ, and for the sake of your sins you have
          rejected all the offers of a Savior, so that you have chosen death
          rather than life. After you have procured wrath to yourself, you clove
          fast to it, and would not part with it for mercy. “All they that hate
          me, love death.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth, how just would it be that you be delivered up into the had of
          the devil and his angels, to be tormented by them hereafter, seeing
          you have voluntarily given yourself up to serve them here! You have
          hearkened to them rather than to God. How just therefore would it be
          if God leave you to them! You have followed Satan and adhered to his
          interest in opposition to God, and have subjected yourself to his will
          in this world, rather than to the will of God. How just therefore
          would it be if God should give you up to his will hereafter!
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventh, how justly may your bodies be made organs of torment to you
          hereafter, which you have made organs and instruments of sin in this
          world! You have given up your bodies a sacrifice to sin and Satan. How
          justly therefore may God give them up a sacrifice to wrath! You have
          employed your bodies as servants to your vile and hateful lusts. How
          just therefore would it be for God hereafter to raise your bodies to
          be organs and instruments of misery; and to fill them as full of
          torment as they have been filled full of sin!
        </p>
        <p>
          Eighth, but the greatest objection of wicked men against the justice
          of the future punishment which God has threatened, is from the
          greatness of that punishment: that God should inflict upon the finally
          impenitent, torments so extreme, so amazingly dreadful, to have their
          bodies cast into a furnace of fire of such immense heat and
          fierceness, there to lie unconsumed, and yet full of sense and
          feeling, glowing within and without; and the soul full of yet more
          dreadful horror and torment; and so to remain without any remedy or
          rest forever, and ever, and ever. And, therefore, I would mention
          several things to you, to show how justly you lie exposed to so
          dreadful a punishment.

          1. This punishment, as dreadful as it is, is not more so than the
          Being is great and glorious against whom you have sinned. It is true
          this punishment is dreadful beyond all expression or conception, and
          so is the greatness and gloriousness of God as much beyond all
          expression or conception; and yet you have continued to sin against
          him, yea, you have been bold and presumptuous in your sins, and have
          multiplied transgressions against him without end. The wrath of God
          that you have heard of, dreadful as it is, is not more dreadful than
          that Majesty which you have despised and trampled on is awful. This
          punishment is indeed enough to fill one with horror barely to think of
          it. And so it would fill you with at least equal horror to think of
          sinning so exceedingly against so great and glorious a God, if you
          conceived of it aright. Jer. 2:12, 13, “Be astonished, O ye heavens,
          at this, and be horribly afraid; be ye very desolate, saith the Lord:
          for my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the
          fountain of living waters; and hewed them out cisterns, broken
          cisterns, that can hold no water!” God’s being so infinitely great and
          excellent, has not influenced you not to sin against him, but you have
          done it boldly, and made nothing of it, thousands of times; and why
          should this misery, being so infinitely great and dreadful, hinder God
          from inflicting it on you? 1 Sam. 2:25, “If one man sin against
          another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the Lord,
          who shall entreat for him?”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Your nature is not more averse from such misery as you have heard
          of, than God’s nature is averse from such sin as you have been guilty
          of. The nature of man is very averse from pain and torment, and
          especially it is exceedingly averse from such dreadful and eternal
          torment. But yet that does not hinder but that it is just that it
          should be inflicted, for men do not hate misery more than God hates
          sin. God is so holy, and is of so pure a nature, that he has an
          infinite aversion to sin. But yet you have made light of sin, and your
          sins have been exceedingly multiplied and enhanced. The consideration
          of God’s hating of it has not at all hindered you from committing it.
          Why, therefore, should the consideration of your hating misery hinder
          God from bringing it upon you? God represents himself in his word as
          burdened an wearied with the sins of wicked men. Isa. 1:14. “Your new
          moons and your appointed feasts, my soul hateth: they are a trouble
          unto me; I am weary to bear them.” Mal. 2:17, “Ye have wearied the
          Lord with your words: yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye
          say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and
          he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. You have not cared how much God’s honor suffered. And why should
          God be careful lest your misery be great? You have been told how much
          these and those things which you have practiced were to the dishonor
          of God; yet you did not care for that, but went on still multiplying
          transgressions. The consideration that the more you sinned, the more
          God was dishonored, did not in the least restrain you. If it had not
          been for fear of God’s displeasure, you would not have cared though
          you had dishonored him ten thousand times as much as you did. As for
          any respect you had to God, you did not care what became of God’s
          honor, nor of his happiness neither, no, nor of his being. Why then is
          God obliged to be careful how much you suffer? Why should he be
          careful of your welfare, or use any caution lest he should lay more on
          you than you can bear.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. As great as this wrath is, it is not greater than that love of God
          which you have slighted and rejected. God, in infinite mercy to lost
          sinners, has provided a way for them to escape future misery, and to
          obtain eternal life. For that end he has given his only-begotten Son,
          a person infinitely glorious and honorable in himself — being equal
          with God, and infinitely near and dear to God. It was ten thousand
          times more than if God had given all the angels in heaven, or the
          whole world, for sinners. Him he gave to be incarnate, to suffer
          death, to be made a curse for us, and to undergo the dreadful wrath of
          God in our room, and thus to purchase for us eternal glory. This
          glorious person has been offered to you times without number, and he
          has stood and knocked at your door, till his hairs were with the dews
          of the night. But all that he has done has not won upon you. You see
          no form nor comeliness in him, no beauty that you should desire him.
          When he has thus offered himself to you as your Savior, you never
          freely and heartily accept of him. This love which you have thus
          abused, is as great as that wrath of which you are in danger. If you
          would have accepted of it, you might have had the enjoyment of this
          love instead of enduring this terrible wrath. So that the misery you
          have heard of is not greater than the love you have despised, and the
          happiness and glory which you have rejected. How just than would it be
          in God to execute upon you this dreadful wrath, which is not greater
          than that love which you have despised! Heb. 2:3, “How shall we escape
          if we neglect so great salvation?”
        </p>
        <p>
          5. If you complain of this punishment as being too great, then why has
          it not been great enough to deter you from sin? As great as it is, you
          have made nothing of it. When God threatened to inflict it on you, you
          did not mind his threatenings, but were bold to disobey him, and to do
          those very things for which he threatened this punishment. Great as
          this punishment is, it has not been great enough to keep you from
          living a willfully wicked life, and going on in ways that you knew
          were evil. When you have been told that such and such things certainly
          exposed you to this punishment, you did not abstain on that account,
          but went on from day to day in a most presumptuous manner, and God’s
          threatening such a punishment was no effectual check upon you. Why
          therefore do you now complain of this punishment as too great, and
          quarrel against it, and say that God is unreasonable and cruel to
          inflict it? In so saying you are condemned out of your own mouth; for
          if it be so dreadful a punishment, and more than is just, then why was
          it not great enough at least to retrain you from willful sinning? Luke
          19:21, 22, “I feared thee, because thou art an austere man, thou
          takest up that thou laidest not down, and reapest that thou didst not
          sow. And he said unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee,
          thou wicked servant,” You complain of this punishment as too great,
          but yet you have acted as if it was not great enough, and you have
          made light of it. If the punishment is too great, why have you gone on
          to make it still greater? You have gone on from day to day, to
          treasure up wrath against the day of wrath, to add to your punishment,
          and increase it exceedingly. And yet now you complain of it as too
          great, as though God could not justly inflict so great a punishment.
          How absurd and self-contradictory is the conduct of such an one, who
          complains of God for making his punishment too great, and yet from day
          to day industriously gathers, and heaps up fuel, to make the fire the
          greater!
        </p>
        <p>
          6. You have no cause to complain of the punishment being greater than
          is just; for you have many and many a time provoked God to do his
          worst. If you should forbid a servant to do a given thing, and
          threaten that if he did it you would inflict some very dreadful
          punishment upon him, and he should do it notwithstanding, and you
          should renew your command, and warn him in the most strict manner
          possible not to do it, and tell him you would surely punish him if he
          persisted, and should declare that his punishment should be
          exceedingly dreadful, and he should wholly disregard you, and should
          disobey you again, and you should continue to repeat your commands and
          warnings ,still setting out the dreadfulness of the punishment, and he
          should still, without any regard to you, go on again and again to
          disobey you to your face, and this immediately on your thus forbidding
          and threatening him: could you take it any otherwise than as daring
          you to do your worst? But thus have you done towards God. You have had
          his commands repeated, and his threatenings set before you hundreds of
          times, and have been most solemnly warned. Yet have you
          notwithstanding gone on in ways which you knew were sinful, and have
          done the very things which he has forbidden, directly before his face.
          Job 15:25, 26, “For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and
          strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. He runneth upon him, even
          on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his buckler.” You have thus bid
          defiance to the Almighty, even when you saw the sword of his
          vindictive wrath uplifted, that it might fall upon your head. Will it,
          therefore, be any wonder if he shall make you know how terrible that
          wrath is, in your utter destruction?
