          James 2:19, “Thou believest that there is one God; thou dost well: the
          devils also believe, and tremble.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe in these words, — 1. Something that some depended on, as an
          evidence of their good estate and acceptance, as the objects of God’s
          favor, viz. a speculative faith, or belief of the doctrines of
          religion. The great doctrine of the existence of one only God is
          particularly mentioned probably because this was a doctrine wherein,
          especially, there was a visible and noted distinction between
          professing Christians and the heathens, amongst whom the Christians in
          those days were dispersed. And therefore, this was what many trusted
          in, as what recommended them to, or at least was an evidence of their
          interest in, the great spiritual and eternal privileges, in which real
          Christians were distinguished from the rest of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How much is allowed concerning this faith, viz. that it is a good
          attainment. “Thou dost well.” It was good, as it was necessary. This
          doctrine was one of the fundamental doctrines of Christianity and, in
          some respects, above all others fundamental. It was necessary to be
          believed, in order to salvation. To be without the belief of this
          doctrine, specially in those that had such advantage to know as they
          had to whom the apostle wrote, would be a great sin, and what would
          vastly aggravate their damnation. This belief was also good, as it had
          a good tendency in many respects.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. What is implicitly denied concerning it, viz. that is any evidence
          of a person’s being in a state of salvation. The whole context shows
          this to be the design of the apostle in the words. And it is
          particularly manifest by the conclusion of the verse, which is,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The thing observable in the words, viz. the argument by which the
          apostle proves that this is no sign of a state of grace, viz. that it
          is found in the devils. They believe that there is one God, and that
          he is a holy, sin-hating God and that he is a God of truth, and will
          fulfill his threatenings by which he has denounced future judgments,
          and a great increase of misery on them, and that he is an almighty
          God, and able to execute his threatened vengeance upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the doctrine I infer from the words to make the subject of
          my present discourse is this, viz. nothing in the mind of man that is
          of the same nature with what the devils experience, or are the
          subjects of, is any sure sign of saving grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there be anything that the devils have, or find in themselves,
          which is an evidence of the saving grace of the Spirit of God, then
          the apostle’s argument is not good; which is plainly this: “That which
          is in the devils, or which they do, is no certain evidence of grace.
          But the devils believe that there is one God. Therefore, thy believing
          that there is one God is no sure evidence that thou art gracious.” So
          that the whole foundation of the apostle’s argument lies in that
          proposition: “That which is in the devils, is no certain sign of
          grace.” — Nevertheless, I shall mention two or three further reasons,
          or arguments of the truth of this doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The devils have no degree of holiness. And therefore those things
          which are nothing beyond what they are the subjects of cannot be holy
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The devil once was holy. But when he fell, he lost all his holiness
          and became perfectly wicked. He is the greatest sinner, and in some
          sense the father of all sin. John 8:44, “Ye are of your father the
          devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was a murderer from
          the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there was no truth
          in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a
          liar, and the father of it.” 1 John 3:8, “He that committeth sin is of
          the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning.” He is often
          spoken of, by way of eminence, as “the wicked one.” So, Mat. 13:19,
          “Then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in
          his heart.” Verse 38, “The tares are the children of the wicked one.”
          1 John 2:13, “I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome
          the wicked one.” Chap. 3:12, “Not as Cain, who was of that wicked
          one.” Chap. 5:18, “Whosoever is born of God — keepeth himself, and
          that wicked one toucheth him not.” So the devils are called evil
          spirits, unclean spirits, powers of darkness, rulers of the darkness
          of this world, and wickedness itself. Eph. 6:12, “For we wrestle not
          against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
          against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
          wickedness in high places.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, surely those things which the minds of devils are the
          subjects of can have nothing of the nature of true holiness in them.
          The knowledge and understanding which they have of the things of God
          and religion cannot be of the nature of divine and holy light, nor any
          knowledge that is merely of the same kind. No impressions made on
          their hearts can be of a spiritual nature. That kind of sense which
          they have of divine things, however great, cannot be a holy sense.
          Such affections as move their hearts, however powerful, cannot be holy
          affections. If there be no holiness in them as they are in the devil,
          there can be no holiness in them as they are in man, unless something
          be added to them beyond what is in the devil. And if anything be added
          to them, then they are not the same things. But [they] are something
          beyond what devils are the subjects of, which is contrary to the
          supposition, for the proposition which I am upon is, that those things
          which are of the same nature, and nothing beyond what devils are the
          subjects of, cannot be holy experiences. It is not the subject that
          makes the affection, or experience, or quality holy. But it is the
          quality that makes the subject holy.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if those qualities and experiences which the devils are the
          subjects of have nothing of the nature of holiness in them, then they
          can be no certain signs that persons which have them are holy or
          gracious. There is no certain sign of true grace, but those things
          which are spiritual and gracious. It is God’s image that is his seal
          and mark, the stamp by which those that are his are known. But that
          which has nothing of the nature of holiness, has nothing of this
          image. That which is a sure sing of grace, must either be something
          which has the nature and essence of grace, or flows from, or some way
          belongs to, its essence. For that which distinguishes things one from
          another is the essence, or something appertaining to their essence.
          And therefore, that which is sometimes found wholly without the
          essence of holiness or grace, can be no essential, sure, or
          distinguishing mark of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The devils are not only absolutely without all true holiness, but
          they are not so much as the subjects of any common grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any should imagine, that some things may be signs of grace which
          are not grace itself, or which have nothing of the nature and essence
          of grace and holiness in them; yet, certainly they will allow, that
          the qualifications which are sure evidences of grace, must be things
          that are near akin to grace, or having some remarkable affinity with
          it. But the devils are not only wholly destitute of any true holiness,
          but they are at the greatest distance from it, and have nothing in
          them in any wise akin to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many in this world who are wholly destitute of saving grace
          who yet have common grace. They have no true holiness, but
          nevertheless have something of that which is called moral virtue. And
          [they] are the subjects of some degree of the common influences of the
          Spirit of God. It is so with those in general that live under the
          light of the gospel and are not given up to judicial blindness and
          hardness. Yea, those that are thus given up, yet have some degree of
          restraining grace while they live in this world, without which the
          earth could not bear them, and they would in no measure be tolerable
          members of human society. But when any are damned, or cast into hell,
          as the devils are, God wholly withdraws his restraining grace and all
          merciful influences of his Spirit whatsoever. They have neither saving
          grace nor common grace; neither the grace of the Spirit, nor any of
          the common gifts of the Spirit; neither true holiness, nor moral
          virtue of any kind. Hence arises the vast increase of the exercise of
          wickedness in the hearts of men when they are damned. And herein is
          the chief difference between the damned in hell and unregenerate and
          graceless men in this world. Not that wicked men in this world have
          any more holiness or true virtue than the damned, or have wicked men,
          when they leave this world, any principles of wickedness infused into
          them. But when men are cast into hell, God perfectly takes away his
          Spirit from them, as to all its merciful common influences, and
          entirely withdraws from them all restraints of his Spirit and good
          providence.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. It is unreasonable to suppose that a person’s being in any
          respect as the devil is, should be a certain sign that he is very
          unlike and opposite to him, and hereafter shall not have his part with
          him. True saints are extremely unlike and contrary to the devil, both
          relatively and really. They are so relatively. The devil is the grand
          rebel, the chief enemy of God and Christ, the object of God’s greatest
          wrath, a condemned malefactor, utterly rejected and cast off by him,
          forever shut out of his presence, the prisoner of his justice, an
          everlasting inhabitant of the infernal world. The saints, on the
          contrary, are the citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem, members of the
          family of the glorious King of heaven, the children of God, the
          brethren and spouse of his dear Son, heirs of God, joint-heirs with
          Christ, kings and priests unto God. And they are extremely different
          really. The devil, on account of his hateful nature, and those
          accursed dispositions which reign in him, is called Satan, the
          adversary, Abaddon and Apollyon, the great destroyer, the wolf, the
          roaring lion, the great dragon, the old serpent. The saints are
          represented as God’s holy ones, his anointed ones, the excellent of
          the earth, the meek of the earth, lambs and doves, Christ’s little
          children, having the image of God, pure in heart, God’s jewels, lilies
          in Christ’s garden, plants of paradise, stars of heaven, temples of
          the living God. The saints, so far as they are saints, are as diverse
          from the devil, as heaven is from hell. And much more contrary than
          light is to darkness. And the eternal state that they are appointed to
          is answerably diverse and contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is not reasonable to suppose that being in any respect as Satan
          is, or being the subject of any of the same properties,
          qualifications, affections, or actions, that are in him, is any
          certain evidence that persons are thus exceeding different from him,
          and in circumstances so diverse, and appointed to an eternal state so
          extremely contrary in all respects. Wicked men are in Scripture called
          the children of the devil. Now is it reasonable to suppose, that men’s
          being in any respect as the devil is can be a certain sign that they
          are not his children, but the children of the infinitely holy and
          blessed God? We are informed, that wicked men shall hereafter have
          their part with devils, shall be sentenced to the same everlasting
          fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels. Now, can a man’s
          being like the devil in any respect be a sure token that he shall not
          have his part with him, but with glorious angels, and with Jesus
          Christ, dwelling with him, where he is, that he may behold and partake
          of his glory?
        </p>
        <p>IMPROVEMENT</p>
        <p>The first use may lie in several inferences, for our instruction.</p>
        <p>
          I. From what has been said, it may be inferred, by parity of reason,
          that nothing that damned men do, or ever will experience, can be any
          sure sign of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Damned men are like the devils, are conformed to them in nature and
          state. They have nothing better in them than the devils, have no
          higher principles in their hearts, experience nothing and do nothing
          of a more excellent kind, as they are the children and servants of the
          devil, and as such, shall dwell with him, and be partakers with him of
          the same misery. As Christ says, concerning the saints in their future
          state, Mat. 22:30, “That they shall be as the angels of God in
          heaven.” So it may be said concerning ungodly men in their future
          state, that they shall be as the fallen wicked angels in hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of the aforementioned reasons, given to show the truth of the
          doctrine with respect to devils, holds good with respect to damned
          men. Damned men have no degree of holiness. And therefore those things
          which are nothing beyond what they have, cannot be holy experiences.
          Damned men are not only absolutely destitute of all true holiness, but
          they have not so much as any common grace. And lastly, it is
          unreasonable to suppose that a person’s being in any respect as the
          damned in hell are, should be a certain sign that they are very unlike
          and opposite to them, and hereafter shall not have their portion with
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We may hence infer, that no degree of speculative knowledge of
          things of religion is any certain sign of saving grace. The devil,
          before his fall, was among those bright and glorious angels of heaven,
          which are represented as morning-stars and flames of fire that excel
          in strength and wisdom. And though he be now become sinful, yet his
          sin has not abolished the faculties of the angelic nature. As when man
          fell, he did not lose the faculties of the human nature. — Sin
          destroys spiritual principles, but not the natural faculties. It is
          true, sin, when in full dominion, entirely prevents the exercise of
          the natural faculties in holy and spiritual understanding, and lays
          many impediments in the way of their proper exercise in other
          respects. It lays the natural faculty of reason under great
          disadvantages by many and strong prejudices, and in fallen men the
          faculties of the soul are, doubtless, greatly impeded in their
          exercise, through that great weakness and disorder of the corporeal
          organ to which it is strictly united, and which is the consequence of
          sin. — But there seems to be nothing in the nature of sin, or moral
          corruption, that has any tendency to destroy the natural capacity, or
          even to diminish it, properly speaking. If sin were of such a nature
          as necessarily to have that tendency and effect, then it might be
          expected that wicked men, in a future state, where they are given up
          entirely to the unrestrained exercise of their corruptions and lusts,
          and sin is in all respects brought to its greatest perfection in them,
          would have the capacity of their souls greatly diminished. This we
          have no reason to suppose, but rather on the contrary, that their
          capacities are greatly enlarged and that their actual knowledge is
          vastly increased. And that even with respect to the Divine Being, and
          the things of religion, and the great concerns of the immortal souls
          of men, the eyes of wicked men are opened, when they go into another
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The greatness of the abilities of devils may be argued from the
          representation in Eph. 6:12. “We wrestle not against flesh and blood,
          but against principalities, against powers,” etc. The same may also be
          argued from what the Scripture says of Satan’s subtlety. Gen. 3:1; 2
          Cor. 11:3; Acts 13:10. And as the devil has a faculty of understanding
          of large capacity, so he is capable of a great speculative knowledge
          of the things of God, and the invisible and eternal world, as well as
          other things. And must needs actually have a great understanding of
          these things, as these have always been chiefly in his view, and as
          his circumstances, from his first existence, have been such as have
          tended chiefly to engage him to attend to these things. Before his
          fall, he was one of those angels who continually beheld the face of
          the Father in heaven. And sin has no tendency to destroy the memory,
          and therefore has no tendency to blot out of it any speculative
          knowledge that was formerly there.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the devil’s subtlety shows his great capacity, so the way in which
          his subtlety is exercised and manifested — which is principally in his
          artful management with respect to things of religion, his exceeding
          subtle representations, insinuations, reasonings, and temptations,
          concerning these things — demonstrates his great actual understanding
          of them. As, in order to be a very artful disputant in any science,
          though it be only to confound and deceive such as are conversant in
          it, a person had need to have a great and extensive acquaintance with
          the things which pertain to that science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the devil has undoubtedly a great degree of speculative knowledge
          in divinity, having been, as it were, educated in the best divinity
          school in the universe, viz. the heaven of heavens. He must needs have
          such an extensive and accurate knowledge concerning the nature and
          attributes of God, as we, worms of the dust, in our present state, are
          not capable of. And he must have a far more extensive knowledge of the
          works of God, as of the work of creation in particular. For he was a
          spectator of the creation of this visible world. He was one of those
          morning-stars (Job 38:4-7), “who sang together, and of those sons of
          God, that shouted for joy, when God laid the foundations of the earth,
          and laid the measures thereof, and stretched the line upon it.” And so
          he must have a very great knowledge of God’s works of providence. He
          has been a spectator of the series of these works from the beginning.
          He has seen how God has governed the world in all ages. And he has
          seen the whole train of God’s wonderful successive dispensations of
          providence towards his church, from generation to generation. And he
          has not been an indifferent spectator. But the great opposition
          between God and him, in the whole course of those dispensations, has
          necessarily engaged his attention in the strictest observation of
          them. He must have a great degree of knowledge concerning Jesus Christ
          as the Savior of men, and the nature and method of the work of
          redemption, and the wonderful wisdom of God in this contrivance. It is
          that work of God wherein, above all others, God has acted in
          opposition to him, and in which he has chiefly set himself in
          opposition to God. It is with relation to this affair, that the mighty
          warfare has been maintained, which has been carried on between Michael
          and his angels, and the devil and his angels, through all ages from
          the beginning of the world, and especially since Christ appeared. The
          devil has had enough to engage his attention to the steps of divine
          wisdom in this work. For it is to that wisdom he has opposed his
          subtlety. And he has seen and found, to his great disappointment and
          unspeakable torment, how divine wisdom, as exercised in that work, has
          baffled and confounded his devices. He has a great knowledge of the
          things of another world. For the things of that world are in his
          immediate view. He has a great knowledge of heaven, for he has been an
          inhabitant of that world of glory. And he has a great knowledge of
          hell, and the nature of its misery. For he is the first inhabitant of
          hell. And above all the other inhabitants, has experience of its
          torments and has felt them constantly for more than fifty-seven
          hundred years. He must have a great knowledge of the Holy Scriptures,
          for it is evident he is not hindered from knowing what is written
          there, by the use he made of the words of Scripture in his temptation
          of our Savior. And if he can know, he has much opportunity to know,
          and must needs have a disposition to know, with the greatest
          exactness; that he may, to greater effect, pervert and wrest the
          Scripture, and prevent such an effect of the Word of God on the hearts
          of men, as shall tend to overthrow his kingdom. He must have a great
          knowledge of the nature of mankind, their capacity, their
          dispositions, and the corruption’s of their hearts. For he has had
          long and great observation and experience. The heart of man is what he
          had chiefly to do with, in his subtle devices, mighty efforts,
          restless and indefatigable operations and exertions of himself, from
          the beginning of the world. And it is evident that he has a great
          speculative knowledge of the nature of experimental religion, by his
          being able to imitate it so artfully, and in such a manner as to
          transform himself into an angel of light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore it is manifest from my text and doctrine that no degree of
          speculative knowledge of religion is any certain sign of true piety.
          Whatever clear notions a man may have of the attributes of God, the
          doctrine of the Trinity, the nature of the two covenants, the economy
          of the persons of the Trinity, and the part which each person has in
          the affair of man’s redemption, if he can discourse never so
          excellently of the offices of Christ, and the way of salvation by him,
          and the admirable methods of divine wisdom, and the harmony of the
          various attributes of God in that way; if he can talk never so clearly
          and exactly of the method of the justification of a sinner, and of the
          nature of conversion, and the operations of the Spirit of God, in
          applying the redemption of Christ, giving good distinctions, happily
          solving difficulties, and answering objections, in a manner tending
          greatly to enlighten the ignorant, to the edification of the church of
          God, and the conviction of gainsayers, and the great increase of light
          in the world. If he has more knowledge of this sort than hundreds of
          true saints of an ordinary education, and most divines; yet all is no
          certain evidence of any degree of saving grace in the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true, the Scripture often speaks of knowledge of divine things
          as what is peculiar to true saints. As in John 17:3, “This is life
          eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ
          whom thou has sent.” Mat. 11:27, “No man knoweth the Son, but the
          Father: neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to
          whomsoever the Son will reveal him.” Psa. 9:10, “They that know thy
          name will put their trust in thee.” Phil. 3:8, “I count all things but
          loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.”
          But then, we must understand it of a different kind of knowledge from
          that speculative understanding which the devil has to so great a
          degree. It will also be allowed, that the spiritual saving knowledge
          of God and divine things, greatly promotes speculative knowledge, as
          it engages the mind in its search into things of this kind, and much
          assists to a distinct understanding of them. So that, other things
          being equal, they who have spiritual knowledge are much more likely
          than others to have a good doctrinal acquaintance with things of
          religion. But yet such acquaintance may be no distinguishing
          characteristic of true saints.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. It may also be inferred from what has been observed, that for
          persons merely to yield a speculative assent to the doctrines of
          religion as true is no certain evidence of a state of grace. My text
          tells us that the devils believe. And as they believe that there is
          one God, so they believe the truth of the doctrines of religion in
          general. The devil is orthodox in his faith. He believes the true
          scheme of doctrine. He is no Deist, Socinian, Arian, Pelagian, or
          antinomian. The articles of his faith are all sound, and in them he is
          thoroughly established.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, for a person to believe the doctrines of Christianity
          merely from the force of arguments, as discerned only by speculation,
          is no evidence of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is probably a very rare thing for unregenerate men to have a strong
          persuasion of the truth of the doctrines of religion, specially such
          of them as are very mysterious, and much above the comprehension of
          reason. Yet if he be very confident of the truth of Christianity and
          its doctrines, and is able to argue most strongly for the proof of
          them, in this he goes nothing beyond the devil, who doubtless has a
          great knowledge of the rational arguments by which the truth of the
          Christian religion and its several principles are evinced.
        </p>
        <p>
          And therefore when the Scripture speaks of believing that Jesus is the
          Son of God, as a sure evidence of grace, as in 1 John 5:1, and other
          places, it must be understood, not of a mere speculative assent, but
          of another kind and manner of believing, which is called the faith of
          God’s elect, Tit. 1:1. There is a spiritual conviction of the truth,
          which is a believing with the whole heart, peculiar to true saints, of
          which I shall speak more particularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. It may be inferred from the doctrine which has been insisted on
          that it is no certain sign of persons being savingly converted that
          they have been subjects of very great distress and terrors of mind,
          through apprehensions of God’s wrath, and fears of damnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the devils are the subjects of great terrors, through
          apprehensions of God’s wrath, and fears of its future effects is
          implied in my text, which speaks not only of their believing, but
          trembling. It must be no small degree of terror which should make
          those principalities and powers, those mighty, proud, and sturdy
          beings, to tremble.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many terrors that some persons who are concerned for their
          salvation are the subjects of, which are not from any proper
          awakenings of conscience, or apprehensions of truth, but from
          melancholy or frightful impressions on their imagination, or some
          groundless apprehensions, and the delusions and false suggestions of
          Satan. But if they have had never so great and long continued terrors
          from real awakenings, and convictions of truth, and views of things as
          they are, this is no more than what is in the devils, and will be in
          all wicked men in another world. However stupid and senseless most
          ungodly men are now, all will be effectually awakened at last. There
          will be no such thing as slumbering in hell. There are many that
          cannot be awakened by the most solemn warnings and awful threatenings
          of the Word of God — the most alarming discourses from the pulpit, and
          the most awakening and awful providences — but all will be thoroughly
          awakened by the sound of the last trumpet and the appearance of Christ
          to judgment. All sorts will then be filled with most amazing terrors,
          from apprehensions of truth, and seeing things as they are, when “the
          kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief
          captains, and the mighty men (such as were the most ofty and
          stout-hearted, most ready to treat the things of religion with
          contempt) shall hide themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the
          mountains, and say to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us
          from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of
          the Lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be
          able to stand?” Rev. 6:15-17. — Therefore if persons have been first
          awakened, and afterwards have had comfort and joy, it is no certain
          sign that their comforts are of the right hand, because they were
          preceded by very great terrors.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. It may be further inferred from the doctrine, that no work of the
          law on men’s hearts, in conviction of guilt, and just desert of
          punishment, is a sure argument that a person has been savingly
          converted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only are no awakenings and terrors any certain evidence of this,
          but no mere real work whatsoever, though carried to the utmost extent.
          Nothing wherein there is no grace or spiritual light, but only the
          mere conviction of natural conscience, and those acts and operations
          of the mind which are the result of this — and so are, as it were,
          merely forced by the clear light of conscience, without the
          concurrence of the heart and inclination with that light — is any
          certain sign of the saving grace of God, or that a person was ever
          savingly converted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evidence of this, from my text and doctrine, is demonstrative
          because the devils are the subjects of these thing. And all wicked men
          that shall finally perish, will be the subjects of the same. Natural
          conscience is not extinguished in the damned in hell, but, on the
          contrary, remains there in its greatest strength, and is brought to
          its most perfect exercise, most fully to do its proper office as God’s
          vicegerent in the soul, to condemn those rebels against the King of
          heaven and earth, and manifest God’s just wrath and vengeance, and by
          that means to torment them, and be as a never-dying worm within them.
          Wretched men find means in this world to blind the eyes and stop the
          mouth of this vicegerent of a sin-revenging God. But they shall not be
          able to do it always. In another world, the eyes and mouth of
          conscience will be fully opened. God will hereafter make wicked men to
          see and know these things from which now they industriously hide their
          eyes. Isa. 26:10, 11, “Let favour be showed to the wicked, yet will he
          not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal
          unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the Lord. Lord, when thy
          hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see, and be
          ashamed for their envy at the people, yea, the fire of thine enemies
          shall devour them.” We have this expression often annexed to God’s
          threatenings of wrath to his enemies; “And they shall know that I am
          the Lord.” This shall be accomplished by their woeful experience and
          clear light in their consciences, whereby they shall be made to know,
          whether they will or not, how great and terrible, holy and righteous,
          a God Jehovah is, whose authority they have despised. And they shall
          know that he is righteous and holy in their destruction. This all the
          ungodly will be convinced of at the day of judgment, by the bringing
          to light of all their wickedness of heart and practice, and setting
          all their sins, with all their aggravations, in order, not only in the
          view of others, even of the whole world, but in the view of their own
          consciences. This is threatened, Psa. 50:21, “These things thou hast
          done, and I kept silence: thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a
          one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before
          thine eyes.” Compare this with the four first verses of the Psalm. —
          The design of the day of judgment is not to find out what is just, as
          it is with human judgments. But it is to manifest what is just; to
          make known God’s justice in the judgment which he will execute to
          men’s own consciences, and to the world. And therefore that day is
          called “the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of
          God,” Rom. 2:5. Now sinners often cavil against the justice of God’s
          dispensations, and particularly the punishment which he threatens for
          their sins, excusing themselves, and condemning him. But when God
          comes to manifest their wickedness in the light of that day and to
          call them to an account, they will be speechless. Mat. 22:11, 12, “And
          when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had
          not on a wedding-garment. And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest
          thou in hither, not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.”
          When the King of heaven and earth comes to judgment, their consciences
          will be so perfectly enlightened and convinced by the all-searching
          Light they shall then stand in, that their mouths will be effectually
          stopped, as to all excuses for themselves, all pleading of their own
          righteousness to excuse or justify them, and all objections against
          the justice of their Judge, that their conscience will condemn them
          only, and not God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore it follows from the doctrine, That it can be no certain sign
          of grace, that persons have had great convictions of sin. Suppose they
          have had their sins of life, with their aggravations, remarkably set
          before them, so as greatly to affect and terrify them. And withal,
          have had a great sight of the wickedness of their hearts, the
          greatness of the sin of unbelief, and of the unexcusableness and
          heinousness of their most secret spiritual iniquities. Perhaps they
          have been convinced of the utter insufficiency of their own
          righteousness, and they despair of being recommended to God by it.
          [They] have been convinced that they are wholly without excuse before
          God, and deserve damnation. And that God would be just in executing
          the threatened punishment upon them, though it be so dreadful. All
          these things will be in the ungodly at the day of judgment, when they
          shall stand with devils, at the left hand, and shall be doomed as
          accursed to everlasting fire with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed there will be no submission in them. Their conscience will be
          convinced that God is just in their condemnation. But yet their wills
          will not be bowed to God’s justice. There will be no acquiescence of
          mind in that divine attribute, no yielding of the soul to God’s
          sovereignty, but the highest degree of enmity and opposition. A true
          submission of the heart and will to the justice and sovereignty of God
          is therefore allowed to be something peculiar to true converts, being
          something which the devils and damned souls are and ever will be far
          from. And to which a mere work of the law, and convictions of
          conscience, however great and clear, will never bring men.
        </p>
        <p>
          When sinners are the subjects of great convictions of conscience, and
          a remarkable work of the law, it is only transacting the business of
          the day of judgment in the conscience before-hand. God sits enthroned
          in the conscience, as at the last day he will sit enthroned in the
          clouds of heaven. The sinner is arraigned as it were at God’s bar. And
          God appears in his awful greatness as a just and holy, sin-hating and
          sin-revenging God, as he will then. The sinner’s iniquities are
          brought to light. His sins set in order before him. The hidden things
          of darkness, and the counsels of the heart are made manifest, as it
          will be then. Many witnesses do as it were rise up against the sinner
          under convictions of conscience, as they will against the wicked at
          the day of judgment; and the books are opened particularly the book of
          God’s strict and holy law is opened in the conscience, and its rules
          applied for the condemnation of the sinner, which is the book that
          will be opened at the day of judgment, as the grand rule to all such
          wicked men as have lived under it. And the sentence of the law is
          pronounced against the sinner, and the justice of the sentence made
          manifest, as it will be at the day of judgment. The conviction of a
          sinner at the day of judgment will be a work of the law, as well as
          the conviction of conscience in this world. And the work of the law
          (if the work be merely legal) is never carried further in the
          consciences of sinners now than it will be at that day, when its work
          will be perfect in thoroughly stopping the sinner’s mouth. Rom. 3:19,
          “Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them
          who are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the
          world may become guilty before God.” Every mouth shall be stopped by
          the law, either now or hereafter; and all the world shall become
          sensibly guilty before God, guilty of death, deserving of damnation.
          And therefore, if sinners have been the subjects of a great work of
          the law, and have thus become guilty, and their mouths have been
          stopped, it is no certain sign that ever they have been converted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed the want of a thorough sense of guilt, and desert of
          punishment, and conviction of the justice of God in threatening
          damnation is a sign that a person never was converted, and truly
          brought with the whole soul to embrace Christ as a Savior from this
          punishment. For it is easily demonstrable, that there is no such thing
          as entirely and cordially accepting an offer of a Savior from a
          punishment which we think we do not deserve. But having such a
          conviction is no certain sign that persons have true faith, or have
          ever truly received Christ as their Savior. And if persons have great
          comfort, joy, and confidence suddenly let into their minds, after
          great convictions, it is no infallible evidence that their comforts
          are built on a good foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is manifest, therefore, that too much stress has been laid by many
          persons on a great work of the law preceding their comforts, who seem
          not only to have looked on such a work of the law as necessary to
          precede faith, but also to have esteemed it as the chief evidence of
          the truth and genuineness of succeeding faith and comforts. By this
          means it is to be feared very many have been deceived and established
          in a false hope. And what is to be seen in the event of things, in
          multitudes of instances, confirms this. It may be safely allowed that
          it is not so usual for great convictions of conscience to prove
          abortive, and fail of a good issue, as for lesser convictions. And
          that more generally when the Spirit of God proceeds so far with
          sinners, in the work of the law, as to give them a great sight of
          their hearts, and of the heinousness of their spiritual iniquities,
          and to convince them that they are without excuse, and that all their
          righteousness can do nothing to merit God’s favor. But they lie justly
          exposed to God’s eternal vengeance with mercy — a work of saving
          conversion follows. But we can have no warrant to say, it is
          universally so, or to lay it down as an infallible rule, that when
          convictions of conscience have gone thus far, saving faith and
          repentance will surely follow. If any should think they have ground
          for such a determination, because they cannot conceive what end God
          should have, in carrying a work of conviction to such a length, and so
          preparing the heart for faith, and after all, never giving saving
          faith to the soul, I desire it may be considered, where will be the
          end of our doubts and difficulties, if we think ourselves sufficient
          to determine so positively and particularly concerning God’s ends and
          designs in what he does. It may be asked such an objector, what is
          God’s end in giving a sinner any degree of the strivings of his Spirit
          and conviction of conscience, when he afterwards suffers it to come to
          nothing?
        </p>
        <p>
          If he may give some degree that may finally be in vain, who shall set
          the bounds, and say how great the degree shall be? Who can, on sure
          grounds, determine that when a sinner has so much of that conviction
          which the devils and damned in hell have, true faith and eternal
          salvation will be the certain consequence? This we may certainly
          determine, that, if the apostle’s argument in the text be good, not
          anything whatsoever that the devils have is certainly connected with
          such a consequence. Seeing sinners, while such, are capable of the
          most perfect convictions, and will have them at the day of judgment,
          and in hell, who shall say, that God never shall cause reprobates to
          anticipate the future judgment and damnation in that respect? And if
          he does so, who shall say to him, What dost thou? Or call him to
          account concerning his ends in so doing? Not but that many possible
          wise ends might be thought of, and mentioned, if it were needful, or I
          had now room for it. — The Spirit of God is often quenched by the
          exercise of the wickedness of men’s hearts, after he has gone far in a
          work of conviction, so that their convictions never have a good issue.
          And who can say that sinners, by the exercise of their opposition and
          enmity against God, which is not at all mortified by the greatest
          legal convictions, neither in the damned in hell nor sinners on earth,
          may not provoke God to take his Spirit from them, even after he has
          proceeded the greatest length in a work of conviction? Who can say,
          that God never is provoked to destroy some, after he has brought them,
          as it were, through the wilderness, even to the edge of the land of
          rest? As he slew some of the Israelites, even in the plains of Moab.
        </p>
        <p>
          And let it be considered, where is our warrant in Scripture, to make
          use of any legal convictions, or any method or order of successive
          events in a work of the law, and consequent comforts, as a sure sign
          of regeneration. The Scripture is abundant, in expressly mentioning
          evidences of grace, and of a state of favor with God, as
          characteristics of true saints. But where do we ever find such things
          as these amongst those evidences? Or where do we find any other signs
          insisted on, besides grace itself, its nature, exercises, and fruits?
          These were the evidences that Job relied upon. These were the things
          that the Psalmist everywhere insists upon as evidences of his
          sincerity, and particularly in the 119th Psalm, from the beginning to
          the end: these were the signs that Hezekiah trusted to in his
          sickness.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were the characteristics of those that are truly happy given by
          our Savior in the beginning of his sermon on the mount. These are the
          things that Christ mentions, as the true evidences of being his real
          disciples, in his last and dying discourse to his disciples, in the
          14th, 15th, and 16th chapters of John, and in his intercessory prayer,
          chap. 17. These are the things which the apostle Paul often speaks of
          as evidences of his sincerity, and sure title to a crown of glory. And
          these are the things he often mentions to others, in his epistles, as
          the proper evidences of real Christianity, a justified state, and a
          title to glory. He insists on the fruits of the spirit; love, joy,
          peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
          temperance as the proper evidences of being Christ’s, and living in
          the Spirit: Gal. 5:22-25. It is that charity, or divine love, which is
          pure, peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy, etc.
          that he insists on, as the most essential evidence of true godliness.
          Without which, all other things are nothing. Such are the signs which
          the apostle James insists on, as the proper evidence of a truly wise
          and good man. Jam. 3:17, “The wisdom that is from above is first pure,
          then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and
          good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.” And such are
          the signs of true Christianity, which the apostle John insists on
          throughout his epistles. And we never have anywhere in the Bible, from
          the beginning to the end of it, any other signs of godliness given,
          than such as these. If persons have such things as these apparently in
          them, it ought to be determined that they are truly converted, without
          its being first known what method the Spirit of God took to introduce
          these things into the soul, which oftentimes is altogether
          untraceable. All the works of God are in some respects unsearchable.
          But the Scripture often represents the works of the Spirit of God as
          peculiarly so. Isa. 40:13, “Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord,
          or being his counselor, hath taught him?” Ecc. 11:5, “As thou knowest
          not what is the way of the Spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the
          womb of her that is with child: so thou knowest not the works of God,
          who maketh all.” John 3:8, “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and
          thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh,
          and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.”
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. It follows from my text and doctrine, that it is no certain sign
          of grace that persons have earnest desires and longings after
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The devils, doubtless, long for deliverance from the misery they
          suffer and from that greater misery which they expect. If they tremble
          through fear of it, they must necessarily, earnestly desire to be
          delivered from it. Wicked men are, in Scripture, represented as
          longing for the privileges of the righteous, when the door is shut,
          and they are shut out from among them. They come to the door, and cry,
          Lord, Lord, open to us. Therefore, we are not to look on all desires
          that are very earnest and vehement, as certain evidences of a pious
          heart. There are earnest desires of a religious nature, which the
          saints have, that are the proper breathings of a new nature, and
          distinguishing qualities of true saints. But there are also longings
          which unregenerate men may have, which are often mistaken for marks of
          godliness. They think they hunger and thirst after righteousness, and
          have earnest desires after God and Christ, and long for heaven. When,
          indeed, all is to be resolved into self-love. And so [it] is a longing
          which arises from no higher principles than the earnest desires of
          devils.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. It may be inferred from what has been observed, that persons who
          have no grace may have a great apprehension of an external glory in
          things heavenly and divine, and of whatsoever is external pertaining
          to religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          If persons have impressed strongly on their minds ideas obtained by
          the external senses, whether by the ear, as any kind of sound,
          pleasant music, or words spoken of excellent signification, words of
          Scripture, suitable to their case, or adapted to the subject of their
          meditations, or ideas obtained by the eye, as of a visible beauty and
          glory, a shining light, golden streets, gates of precious stone, a
          most magnificent throne surrounded by angels and saints in shining
          ranks, or anything external belonging to Jesus Christ, either in his
          humbled state, as hanging on the cross with his crown of thorns, his
          wounds open, and blood trickling down, or in his glorified state, with
          awful majesty, or ravishing beauty and sweetness in his countenance,
          his face shining above the brightness of the sun, and the like. These
          things are no certain signs of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multitudes that are now in hell will have ideas of the external glory
          that pertains to things heavenly, far beyond whatever any have in this
          world. They will see all that external glory and beauty, in which
          Christ will appear at the day of judgment, when the sun shall be
          turned into darkness before him, which, doubtless, will be ten
          thousand times greater than ever was impressed on the imagination of
          either saints or sinners in this present state, or ever was conceived
          by any mortal man.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. It may be inferred from the doctrine that persons who have no
          grace may have a very great and affecting sense of many divine things
          on their hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The devil has not only great speculative knowledge, but he has a sense
          of many divine things, which deeply affects him, and is most strongly
          impressed on his heart. As,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the devils and damned souls have a great sense of the vast
          importance of the things of another world. They are in the invisible
          world, and they see and know how great the things of that world are.
          Their experience teaches them in the most affecting manner. They have
          a great sense of the worth of salvation, and the worth of immortal
          souls, and the vast importance of those things that concern men’s
          eternal welfare. The parable in the latter end of the 16th chapter of
          Luke teaches this, in representing the rich man in hell, as entreating
          that Lazarus might be sent to his five brothers to testify unto them,
          lest they should come to that place of torment. They who endure the
          torments of hell have doubtless a most lively and affecting sense of
          the vastness of an endless eternity, and of the comparative
          momentariness of this life, and the vanity of the concerns and
          enjoyments of time. They are convinced effectually, that all the
          things of this world, even those that appear greatest and most
          important to the inhabitants of the earth, are despicable trifles, in
          comparison of the things of the eternal world. They have a great sense
          of the preciousness of time, and of the means of grace, and the
          inestimable value of the privileges which they enjoy which live under
          the gospel. They are fully sensible of the folly of those that go on
          in sin, neglect their opportunities, make light of the counsels and
          warnings of God, and bitterly lament their exceeding folly in their
          own sins, by which they have brought on themselves so great and
          remediless misery. When sinners, by woeful experience, know the
          dreadful issue of their evil way, they will mourn at the last, saying,
          How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof, and have
          not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them
          that instructed me! Pro. 4:11, 12, 13.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, however true godliness is attended with a great sense of
          the importance of divine things — and it is rare that men who have no
          grace maintain such a sense in any steady and persevering manner — yet
          it is manifest those things are no certain evidences of grace.
          Unregenerate men may have a sense of the importance of eternity, and
          the vanity of time, the worth of immortal souls, the preciousness of
          time and the means of grace, and the folly of the way of allowed sin.
          They may have such a sense of those things, as may deeply affect them,
          and cause them to mourn for their own sins, and be much concerned for
          others. Though it be true, they have not these things in the same
          manner, and in all respects from the same principles and views, as
          godly men have them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, devils and damned men have a strong and most affecting sense
          of the awful greatness and majesty of God. This is greatly made
          manifest in the execution of divine vengeance on his enemies. Rom.
          9:22, “What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power
          known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to
          destruction?” The devils tremble before this great and terrible God
          and under a strong sense of his awful majesty. It is greatly
          manifested to them and damned souls now. But shall he manifested in a
          further degree, in that day when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from
          heaven in flaming fire, to take vengeance upon them. And when they
          shall earnestly desire to fly, and be hid from the face of him that
          sits on the throne (which shall be, “because of the glory of his
          majesty,” Isa. 2:10) and when they shall be punished with everlasting
          destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his
          power. When Christ comes at the last day, in the glory of his Father,
          every eye shall see him in that glory (in this respect, that they
          shall see his terrible majesty), and they also that pierced him, Rev.
          1:7. Both those devils, and wicked men, which tormented and insulted
          him when he appeared in meanness and ignominy, shall then see him in
          the glory of his Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident, therefore, that a sense of God’s terrible majesty is no
          certain evidence of saving grace. For we see that wicked men and
          devils are capable of it. Yea, many wicked men in this world have
          actually had it. This is a manifestation which God made of himself in
          the sight of that wicked congregation at mount Sinai, which they saw,
          and with which they were deeply affected, so that all the people in
          the camp trembled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, devils and damned men have some kind of conviction and sense of
          all attributes of God, both natural and moral, that is strong and very
          affecting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The devils know God’s almighty power. They saw a great manifestation
          of it when they saw God lay the foundation of the earth, etc. and were
          much affected with it. They have seen innumerable other great
          demonstrations of his power, as in the universal deluge, the
          destruction of Sodom, the wonders in Egypt, at the Red sea, and in the
          wilderness, causing the sun to stand still in Joshua’s time, and many
          others. — And they had a very affecting manifestation of God’s mighty
          power on themselves in casting all their hosts down from heaven into
          hell. And have continual affecting experience of it, in God’s
          reserving them in strong chains of darkness, and in the strong pains
          they feel. They will hereafter have far more affecting experience of
          it, when they shall be punished from the glory of God’s power, with
          that mighty destruction in expectation of which they now tremble. So
          the devils have a great knowledge of the wisdom of God. They have had
          unspeakably more opportunity and occasion to observe it in the work of
          creation, and also in the works of providence, than any mortal man has
          ever had. And have been themselves the subjects of innumerable
          affecting manifestations of it, in God’s disappointing and confounding
          them in their most subtle devices, in so wonderful and amazing a
          manner. So they see and find the infinite purity and holiness of the
          divine nature, in the most affecting manner, as this appears in his
          infinite hatred of sin, in what they feel of the dreadful effects of
          that hatred. They know already by what they suffer, and will know
          hereafter to a greater degree, and far more affecting manner, that
          such is the opposition of God’s nature to sin, that is like a
          consuming fire, which burns with infinite vehemence against it. They
          also will see the holiness of God, as exercised in his love to
          righteousness and holiness, in the glory of Christ and his church,
          which also will be very affecting to devils and wicked men. And the
          exact justice of God will be manifested to them in the clearest and
          strongest, most convincing and most affecting, light, at the day of
          judgment; when they will also see great and affecting demonstrations
          of the riches of his grace, in the marvelous fruits of his love to the
          vessels of mercy, when they shall see them at the right hand of
          Christ, shining as the sun in the kingdom of their Father, and shall
          hear the blessed sentence pronounced upon them, and will be deeply
          affected with it, as seems naturally implied in Luke 13:28, 29. The
          devils know God’s truth, and therefore they believe his threatenings,
          and tremble in expectation of their accomplishment. And wicked men
          that now doubt his truth, and dare not trust his word, will hereafter,
          in the most convincing, affecting manner, find his word to be true in
          all that he has threatened, and will see that he is faithful to his
          promises in the rewards of his saints. Devils and damned men know that
          God is eternal and unchangeable. And therefore they despair of there
          ever being an end to their misery. Therefore it is manifest, that
          merely persons having an affecting sense of some, or even of all God’s
          attributes, is no certain sign that they have the true grace of God in
          their hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object. Here possibly some may object against the force of the
          foregoing reasoning, that ungodly men in this world are in exceeding
          different circumstances from those in which the devils are, and from
          those which wicked men will be in at the day of judgment. Those things
          which are visible and present to these, are now future and invisible
          to the other. And wicked men in this world are in the body, that clogs
          and hinders the soul, and are encompassed with objects that blind and
          stupefy them. Therefore it does not follow, that because the wicked in
          another world have a great apprehension and lively sense of such
          things without grace, ungodly men in their present state may have the
          same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ans. To this I answer: It is not supposed that ever men in this life
          have all those things which have been mentioned to the same degree
          that the devils and damned have them. — None supposes that ever any in
          this life have terrors of conscience to an equal degree with them. It
          is not to be supposed that any mortal man, whether godly or ungodly,
          has an equal degree of speculative knowledge with the devil. And, as
          was just now observed, the wicked at the day of judgment, will have a
          vastly greater idea of the external glory of Christ than ever any have
          in the present state. So, doubtless, they will have a far greater
          sense of God’s awful greatness and terrible majesty, than any could
          subsist under in this frail state. So we may well conclude, that the
          devils and wicked men in hell have a greater and more affecting sense
          of the vastness of eternity, and (in some respects) a greater sense of
          the importance of the things of another world than any here have. And
          they have also longings after salvation to a higher degree than any
          wicked men in this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yet it is evident that men in this world may have things of the
          same kind with devils and damned men, the same sort of light in the
          understanding, the same views and affections, the same sense of
          things, the same kind of impressions on the mind and on the heart. The
          objection is against the conclusiveness of that reasoning which is the
          apostle’s more properly than mine. The apostle judged it a conclusive
          argument against such as thought their believing there was one God an
          evidence of their being gracious, that the devils believed the same.
          So the argument is exactly the same against such as think they have
          grace, because they believe God is a holy God, or because they have a
          sense of the awful majesty of God. — The same may be observed of other
          things that have been mentioned. My text has reference, not only to
          the act of the understandings of devils in believing, but to that
          affection of their hearts which accompanies the views they have, as
          trembling is an effect of the affection of the heart. Which shows,
          that if men have both the same views of understanding and also the
          same affections of heart that the devils have, it is no sign of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as to the particular degree to which these things may be carried
          in men in this world without grace, it appears not safe to make use of
          it as an infallible rule to determine men’s state. I know not where we
          have any rule to go by, to fix the precise degree in which God by his
          providence, or his common influences on the mind, will excite in
          wicked men in this world, the same views and affections which the
          wicked have in another world. Which it is manifest, the former are
          capable of as well as the latter, having the same faculties and
          principles of soul, and which views and affections, it is evident,
          they often are actually the subjects of in some degree, some in a
          greater and some in a less degree. The infallible evidences of grace
          which are laid down in Scripture are of another kind. They are all of
          a holy and spiritual nature. And therefore things of that kind which a
          heart that is wholly carnal and corrupt cannot receive or experience,
          1 Cor. 2:14. I might also here add that observation and experience, in
          very many instances, seem to confirm what Scripture and reason teaches
          in these things.
