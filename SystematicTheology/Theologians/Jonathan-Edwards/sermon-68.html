          Isaiah 32:2<br />
          And a man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from
          the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a
          great rock in a weary land.
        </p>
        <p>In these words we may observe,</p>
        <p>
          1. The person who is here prophesied of and commended, viz. the Lord
          Jesus Christ, the King spoken of in the preceding verse, who shall
          reign in righteousness. This King is abundantly prophesied of in the
          Old Testament, and especially in this prophecy of Isaiah. Glorious
          predictions were from time to time uttered by the prophets concerning
          that great King who was to come: there is no subject which is spoken
          of in so magnificent and exalted a style by the prophets of the Old
          Testament, as the Messiah. They saw his day and rejoiced, and searched
          diligently, together with the angels, into those things. I Peter 1:11,
          12. “Searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ
          which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the
          sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. Unto whom it
          was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us, they did minister
          the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached
          the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which
          things the angels desire to look into.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We are told here that “a man shall be a hiding-place from the wind,”
          &amp;c. There is an emphasis in the words, that “a man” should be
          this. If these things had been said of God, it would not be strange
          under the Old Testament; for God is frequently called a hiding-place
          for his people, a refuge in time of trouble, a strong rock, and a high
          tower. But what is so remarkable is, that they are said of “a man.”
          But this is a prophecy of the Son of God incarnate.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The things here foretold of him, and the commendations given him.
          “He shall be a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the
          tempest:” that is, he shall be the safety and defence of his people,
          to which they shall flee for protection in the time of their danger
          and trouble. To him they shall flee, as one who is abroad, and sees a
          terrible storm arising, makes haste to some shelter to secure himself;
          so that however furious is the tempest, yet he is safe within, and the
          wind and rain, though they beat never so impetuously upon the roof and
          walls, are no annoyance unto him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shall be as “rivers of water in a dry place.” This is an allusion
          to the deserts of Arabia, which was an exceedingly hot and dry
          country. One may travel there many days, and see no sign of a river,
          brook, or spring, nothing but a dry and parched wilderness; so that
          travelers are ready to be consumed with thirst, as the children of
          Israel were when they were in this wilderness, when they were faint
          because there was no water. Now when a man finds Jesus Christ, he is
          like one that has been traveling in those deserts till he is almost
          consumed with thirst, and who as last finds a river of cool and clear
          water. And Christ was typified by the river of water that issued out
          of the rock for the children of Israel in this desert: he is compared
          to a river, because there is such a plenty and fulness in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is the “shadow of a great rock in a weary land.” Allusion is still
          made to the desert of Arabia. It is not said, as the shadow of a tree,
          because in some places of that country, there is nothing but dry sand
          and rocks for a vast space together, not a tree to be seen; and the
          sun beats exceedingly hot upon the sands, and all the shade to be
          found there, where travellers can rest and shelter themselves from the
          scorching sun, is under some great rock. They who come to Christ find
          such rest and refreshment as the weary traveller in that hot and
          desolate country finds under the shadow of a great rock.
        </p>
        <p>
          We propose to speak to three propositions that are explicatory of the
          several parts of the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. There is in Christ Jesus abundant foundation of peace and safety
          for those who are in fear and danger. “A man shall be a hiding-place
          from the wind, a covert from the tempest.”
        </p>
        <p>
          II. There is in Christ provision for the satisfaction, and full
          contentment, of the needy and thirsty soul. He shall be “as rivers of
          water in a dry place.”
        </p>
        <p>
          III. There are quiet rest and sweet refreshment in Christ Jesus for
          him who is weary. He shall be “as the shadow of a great rock in a
          weary land.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I. There is in Christ Jesus abundant foundation of peace and safety
          for those who are in fear and danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fears and dangers to which men are subject, are of two kinds;
          temporal and eternal. Men are frequently in distress from fear of
          temporal evils. We live in an evil world, where we are liable to an
          abundance of sorrows and calamities. A great part of our lives is
          spent in sorrowing for present or past evils, and in fearing those
          which are future. What poor, distressed creatures are we, when God is
          pleased to send his judgements among us! If he visits a place with
          mortal and prevailing sickness, what terror seizes our hearts! If any
          person is taken sick, and trembles for his life, or if our near
          friends are at the point of death, or in many other dangers, how
          fearful is our condition! Now there is sufficient foundation for peace
          and safety to those exercised with such fears, and brought into such
          dangers. But Christ is a refuge in all trouble; there is a foundation
          for rational support and peace in him, whatever threatens us. He,
          whose heart is fixed, trusting in Christ, need not be afraid of any
          evil tidings. “As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so Christ
          is round about them that fear him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is the other kind of fear and danger to which we have a
          principal respect; the fear and danger of God’s wrath. The fears of a
          terrified conscience, the fearful expectation of the dire fruits of
          sin, and the resentment of an angry God, these are infinitely the most
          dreadful. If men are in danger of those things, and are not asleep,
          they will be more terrified than with the fears of any outward evil.
          Men are in a most deplorable condition, as they are by nature exposed
          to God’s wrath; and if they are sensible how dismal their case is,
          will be in dreadful fears and dismal expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is pleased to make some sensible of their true condition. He lets
          them see the storm that threatens them, how black the clouds are, and
          how impregnated with thunder, that it is a burning tempest, that they
          are in danger of being speedily overtaken by it, that they have
          nothing to shelter themselves from it, and that they are in danger of
          being taken away by the fierceness of his anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a fearful condition when one is smitten with a sense of the
          dreadfulness of God’s wrath, when he has his heart impressed with the
          conviction that the great God is not reconciled to him, that he holds
          him guilty of these and those sins, and that he is angry enough with
          him to condemn him for ever. It is dreadful to lie down and rise up,
          it is dreadful to eat and drink, and to walk about, in God’s anger
          from day to day. One, in such a case, is ready to be afraid of every
          thing; he is afraid of meeting God’s wrath wherever he goes. He has no
          peace in his mind, but there is a dreadful sound in his ears; his mind
          is afflicted and tossed with tempest, and not comforted, and courage
          is ready to fail, and the spirit ready to sink with fear; for how can
          a poor worm bear the wrath of the great God, and what would not he
          give for peace of conscience, what would not he give if he could find
          safety! When such fears exist to a great degree, or are continued a
          long time, they greatly enfeeble the heart, and bring it to a
          trembling posture and disposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now for such as these there is abundant foundation for peace and
          safety in Jesus Christ, and this will appear from the following
          things:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Christ has undertaken to save all such from what they fear, if they
          come to him. It is his professional business; the work in which he
          engaged before the foundation of the world. It is what he always had
          in his thoughts and intentions; he undertook from everlasting to be
          the refuge of those that are afraid of God’s wrath. His wisdom is
          such, that he would never undertake a work for which he is not
          sufficient. If there were some in so dreadful a case that he was not
          able to defend them, or so guilty that it was not fit that he should
          save them, then he never would have undertaken for them. Those who are
          in trouble and distressing fear, if they come to Jesus Christ, have
          this to ease them of their fears, that Christ has promised them that
          he will protect them; that they come upon his invitation; that Christ
          has plighted his faith for their security if they will close with him;
          and that he is engaged by covenant to God the Father that he will save
          those afflicted and distressed souls that come to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ, by his own free act, has made himself the surety of such, he
          has voluntarily put himself in their stead; and if justice has any
          thing against them, he has undertaken to answer for them. By his own
          act, he has engaged to be responsible for them; so that if they have
          exposed themselves to God’s wrath, and to the stroke of justice, it is
          not their concern, but his, how to answer or satisfy for what they
          have done. Let there be never so much wrath that they have deserved,
          they are as safe as if they never had deserved any; because he has
          undertaken to stand for them, let it be more or less. If they are in
          Christ Jesus, the storm does of course light on him, and not on them;
          as when we are under a good shelter, the storm, that would otherwise
          come upon our heads, lights upon the shelter.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He is chosen and appointed of the Father to this work. There needs
          to be no fear nor jealousy, whether the Father will approve of this
          undertaking of Christ Jesus, whether he will accept of him as a
          surety, or whether he will be willing that his wrath should be poured
          upon his own dear Son, instead of us miserable sinners. For there was
          an agreement with him concerning it before the world was; it was a
          thing much upon God’s heart, that his Son Jesus Christ should
          undertake this work, and it was the Father that sent him into the
          world. It is as much the act of God the Father as it is of the Son.
          Therefore, when Christ was near the time of his death, he tells the
          Father that he had finished the work which he gave him to do. Christ
          is often called God’s elect, or his chosen, because he was chosen by
          the Father for his work; and God’s anointed, for the words Messiah and
          Christ signify anointed, because he is by God appointed and fitted for
          this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If we are in Christ Jesus, justice and the law have its course with
          respect to our sins, without our hurt. The foundation of the sinner’s
          fear and distress is the justice and the law of God; they are against
          him, and they are unalterable, they must have their course. Every jot
          and tittle of the law must be fulfilled, heaven and earth shall be
          destroyed, rather than justice should not take place; there is no
          possibility of sin’s escaping justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yet if the distressed trembling soul who is afraid of justice,
          would fly to Christ, he would be a safe hiding-place. Justice and the
          threatening of the law will have their course as fully, while he is
          safe and untouched, as if he were to be eternally destroyed. Christ
          bears the stroke of justice, and the curse of the law falls fully upon
          him; Christ bears all that vengeance that belongs to the sin that has
          been committed by him, and there is no need of its being borne twice
          over. His temporal sufferings, by reason of the infinite dignity of
          his person, are fully equivalent to the eternal sufferings of a mere
          creature. And then his sufferings answer for him who flees to him as
          well as if they were his own, for indeed they are his own by virtue of
          the union between Christ and him. Christ has made himself one with
          them; he is the head, and they are the members. Therefore, if Christ
          suffers for the believer, there is no need of his suffering; and what
          needs he to be afraid? His safety is not only consistent with absolute
          justice, but it is consistent with the tenor of the law. The law
          leaves fair room for such a thing as the answering of a surety. If the
          end of punishment in maintaining the authority of the law and the
          majesty of the government is fully secured by the sufferings of Christ
          as his surety, then the law of God, according to the true and fair
          interpretation of it, has its course as much in the sufferings of
          Christ, as it would have in his own sufferings. The threatening, “thou
          shalt surely die,” is properly fulfilled in the death of Christ, as it
          is fairly to be understood. Therefore if those who are afraid will go
          to Jesus Christ, they need to fear nothing from the threatening of the
          law. The threatening of the law has nothing to do with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Those who come to Christ, need not be afraid of God’s wrath for
          their sins; for God’s honour will not suffer by their escaping
          punishment and being made happy. The wounded soul is sensible that he
          has affronted the majesty of God, and looks upon God as a vindicator
          of his honour; as a jealous God that will not be mocked, an infinitely
          great God that will not bear to be affronted, that will not suffer his
          authority and majesty to be trampled on, that will not bear that his
          kindness should be abused. A view of God in this light terrifies
          awakened souls. They think how exceedingly they have sinned, how they
          have sinned against light, against frequent and long-continued calls
          and warnings; and how they have slighted mercy, and been guilty of
          turning the grace of God into lasciviousness, taking encouragement
          from God’s mercy to go on in sin against him; and they fear that God
          is so affronted at the contempt and slight which they have cast upon
          him, that he, being careful of his honour, will never forgive them,
          but will punish them. But if they go to Christ, the honour of God’s
          majesty and authority will not be in the least hurt by their being
          freed and made happy. For what Christ has done has repaired God’s
          honour to the full. It is a greater honour to God’s authority and
          majesty, that, rather than it should be wronged, so glorious a person
          would suffer what the law required. It is surely a wonderful display
          of the honour of God’s majesty, to see an infinite and eternal person
          dying for its being wronged. And then Christ by his obedience, by that
          obedience which he undertook for our sakes, has honoured God
          abundantly more than the sins of any of us have dishonoured him, how
          many soever, and how great soever. How great an honour is it to God’s
          law that so great a person is willing to submit to it, and to obey it!
          God hates our sins, but not more than he delights in Christ’s
          obedience which he performed on account. This is a sweet savour to
          him, a savour of rest. God is abundantly compensated, he desires no
          more; Christ’s righteousness is of infinite worthiness and merit.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Christ is a person so dear to the Father, that those who are in
          Christ need not be at all jealous of being accepted upon his account.
          If Christ is accepted they must of consequence be accepted, for they
          are in Christ, as members, as parts, as the same. They are the body of
          Christ, his flesh and his bones. They that are in Christ Jesus, are
          one spirit; and therefore, if God loves Christ Jesus, he must of
          necessity accept of those that are in him, and that are of him. But
          Christ is a person exceedingly dear to the Father, the Father’s love
          to the Son is really infinite. God necessarily loves the Son; God
          could as soon cease to be, as cease to love the Son. He is God’s
          elect, in whom his soul delighteth; he is his beloved Son, in whom he
          is well pleased; he loved him before the foundation of the world, and
          had infinite delight in him from all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          A terrified conscience, therefore, may have rest here, and abundant
          satisfaction that he is safe in Christ, and that there is not the
          least danger but that he shall be accepted, and that God will be at
          peace with him in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. God has given an open testimony that Christ has done and suffered
          enough, and that he is satisfied with it, by his raising him from the
          dead. Christ, when he was in his passion, was in the hands of justice,
          he was God’s prisoner for believers, and it pleased God to bruise him,
          and put him to grief, and to bring him into a low state; and when he
          raised him from the dead, he set him at liberty, whereby he declared
          that it was enough. If God was not satisfied, why did he set Christ at
          liberty so soon? he was in the hands of justice, why did not God pour
          out more wrath upon him, and hold him in the chains of darkness
          longer? God raised him up and opened the prison doors to him, because
          he desired no more. And now surely there is free admittance for all
          sinners into God’s favour through this risen Saviour, there is enough
          done, and God is satisfied; as he has declared and sealed to it by the
          resurrection of Christ, who is alive, and lives for evermore, and is
          making intercession for poor, distressed souls that come unto him.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Christ has the dispensation of safety and deliverance in his own
          hands, so that we need not fear but that, if we are united to him, we
          may be safe. God has given him all power in heaven and in earth, to
          give eternal life to whomsoever comes to him. He is made head over all
          things to the church, and the work of salvation is left with himself,
          he may save whom he pleases, and defend those that are in him by his
          own power. What greater ground of confidence could God have given us
          than that the Mediator, who died for us, and intercedes for us, should
          have committed to him the dispensation of the very thing which he died
          to purchase and for which he intercedes?
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Christ’s love, and compassion, and gracious disposition, are such
          that we may be sure he is inclined to receive all who come to him. If
          he should not do it, he would fail of his own undertaking, and also of
          his promise to the Father, and to us; and his wisdom and faithfulness
          will not allow of that. But he is so full of love and kindness that he
          is disposed to nothing but to receive and defend us, if we come to
          him. Christ is exceedingly ready to pity us, his arms are open to
          receive us, he delights to receive distressed souls that come to him,
          and to protect them; he would gather them as a hen gathereth her
          chickens under her wings; it is a work that he exceedingly rejoices
          in, because he delights in acts of love, and pity, and mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall take occasion from what now has been said, to invite those who
          are afraid of God’s wrath, to come to Christ Jesus. You are indeed in
          a dreadful condition. It is dismal to have God’s wrath impending over
          our heads, and not to know how soon it will fall upon us. And you are
          in some measure sensible that it is a dreadful condition, you are full
          of fear and trouble, and you know not where to flee for help; your
          mind is, as it were, tossed with a tempest. But how lamentable is it,
          that you should spend your life in such a condition, when Christ would
          shelter you, as a hen shelters her chickens under her wings, if you
          were but willing; and that you should live such a fearful, distressed
          life, when there is so much provision made for your safety in Christ
          Jesus!
        </p>
        <p>
          How happy would you be if your hearts were but persuaded to close with
          Jesus Christ! Then you would be out of all danger: whatever storms and
          tempests were without, you might rest securely within; you might hear
          the rushing of the wind, and the thunder roar abroad, while you are
          safe in this hiding-place. O be persuaded to hide yourself in Christ
          Jesus! What greater assurance of safety can you desire? He has
          undertaken to defend and save you, if you will come to him: he looks
          upon it as his work; he engaged in it before the world was, and he has
          given his faithful promise which he will not break; and if you will
          but make your flight there, his life shall be for yours; he will
          answer for you, you shall have nothing to do but rest quietly in him;
          you may stand still and see what the Lord will do for you. If there be
          any thing to suffer, the suffering is Christ’s, you will have nothing
          to suffer; if there be any thing to be done, the doing of it is
          Christ’s, you will have nothing to do but to stand still and behold
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will certainly be accepted of the Father if your soul lays hold of
          Jesus Christ. Christ is chosen and anointed of the Father, and sent
          forth for this very end, to save those that are in danger and fear;
          and he is greatly beloved of God, even infinitely, and he will accept
          of those that are in him. Justice and the law will not be against you,
          if you are in Christ; that threatening, “in the day that thou eatest
          thou shalt die,” in the proper sense of it, will not touch you. The
          majesty and honour of God are not against you. You need not be afraid
          but that you shall be justified, if you come to him; there is an act
          of justification already past and declared for all who come to Christ
          by the resurrection of Christ, and as soon as ever you come, you are
          by that declared free. If you come to Christ it will be a sure sign
          that Christ loved you from all eternity, and that he died for you; and
          you may be sure if he died for you, he will not lose the end of his
          death, for the dispensation of life is committed unto him.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need not, therefore, continue in so dangerous a condition; there
          is help for you. You need not stand out in the storm so long, as there
          is so good a shelter near you, whose doors are open to receive you. O
          make haste, therefore, unto that man who is a hiding-place from the
          wind, and a covert from the tempest!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let this truth also cause believers more to prize the Lord Jesus
          Christ. Consider that it is he, and he only, who defends you from
          wrath, and that he is a safe defence; your defence is a high tower;
          your city of refuge is impregnable. There is no rock like your rock.
          There is none like Christ, “the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the
          heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky; the eternal God
          is thy refuge, and underneath are everlasting arms.” He in whom you
          trust is a buckler to all that trust in him. O prize that Saviour, who
          keeps your soul in safety, while thousands of others are carried away
          by the fury of God’s anger, and are tossed with raging and burning
          tempests in hell! O, how much better is your case than theirs! and to
          whom is it owing but to the Lord Jesus Christ? Remember what was once
          your case, and what it is now, and prize Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And let those christians who are in doubts and fears concerning their
          condition, renewedly fly to Jesus Christ, who is a hiding-place from
          the wind, and a covert from the tempest. Most Christians are at times
          afraid whether they shall not miscarry at last. Such doubtings are
          always through some want of the exercise of faith, and the best remedy
          for them is a renewed resort of the soul to this hiding-place; the
          same act which at first gave comfort and peace, will give peace again.
          They that clearly see the sufficiency of Christ, and the safety of
          committing themselves to him to save them from what they fear, will
          rest in it that Christ will defend them; be directed therefore at such
          times to do as the psalmist. Psalm 56:3, 4. “What time I am afraid, I
          will trust in thee. In God I will praise his word; in God I have put
          my trust: I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.”
        </p>
        <p>
          II. There is provision in Christ for the satisfaction and full
          contentment of the needy and thirsty soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the sense of those words in the text, “as rivers of water in a
          dry place,” in a dry and parched wilderness, where there is a great
          want of water, and where travellers are ready to be destroyed with
          thirst, such as was that wilderness in which the children of Israel
          wandered. This comparison is used elsewhere in the Scriptures. Psalm
          63:1. “O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul
          thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty
          land, where no water is.” Psalm 143:6. “I stretch forth my hands unto
          thee; my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land.” Those who
          travel in such a land, who wander in such a wilderness, are in extreme
          need of water; they are ready to perish for the want of it; and thus
          they have a great thirst and longing for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is said that Christ is a river of water, because there is such a
          fulness in him, so plentiful a provision for the satisfaction of the
          needy and longing soul. When one is extremely thirsty, though it is
          not a small draught of water will satisfy him, yet when he comes to a
          river, he finds a fulness, there he may drink full draughts. Christ is
          like a river, in that he has a sufficiency not only for one thirsty
          soul, but by supplying him the fountain is not lessened; there is not
          the less afforded to those who come afterwards. A thirsty man does not
          sensibly lessen a river by quenching his thirst.<br />
          Christ is like a river in another respect. A river is continually
          flowing, there are fresh supplies of water coming from the
          fountain-head continually, so that a man may live by it, and be
          supplied with water all his life. So Christ is an ever-flowing
          fountain; he is continually supplying his people, and the fountain is
          not spent. They who live upon Christ, may have fresh supplies from him
          to all eternity; they may have an increase of blessedness that is new,
          and new still, and which never will come to an end.
        </p>
        <p>In illustrating this second proposition, I shall inquire,</p>
        <p>
          1. What it is that the soul of every man naturally and necessarily
          craves.
        </p>
        <p>
          First. The soul of every man necessarily craves happiness. This is an
          universal appetite of human nature, that is alike in the good and the
          bad; it is as universal as the very essence of the soul, because it
          necessarily and immediately flows from that essence. It is not only
          natural to all mankind, but to the angels; it is universal among all
          reasonable, intelligent beings, in heaven, earth, or hell, because it
          flows necessarily from an intelligent nature. There is no rational
          being, nor can there be any, without a love and desire of happiness.
          It is impossible that there should be any creature made that should
          love misery, or not love happiness, since it implies a manifest
          contradiction; for the very notion of misery is to be in a state that
          nature abhors, and the notion of happiness, is to be in such a state
          as is most agreeable to nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, this craving of happiness must be insuperable, and what
          never can be changed; it never can be overcome, or in any way abated.
          Young and old love happiness alike, and good and bad, wise and unwise;
          though there is a great variety as to men’s ideas of happiness. Some
          think it is to be found in one thing, and some in another; yet, as to
          the desire of happiness in general, there is no variety. There are
          particular appetites that may be restrained, and kept under, and
          conquered, but this general appetite for happiness nev-er can be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly. The soul of every man craves a happiness that is equal to
          the capacity of his nature. The soul of man is like a vessel; the
          capacity of the soul is as the largeness or contents of the vessel.
          And therefore, if man has much pleasure and happiness, yet if the
          vessel is not full, the craving will not cease. Every creature is
          restless till it enjoys what is equal to the capacity of its nature.
          Thus we may observe in the brutes; when they have that which is
          suitable to their nature, and proportional to their capacity, they are
          contented. Man is of such a nature, that he is capable of an
          exceedingly great degree of happiness; he is made of a vastly higher
          nature than the brutes, and therefore he must have vastly higher
          happiness to satisfy. The pleasures of the outward senses which
          content the beasts, will not content man. He has other faculties of a
          higher nature that stand in need of something to fill them; if the
          sense be satiated, yet if the faculties of the soul are not filled,
          man will be in a craving restless state.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is more especially by reason of the faculty of understanding that
          the soul is capable of so great a happiness, and desires so much. The
          understanding is an exceedingly extensive faculty; it extends itself
          beyond the limits of earth, beyond the limits of the creation. As we
          are capable of understanding immensely more than we do understand, who
          can tell how far the understanding of men is capable of stretching
          itself? and as the understanding enlarges, the desire will enlarge
          with it. It must therefore be an incomprehensible object that must
          satisfy the soul; it will never be contented with that, and that only,
          to which it can see an end, it will never be satisfied with that
          happiness to which it can find a bottom. A man may seem to take
          contentment for a little while in a finite object, but after he has
          had a little experience, he finds that he wants something besides.
          This is very apparent from the experience of this restless craving
          world. Every one is inquiring, Who will show us any good?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Men in their fallen state, are in very great want of this
          happiness. They were once in the enjoyment of it, but mankind are sunk
          to a very low estate; we are naturally poor, destitute creatures. We
          came naked into the world, and our souls as well as our bodies are in
          a wretched, miserable condition; we are so far from having food to eat
          suitable to our nature, that we are greedy after the husks which the
          swine do eat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The poverty of man in a natural condition, appears in his
          discontented, craving spirit; it shows that the soul is very empty,
          when, like the horse-leech, it cries, “Give, give, and saith not, It
          is enough.” We are naturally like the prodigal, for we once were rich,
          but we departed from our father’s house, and have squandered away our
          wealth, and are become poor, hungry, famishing wretches. Men in a
          natural condition may find something to gratify their senses, but
          there is nothing to feed the soul; that more noble and more essential
          part perishes for lack of food. They may fare sumptuously every day,
          they may pamper their bodies, but the soul cannot be fed from a
          sumptuous table; they may drink wine in bowls, yet the spiritual part
          is not refreshed. The superior faculties want to be supplied as well
          as the inferior. True poverty and true misery consist in the want of
          those things of which our spiritual part stands in need.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Those sinners who are thoroughly awakened, are sensible of their
          great want. Multitudes of men are not sensible of their miserable,
          needy condition. There are many who are thus poor, and think
          themselves rich, and increased in goods. Indeed there are no natural
          men that have true contentment: they are all restless, and crying,
          “Who will show us any good?” but multitudes are not sensible how
          exceedingly necessitous is their condition. But the thoroughly
          awakened soul sees that he is very far from true happiness, that those
          things which he possesses will never make him happy; that for all his
          outward possessions he is wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
          blind, and naked. He becomes sensible of the short continuance and
          uncertainty of those things, and their insufficiency to satisfy a
          troubled conscience. He wants something else to give him peace and
          ease. If you would tell him that he might have a kingdom, it would not
          quiet him; he desires to have his sins pardoned, and to be at peace
          with his Judge. He is poor, and he becomes as a beggar; he comes and
          cries for help. He does not thirst, because he as yet sees where true
          happiness is to be found, but because he sees that he has it not, and
          cannot find it. He is without comfort, and does not know where to find
          it, but he longs for it. O, what would he not give, if he could find
          some satisfying peace and comfort!
        </p>
        <p>
          Such are those hungry, thirsty souls that Christ so often invites to
          come to him. Isaiah 55:1, 2. “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to
          the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea,
          come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do
          ye spend money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that
          which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that
          which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.” “If any
          man thirst, let him come unto me and drink; and he that is athirst,
          let him come and take of the water of life freely.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. There is in Christ Jesus provision for the full satisfaction and
          contentment of such as these.
        </p>
        <p>
          First. The excellency of Christ is such, that the discovery of it is
          exceedingly contenting and satisfying to the soul. The inquiry of the
          soul is after that which is most excellent. The carnal soul imagines
          that earthly things are excellent; one thinks riches most excellent,
          another has the highest esteem of honour, and to another carnal
          pleasure appears the most excellent; but the soul cannot find
          contentment in any of these things, because it soon finds an end to
          their excellency. Worldly men imagine, that there is true excellency
          and true happiness in those things which they are pursuing. They think
          that if they could but obtain them, they should be happy; and when
          they obtain them, and cannot find happiness, they look for happiness
          in something else, and are still upon the pursuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Christ Jesus has true excellency, and so great excellency, that
          when they come to see it they look no further, but the mind rests
          there. It sees a transcendent glory and an ineffable sweetness in him;
          it sees that till now it has been pursuing shadows, but that now it
          has found the substance; that before it had been seeking happiness in
          the stream, but that now it has found the ocean. The excellency of
          Christ is an object adequate to the natural cravings of the soul, and
          is sufficient to fill the capacity. It is an infinite excellency, such
          an one as the mind desires, in which it can find no bounds; and the
          more the mind is used to it, the more excellent it appears. Every new
          discovery makes this beauty appear more ravishing, and the mind sees
          no end; here is room enough for the mind to go deeper and deeper, and
          never come to the bottom. The soul is exceedingly ravished when it
          first looks on this beauty, and it is never weary of it. The mind
          never has any satiety, but Christ’s excellency is always fresh and
          new, and tends as much to delight, after it has been seen a thousand
          or ten thousand years, as when it was seen the first moment. The
          excellency of Christ is an object suited to the superior faculties of
          man, it is suited to entertain the faculty of reason and
          understanding, and there is nothing so worthy about which the
          understanding can be employed as this excellency; no other object is
          so great, noble, and exalted.
        </p>
        <p>
          This excellency of Jesus Christ is the suitable food of the rational
          soul. The soul that comes to Christ, feeds upon this, and lives upon
          it; it is that bread which came down from heaven, of which he that
          eats shall not die; it is angels’ food, it is that wine and milk that
          is given without money, and without price. This is that fatness in
          which the believing soul delights itself; here the longing soul may be
          satisfied, and the hungry soul may be filled with goodness. The
          delight and contentment that is to be found here, passeth
          understanding, and is unspeakable and full of glory. It is impossible
          for those who have tasted of this fountain, and know the sweetness of
          it, ever to forsake it. The soul has found the river of water of life,
          and it desires no other drink; it has found the tree of life, and it
          desires no other fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly. The manifestation of the love of Christ gives the soul
          abundant contentment. This love of Christ is exceedingly sweet and
          satisfying, it is better than life, because it is the love of a person
          of such dignity and excellency. The sweetness of his love depends very
          much upon the greatness of his excellency; so much the more lovely the
          person, so much the more desirable is his love. How sweet must the
          love of that person be, who is the eternal Son of God, who is of equal
          dignity with the Father! How great a happiness must it be to be the
          object of the love of him who is the Creator of the world, and by whom
          all things consist, and who is exalted at God’s right hand, and made
          head over principalities and powers in heavenly places, who has all
          things put under his feet, and is King of kings and Lord of lords, and
          is the brightness of the Father’s glory! Surely to be beloved by him,
          is enough to satisfy the soul of a worm of the dust.
        </p>
        <p>
          This love of Christ is also exceedingly sweet and satisfying from the
          greatness of it; it is a dying love; such love as never was before
          seen, and such as no other can parallel. There have been instances of
          very great love between one earthly friend and another; there was a
          surpassing love between David and Jonathan. But there never was any
          such love as Christ has towards believers. The satisfying nature of
          this love arises also from the sweet fruits of it. Those precious
          benefits that Christ bestows upon his people, and those precious
          promises which he has given them, are the fruit of this love; joy and
          hope are the constant streams that flow from this fountain, from the
          love of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly. There is provision for the satisfaction and contentment of
          the thirsty longing soul in Christ, as he is the way to the Father;
          not only from the fulness of excellency and grace which he has in his
          own person, but as by him we may come to God, may be reconciled to
          him, and may be made happy in his favour and love. The poverty and
          want of the soul in its natural state consist in its being separated
          from God, for God is the riches and the happiness of the creature. But
          we naturally are alienated from God; and God is alienated from us, our
          Maker is not at peace with us. But in Christ there is a way for a free
          communication between God and us; for us to come to God, and for God
          to communicate himself to us by his Spirit. John 14:6. “Jesus saith
          unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh
          unto the Father but by me.” Ephesians 2:13, 18, 19. “But now in Christ
          Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of
          Christ. For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
          Father. Now, therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
          fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God.” Christ
          by being thus the way to the Father, is the way to true happiness and
          contentment. John 10:9. “I am the door: by me, if any man enter in, he
          shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.” Hence I
          would take occasion to invite needy, thirsty souls to come to Jesus.
          “In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried,
          saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.” You that
          have not yet come to Christ, are in a poor, necessitous condition; you
          are in a parched wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land. And if you are
          thoroughly awakened, you are sensible that you are in distress and
          ready to faint for want of something to satisfy your souls. Come to
          him who is “as rivers of water in a dry place.” There are plenty and
          fulness in him; he is like a river that is always flowing, you may
          live by it for ever, and never be in want. Come to him who has such
          excellency as is sufficient to give full contentment to your soul, who
          is a person of transcendent glory, and ineffable beauty, where you may
          entertain the view of your soul for ever without weariness, and
          without being cloyed. Accept of the offered love of him who is the
          only-begotten Son of God, and his elect, in whom his soul delighteth.
          Through Christ, come to God the Father, from whom you have departed by
          sin. He is the way, the truth, and the life; he is the door, by which
          if any man enters he shall be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. There are quiet rest and sweet refreshment in Christ Jesus, for
          those that are weary. He is “as the shadow of a great rock in a weary
          land.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The comparison that is used in the text is very beautiful and very
          significative. The dry, barren, and scorched wilderness of Arabia is a
          very lively representation of the misery that men have brought upon
          themselves by sin. It is destitute of any inhabitants but lions and
          tigers and fiery serpents; it is barren and parched, and without any
          river or spring; it is a land of drought, wherein there is seldom any
          rain, a land exceedingly hot and uncomfortable. The scorching sunbeams
          that are ready to consume the spirits of travellers, are a fit
          representation of terror of conscience, and the inward sense of God’s
          displeasure. And there being no other shade in which travellers may
          rest, but only here and there that of a great rock, it is a fit
          representation of Jesus Christ, who came to redeem us from our misery.
          Christ is often compared to a rock, because he is a sure foundation to
          builders, and because he is a sure bulwark and defence. They who dwell
          upon the top of a rock, dwell in a most defensible place; we read of
          those whose habitation is the munitions of rocks. He may also be
          compared to a rock, as he is everlasting and unchangeable. A great
          rock remains stedfast, unmoved, and unbroken by winds and storms from
          age to age; and therefore God chose a rock to be an emblem of Christ
          in the wilderness, when he caused water to issue forth for the
          children of Israel; and the shadow of a great rock is a most fit
          representation of the refreshment given to weary souls by Jesus
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. There is quiet rest and full refreshment in Christ for sinners that
          are weary and heavy laden with sin. Sin is the most evil and odious
          thing, as well as the most mischievous and fatal; it is the most
          mortal poison; it, above all things, hazards life, and endangers the
          soul, exposes to the loss of all happiness, and to the suffering of
          all misery, and brings the wrath of God. All men have this dreadful
          evil hanging about them, and cleaving fast to the soul, and ruling
          over it, and keeping it in possession, and under absolute command: it
          hangs like a viper to the heart, or rather holds it as a lion does his
          prey.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yet there are multitudes, who are not sensible of their misery.
          They are in such a sleep that they are not very unquiet in this
          condition, it is not very burthensome to them, they are so sottish
          that they do not know what is their state, and what is like to become
          of them. But there are others who have their sense so far restored to
          them that they feel the pain, and see the approaching destruction, and
          sin lies like a heavy load upon their hearts; it is a load that lies
          upon them day and night, they cannot lay it down to rest themselves,
          but it continually oppresses them. It is bound fast unto them, and is
          ready to sink them down; it is a continual labour of heart, to support
          itself under this burden. Thus we read of them “that labour, and are
          heavy laden.” Or rather, it is like the scorching heat in a dry
          wilderness, where the sun beats and burns all the day long; where they
          have nothing to defend them; where they can find no shade to refresh
          themselves. If they lay themselves down to rest, it is like lying down
          in the hot sands, where there is nothing to keep off the heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here it may be proper to inquire who are weary and heavy laden with
          sin; and in what sense a sinner may be weary and burdened with sin.
          Sinners are not wearied with sin from any dislike to it, or dislike of
          it. There is no sinner that is burdened with sin in the sense in which
          a godly man carries his indwelling sin, as his daily and greatest
          burden, because he loathes it, and longs to get rid of it; he would
          fain be at a great distance from it, and have nothing more to do with
          it; he is ready to cry out as Paul did, “O wretched man that I am! who
          shall deliver me from the body of this death?” The unregenerate man
          has nothing of this nature, for sin is yet his delight, he dearly
          loves it. If he be under convictions, his love to sin in general is
          not mortified, he loves it as well as ever, he hides it still as a
          sweet morsel under his tongue.<br />
          But there is a difference between being weary and burdened with sin,
          and being weary of sin. Awakened sinners are weary with sin, but not
          properly weary of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, they are only weary of the guilt of sin, the guilt that
          cleaves to their consciences is that great burden. God has put the
          sense of feeling into their consciences, that were before as seared
          flesh, and it is guilt that pains them. The filthiness of sin and its
          evil nature, as it is an offence to a holy, gracious, and glorious
          God, is not a burden to them. But it is the connexion between sin and
          punishment, between sin and God’s wrath, that makes it a burden. Their
          consciences are heavy laden with guilt, which is an obligation to
          punishment; they see the threatening and curse of the law joined to
          their sins, and see that the justice of God and his vengeance are
          against them. They are burdened with their sins, not because there is
          any odiousness in them, but because there is hell in them. This is the
          sting of sin, whereby it stings the conscience, and distresses and
          wearies the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guilt of such and such great sins is upon the soul, and the man
          sees no way to get rid of it, but he has wearisome days and wearisome
          nights; it makes him ready sometimes to say as the psalmist did, “O
          that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away and be at
          rest. Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. I
          would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.” But when
          sinners come to Christ, he takes away that which was their burden, or
          their sin and guilt, that which was so heavy upon their hearts, that
          so distressed their minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          First. He takes away the guilt of sin, from which the soul before saw
          no way how it was possible to be freed, and which, if it was not
          removed, led to eternal destruction. When the sinner comes to Christ,
          it is all at once taken away, and the soul is left free, it is
          lightened of its burden, it is delivered from its bondage, and is like
          a bird escaped from the snare of the fowler. The soul sees in Christ a
          way to peace with God, and a way by which the law may be answered, and
          justice satisfied, and yet he may escape; a wonderful way indeed, but
          yet a certain and a glorious one. And what rest does it give to the
          weary soul to see itself thus delivered, that the foundation of its
          anxieties and fears is wholly removed, and that God’s wrath ceases,
          that it is brought into a state of peace with God, and that there is
          no more occasion to fear hell, but that it is for ever safe! How
          refreshing is it to the soul to be at once thus delivered of that
          which was so much its trouble and terror, and to be eased of that
          which was so much its burden! This is like coming to a cool shade
          after one has been travelling in a dry and hot wilderness, and almost
          fainting under the scorching heat. And then Christ also takes away sin
          itself, and mortifies that root of bitterness which is the cause of
          all the inward tumults and disquietudes that are in the mind, that
          make it like the troubled sea that cannot rest, and leaves it all
          calm. When guilt is taken away and sin is mortified, then the
          foundation of fear, and trouble, and pain is removed, and the soul is
          left in peace and serenity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly. Christ puts strength and a principle of new life into the
          weary soul that comes to him. The sinner, before he comes to Christ,
          is as a sick man that is weakened and brought low, and whose nature is
          consumed by some strong distemper: he is full of pain, and so weak
          that he cannot walk nor stand. Therefore, Christ is compared to a
          physician. “But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be
          whole, need not a physician, but they that are sick.” When he comes
          and speaks the word, he puts a principle of life into him that was
          before as dead: he gives a principle of spiritual life and the
          beginning of eternal life; he invigorates the mind with a
          communication of his own life and strength, and renews the nature and
          creates it again, and makes the man to be a new creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that the fainting, sinking spirits are now revived, and this
          principle of spiritual life is a continual spring of refreshment, like
          a well of living water. “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall
          give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him
          shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.”
          Christ gives his Spirit, that calms the mind, and is like a refreshing
          breeze of wind. He gives that strength whereby he lifts up the hands
          that hang down, and strengthens the feeble knees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly. Christ gives to those who come to him such comfort and
          pleasure as are enough to make them forget all their former labour and
          travail. A little of true peace, a little of the joys of the
          manifested love of Christ, and a little of the true and holy hope of
          eternal life, are enough to compensate for all that toil and
          weariness, and to erase the remembrance of it from the mind. That
          peace which results from true faith passes understanding, and that joy
          is joy unspeakable. There is something peculiarly sweet and refreshing
          in this joy, that is not in other joys; and what can more effectually
          support the mind, or give a more rational ground of rejoicing, than a
          prospect of eternal glory in the enjoyment of God from God’s own
          promise in Christ? If we come to Christ, we may not only be refreshed
          by resting in his shadow, but by eating his fruit: these things are
          the fruits of this tree. “I sat down under his shadow with great
          delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.”<br />
          Before proceeding to the next particular of this proposition, I would
          apply myself to those that are weary; to move them to repose
          themselves under Christ’s shadow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great trouble of such a state, one would think, should be a motive
          to you to accept of an offer of relief, and remedy. You are weary, and
          doubtless would be glad to be at rest; but here you are to consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          First. That there is no remedy but in Jesus Christ; there is nothing
          else will give you true quietness. If you could fly into heaven, you
          would not find it there; if you should take the wings of the morning,
          and dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth, in some solitary place
          in the wilderness, you could not fly from your burden. So that if you
          do not come to Christ, you must either continue still weary and
          burdened, or, which is worse, you must return to your old dead sleep,
          to a state of stupidity; and not only so, but you must be
          everlastingly wearied with God’s wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second. Consider that Christ is a remedy at hand. You need not wish
          for the wings of a dove that you may fly afar off, and be at rest, but
          Christ is nigh at hand, if you were but sensible of it. Romans 10:6,
          7, 8. “But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
          Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to
          bring Christ down from above:) or, Who shall descend into the deep?
          (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) But what saith it?
          The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is,
          the word of faith which we preach.” There is no need of doing any
          great work to come at this rest; the way is plain to it; it is but
          going to it, it is but sitting down under Christ’s shadow. Christ
          requires no money to purchase rest of him, he calls to us to come
          freely, and for nothing. If we are poor and have no money, we may
          come. Christ sent out his servants to invite the poor, the maimed, the
          halt, and the blind. Christ does not want to be hired to accept of
          you, and to give you rest. It is his work as Mediator to give rest to
          the weary, it is the work that he was anointed for, and in which he
          delights. “The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord
          hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me
          to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,
          and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Third. Christ is not only a remedy for your weariness and trouble, but
          he will give you an abundance of the contrary, joy and delight. They
          who come to Christ, do no only come to a resting-place after they have
          been wandering in a wilderness, but they come to a banqueting-house
          where they may rest, and where they may feast. They may cease from
          their former troubles and toils, and they may enter upon a course of
          delights and spiritual joys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ not only delivers from fears of hell and of wrath, but he gives
          hopes of heaven, and the enjoyment of God’s love. He delivers from
          inward tumults and inward pain from that guilt of conscience which is
          as a worm gnawing within, and he gives delight and inward glory. He
          brings us out of a wilderness of pits, and drought, and fiery flying
          spirits; and he brings us into a pleasant land, a land flowing with
          milk and honey. He delivers us out of prison, and lifts us off from
          the dunghill, and he sets us among princes, and causes us to inherit
          the throne of glory. Wherefore, if any one is weary, if any is in
          prison, if any one is in captivity, if any one is in the wilderness,
          let him come to the blessed Jesus, who is as the shadow of a great
          rock in a weary land. Delay not, arise and come away.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There are quiet rest and sweet refreshment in Christ for God’s
          people that are weary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The saints themselves, while they remain in this imperfect state, and
          have so much remains of sin in their hearts, are liable still to many
          troubles and sorrows, and much weariness, and have often need to
          resort anew unto Jesus Christ for rest. I shall mention three cases
          wherein Christ is a sufficient remedy.
        </p>
        <p>
          First. There is rest and sweet refreshment in Christ for those that
          are wearied with persecutions. It has been the lot of God’s church in
          this world for the most part to be persecuted. It has had now and then
          some lucid intervals of peace and outward prosperity, but generally it
          has been otherwise. This has accorded with the first prophecy
          concerning Christ; “I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and
          between thy seed and her seed.” Those two seeds have been at enmity
          ever since the time of Abel. Satan has borne great malice against the
          church of God, and so have those that are his seed. And oftentimes
          God’s people have been persecuted to an extreme degree, have been put
          to the most exquisite torments that wit or art could devise, and
          thousands of them have been tormented to death.
        </p>
        <p>
          But even in such a case there are rest and refreshment to be found in
          Christ Jesus. When their cruel enemies have given them no rest in this
          world; when, as oftentimes has been the case, they could not flee, nor
          in any way avoid the rage of their adversaries, but many of them have
          been tormented gradually from day to day, that their torments might be
          lengthened; still rest has been found even then in Christ. It has been
          often found by experience; the martyrs have often showed plainly that
          the peace and calm of their minds were undisturbed in the midst of the
          greatest bodily torment, and have sometimes rejoiced and sung praises
          upon the rack and in the fire. If Christ is pleased to send forth his
          Spirit to manifest his love, and speaks friendly to the soul, it will
          support it even in the greatest outward torment that man can inflict.
          Christ is the joy of the soul, and if the soul be but rejoiced and
          filled with divine light, such joy no man can take away; whatever
          outward misery there be, the spirit will sustain it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly. There is in Christ rest for God’s people, when exercised
          with afflictions. If a person labour under great bodily weakness, or
          under some disease that causes frequent and strong pains, such things
          will tire out so feeble a creature as man. It may to such an one be a
          comfort and an effectual support to think, that he has a Mediator, who
          knows by experience what pain is; who by his pain has purchased
          eternal ease and pleasure for him; and who will make his brief
          sufferings to work out a far more exceeding delight, to be bestowed
          when he shall rest from his labours and sorrows.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a person be brought into great straits as to outward subsistence,
          and poverty brings abundance of difficulties and extremities; yet it
          may be a supporting, refreshing consideration to such an one to think,
          that he has a compassionate Savior, who when upon earth, was so poor
          that he had not where to lay his head, and who became poor to make him
          rich, and purchased for him durable riches, and will make his poverty
          work out an exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          If God in his providence calls his people to mourn over lost
          relations, and if he repeats his stroke and takes away one after
          another of those that were dear to him; it is a supporting, refreshing
          consideration to think, that Christ has declared that he will be in
          stead of all relations unto those who trust in him. They are as his
          mother, and sister, and brother; he has taken them into a very near
          relation to himself: and in every other afflictive providence, it is a
          great comfort to a believing soul to think that he has an intercessor
          with God, that by him he can have access with confidence to the throne
          of grace, and that in Christ we have so many great and precious
          promises, that all things shall work together for good, and shall
          issue in eternal blessedness. God’s people, whenever they are scorched
          by afflictions as by hot sun-beams, may resort to him, who is as a
          shadow of a great rock, and be effectually sheltered, and sweetly
          refreshed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly. There is in Christ quiet rest and sweet refreshment for God’s
          people, when wearied with the buffetings of Satan. The devil, that
          malicious enemy of God and man, does whatever lies in his power to
          darken and hinder, and tempt God’s people, and render their lives
          uncomfortable. Often he raises needless and groundless scruples, and
          casts in doubts, and fills the mind with such fear as is tormenting,
          and tends to hinder them exceedingly in the christian course; and he
          often raises mists and clouds of darkness, and stirs up corruption,
          and thereby fills the mind with concern and anguish, and sometimes
          wearies out the soul. So that they may say as the psalmist; “Many
          bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
          They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring
          lion.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In such a case if the soul flies to Jesus Christ, they may find rest
          in him, for he came into the world to destroy Satan, and to rescue
          souls out of his hands. And he has all things put under his feet,
          whether they be things in heaven, or things on earth, or things in
          hell, and therefore he can restrain Satan when he pleases. And that he
          is doubtless ready enough to pity us under such temptations, we may be
          assured, for he has been tempted and buffeted by Satan as well as we.
          He is able to succour those that are tempted, and he has promised that
          the will subdue Satan under his people’s feet. Let God’s people
          therefore, when they are exercised with any of those kinds of
          weariness, make their resort unto Jesus Christ for refuge and rest.
        </p>
        <p>REFLECTIONS</p>
        <p>
          1. We may here see great reason to admire the goodness and grace of
          God to us in our low estate, that he has so provided for our help and
          relief. We are by our own sin against God plunged into all sort of
          evil, and God has provided a remedy for us against every sort of evil,
          he has left us helpless in no calamity. We by our sin have exposed
          ourselves to wrath, to a vindictive justice; but God has done very
          great things that we might be saved from that wrath; he has been at
          infinite cost that the law might be answered without our suffering. We
          by our sins have exposed ourselves to terror of conscience, in
          expectation of the dreadful storm of God’s wrath; but God has provided
          for us a hiding-place from the storm, he bids us enter into his
          chambers, and hide ourselves from indignation. We by sin have made
          ourselves poor, needy creatures; but God has provided for us gold
          tried in the fire. We by sin have made ourselves naked; and when he
          passed by, he took notice of our want, and has provided us white
          raiment that we may be clothed. We have made ourselves blind, and God
          in mercy to us has provided eye-salve, that we may see. We have
          deprived ourselves of all spiritual food; we are like the prodigal son
          that perished with hunger, and would gladly have filled his belly with
          husks. God has taken notice of this our condition, and has provided
          for us a feast of fat things, and has sent forth his servants to
          invite the poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind. We by sin have
          brought ourselves into a dry and thirsty wilderness; but God was
          merciful, and took notice of our condition, and has provided for us
          rivers of water, water out of the rock. We by sin have brought upon
          ourselves a miserable slavery and bondage; God has made provision for
          our liberty. We have exposed ourselves to weariness; God has provided
          a resting-place for us. We by sin have exposed ourselves to many
          outward troubles and afflictions; God has pitied us, and in Christ has
          provided true comfort for us. We have exposed ourselves to our grand
          enemy, even Satan, to be tempted and buffeted by him; God has pitied,
          and has provided for us a Savior and Captain of salvation, who has
          overcome Satan, and is able to deliver us. Thus God has in Christ
          provided sufficiently for our help in all kinds of evils.
        </p>
        <p>
          How ought we to bless God for this abundant provision he has made for
          us, poor and sinful as we were, who were so undeserving and so
          ungrateful. He made no such provision for the fallen angels, who are
          left without remedy in all the woes and miseries into which they are
          plunged.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We should admire the love of Christ to men, that he has thus given
          himself to be the remedy for all their evil, and a fountain of all
          good. Christ has given himself to us, to be all things to us that we
          need. We want clothing, and Christ does not only give us clothing, but
          he gives himself to be our clothing, that we might put him on.
          Galatians 3:27. “For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ
          have put on Christ.” Romans 13:14. “But put ye on the Lord Jesus
          Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts
          thereof.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We want food, and Christ has given himself to be our food; he has
          given his own flesh to be our meat, and his blood to be our drink, to
          nourish our soul. Thus Christ tells us that he is the bread which came
          down from heaven, and the bread of life. “I am that bread of life.
          Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is
          the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof,
          and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any
          man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever; and the bread that I
          will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”
          In order to our eating of his flesh, it was necessary that he should
          be slain, as the sacrifices must be slain before they could be eaten;
          and such was Christ’s love to us, that he consented to be slain, he
          went as a sheep to the slaughter, that he might give us his flesh to
          be food for our poor, famishing souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are in need of a habitation; we by sin have, as it were, turned
          ourselves out of house and home; Christ has given himself to be the
          habitation of his people. Psalm 90:1. “Lord, thou has been our
          dwelling-place in all generations.” It is promised to God’s people
          that they should dwell in the temple of God for ever, and should go no
          more out; and we are told that Christ is the temple of the new
          Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ gives himself to his people to be all things to them that they
          need, and all things that make for their happiness. Colossians 3:11.
          “Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
          uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bond, nor free; but Christ is
          all, and in all.” And that he might be so, he has refused nothing that
          is needful to prepare him to be so.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it was needful that he should be incarnate, he refused it not,
          but became man, and appeared in the form of a servant. When it was
          needful that he should be slain, he refused it not, but gave himself
          for us, and gave himself to us upon the cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is love for us to admire, for us to praise, and for us to rejoice
          in, with joy that is full of glory for ever.
