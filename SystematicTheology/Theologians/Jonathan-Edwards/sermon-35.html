        <h2>Christ’s Agony – Luke 22:44</h2>
        <p class="title">
          Luke 22:44, “And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly, and his
          sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.”
        </p>
        <p>
          OUR Lord Jesus Christ, in his original nature, was infinitely above
          all suffering, for he was “God over all, blessed for evermore;” but,
          when he became man, he was not only capable of suffering, but partook
          of that nature that is remarkably feeble and exposed to suffering. The
          human nature, on account of its weakness, is in Scripture compared to
          the grass of the field, which easily withers and decays. So it is
          compared to a leaf; and to the dry stubble; and to a blast of wind:
          and the nature of feeble man is said to be but dust and ashes, to have
          its foundation in the dust, and to be crushed before the moth. It was
          this nature, with all its weakness and exposedness to sufferings,
          which Christ, who is the Lord God omnipotent, took upon him. He did
          not take the human nature on him in its first, most perfect and
          vigorous state, but in that feeble forlorn state which it is in since
          the fall; and therefore Christ is called “a tender plant,” and “a root
          out of a dry ground.” Isa. 53:2. “For he shall grow up before him as a
          tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor
          comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we
          should desire him.” Thus, as Christ’s principal errand into the world
          was suffering, so, agreeably to that errand, he came with such a
          nature and in such circumstances, as most made way for his suffering;
          so his whole life was filled up with suffering, he began to suffer in
          his infancy, but his suffering increased the more he drew near to the
          close of his life. His suffering after his public ministry began, was
          probably much greater than before; and the latter part of the time of
          his public ministry seems to have been distinguished by suffering. The
          longer Christ lived in the world, the more men saw and heard of him,
          the more they hated him. His enemies were more and more enraged by the
          continuance of the opposition that he made to their lusts; and the
          devil having been often baffled by him, grew more and more enraged,
          and strengthened the battle more and more against him: so that the
          cloud over Christ’s head grew darker and darker, as long as he lived
          in the world, till it was in its greatest blackness when he hung upon
          the cross and cried out, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!
          Before this, it was exceedingly dark, in the time of his agony in the
          garden; of which we have an account in the words now read; and which I
          propose to make the subject of my present discourse. The word agony
          properly signifies an earnest strife, such as is witnessed in
          wrestling, running, or fighting. And therefore in Luke 13:24. “Strive
          to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to
          enter in, and shall not be able;” the word in the original, translated
          strive, is agwnizesqe . “Agonize, to enter in at the strait gate.” The
          word is especially used for that sort of strife, which in those days
          was exhibited in the Olympic games, in which men strove for the
          mastery in running, wrestling, and other such kinds of exercises; and
          a prize was set up that was bestowed on the conqueror. Those, who thus
          contended, were, in the language then in use, said to agonize. Thus
          the apostle in his epistle to the Christians of Corinth, a city of
          Greece, where such games were annually exhibited, says in allusion to
          the strivings of the combatants, “And every man that striveth for the
          mastery,” in the original, every one that agonizeth, “is temperate in
          all things.” The place where those games were held was called Agwn ,
          or the place of agony; and the word is particularly used in Scripture
          for that striving in earnest prayer wherein persons wrestle with
          God:they are said to agonize, or to be in agony, in prayer. So the
          word is used Rom. 15:30. “Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord
          Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive
          together with me in your prayers to God for me:” in the original
          sunagwnizesqai moi , that ye agonize together with me. So Col. 4:12.
          “Always labouring fervently for you in prayer, that ye may stand
          perfect and complete in all the will of God:” in the original agwnizwn
          agonizing for you. So that when it is said in the text that Christ was
          in an agony, the meaning is, that his soul was in a great and earnest
          strife and conflict. It was so in two respects:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. As his soul was in a great and sore conflict with those terrible
          and amazing views and apprehensions which he then had.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As he was at the same time in great labour and earnest strife with
          God in prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I propose therefore, in discoursing on the subject of Christ’s agony,
          distinctly to unfold it, under these two propositions,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That the soul of Christ in his agony in the garden had a sore
          conflict with those terrible and amazing views and apprehensions, of
          which he was then the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That the soul of Christ in his agony in the garden had a great and
          earnest labour and struggle with God in prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The soul of Christ in his agony in the garden had a sore conflict
          with those terrible amazing views and apprehensions, of which he was
          then the subject.
        </p>
        <p>In illustrating this proposition I shall endeavour to show,</p>
        <p>1. What those views and apprehensions were.</p>
        <p>
          2. That the conflict or agony of Christ’s soul was occasioned by those
          views and apprehensions.
        </p>
        <p>3. That this conflict was peculiarly great and distressing; and,</p>
        <p>
          4. What we may suppose to be the special design of God in giving
          Christ those terrible views and apprehensions, and causing him to
          suffer that dreadful conflict, before he was crucified.
        </p>
        <p>I proposed to show,</p>
        <p>
          First, What were those terrible views and amazing apprehensions which
          Christ had in his agony. This may be explained by considering,
        </p>
        <p>1. The cause of those views and apprehensions; and,</p>
        <p>2. The manner in which they were then experienced.</p>
        <p>
          1. The cause of those views and apprehensions, which Christ had in his
          agony in the garden, was the bitter cup which he was soon after to
          drink on the cross. The sufferings which Christ underwent in his agony
          in the garden, were not his greatest sufferings; though they were so
          very great. But his last sufferings upon the cross were his principal
          sufferings; and therefore they are called “the cup that he had to
          drink.” The sufferings of the cross, under which he was slain, are
          always in the Scriptures represented as the main sufferings of Christ;
          those in which especially “he bare our sins in his own body,” and made
          atonement for sin. His enduring the cross, his humbling himself, and
          becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, is spoken
          of as the main thing wherein his sufferings appeared. This is the cup
          that Christ had set before him in his agony. It is manifest that
          Christ had this in view at this time, from the prayers which he then
          offered. According to Matthew, Christ made three prayers that evening
          while in the garden of Gethsemane, and all on this one subject, the
          bitter cup that he was to drink. Of the first, we have an account in
          Matt. 26:39. “And he went a little farther, and fell on his face and
          prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from
          me; nevertheless, not as I will but as thou wilt:” of the second in
          the 42d verse, “He went away again the second time and prayed, saying,
          O my Father, if this cup may not pass from me, except I drink it, thy
          will be done:” and of the third in the 44th verse, “And he left them,
          and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same
          words.” From this it plainly appears what it was of which Christ had
          such terrible views and apprehensions at that time. What he thus
          insists on in his prayers, shows on what his mind was so deeply
          intent. It was his sufferings on the cross, which were to be endured
          the next day, when there should be darkness over all the earth, and at
          the same time a deeper darkness over the soul of Christ, of which he
          had now such lively views and distressing apprehensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The manner in which this bitter cup was now set in Christ’s view.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) He had a lively apprehension of it impressed at that time on his
          mind. He had an apprehension of the cup that he was to drink before.
          His principal errand into the the world was to drink that cup, and he
          therefore was never unthoughtful of it, but always bore it in his
          mind, and often spoke of it to his disciples. Thus Matt. 16:21. “From
          that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he
          must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders, and
          chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the
          third day .” Again ch. 20:17, 18, 19. “And Jesus going up to
          Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto
          them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be
          betrayed unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes, and they shall
          condemn him to death. And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock,
          and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise
          again.” The same thing was the subject of conversation on the mount
          with Moses and Elias when he was transfigured. So he speaks of his
          bloody baptism, Luke 12:50. “But I have a baptism to be baptized with;
          and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!” He speaks of it
          again to Zebedee’s children, Matt. 20:22. “Are ye able to drink of the
          cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I
          am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.” He spake of his
          being lifted up. John 8:28. ‘Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have
          lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I
          do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these
          things .” John 12:34. “The people answered him, We have heard out of
          the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of
          man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?” So he spake of
          destroying the temple of his body, John 2:19. “Jesus answered and said
          unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up
          .” And he was very much in speaking of it a little before his agony,
          in his dying counsels to his disciples in the 12th and 13th ch. of
          John. Thus this was not the first time that Christ had this bitter cup
          in his view. On the contrary, he seems always to have had it in view.
          But it seems that at this time God gave him an extraordinary view of
          it. A sense of that wrath that was to be poured out upon him, and of
          those amazing sufferings that he was to undergo, was strongly
          impressed on his mind by the immediate power of God; so that he had
          far more full and lively apprehensions of the bitterness of the cup
          which he was to drink than he ever had before, and these apprehensions
          were so terrible, that his feeble human nature shrunk at the sight,
          and was ready to sink.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The cup of bitterness was now represented as just at hand. He had
          not only a more clear and lively view of it than before; but it was
          now set directly before him, that he might without delay take it up
          and drink it; for then, within that same hour, Judas was to come with
          his band of men, and he was then to deliver up himself into their
          hands to the end that he might drink this cup the next day; unless
          indeed he refused to take it, and so made his escape from that place
          where Judas would come; which he had opportunity enough to do if he
          had been so minded. Having thus shown what those terrible views and
          apprehensions were which Christ had in the time of his agony; I shall
          endeavour to show,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That the conflict which the soul of Christ then endured was
          occasioned by those views and apprehensions. The sorrow and distress
          which his soul then suffered, arose from that lively, and full, and
          immediate view which he had then given him of that cup of wrath; by
          which God the Father did as it were set the cup down before him, for
          him to take it and drink it. Some have inquired, what was the occasion
          of that distress and agony, and many speculations there have been
          about it, but the account which the Scripture itself gives us is
          sufficiently full in this matter, and does not leave room for
          speculation or doubt. The thing that Christ’s mind was so full of at
          that time was, without doubt, the same with that which his mouth was
          so full of: it was the dread which his feeble human nature had of that
          dreadful cup, which was vastly more terrible than Nebuchadnezzar’s
          fiery furnace. He had then a near view of that furnace of wrath, into
          which he was to be cast; he was brought to the mouth of the furnace
          that he might look into it, and stand and view its raging flames, and
          see the glowings of its heat, that he might know where he was going
          and what he was about to suffer. This was the thing that filled his
          soul with sorrow and darkness, this terrible sight as it were
          overwhelmed him. For what was that human nature of Christ to such
          mighty wrath as this? it was in itself, without the supports of God,
          but a feeble worm of the dust, a thing that was crushed before the
          moth, none of God’s children ever had such a cup set before them, as
          this first being of every creature had. But not to dwell any longer on
          this, I hasten to show,
        </p>
        <p>
          III. That the conflict in Christ’s soul, in this view of his last
          sufferings, was dreadful, beyond all expression or conception. This
          will appear,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. From what is said of its dreadfulness in the history. By one
          evangelist we are told, (Matt. 26:37.) “He began to be sorrowful and
          very heavy; and by another, (Mark 14:33.) “And he taketh with him
          Peter, and James, and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be
          very heavy.” These expressions hold forth the intense and overwhelming
          distress that his soul was in. Luke’s expression in the text of his
          being in an agony, according to the signification of that word in the
          original, implies no common degree of sorrow, but such extreme
          distress that his nature had a most violent conflict with it, as a man
          that wrestles with all his might with a strong man, who labours and
          exerts his utmost strength to gain a conquest over him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. From what Christ himself says of it, who was not wont to magnify
          things beyond the truth. He says, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful even
          unto death.” Matt. 26:38. What language can more strongly express the
          most extreme degree of sorrow? His soul was not only “sorrowful,” but
          “exceeding sorrowful;” and not only so, but because that did not fully
          express the degree of his sorrow, he adds, “even unto death;” which
          seems to intimate that the very pains and sorrows of hell, of eternal
          death, had got hold upon him. The Hebrews were wont to express the
          utmost degree of sorrow that any creature could be liable to by the
          phrase, the shadow of death. Christ had now, as it were, the shadow of
          death brought over his soul by the near view which he had of that
          bitter cup that was now set before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. From the effect which it had on his body, in causing that bloody
          sweat that we read of in the text. In our translation it is said, that
          “his sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood, falling down to the
          ground.” The word rendered great drops, is in the original qromboi ,
          which properly signifies lumps or clots; for we may suppose that the
          blood that was pressed out through the pores of his skin by the
          violence of that inward struggle and conflict that there was, when it
          came to be exposed to the cool air of the night, congealed and
          stiffened, as is the nature of blood, and so fell off from him not in
          drops, but in clots. If the suffering of Christ had occasioned merely
          a violent sweat, it would have shown that he was in great agony; for
          it must be an extraordinary grief and exercise of mind that causes the
          body to be all of a sweat abroad in the open air, in a cold night as
          that was, as is evident from John 18:18. “And the servants and
          officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals, (for it was cold,)
          and they warmed themselves; and Peter stood with them, and warmed
          himself.” This was the same night in which Christ had his agony in the
          garden. But Christ’s inward distress and grief was not merely such as
          caused him to be in a violent and universal sweat, but such as caused
          him to sweat blood. The distress and anguish of his mind was so
          unspeakably extreme as to force his blood through the pores of his
          skin, and that so plentifully as to fall in great clots or drops from
          his body to the ground. I come now to show,
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. What may be supposed to be the special end of God’s giving Christ
          beforehand these terrible views of his last sufferings; in other
          words, why it was needful that he should have a more full and
          extraordinary view of the cup that he was to drink, a little before he
          drank it, than ever he had before; or why he must have such a
          foretaste of the wrath of God to be endured on the cross, before the
          time came that he was actually to endure it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer. It was needful, in order that he might take the cup and drink
          it, as knowing what he did. Unless the human nature of Christ had had
          an extraordinary view given him beforehand of what he was to suffer,
          he could not, as man, fully know beforehand what he was going to
          suffer, and therefore could not, as man, know what he did when he took
          the cup to drink it, because he would not fully have known what the
          cup was–it being a cup that he never drank before. If Christ had
          plunged himself into those dreadful sufferings, without being fully
          sensible beforehand of their bitterness and dreadfulness, he must have
          done he knew not what. As man, he would have plunged himself into
          sufferings of the amount of which he was ignorant, and so have acted
          blindfold; and of course his taking upon him these sufferings could
          not have been so fully his own act. Christ, as God, perfectly knew
          what these sufferings were; but it was more needful also that he
          should know as man; for he was to suffer as man, and the act of Christ
          in taking that cup was the act of Christ as God man. But the man
          Christ Jesus hitherto never had had experience of any such sufferings
          as he was now to endure on the cross; and therefore he could not fully
          know what they were beforehand, but by having an extraordinary view of
          them set before him, and an extraordinary sense of them impressed on
          his mind. We have heard of tortures that others have undergone, but we
          do not fully know what they were, because we never experienced them;
          and it is impossible that we should fully know what they were but in
          one of these two ways, either by experiencing them, or by having a
          view given of them, or a sense of them impressed in an extraordinary
          way. Such a sense was impressed on the mind of the man Christ Jesus,
          in the garden of Gethsemane, of his last sufferings, and that caused
          his agony. When he had a full sight given him what that wrath of God
          was that he was to suffer, the sight was overwhelming to him; it made
          his soul exceeding sorrowful, even unto death. Christ was going to be
          cast into a dreadful furnace of wrath, and it was not proper that he
          should plunge himself into it blindfold, as not knowing how dreadful
          the furnace was. Therefore that he might not do so, God first brought
          him and set him at the mouth of the furnace, that he might look in,
          and stand and view its fierce and raging flames, and might see where
          he was going, and might voluntarily enter into it and bear it for
          sinners, as knowing what it was. This view Christ had in his agony.
          Then God brought the cup that he was to drink, and set it down before
          him, that he might have a full view of it, and see what it was before
          he took it and drank it. If Christ had not fully known what the
          dreadfulness of these sufferings was, before he took them upon him,
          his taking them upon him could not have been fully his own act as man;
          there could have been no explicit act of his will about that which he
          was ignorant of; there could have been no proper trial, whether he
          would be willing to undergo such dreadful sufferings or not, unless he
          had known beforehand how dreadful they were; but when he had seen what
          they were, by having an extraordinary view given him of them, and then
          undertaken to endure them afterwards; then he acted as knowing what he
          did; then his taking that cup, and bearing such dreadful sufferings,
          was properly his own act by an explicit choice; and so his love to
          sinners, in that choice of his, was the more wonderful, as also his
          obedience to God in it. And it was necessary that this extraordinary
          view that Christ had of the cup he was to drink should be given at
          that time, just before he was apprehended. This was the most proper
          season for it, just before he took the cup, and while he yet had
          opportunity to refuse the cup; for before he was apprehended by the
          company led by Judas, he had opportunity to make his escape at
          pleasure. For the place where he was, was without the city, where he
          was not at all confined, and was a lonesome, solitary place; and it
          was the night season; so that he might have gone from that place where
          he would, and his enemies not have known where to have found him. This
          view that he had of the bitter cup was given him while he was yet
          fully at liberty, before he was given into the hands of his enemies.
          Christ’s delivering himself up into the hands of his enemies, as he
          did when Judas came, which was just after his agony, was properly his
          act of taking the cup in order to drink; for Christ knew that the
          issue of that would be his crucifixion the next day. These things may
          show us the end of Christ’s agony, and the necessity there was of such
          an agony before his last sufferings.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION.</p>
        <p>
          1. Hence we may learn how dreadful Christ’s last sufferings were. We
          learn it from the dreadful effect which the bare foresight of them had
          upon him in his agony. His last sufferings were so dreadful, that the
          view which Christ had of them before overwhelmed him and amazed him,
          as it is said he began to be sore amazed. The very sight of these last
          sufferings was so very dreadful as to sink his soul down into the dark
          shadow of death; yea, so dreadful was it, that in the sore conflict
          which his nature had with it, he was all in a sweat of blood, his body
          all over was covered with clotted blood, and not only his body, but
          the very ground under him with the blood that fell from him, which had
          been forced through his pores through the violence of his agony. And
          if only the foresight of the cup was so dreadful, how dreadful was the
          cup itself, how far beyond all that can be uttered or conceived! Many
          of the martyrs have endured extreme tortures, but from what has been
          said, there is all reason to think those all were a mere nothing to
          the last sufferings of Christ on the cross. And what has been said
          affords a convincing argument that the sufferings which Christ endured
          in his body on the cross, though they were very dreadful, were yet the
          least part of his last sufferings; and that beside those, he endured
          sufferings in his soul which were vastly greater. For if it had been
          only the sufferings which he endured in his body, though they were
          very dreadful, we cannot conceive that the mere anticipation of them
          would have such an effect on Christ. Many of the martyrs, for ought we
          know, have endured as severe tortures in their bodies as Christ did.
          Many of the martyrs have been crucified, as Christ was; and yet their
          souls have not been so overwhelmed. There has been no appearance of
          such amazing sorrow and distress of mind either at the anticipation of
          their sufferings, or in the actual enduring of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. From what has been said, we may see the wonderful strength of the
          love of Christ to sinners. What has been said shows the strength of
          Christ’s love two ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That it was so strong as to carry him through that agony that he
          was then in. The suffering that he then was actually subject to, was
          dreadful and amazing, as has been shown; and how wonderful was his
          love that lasted and was upheld still! The love of any mere man or
          angel would doubtless have sunk under such a weight, and never would
          have endured such a conflict in such a bloody sweat as that of Jesus
          Christ. The anguish of Christ’s soul at that time was so strong as to
          cause that wonderful effect on his body. But his love to his enemies,
          poor and unworthy as they were, was stronger still. The heart of
          Christ at that time was full of distress, but it was fuller of love to
          vile worms: his sorrows abounded, but his love did much more abound.
          Christ’s soul was overwhelmed with a deluge of grief, but this was
          from a deluge of love to sinners in his heart sufficient to overflow
          the world, and overwhelm the highest mountains of its sins. Those
          great drops of blood that fell down to the ground were a manifestation
          of an ocean of love in Christ’s heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The strength of Christ’s love more especially appears in this, that
          when he had such a full view of the dreadfulness of the cup that he
          was to drink, that so amazed him, he would notwithstanding even then
          take it up, and drink it. Then seems to have been the greatest and
          most peculiar trial of the strength of the love of Christ, when God
          set down the bitter portion before him, and let him see what he had to
          drink, if he persisted in his love to sinners; and brought him to the
          mouth of the furnace that he might see its fierceness, and have a full
          view of it, and have time then to consider whether he would go in and
          suffer the flames of this furnace for such unworthy creatures, or not.
          This was as it were proposing it to Christ’s last consideration what
          he would do; as much as if it had then been said to him, ‘Here is the
          cup that you are to drink, unless you will give up your undertaking
          for sinners, and even leave them to perish as they deserve. Will you
          take this cup, and drink it for them, or not? There is the furnace
          into which you are to be cast, if they are to be saved; either they
          must perish, or you must endure this for them. There you see how
          terrible the heat of the furnace is; you see what pain and anguish you
          must endure on the morrow, unless you give up the cause of sinners.
          What will you do? is your love such that you will go on? Will you cast
          yourself into this dreadful furnace of wrath?’ Christ’s soul was
          overwhelmed with the thought; his feeble human nature shrunk at the
          dismal sight. It put him into this dreadful agony which you have heard
          described; but his love to sinners held out. Christ would not undergo
          these sufferings needlessly, if sinners could be saved without. If
          there was not an absolute necessity of his suffering them in order to
          their salvation, he desired that the cup might pass from him. But if
          sinners, on whom he had set his love, could not, agreeably to the will
          of God, be saved without his drinking it, he chose that the will of
          God should be done. He chose to go on and endure the suffering, awful
          as it appeared to him. And this was his final conclusion, after the
          dismal conflict of his poor feeble human nature, after he had had the
          cup in view, and for at least the space of one hour, had seen how
          amazing it was. Still he finally resolved that he would bear it,
          rather than those poor sinners whom he had loved from all eternity
          should perish. When the dreadful cup was before him, he did not say
          within himself, why should I, who am so great and glorious a person,
          infinitely more honourable than all the angels of heaven, Why should I
          go to plunge myself into such dreadful, amazing torments for worthless
          wretched worms that cannot be profitable to God, or me, and that
          deserve to be hated by me, and not to be loved? Why should I, who have
          been living from all eternity in the enjoyment of the Father’s love,
          go to cast myself into such a furnace for them that never can requite
          me for it? Why should I yield myself to be thus crushed by the weight
          of divine wrath, for them who have no love to me, and are my enemies?
          they do not deserve any union with me, and never did, and never will
          do, any thing to recommend themselves to me. What shall I be the
          richer for having saved a number of miserable haters of God and me,
          who deserve to have divine justice glorified in their destruction?
          Such, however, was not the language of Christ’s heart, in these
          circumstances; but on the contrary, his love held out, and he resolved
          even then, in the midst of his agony, to yield himself up to the will
          of God, and to take the cup and drink it. He would not flee to get out
          of the way of Judas and those that were with him, though he knew they
          were coming, but that same hour delivered himself voluntarily into
          their hands. When they came with swords and staves to apprehend him,
          and he could have called upon his Father, who would immediately have
          sent many legions of angels to repel his enemies, and have delivered
          him, he would not do it; and when his disciples would have made
          resistance, he would not suffer them, as you may see in Matt. 26:51,
          and onward: “And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched
          out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high
          priest’s, and smote off his ear. Then said Jesus unto him, Put up
          again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall
          perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my
          Father, and he will presently give me more than twelve legions of
          angels? But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it
          must be? In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come
          out as against a thief, with swords and staves for to take me? I sat
          daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. But
          all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be
          fulfilled.” And Christ, instead of hiding himself from Judas and the
          soldiers, told them, when they seemed to be at a loss whether he was
          the person whom they sought; and when they seemed still somewhat to
          hesitate, being seized with some terror in their minds, he told them
          so again, and so yielded himself up into their hands, to be bound by
          them, after he had shown them that he could easily resist them if he
          pleased, when a single word spoken by him, threw them backwards to the
          ground, as you may see in John 18:3, etc. “Judas then, having received
          a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees,
          cometh thither with lanterns, and torches, and weapons. Jesus
          therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth,
          and said unto them, Whom seek ye? They answered him, Jesus of
          Nazareth. Jesus said unto them, I am he. As soon then as he had said
          unto them, I am he, they went backward and fell to the ground.” Thus
          powerful, constant, and violent was the love of Christ; and the
          special trial of his love above all others in his whole life seems to
          have been in the time of his agony. For though his sufferings were
          greater afterwards, when he was on the cross, yet he saw clearly what
          those sufferings were to be, in the time of his agony; and that seems
          to have been the first time that ever Christ Jesus had a clear view
          what these sufferings were; and after this the trial was not so great,
          because the conflict was over. His human nature had been in a struggle
          with his love to sinners, but his love had got the victory. The thing,
          upon a full view of his sufferings, had been resolved on and
          concluded; and accordingly, when the moment arrived, he actually went
          through with those sufferings.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are two circumstances of Christ’s agony that do still make
          the strength and constancy of his love to sinners the more
          conspicuous.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That at the same time that he had such a view of the dreadfulness
          of his sufferings, he had also an extraordinary view of the
          hatefulness of the wickedness of those for whom those sufferings were
          to make atonement. There are two things that render Christ’s love
          wonderful: 1. That he should be willing to endure sufferings that were
          so great; and 2. That he should be willing to endure them to make
          atonement for wickedness that was so great. But in order to its being
          properly said, Christ of his own act and choice endured sufferings
          that were so great, to make atonement for wickedness that was so
          great, two things were necessary. 1. That he should have an
          extraordinary sense how great these sufferings were to be, before he
          endured them. This was given in his agony. And 2. That he should also
          at the same time have an extraordinary sense how great and hateful was
          the wickedness of men for which he suffered to make atonement; or how
          unworthy those were for whom he died. And both these were given at the
          same time. When Christ had such an extraordinary sense how bitter his
          cup was to be, he had much to make him sensible how unworthy and
          hateful that wickedness of mankind was for which he suffered; because
          the hateful and malignant nature of that corruption never appeared
          more fully than in the spite and cruelty of men in these sufferings;
          and yet his love was such that he went on notwithstanding to suffer
          for them who were full of such hateful corruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the corruption and wickedness of men that contrived and
          effected his death; it was the wickedness of men that agreed with
          Judas, it was the wickedness of men that betrayed him, and that
          apprehended him, and bound him, and led him away like a malefactor; it
          was by men’s corruption and wickedness that he was arraigned, and
          falsely accused, and unjustly judged. It was by men’s wickedness that
          he was reproached, mocked, buffeted, and spit upon. It was by men’s
          wickedness that Barabbas was preferred before him. It was men’s
          wickedness that laid the cross upon him to bear, and that nailed him
          to it, and put him to so cruel and ignominious a death. This tended to
          give Christ an extraordinary sense of the greatness and hatefulness of
          the depravity of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Because hereby in the time of his sufferings he had that depravity
          set before him as it is, without disguise. When it killed Christ, it
          appeared in its proper colours. Here Christ saw it in its true nature,
          which is the utmost hatred and contempt of God; in its ultimate
          tendency and desire, which is to kill God; and in its greatest
          aggravation and highest act, which is killing a person that was God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Because in these sufferings he felt the fruits of that wickedness.
          It was then directly levelled against himself, and exerted itself
          against him to work his reproach and torment, which tended to impress
          a stronger sense of its hatefulness on the human nature of Christ. But
          yet at the same time, so wonderful was the love of Christ to those who
          exhibited this hateful corruption, that he endured those very
          sufferings to deliver them from the punishment of that very
          corruption. The wonderfulness of Christ’s dying love appears partly in
          that he died for those that were so unworthy in themselves, as all
          mankind have the same kind of corruptions in their hearts, and partly
          in that he died for those who were not only so wicked, but whose
          wickedness consists in being enemies to him; so that he did not only
          die for the wicked, but for his own enemies; and partly in that he was
          willing to die for his enemies at the same time that he was feeling
          the fruits of their enmity, while he felt the utmost effects and
          exertions of their spite against him in the greatest possible contempt
          and cruelty towards him in his own greatest ignominy, torments, and
          death; and partly in that he was willing to atone for their being his
          enemies in these very sufferings, and by that very ignominy, torment,
          and death that was the fruit of it. The sin and wickedness of men, for
          which Christ suffered to make atonement, was, as it were, set before
          Christ in his view.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In that this wickedness was but a sample of the wickedness of
          mankind; for the corruption of all mankind is of the same nature, and
          the wickedness that is in one man’s heart is of the same nature and
          tendency as in another’s. As in water, face answereth to face, so the
          heart of man to man.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is probable that Christ died to make atonement for that
          individual actual wickedness that wrought his sufferings, that
          reproached, mocked, buffeted, and crucified him. Some of his
          crucifiers, for whom he prayed that they might be forgiven, while they
          were in the very act of crucifying him, were afterwards, in answer to
          his prayer, converted, by the preaching of Peter; as we have an
          account of in the 2d chapter of Acts.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Another circumstance of Christ’s agony that shows the strength of
          his love, is the ungrateful carriage of his disciples at that time.
          Christ’s disciples were among those for whom he endured this agony,
          and among those for whom he was going to endure those last sufferings,
          of which he now had such dreadful apprehensions. Yet Christ had
          already given them an interest in the benefits of those sufferings.
          Their sins had already been forgiven them through that blood that he
          was going to shed, and they had been infinite gainers already by that
          dying pity and love which he had to them, and had through his
          sufferings been distinguished from all the world besides. Christ had
          put greater honour upon them than any other, by making them his
          disciples in a more honourable sense than he had done any other. And
          yet now, when he had that dreadful cup set before him which he was
          going to drink for them, and was in such an agony at the sight of it,
          he saw no return on their part but indifference and ingratitude. When
          he only desired them to watch with him, that he might be comforted in
          their company, now at this sorrowful moment they fell asleep; and
          showed that they had not concern enough about it to induce them to
          keep awake with him even for one hour, though he desired it of them
          once and again. But yet this ungrateful treatment of theirs, for whom
          he was to drink the cup of wrath which God had set before him, did not
          discourage him from taking it, and drinking it for them. His love held
          out to them; having loved his own, he loved them to the end. He did
          not say within himself when this cup of trembling was before him, Why
          should I endure so much for those that are so ungrateful; why should I
          here wrestle with the expectation of the terrible wrath of God to be
          borne by me to-morrow, for them that in the mean time have not so much
          concern for me as to keep awake with me when I desire it of them even
          for one hour? But on the contrary, with tender and fatherly
          compassions he excuses this ingratitude of his disciples, and says,
          Matt. 26:41. “Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; the
          spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak;” and went and was
          apprehended, and mocked, and scourged, and crucified, and poured out
          his soul unto death, under the heavy weight of God’s dreadful wrath on
          the cross for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d Inference. From what has been said, we may learn the wonderfulness
          of Christ’s submission to the will of God. Christ, as he was a divine
          person, was the absolute sovereign of heaven and earth, but yet he was
          the most wonderful instance of submission to God’s sovereignty that
          ever was. When he had such a view of the terribleness of his last
          sufferings, and prayed if it were possible that that cup might pass
          from him, i.e. if there was not an absolute necessity of it in order
          to the salvation of sinners, yet it was with a perfect submission to
          the will of God. He adds, “Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be
          done.” He chose rather that the inclination of his human nature, which
          so much dreaded such exquisite torments, should be crossed, than that
          God’s will should not take place. He delighted in the thought of God’s
          will being done; and when he went and prayed the second time, he had
          nothing else to say but, “O my Father, if this cup may not pass from
          me except I drink it, thy will be done;” and so the third time. What
          are such trials of submission as any of us sometimes have in the
          afflictions that we suffer in comparison of this? If God does but in
          his providence signify it to be his will that we should part with a
          child, how hardly are we brought to yield to it, how ready to be
          unsubmissive and froward! Or if God lays his hand upon us in some
          acute pain of body, how ready are we to be discontented and impatient;
          when the innocent Son of God, who deserved no suffering could quietly
          submit to sufferings inconceivably great, and say it over and over,
          God’s will be done! When he was brought and set before that dreadful
          furnace of wrath into which he was to be cast, in order that he might
          look into it and have a full view of its fierceness, when his flesh
          shrunk at it, and his nature was in such a conflict, that his body was
          all covered with a sweat of blood falling in great drops to the
          ground, yet his soul quietly yielded that the will of God should be
          done, rather than the will or inclination of his human nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th Infer. What has been said on this subject also shows us the glory
          of Christ’s obedience. Christ was subject to the moral law as Adam
          was, and he was also subject to the ceremonial and judicial laws of
          Moses; but the principal command that he had received of the Father
          was, that he should lay down his life, that he should voluntarily
          yield up himself to those terrible sufferings on the cross. To do this
          was his principal errand into the world; and doubtless the principal
          command that he received, was about that which was the principal
          errand on which he was sent. The Father, when he sent him into the
          world, sent him with commands concerning what he should do in the
          world; and his chief command of all was about that, which was the
          errand he was chiefly sent upon, which was to lay down his life. And
          therefore this command was the principal trial of his obedience. It
          was the greatest trial of his obedience, because it was by far the
          most difficult command: all the rest were easy in comparison of this.
          And the main trial that Christ had, whether he would obey this
          command, was in the time of his agony; for that was within an hour
          before he was apprehended in order to his sufferings, when he must
          either yield himself up to them, or fly from them. And then it was the
          first time that Christ had a full view of the difficulty of this
          command; which appeared so great as to cause that bloody sweat. Then
          was the conflict of weak human nature with the difficulty, then was
          the sore struggles and wrestling with the heavy trial he had, and then
          Christ got the victory over the temptation, from the dread of his
          human nature. His obedience held out through the conflict. Then we may
          suppose that Satan was especially let loose to set in with the natural
          dread that the human nature had of such torments, and to strive to his
          utmost to dissuade Christ from going on to drink the bitter cup; for
          about that time, towards the close of Christ’s life, was he especially
          delivered up into the hands of Satan to be tempted of him, more than
          he was immediately after his baptism; for Christ says, speaking of
          that time, Luke 22:53. “When I was daily with you in the temple, ye
          stretched forth no hands against me; but this is your hour, and the
          power of darkness.” So that Christ, in the time of his agony, was
          wrestling not only with overwhelming views of his last sufferings, but
          he also wrestled, in that bloody sweat, with principalities and powers
          — he contended at that time with the great leviathan that laboured to
          his utmost to tempt him to disobedience. So that then Christ had
          temptations every way to draw him off from obedience to God. He had
          temptations from his feeble human nature, that exceedingly dreaded
          such torments; and he had temptations from men, who were his enemies;
          and he had temptations from the ungrateful carriage of his own
          disciples; and he had temptations from the devil. He had also an
          overwhelming trial from the manifestation of God’s own wrath; when, in
          the words of Isaiah, it pleased the Lord to bruise him and put him to
          grief. But yet he failed not, but got the victory over all, and
          performed that great act of obedience at that time to that same God
          that hid himself from him, and was showing his wrath to him for men’s
          sins, which he must presently suffer. Nothing could move him away from
          his steadfast obedience to God, but he persisted in saying, “Thy will
          be done:” expressing not only his submission, but his obedience; not
          only his compliance with the disposing will of God, but also with his
          perceptive will. God had given him this cup to drink, and had
          commanded him to drink it, and that was reason enough with him to
          drink it; hence he says, at the conclusion of his agony, when Judas
          came with his band, “The cup which my Father giveth me to drink, shall
          I not drink it?” John 18:11. Christ, at the time of his agony, had an
          inconceivably greater trial of obedience than any man or any angel
          ever had. How much was this trial of the obedience of the second Adam
          beyond the trial of the obedience of the first Adam! How light was our
          first father’s temptation in comparison of this! And yet our first
          surety failed, and our second failed not, but obtained a glorious
          victory, and went and became obedient unto death, even the death of
          the cross. Thus wonderful and glorious was the obedience of Christ, by
          which he wrought out righteousness for believers, and which obedience
          is imputed to them. No wonder that it is a sweet penalty sown, and
          that God stands ready to bestow heaven as its reward on all that
          believe on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. What has been said shows us the sottishness of secure sinners in
          being so fearless of the wrath of God. If the wrath of God was so
          dreadful, that, when Christ only expected it, his human nature was
          nearly overwhelmed with the fear of it, and his soul was amazed, and
          his body all over in a bloody sweat; then how sottish are sinners, who
          are under the threatening of the same wrath of God, and are condemned
          to it, and are every moment exposed to it; and yet, instead of
          manifesting intense apprehension, are quiet and easy, and unconcerned;
          instead of being sorrowful and very heavy, go about with a light and
          careless heart; instead of crying out in bitter agony, are often gay
          and cheerful, and eat and drink, and sleep quietly, and go on in sin,
          provoking the wrath of God more and more, without any great matter of
          concern! How stupid and sottish are such persons! Let such senseless
          sinners consider, that that misery, of which they are in danger from
          the wrath of God, is infinitely more terrible than that, the fear of
          which occasioned in Christ his agony and bloody sweat. It is more
          terrible, both as it differs both in its nature and degree, and also
          as it differs in its duration. It is more terrible in its nature and
          degree. Christ suffered that which, as it upheld the honour of the
          divine law, was fully equivalent to the misery of the damned; and in
          some respect it was the same suffering; for it was the wrath of the
          same God; but yet in other respects it vastly differed. The difference
          does not arise from the difference in the wrath poured out on one and
          the other, for it is the same wrath, but from the difference of the
          subject, which may be best illustrated from Christ’s own comparison.
          Luke 23:31. “For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall
          be done in the dry?” Here he calls himself the green tree, and wicked
          men the dry, intimating that the misery that will come on wicked men
          will be far more dreadful than those sufferings which came on him, and
          the difference arises from the different nature of the subject. The
          green tree and the dry are both cast into the fire; but the flames
          seize and kindle on the dry tree much more fiercely than on the green.
          The sufferings that Christ endured differ from the misery of the
          wicked in hell in nature and degree in the following respects.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Christ felt not the gnawings of a guilty, condemning conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He felt no torment from the reigning of inward corruptions and
          lusts as the damned do. The wicked in hell are their own tormentors,
          their lusts are their tormentors, and being without restraint, (for
          there is no restraining grace in hell,) their lusts will rage like
          raging flames in their hearts. They shall be tormented with the
          unrestrained violence of a spirit of envy and malice against God, and
          against the angels and saints in heaven, and against one another. Now
          Christ suffered nothing of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Christ had not to consider that God hated him. The wicked in hell
          have this to make their misery perfect, they know that God perfectly
          hates them without the least pity or regard to them, which will fill
          their souls with inexpressible misery. But it was not so with Christ.
          God withdrew his comfortable presence from Christ, and hid his face
          from him, and so poured out his wrath upon him, as made him feel its
          terrible effects in his soul; but yet he knew at the same time that
          God did not hate him, but infinitely loved him. He cried out of God’s
          forsaking him, but yet at the same time calls him “My God, my God!”
          knowing that he was his God still, though he had forsaken him. But the
          wicked in hell will know that he is not their God, but their judge and
          irreconcilable enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Christ did not suffer despair, as the wicked do in hell. He knew
          that there would be an end to his sufferings in a few hours; and that
          after that he should enter into eternal glory. But it will be far
          otherwise with you that are impenitent; if you die in your present
          condition, you will be in perfect despair. On these accounts, the
          misery of the wicked in hell will be immensely more dreadful in nature
          and degree, than those sufferings with the fears of which Christ’s
          soul was so much overwhelmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It will infinitely differ in duration. Christ’s sufferings lasted
          but a few hours, and there was an eternal end to them, and eternal
          glory succeeded. But you that are a secure, senseless sinner, are
          every day exposed to be cast into everlasting misery, a fire that
          never shall be quenched. If then the Son of God was in such amazement,
          in the expectation of what he was to suffer for a few hours, how
          sottish are you who are continually exposed to sufferings, immensely
          more dreadful in nature and degree, and that are to be without any
          end, but which must be endured without any rest day or night for ever
          and ever! If you had a full sense of the greatness of that misery to
          which you are exposed, and how dreadful your present condition is on
          that account, it would this moment put you into as dreadful an agony
          as that which Christ underwent; yea, if your nature could endure it,
          one much more dreadful. We should now see you fall down in a bloody
          sweat, wallowing in your gore, and crying out in terrible amazement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus endeavoured to explain and illustrate the former of the
          two propositions mentioned in the commencement of this discourse, I
          shall now proceed to show,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That the soul of Christ in his agony in the garden was in a great
          and earnest strife and conflict in his prayer to God. The labour and
          striving of Christ’s soul in prayer was a part of his agony, and was
          without doubt a part of what is intended in the text, when it is said
          that Christ was in an agony; for, as we have shown, the word is
          especially used in Scripture in other places for striving or wrestling
          with God in prayer. From this fact, and from the evangelist mentioning
          his being in agony, and his praying earnestly in the same sentence, we
          may well understand him as mentioning his striving in prayer as part
          of his agony. The words of the text seem to hold forth as much as that
          Christ was in an agony in prayer: “Being in an agony, he prayed more
          earnestly; and his sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood falling
          to the ground.” This language seems to imply thus much, that the
          labour and earnestness of Christ’s soul was so great in his wrestling
          with God in prayer, that he was in a mere agony, and all over in a
          sweat of blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I propose now, in this second proposition, is by the help of God
          to explain this part of Christ’s agony which consisted in the
          agonizing and wrestling of his soul in prayer; which is the more
          worthy of a particular inquiry, being that which probably is but
          little understood; though, as may appear in the sequel, the right
          understanding of it is of great use and consequence in divinity. It is
          not as I conceive ordinarily well understood what is meant when it is
          said in the text that Christ prayed more earnestly; or what was the
          thing that he wrestled with God for, or what was the subject matter of
          this earnest prayer, or what was the reason of his being so very
          earnest in prayer at this time. And therefore, to set this whole
          matter in a clear light, I would particularly inquire,
        </p>
        <p>1. Of what nature this prayer was;</p>
        <p>
          2. What was the subject matter of this earnest prayer of Christ to the
          Father;
        </p>
        <p>3. In what capacity Christ offered up this prayer to God;</p>
        <p>4. Why he was so earnest in his prayer;</p>
        <p>
          5. What was the success of this his earnest wrestling with God in
          prayer; and then make some improvement.
        </p>
        <p>I. Of what nature this prayer of Christ was.</p>
        <p>
          Addresses that are made to God may be of various kinds. Some are
          confessions on the part of the individual, or expressions of his sense
          of his own unworthiness before God, and are thus penitential addresses
          to God. Others are doxologies or prayers intended to express the sense
          which the person has of God’s greatness and glory. Such are many of
          the psalms of David. Others are gratulatory addresses, or expressions
          of thanksgiving and praise for mercies received. Others are submissive
          addresses, or expressions of submission and resignation to the will of
          God, whereby he that addresses the Majesty of heaven, expresses the
          compliance of his will with the sovereign will of God; saying, “Thy
          will, O Lord, be done!” as David, 2 Sam. 15:26. “But if he thus say, I
          have no delight in thee; behold, here am I; let him do to me as
          seemeth good unto him.” Others are petitory or supplicatory; whereby
          the person that prays, begs of God and cries to him for some favour
          desired of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence the inquiry is, of which of these kinds was the prayer of
          Christ, that we read of in the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer. It was chiefly supplicatory. It was not penitential or
          confessional; for Christ had no sin or unworthiness to confess. Nor
          was it a doxology or a thanksgiving or merely an expression of
          submission; for none of these agree with what is said in the text,
          viz. that he prayed more earnestly. When any one is said to pray
          earnestly, it implies an earnest request for some benefit, or favour
          desired; and not merely a confession, or submission, or gratulation.
          So what the apostle says of this prayer, in Heb. 5:7. “Who in the days
          of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications, with
          strong crying and tears, unto him that was able to save him from
          death, and was heard, in that he feared,” shows that it was petitory,
          or an earnest supplication for some desired benefit. They are not
          confessions, or doxologies, or thanksgivings. or resignations, that
          are called “supplications” and “strong cyings,” but petitions for some
          benefit earnestly desired. And having thus resolved the first inquiry,
          and shown that this earnest prayer of Christ -was of the nature of a
          supplication for some benefit or favour which Christ earnestly
          desired, I come to inquire,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. What was the subject matter of this supplication; or what favour
          and benefit that was for which Christ so earnestly supplicated in this
          prayer of which we have an account in the text. Now the words of the
          text are not express on this matter. It is said that Christ, “being in
          an agony, prayed more earnestly;” but yet it is not said what he
          prayed so earnestly for. And here is the greatest difficulty attending
          this account: even what that was which Christ so earnestly desired,
          for which he so wrestled with God at that time. And though we are not
          expressly told in the text, yet the Scriptures have not left us
          without sufficient light in this matter. And the more effectually to
          avoid mistakes, I would answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Negatively, the thing that Christ so earnestly prayed for at this
          time, was not that the bitter cup which he had to drink might pass
          from him. Christ had before prayed for this, as in the next verse but
          one before the text, saying “Father, if thou be willing, remove this
          cup from me! nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done!” It is
          after this that we have an account that Christ being in an agony,
          prayed more earnestly; but we are not to understand that he prayed
          more earnestly than he had done before, that the cup might pass from
          him. That this was not the thing that he so earnestly prayed for in
          this second prayer, the following things seem to prove:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This second prayer was after the angel had appeared to him from
          heaven, strengthening him, the more cheerfully to take the cup and
          drink it. The evangelists inform us that when Christ came into the
          garden, he began to be sorrowful, and very heavy, and that he said his
          soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death, and that then he went
          and prayed to God, that if it were possible the cup might pass from
          him. Luke says in the 41st and 42nd verses, “that being withdrawn from
          his disciples about a stone’s cast, he kneeled down and prayed,
          saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me;
          nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done!” And then, after this,
          it is said in the next verse, that there appeared an angel from heaven
          unto him strengthening him. Now this can be understood no otherwise
          than that the angel appeared to him, strengthening him and encouraging
          him to go through his great and difficult work, to take the cup and
          drink it. Accordingly we must suppose, that now Christ was more
          strengthened and encouraged to go through with his sufferings: and
          therefore we cannot suppose that after this he would pray more
          earnestly than before to be delivered from his sufferings; and of
          course that it was something else that Christ more earnestly prayed
          for, after that strengthening of the angel, and not that the cup might
          pass from him. Though Christ seems to have a greater sight of his
          sufferings given him after this strengthening of the angel than
          before, that caused such an agony, yet he was more strengthened to fit
          him for a greater sight of them, he had greater strength and courage
          to grapple with these awful apprehensions, than before. His strength
          to bear sufferings is increased with the sense of his sufferings.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Christ, before his second prayer, had had an intimation from the
          Father, that it was not his will that the cup should pass from him.
          The angel’s coming from heaven to strengthen him must be so
          understood. Christ first prays, that if it may be the will of the
          Father, the cup might pass; but not, if it was not his will; and then
          God immediately upon this sends an angel to strengthen, and encourage
          him to take the cup, which was a plain intimation to Christ that it
          was the Father’s will that he should take it, and that it should not
          pass from him. And so Christ received it; as appears from the account
          which Matthew gives of this second prayer. Matt. 26:42. “He went away
          again the second time and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may
          not pass away from me except I drink it, thy will be done.” He speaks
          as one that now had had an intimation, since he prayed before, that it
          was not the will of God. And Luke tells us how, viz. by God’s sending
          an angel. Matthew informs us, as Luke does, that in his first prayer,
          he prayed that if it were possible the cup might pass from him; but
          then God sends an angel to signify that it was not his will, and to
          encourage him to take it. And then Christ having received this plain
          intimation that it was not the will of God that the cup should pass
          from him, yields to the message he had received, and says, O my
          Father, if it be so as thou hast now signified, thy will be done.
          Therefore we may surely conclude that what Christ prayed more
          earnestly for after this, was not that the cup might pass from him,
          but something else; for he would not go to pray more earnestly that
          the cup might pass from him, after God had signified that it was not
          his will that it should pass from him, than he did before; that would
          be blasphemous to suppose. And then,
        </p>
        <p>
          3dly, The language of the second prayer, as recited by Matthew, “O my
          Father, if this cup may not pass from me except I drink it, thy will
          be done,” shows that Christ did not then pray that the cup might pass
          from him. This certainly is not praying more earnestly that the cup
          might pass: it is rather a yielding that point, and ceasing any more
          to urge it, and submitting to it as a thing now determined by the will
          of God, made known by the angel. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. From the apostle’s account of this prayer in the 5th ch. of
          Hebrews, the words of the apostle are these, “Who in the days of his
          flesh, when he had offered up his prayers and supplications, with
          strong crying and tears, unto him that was able to save him from
          death, and was heard in that he feared.” The strong crying and tears
          of which the apostle speaks, are doubtless the same that Luke speaks
          of in the text, when he says, “he being in an agony, prayed more
          earnestly;” for this was the sharpest and most earnest crying of
          Christ, of which we have any where any account. But according to the
          apostle’s account, that which Christ feared, and that for which he so
          strongly cried to God in this prayer, was something that he was heard
          in, something that God granted him his request in, and therefore it
          was not that the cup might pass from him. Having thus shown what it
          was not that Christ prayed for in this earnest prayer, I proceed to
          show,
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd, What it was that Christ so earnestly sought of God in this
          prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I answer in one word, it was, That God’s will might be done, in what
          related to his sufferings. Matthew gives this express account of it,
          in the very language of the prayer which has been recited several
          times already, “O my Father, if this cup may not pass from me, except
          I drink it, thy will be done!” This is a yielding, and an expression
          of submission; but it is not merely that. Such words, “The will of the
          Lord be done,” as they are most commonly used, are not understood as a
          supplication or request, but only as an expression of submission. But
          the words are not always to be understood in that sense in Scripture,
          but sometimes are to be understood as a request. So they are to be
          understood in the third petition of the Lord’s prayer, “Thy will be
          done in earth as in heaven.” There the words are to be understood both
          as an expression of submission, and also a request, as they are
          explained in the Assembly’s Catechism, and so the words are to be
          understood here. The evangelist Mark says that Christ went away again
          and spake the same words that he had done in his first prayer. Mark
          14:39. But then we must understand it as of the same words with the
          latter part of his first prayer, “nevertheless not my will but thine
          be done,” as Matthew’s more full and particular account shows. So that
          the thing mentioned in the text, for which Christ was wrestling with
          God in this prayer, was, that God’s will might be done in what related
          to his sufferings.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then here another inquiry may arise, viz. What is implied in
          Christ’s praying that God’s will might be done in what related to his
          sufferings? To this I answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This implies a request that he might be strengthened and supported,
          and enabled to do God’s will, by going through with these sufferings.
          The same as when he says, “Lo, I come, in the volume of the book it is
          written of me, to do thy will, O God.” It was the preceptive will of
          God that he should take that cup and drink it: it was the Father’s
          command to him. The Father had given him the cup, and as it were set
          it down before him with the command that he should drink it. This was
          the greatest act of obedience that Christ was to perform. He prays for
          strength and help, that his poor feeble human nature might be
          supported, that he might not fail in this great trial, that he might
          not sink and be swallowed up, and his strength so overcome that he
          should not hold out, and finish the appointed obedience. This was the
          thing that he feared, of which the apostle speaks in the 5th of
          Hebrews, when he says,”he was heard in that he feared.” When he had
          such an extraordinary sense of the dreadfulness of his sufferings
          impressed on his mind, the fearfulness of it amazed him. He was afraid
          lest his poor feeble strength should be overcome, and that he should
          fail in so great a trial, that he should be swallowed up by that death
          that he was to die, and so should not be saved from death; and
          therefore he offered up strong crying and tears unto him that was able
          to strengthen him, and support, and save him from death, that the
          death he was to suffer might not overcome his love and obedience, but
          that he might overcome death, and so be saved from it. If Christ’s
          courage had failed in the trial, and he had not held out under his
          dying sufferings, he never would have been saved from death, but he
          would have sunk in the deep mire; he never would have risen from the
          dead, for his rising from the dead was a reward of his victory. If his
          courage had failed, and he had given up, he would have remained from
          under the power of death, and so we should all have perished, we
          should have remained yet in our sins. If he had failed, all would have
          failed. If he had not overcome in that sore conflict, neither he nor
          we could have been freed from death, we all must have perished
          together. Therefore this was the saving from death that the apostle
          speaks of, that Christ feared and prayed for with strong crying and
          tears. His being overcome of death was the thing that he feared, and
          so he was heard in that he feared. This Christ prayed, that the will
          of God might be done in his sufferings, even that he might not fail of
          obeying God’s will in his sufferings; and therefore it follows in the
          next verse in that passage of Hebrews, “Though he were a Son, yet
          learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.” That it was in
          this respect that Christ in his agony so earnestly prayed that the
          will of God might be done, viz. that he might have strength to do his
          will, and might not sink and fail in such great sufferings; is
          confirmed from the scriptures of the Old Testament, as particularly
          from the 69th Psalm. The psalmist represents Christ in that psalm, as
          is evident from the fact that the words of that psalm are represented
          as Christ’s words in many places of the New Testament. That psalm is
          represented as Christ’s prayer to God when his soul was overwhelmed
          with sorrow and amazement, as it was in his agony; as you may see in
          the 1st and 2nd verses, “Save me, O God, for the waters are come in
          unto my soul: I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am
          come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.” But then the
          thing that is represented as being the thing that he feared, was
          failing, and being overwhelmed, in this great trial: verses 14 and 15.
          “Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered
          from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. Let not the water-
          flood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the
          pit shut her mouth upon me.” So again in the 22d Psalm, which is also
          represented as the prayer of Christ under his dreadful sorrow and
          sufferings, verses 19, 20, 21. “But be not thou far from me, O Lord; O
          my Strength, haste thee to help me. Deliver my soul from the sword; my
          darling from the power of the dog. Save me from the lion’s mouth.” It
          was meet and suitable that Christ, when about to engage in that
          terrible conflict, should thus earnestly seek help from God to enable
          him to do his will; for he needed God’s help–the strength of his human
          nature, without divine help, was not sufficient to carry him through.
          This was, without doubt, that in which the first Adam failed in his
          first trial, that when the trial came he was not sensible of his own
          weakness and dependence. If he had been, and had leaned on God, and
          cried to him for his assistance and strength against the temptation,
          in all likelihood we should have remained innocent and happy creatures
          to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It implies a request that God’s will and purpose might be obtained
          in the effects and fruits of his sufferings, in the glory to his name,
          that was his design in them; and particularly in the glory of his
          grace, in the eternal salvation and happiness of his elect. This is
          confirmed by John 12:27,28. “Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I
          say?– Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto
          this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from
          heaven, saying, I have both glorified, and will glorify it again.”
          There the first request is the same with the first request of Christ
          here in like trouble: “Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?
          Father, save me from this hour.” He first prays, as he does here, that
          he might be saved from his last sufferings. Then, after he was
          determined within himself that the will of God must be otherwise, that
          he should not be saved from that hour, “but for this cause,” says he,
          “came I to this hour;” and then his second request after this is,
          “Father, glorify thy name!” So this is doubtless the purport of the
          second request in his agony, when he prayed that God’s will might be
          done. It is that God’s will might be done in that glory to his own
          name that he intended in the effects and fruits of his sufferings,
          that seeing that it was his will that he should suffer, he earnestly
          prays that the end of his suffering, in the glory of God and the
          salvation of the elect, may not fail. And these things are what Christ
          so earnestly wrestled with God for in his prayer, of which we have an
          account in the text, and we have no reason to think that they were not
          expressed in prayer as well as implied. It is not reasonable to
          suppose that the evangelist in his other account of things mentions
          all the words of Christ’s prayer. He only mentions the substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. In what capacity did Christ offer up those earnest prayers to God
          in his agony?
        </p>
        <p>
          In answer to this inquiry, I observe that he offered them up not as a
          private person, but as high priest. The apostle speaks of the strong
          crying and tears, as what Christ offered up as high priest. Heb.
          5:6-7. “As he says also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever,
          after the order of Melchisedek: who in the days of his flesh, when he
          had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and
          tears,” etc. The things that Christ prayed for in those strong
          cryings, were things not of a private nature, but of common concern to
          the whole church of which he was the high priest. That the will of God
          should be done in his obedience unto death, that his strength and
          courage should not fail, but that he should hold out, was of common
          concern; for, if he had failed, all would have failed and perished for
          ever. And of course, that God’s name should be glorified in the
          effects and fruits of his sufferings, and in the salvation and glory
          of all his elect, was a thing of common concern. Christ offered up
          these strong cries with his flesh in the same manner as the priests of
          old were wont to offer up prayers with their sacrifices. Christ mixed
          strong crying and tears with his blood, and so offered up his blood
          and his prayers together, that the effect and success of his blood
          might be obtained. Such earnest agonizing prayers were offered with
          his blood, and his infinitely precious and meritorious blood was
          offered with his prayers.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Why was Christ so earnest in those supplications? Luke speaks of
          them as very earnest; the apostle speaks of them as strong crying; and
          his agony partly consisted in this earnestness: and the account that
          Luke gives us, seems to imply that his bloody sweat was partly at
          least with the great labour and earnest sense of his soul in wrestling
          with God in prayer. There were three things that concurred at that
          time, especially to cause Christ to be thus earnest and engaged.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He had then an extraordinary sense how dreadful the consequence
          would be, if God’s will should fail of being done. He had then an
          extraordinary sense of his own last suffering under the wrath of God,
          and if he had failed in those sufferings, he knew the consequence must
          be dreadful. He having now such an extraordinary view of the
          terribleness of the wrath of God, his love to the elect tended to make
          him more than ordinarily earnest that they might be delivered from
          suffering that wrath to all eternity, which could not have been if he
          had failed of doing God’s will, or if the will of God in the effect of
          his suffering had failed.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. No wonder that that extraordinary sense that Christ then had of the
          costliness of the means of sinners’ salvation, made him very earnest
          for the success of those means, as you have already heard.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Christ had an extraordinary sense of his dependence on God, and his
          need of his help to enable him to do God’s will in this great trial.
          Though he was innocent, yet he needed divine help. He was dependent on
          God, as man, and therefore we read that he trusted in God. Matt.
          27:43. “He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have
          him: for he said, I am the Son of God.” And when he had such an
          extraordinary sight of the dreadfulness of that wrath he was to
          suffer, he saw how much it was beyond the strength of his human nature
          alone.
        </p>
        <p>V. What was the success of this prayer of Christ?</p>
        <p>
          To this I answer, He obtained all his requests. The apostle says, “He
          was heard in that he feared;” in all that he feared. He obtained
          strength and help from God, all that he needed, and was carried
          through. He was enabled to do and to suffer the whole will of God; and
          he obtained the whole of the end of his sufferings–a full atonement
          for the sins of the whole world, and the full salvation of every one
          of those who were given him in the covenant of redemption, and all
          that glory to the name of God, which his mediation was designed to
          accomplish, not one jot or tittle hath failed. Herein Christ in his
          agony was above all others Jacob’s antitype, in his wrestling with God
          for a blessing; which Jacob did, not as a private person, but as the
          head of his posterity, the nation of Israel, and by which he obtained
          that commendation of God, “As a prince thou hast power with God;” and
          therein was a type of him who was the Prince of princes.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION.</p>
        <p>
          Great improvement may be made of the consideration of the strong
          crying and tears of Christ in the days of his flesh, many ways for our
          benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This may teach us after what manner we should pray to God, not in a
          cold and careless manner, but with great earnestness and engagedness
          of spirit, and especially when we are praying to God for those things
          that are of infinite importance, such as spiritual and eternal
          blessings. Such were the benefits that Christ prayed for with such
          strong crying and tears, that he might be enabled to do God’s will in
          that great and difficult work that God had appointed him, that he
          might not sink and fail, but might get the victory, and so finally be
          delivered from death, and that God’s will and end might be obtained as
          the fruit of his sufferings, in the glory of God, and the salvation of
          the elect.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we go before God in prayer with a cold, dull heart, and in a
          lifeless and listless manner pray to him for eternal blessings, and
          those of infinite import to our souls, we should think of Christ’s
          earnest prayers that he poured out to God, with tears and a bloody
          sweat. The consideration of it may well make us ashamed of our dull,
          lifeless prayers to God, wherein, indeed, we rather ask a denial than
          ask to be heard; for the language of such a manner of praying to God,
          is, that we do not look upon the benefit that we pray for as of any
          great importance, that we are indifferent whether God answers us or
          not. The example of Jacob in wrestling with God for the blessing,
          should teach us earnestness in our prayers, but more especially the
          example of Jesus Christ, who wrestled with God in a bloody sweat. If
          we were sensible as Christ was of the great importance of those
          benefits that are of eternal consequence, our prayers to God for such
          benefits would be after another manner than now they are. Our souls
          also would with earnest labour and strife be engaged in this duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many benefits that we ask of God in our prayers, which are
          every whit of as great importance to us as those benefits which Christ
          asked of God in his agony were to him. It is of as great importance to
          us that we should be enabled to do the will of God, and perform a
          sincere, universal, and persevering obedience to his commands, as it
          was to Christ that he should not fail of doing God’s will in his great
          work. It is of as great importance to us to be saved from death, as it
          was to Christ that he should get the victory over death, and so be
          saved from it. It is of as great, and infinitely greater, importance
          to us, that Christ’s redemption should be successful in us, as it was
          to him that God’s will should be done, in the fruits and success of
          his redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ recommended earnest watchfulness and prayerfulness to his
          disciples, by prayer and example, both at the same time. When Christ
          was in his agony, and came and found his disciples asleep, he bid them
          watch and pray, Matt. 26:41. “Watch and pray, that ye enter not into
          temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” At
          the same time he set them an example of that which he commanded them,
          for though they slept he watched, and poured out his soul in those
          earnest prayers that you have heard of; and Christ has elsewhere
          taught us to ask those blessings of God that are of infinite
          importance, as those that will take no denial. We have another example
          of the great conflicts and engagedness of Christ’s spirit in this
          duty. Luke 6:12. “And it came to pass in those days, that he went out
          into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.”
          And he was often recommending earnestness in crying to God in prayers.
          In the parable of the unjust judge, Luke 18 at the beginning; “And he
          spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray,
          and not to faint; saying There was in a city a judge, which feared not
          God, neither regarded man; and there was a widow in that city; and she
          came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. And he would not
          for awhile: but afterwards he saith within himself, Though I fear not
          God nor regard man, yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge
          her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. And the Lord said,
          Hear what the unjust judge saith.” Luke 6:5, etc. “And he said unto
          them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at
          midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend
          of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before
          him? And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door
          is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and
          give thee. I say unto you, though he will not rise and give him
          because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity, he will rise
          and give him as many as he needeth.” He taught it in his own way of
          answering prayer, as in answering the woman of Canaan, Matt. 15:22,
          etc. “And behold a woman of Canaan came out of the coasts, and cried
          unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my
          daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But he answered her not a
          word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away;
          for she crieth after us. But he answered and said, I am not sent but
          unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Then came she and
          worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. But he answered and said, It is
          not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to dogs. And she
          said, Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from
          their master’s table. Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman,
          great is thy faith; be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her
          daughter was made whole from that very hour.” And as Christ prayed in
          his agony, so I have already mentioned several texts of Scripture
          wherein we are directed to agonize in our prayers to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. These earnest prayers and strong cries of Christ to the Father in
          his agony, show the greatness of his love to sinners. For, as has been
          shown, these strong cries of Jesus Christ were what he offered up to
          God as a public person, in the capacity of high priest, and in the
          behalf of those whose priest he was. When he offered up his sacrifice
          for sinners whom he had loved from eternity, he withal offered up
          earnest prayers. His strong cries, his tears, and his blood, were all
          offered up together to God, and they were all offered up for the same
          end, for the glory of God in the salvation of the elect. They were all
          offered up for the same persons, viz. for his people. For them he shed
          his blood and that bloody sweat, when it fell down in clotted lumps to
          the ground; and for them he so earnestly cried to God at the same
          time. It was that the will of God might be done in the success of his
          sufferings, in the success of that blood, in the salvation of those
          for whom that blood was shed, and therefore this strong crying shows
          his strong love; it shows how greatly he desired the salvation of
          sinners. He cried to God that he might not sink and fail in that great
          undertaking, because if he did so, sinners could not be saved, but all
          must perish. He prayed that he might get the victory over death,
          because if he did not get the victory, his people could never obtain
          that victory, and they can conquer no otherwise than by his conquest.
          If the Captain of our salvation had not conquered in this sore
          conflict, none of us could have conquered, but we must have all sunk
          with him. He cried to God that he might be saved from death, and if he
          had not been saved from death in his resurrection, none of us could
          ever have been saved from death. It was a great sight to see Christ in
          that great conflict that he was in in his agony, but every thing in it
          was from love, that strong love that was in his heart. His tears that
          flowed from his eyes were from love; his great sweat was from love;
          his blood, his prostrating himself on the ground before the Father,
          was from love; his earnest crying to God was from the strength and
          ardency of his love. It is looked upon as one principal way wherein
          true love and good will is shown in Christian friends one towards
          another, heartily to pray one for another; and it is one way wherein
          Christ directs us to show our love to our enemies, even praying for
          them. Matt. 5:44. “But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them
          that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and
          persecute you.” But was there ever any prayer that manifested love to
          enemies to such a degree, as those strong cries and tears of the Son
          of God for the success of his blood in the salvation of his enemies;
          the strife and conflict of whose soul in prayer was such as to produce
          his agony and his bloody sweat?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If Christ was thus earnest in prayer to God, that the end of his
          sufferings might be obtained in the salvation of sinners, then how
          much ought those sinners to be reproved that do not earnestly seek
          their own salvation! If Christ offered up such strong cries for
          sinners as their high priest, that bought their salvation, who stood
          in no need of sinners, who had been happy from all eternity without
          them, and could not be made happier by them; then how great is the
          sottishness of those sinners that seek their own salvation in a dull
          and lifeless manner; that content themselves with a formal attendance
          on the duties of religion, with their hearts in the mean time much
          more earnestly set after other things! They after a sort attend on the
          duty of social prayer, wherein they pray to God that he would have
          mercy on them and save them; but after what a poor dull way is it that
          they do it! they do not apply their heart unto wisdom, nor incline
          their ear to understanding; they do not cry after wisdom, nor lift up
          their voice for understanding; they do not seek it as silver, nor
          search for it as for hidden treasures. Christ’s earnest cries in his
          agony may convince us that it was not without reason that he insisted
          upon it, in Luke 13:24. that we should strive to enter in at the
          strait gate, which, as I have already observed to you, is, in the
          original, Agwnizesqe , “Agonize to enter in at the strait gate.” If
          sinners would be in a hopeful way to obtain their salvation, they
          should agonize in that great concern as men that are taking a city by
          violence, as Matt. 11:12. “And from the days of John the Baptist until
          now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it
          by force.” When a body of resolute soldiers are attempting to take a
          strong city in which they meet with great opposition, what violent
          conflicts are there before the city is taken! How do the soldiers
          press on against the very mouths of the enemies’ cannon, and upon the
          points of their swords! When the soldiers are scaling the walls, and
          making their first entrance into the city, what a violent struggle is
          there between them and their enemies that strive to keep them out! How
          do they, as it were, agonize with all their strength! So ought we to
          seek our salvation, if we would be in a likely way to obtain it. How
          great is the folly then of those who content themselves with seeking
          with a cold and lifeless frame of spirit, and so continue from month
          to month, and from year to year, and yet flatter themselves that they
          shall be successful!
        </p>
        <p>
          How much more still are they to be reproved, who are not in a way of
          seeking their salvation at all, but wholly neglect their precious
          souls, and attend the duties of religion no further than is just
          necessary to keep up their credit among men; and instead of pressing
          into the kingdom of God, are rather violently pressing on towards
          their own destruction and ruin, being hurried on by their many head
          strong lusts, as the herd of swine were hurried on by the legion of
          devils, and ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and
          perished in the waters! Matt. 8:32.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. From what has been said under this proposition, we may learn after
          what manner Christians ought to go through the work that is before
          them. Christ had a great work before him when that took place, of
          which we have an account in the text. Though it was very near the
          close of his life, yet he then, when his agony began, had the chief
          part of the work before him that he came into the world to do; which
          was to offer up that sacrifice which he offered in his last
          sufferings, and therein to perform the greatest act of his obedience
          to God. And so the Christians have a great work to do, a service they
          are to perform to God, that is attended with great difficulty. They
          have a race set before them that they have to run, a warfare that is
          appointed them. Christ was the subject of a very great trial in the
          time of his agony; so God is wont to exercise his people with great
          trials. Christ met with great opposition in that work that he had to
          do; so believers are like to meet with great opposition in running the
          race that is set before them. Christ, as man, had a feeble nature,
          that was in itself very insufficient to sustain such a conflict, or to
          support such a load as was coming upon him. So the saints have the
          same weak human nature, and beside that, great sinful infirmities that
          Christ had not, which lay them under great disadvantages, and greatly
          enhance the difficulty of their work. Those great tribulations and
          difficulties that were before Christ, were the way in which he was to
          enter into the kingdom of heaven; so his followers must expect,
          “through much tribulation to enter into the kingdom of heaven.” The
          cross was to Christ the way to the crown of glory, and so it is to his
          disciples. The circumstances of Christ and of his followers in those
          things are alike, their case, therefore, is the same; and therefore
          Christ’s behaviour under those circumstances, was a fit example for
          them to follow. They should look to their Captain, and observe after
          what manner he went through his great work, and the great tribulations
          which he endured. They should observe after what manner he entered
          into the kingdom of heaven, and obtained the crown of glory, and so
          they also should run the race that is set before them. “Wherefore,
          seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses,
          let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset
          us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.
          Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith; who for the
          joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame,
          and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.” Particularly,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) When others are asleep they should be awake, as it was with
          Christ. The time of Christ’s agony was the night season, the time
          wherein persons were wont to be asleep: it was the time wherein the
          disciples that were about Christ were asleep; but Christ then had
          something else to do than to sleep; he had a great work to do; he kept
          awake, with his heart engaged in this work. So should it be with the
          believers of Christ; when the souls of their neighbours are asleep in
          their sins, and under the power of a lethargic insensibility and
          sloth, they should watch and pray, and maintain a lively sense of the
          infinite importance of their spiritual concerns. 1 Thess. 5:6.
          “Therefore let us not sleep, as do others, but let us watch and be
          sober.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) They should go through their work with earnest labour, as Christ
          did. The time when others were asleep was a time when Christ was about
          his great work, and was engaged in it with all his might, agonizing in
          it; conflicting and wrestling, in tears, and in blood. So should
          Christians with the utmost earnestness improve their time with souls
          engaged in this work, pushing through the opposition they meet with in
          it, pushing through all difficulties and sufferings there are in the
          way, running with patience the race set before them, conflicting with
          the enemies of their souls with all their might; as those that wrestle
          not with flesh and blood, but with principalities and powers, and the
          rulers of the darkness of this world, and spiritual wickedness in high
          places.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) This labour and strife should be, that God may be glorified, and
          their own eternal happiness obtained in a way of doing God’s will.
          Thus it was with Christ: what he so earnestly strove for was, that he
          might do the will of God, that he might keep his command, his
          difficult command, without failing in it, and that in this way God’s
          will might be done, in that glory to his ever great name, and that
          salvation to his elect that he intended by his sufferings. Here is an
          example for the saints to follow in that holy strife, and race, and
          warfare, which God has appointed them; they should strive to do the
          will of their heavenly Father, that they may, as the apostle expresses
          it, Rom. 12:2. “Prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect
          will of God,” and that in this way they may glorify God, and may come
          at last to be happy for ever in the enjoyment of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) In all the great work they have to do, their eye should be to God
          for his help to enable them to overcome. Thus did the man Christ
          Jesus: he strove in his work even to such an agony and bloody sweat.
          But how did he strive? It was not in his own strength, but his eyes
          were to God, he cries unto him for his help and strength to uphold
          him, that he might not fail; he watched and prayed, as he desired his
          disciples to do; he wrestled with his enemies and with his great
          sufferings, but at the same time wrestled with God to obtain his help,
          to enable him to get the victory. Thus the saints should use their
          strength in their Christian course to the utmost, but not as depending
          on their own strength, but crying mightily to God for his strength to
          make them conquerors.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) In this way they should hold out to the end as Christ did. Christ
          in this way was successful, and obtained the victory, and won the
          prize; he overcame, and is set down with the Father in his throne. So
          Christians should persevere and hold out in their great work to the
          end; they should continue to run their race till they have come to the
          end of it; they should be faithful unto the death as Christ was; and
          then, when they have overcome, they shall sit down with him in his
          throne. Rev. 3:21. “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me
          in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father
          in his throne.”
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Hence burdened and distressed sinners, if any such are here
          present, may have abundant ground of encouragement to come to Christ
          for salvation. Here is great encouragement to sinners to come to this
          high priest that offered up such strong crying and tears with his
          blood, for the success of his sufferings in the salvation of sinners.
          For,
        </p>
        <p>
          1st, Here is great ground of assurance that Christ stands ready to
          accept of sinners, and bestow salvation upon them; for those strong
          cries of his that he offered up in the capacity of our high priest,
          show how earnestly desirous he was of it. If he was not willing that
          sinners should be saved, be they ever so unworthy of it, then why
          would he so wrestle with God for it in such a bloody sweat? Would any
          one so earnestly cry to God with such costly cries, in such great
          labour and travail of soul, for that, that he did not desire that God
          should bestow? No, surely! but this shows how greatly his heart was
          set on the success of his redemption; and therefore since he has by
          such earnest prayers, and by such a bloody sweat, obtained salvation
          of the Father to bestow on sinners, he will surely be ready to bestow
          it upon them, if they come to him for it; otherwise he will frustrate
          his own design; and he that so earnestly cried to God that his design
          might not be frustrated, will not, after all, frustrate it himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Here is the strongest ground of assurance that God stands ready to
          accept of all those that come to him for mercy through Christ, for
          this is what Christ prayed for in those earnest prayers, whose prayers
          were always heard, as Christ says, John 11:42. “And I knew that thou
          hearest me always.” And especially may they conclude, that heard their
          high priest in those strong cries that he offered up with his blood,
          and that especially on the following account.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) They were the most earnest prayers that ever were made. Jacob was
          very earnest when he wrestled with God; and many others have wrestled
          with God with many tears; yea, doubtless, many of the saints have
          wrestled with God with such inward labour and strife as to produce
          powerful effects on the body. But so earnest was Christ, so strong was
          the labour and fervency of his heart, that he cried to God in a sweat
          of blood; so that if any earnestness and importunity in prayer ever
          prevailed with God, we may conclude that that prevailed.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) He who then prayed was the most worthy person that ever put up a
          prayer. He had more worthiness than ever men or angels had in the
          sight of God, according as by inheritance he has obtained a more
          excellent name than they; for he was the only-begotten Son of God,
          infinitely lovely in his sight, the Son in whom he declared once and
          again he was well-pleased. He was infinitely near and dear to God, and
          had more worthiness in his eyes ten thousand times than all men and
          angels put together. And can we suppose any other than that such a
          person was heard when he cried to God with such earnestness? Did
          Jacob, a poor sinful man, when he had wrestled with God, obtain of God
          the name of ISRAEL, and that encomium, that as a prince he had power
          with God, and prevailed? And did Elijah, who was a man of like
          passions, and of like corruptions with us, when he prayed, earnestly
          prevail on God to work such great wonders? And shall not the
          only-begotten Son of God, when wrestling with God in tears and blood,
          prevail, and have his request granted him?
        </p>
        <p>
          Surely there is no room to suppose any such thing; and therefore,
          there is no room to doubt whether God will bestow salvation on those
          that believe in him, at his request.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Christ offered up these earnest prayers with the best plea for an
          answer that ever was offered to God, viz. his own blood; which was an
          equivalent for the thing that he asked. He not only offered up strong
          cries, but he offered them up with a price fully sufficient to
          purchase the benefit he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) Christ offered this price and those strong cries both together;
          for at the same time that he was pouring out these earnest requests
          for the success of his redemption in the salvation of sinners, he also
          shed his blood. His blood fell down to the ground at the same instant
          that his cries went up to heaven. Let burdened and distressed sinners,
          that are ready to doubt of the efficacy of Christ’s intercession for
          such unworthy creatures as they, and to call in question God’s
          readiness to accept them for Christ’s sake, consider these things. Go
          to the garden where the Son of God was in an agony, and where he cried
          to God so earnestly, and where his sweat was, as it were, great drops
          of blood, and then see what a conclusion you will draw up from such a
          wonderful sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The godly may take great comfort in this, that Christ has as their
          high priest offered up such strong cries to God. You that have good
          evidence of your being believers in Christ, and his true followers and
          servants, may comfort yourselves in this, that Christ Jesus is your
          high priest, that that blood, which Christ shed in his agony, fell
          down to the ground for you, and that those earnest cries were sent up
          to God for you, for the success of his labours and sufferings in all
          that good you stood in need of in this world, and in your everlasting
          happiness in the world to come. This may be a comfort to you in all
          losses, and under all difficulties, that you may encourage your faith,
          and strengthen your hope, and cause you greatly to rejoice. If you
          were under any remarkable difficulties, it would be a great comfort to
          you to have the prayers of some man that you looked upon to be a man
          of eminent piety, and one that had a great interest at the throne of
          grace, and especially if you knew that he was very earnest and greatly
          engaged in prayer for you. But how much more may you be comforted in
          it, that you have an interest in the prayers and cries of the
          only-begotten and infinitely worthy Son of God, and that he was so
          earnest in his prayers for you, as you have heard!

          7. Hence we may learn how earnest Christians ought to be in their
          prayers and endeavours for the salvation of others. Christians are the
          followers of Christ, and they should follow him in this. We see from
          what we have heard, how great the labour and travail of Christ’s soul
          was for others’ salvation, and what earnest and strong cries to God
          accompanied his labours. Here he hath set us an example. Herein he
          hath set an example for ministers, who should as co-workers with
          Christ travail in birth with them till Christ be found in them. Gal.
          4:19. “My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, until
          Christ be formed in you.” They should be willing to spend and be spent
          for them. They should not only labour for them, and pray earnestly for
          them, but should, if occasion required, be ready to suffer for them,
          and to spend not only their strength, but their blood for them. 2 Cor.
          12:15. “And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you, though the
          more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.” Here is an example
          for parents, showing how they ought to labour and cry to God for the
          spiritual good of their children. You see how Christ laboured and
          strove and cried to God for the salvation of his spiritual children;
          and will not you earnestly seek and cry to God for your natural
          children?

          Here is an example for neighbours one towards another how they should
          seek and cry for the good of one another’s souls, for this is the
          command of Christ, that they should love one another as Christ loved
          them. John 15:12. Here is an example for us, showing how we should
          earnestly seek and pray for the spiritual and eternal good of our
          enemies, for Christ did all this for his enemies, and when some of
          those enemies were at that very instant plotting his death, and busily
          contriving to satiate their malice and cruelty, in his most extreme
          torments, and most ignominious destruction.
