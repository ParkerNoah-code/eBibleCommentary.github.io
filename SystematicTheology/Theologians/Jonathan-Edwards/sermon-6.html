          Sinners In Zion Tenderly Warned
        </h4>
        <p>
          Isaiah 33:14, “The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath
          surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring
          fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?”
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>Showing who are sinners in Zion.</p>
        <p>
          THERE are two kinds of persons among God’s professing people. The one,
          those who are truly godly, spoken of in the verse following the text,
          “He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly,” etc. The other
          kind consists of sinners in Zion, or hypocrites. It is to be observed
          that the prophet in this chapter speaks interchangeably, first to the
          one, and then to the other of these characters of men, awfully
          threatening and denouncing the wrath of God against the one, and
          comforting the other with gracious promises. Thus you may observe, in
          the 5th and 6th verses, there are comfortable promises to the godly.
          Then in the eight following verses, awful judgments are threatened
          against the sinners in Zion. Again, in the two next verses are blessed
          promises to the sincerely godly, and in the former part of verse 17.
          And then in the latter part of verse 17. and in verse 18 and 19 are
          terrible threatenings to sinners in Zion. Then in the verses that
          follow are gracious promises to the godly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text is part of what is said in this chapter to sinners in Zion.
          In verse 10, it is said, “Now will I rise, saith the Lord; now will I
          be exalted; now will I lift up myself,” i.e. Now will I arise to
          execute wrath upon the ungodly. I will not let them alone any longer.
          They shall see that I am not asleep, and that I am not regardless of
          mine own honor. “Now will I be exalted.” Though they have cast
          contempt upon me, yet I will vindicate the honor of my own majesty. I
          will exalt myself, and show my greatness, and my awful majesty in
          their destruction. “Now will I lift up myself.” Now I will no longer
          have mine honor trampled in the dust by them. But my glory shall be
          manifested in their misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          In verse 11, the prophet proceeds, “Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall
          bring forth stubble,” i.e. Ye shall pursue happiness in ways of
          wickedness, but you shall not obtain it. You are as ground which
          brings forth no fruit, as if only chaff were sowed in it. It brings
          forth nothing but stubble, which is fit for nothing but to be burned.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems to have been the manner in that land where the corn grew very
          rank, when they had reaped the wheat, and gathered it off from the
          ground, to set fire to the stubble, which is alluded to here. And
          therefore it is added, “Your breath, as fire, shall devour you.” i.e.
          Your own wicked speeches, your wickedness that you commit with your
          breath, or with your tongues, shall set fire to the stubble and devour
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then it follows in verse 12, “And the people shall be as the burnings
          of lime.” As they are wont to burn lime in a great and exceeding
          fierce fire, till stones, and bones, and other things are burnt to
          lime, so shall the wicked be burnt in the fire of God’s wrath. “As
          thorns cut up shall they be burnt in the fire.” As briers and thorns
          are the encumbrance and curse of the ground where they grow, and are
          wont to be burnt, so shall it be with the wicked that are among God’s
          people, and grow in God’s field. Heb. 6:7, 8, “For the earth which
          drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs
          meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: but
          that which beareth thorns and briers, is rejected, and is nigh unto
          cursing; whose end is to be burned.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then it follows in verse 13, “Hear ye that are far off, what I have
          done; and ye that are near, acknowledge my might.” This implies that
          God will by the destruction of ungodly men, manifest his glory very
          publicly, even in the sight of the whole world, both in the sight of
          those that are near, and of those that are far off. “Acknowledge my
          might.” Which implies that God will execute wrath upon ungodly men in
          such a manner as extraordinarily to show forth his great and mighty
          power. The destruction and misery of the wicked will be so dreadful,
          that it will be a manifestation of the omnipotent power of God, that
          he can execute such misery; agreeable to Rom. 9:22, “What if God,
          willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with
          much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Next follow these words: “The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness
          hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the
          devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?”
          The sense is, That the time will come, when fearfulness will surprise
          the sinners in Zion, because they will know, that they are about to be
          cast into a devouring fire, which they must suffer forever and ever,
          and which none can endure.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be inquired, who are the sinners in Zion? — I answer, that they
          are those who are in a natural condition among the visible people of
          God. Zion, or the city of David of old, was a type of the church. And
          the church of God in Scripture is perhaps more frequently called by
          the name of Zion than by any other name. And commonly by Zion is meant
          the true church of Christ, or the invisible church of true saints. But
          sometimes by this name is meant the visible church, consisting of
          those who are outwardly, by profession and external privileges, the
          people of God. This is intended by Zion in this text.
        </p>
        <p>
          The greater part of the world are sinners. Christ’s flock is, and ever
          hath been, but a little flock. And the sinners of the world are of two
          sorts: those who are visibly of Satan’s kingdom, who are without the
          pale of the visible church; and those who do not profess the true
          religion, nor attend the external ordinances of it. Beside these there
          are the sinners in Zion. Both are the objects of the displeasure and
          wrath of God. But his wrath is more especially manifested in Scripture
          against the latter. Sinners in Zion will have by far the lowest place
          in hell. They are exalted nearest to heaven in this world, and they
          will be lowest in hell in another. The same is meant by hypocrites.
          Sinners in Zion are all hypocrites. For they make a profession of the
          true religion. They attend God’s ordinances, and make a show of being
          the worshippers of God. But all is hypocrisy.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>How fearfulness will hereafter surprise sinners in Zion.</p>
        <p>
          I. They will hereafter be afraid. Now many of them seem to have little
          or no fear. They are quiet and secure. Nothing will awaken them. The
          most awful threatenings and the loudest warnings do not much move
          them. They are not so much moved with them, but they can eat, and
          drink, and sleep, and go about their worldly concerns without much
          disturbance. But the time will come, when the hardest and most stupid
          wretches will be awakened. Though now preaching will not awaken them,
          and the death of others will not make them afraid, though seeing
          others awakened and converted will not much affect them, though they
          can stand all that is to be heard and seen in a time of general
          out-pouring of the Spirit of God, without being much moved; yet the
          time will come, when they will be awakened, and fear will take hold of
          them. They will be afraid of the wrath of God. However senseless they
          be now, they will hereafter be sensible of the awful greatness of God,
          and that it is a fearful thing to fall into his hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. They will be surprised with fear. This seems to imply two things;
          viz. the greatness of their fear, and the suddenness of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the greatness of their fear. Surprise argues a high degree of
          fear. Their fears will be to the degree of astonishment. Some of the
          sinners in Zion are somewhat afraid now. They now and then have some
          degree of fear. They are not indeed convinced that there is such a
          place as hell. But they are afraid there is. They are not thoroughly
          awakened. Neither are they quite easy. They have at certain times
          inward molestations from their consciences. But they have no such
          degrees of fear, as to put them upon any through endeavors to escape
          future wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, hereafter they will have fear enough, as much, and a great
          deal more, than they will be able to stand under. Their fear will be
          to the degree of horror. They will be horribly afraid and terrors will
          take hold on them as water. Thus we read of their fear coming as a
          desolation, and of distress and anguish coming upon them; Pro. 1:27.
          It is also very emphatically said of the wicked, that trouble and
          anguish shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. Job
          15:24.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stoutest heart of them all will then melt with fear. The hearts of
          those who are of a sturdy spirit, and perhaps scorn to own themselves
          afraid of any man, and are even ashamed to own themselves afraid of
          the wrath of God, will then become as weak as water, as weak as the
          heart of a little child. And the most reserved of them will not be
          able to hide his fears. Their faces will turn pale. They will appear
          with amazement in their countenances. Every joint in them will
          tremble. All their bones will shake and their knees will smite one
          against another. Nor will they be able to refrain from crying out with
          fear, and from rending the air with the most dismal shrieks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, they will be suddenly seized with fear. The sinners in Zion
          often remain secure till they are surprised, as with a cry at
          midnight. They will be, as it were, awakened out of their secure sleep
          in a dismal fright. They will see an unexpected calamity coming upon
          them, far more dreadful than they were aware of, and coming at an
          unexpected season.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to the TIME when the wicked shall be thus surprised with
          fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is often so on a death-bed. Many things pass in their lifetime,
          which one would think might well strike terror into their souls, as
          when they see others die, who are as young as they, and of like
          condition and circumstances with themselves, whereby they may see how
          uncertain their lives are, and how unsafe their souls. It may well
          surprise many sinners, to consider how old they are grown, and are yet
          in a Christless state. How much or their opportunity to get an
          interest in Christ is irrecoverably gone, and how little remains. Also
          how much greater their disadvantages now are, than they have been. But
          these things do not terrify them. As age increases, so do the hardness
          and stupidity of their hearts grow upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when death comes, then the sinner is often filled with
          astonishment. It may be, when he is first taken sick, he has great
          hope that he shall recover; as men are ready to flatter themselves
          with hopes, that things will be as they fain would have them. But when
          the distemper comes to prevail much upon him, and he sees that he is
          going into eternity, when he sees that all the medicines of physicians
          are in vain, that all the care and endeavors of friends are to no
          purpose, that nothing seems to help him that his strength is gone,
          that his friends weep over him, and look upon his case as desperate;
          when he sees, by the countenance and behavior of the physician, that
          he looks upon his case as past hope, and perhaps overhears a
          whispering in the room, wherein his friends signify one to another,
          that they look upon it that he is struck with death, or wherein they
          tell one another, that his extreme parts grow cold, that his
          countenance and manner of breathing, and his pulse, show death, and
          that he begins to be in a cold death-sweat; and when perhaps, by and
          by, some one thinks himself bound in duty and faithfulness to let him
          know the worst, and therefore comes and asks him whether or no he be
          sensible that he is a dying: — then how does fearfulness surprise the
          sinner in Zion! How does his heart melt with fear! This is the thing
          which he feared ever since he was taken sick. But till now he had hope
          that he should recover. The physician did not speak. Or if he
          despaired, he spoke of such and such medicines as being very proper.
          And he hoped that they would be effectual. And when these failed, he
          changed his medicines, and applied something new. Then the sinner
          hoped that would be effectual. Thus, although he constantly grew worse
          and worse, still he hoped to recover.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time he cried to God to spare him, and made promises how
          he would live, if God would spare him, and he hoped that God would
          hear him. He observed also, that his friends, and perhaps the
          minister, seemed to pray earnestly for him. And he could not but hope
          that those prayers would be answered, and he should be restored. But
          now how does his heart sink and die within him! How does he look about
          with a freighted countenance! How quick is the motion of his eye,
          through inward fear! And how quick and sudden are all his motions!
          What a frightful hurry does he seem to be in! How does forever look to
          him when he sees pale grim death staring him in the face, and a vast
          eternity within a few hours or minutes of him!
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be, he still struggles for a little hope. He is loth to believe
          what is told him. He tells his informers that he hopes they are more
          affrighted than they need be. He hopes that those symptoms arise from
          some other cause. And, like a poor drowning man, he catches at slender
          and brittle twigs, and clinches his hands about whatever he sees
          within his reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as death creeps more and more on him, he sees his twigs break, all
          his hopes of life fail, and he sees he must die. O! there is nothing
          but death before him! He has been hoping, but his hopes are all
          dashed. He sees this world, and all that belongs to it, are gone. Now
          come the thoughts of hell into his mind with amazement. O! how shall
          he go out of the world? He knows he has no interest in Christ. His
          sins stare him in the face. O the dreadful gulf of eternity! He had
          been crying to God, perhaps since he was sick, to save him. And he had
          some hope, if it were his last sickness, that yet God would pity him,
          and give him pardoning grace before he should die. He begged and
          pleaded, and he hoped that God would have pity on his poor soul. At
          the same time he asked others to pray for him, and he had been looking
          day after day for some light to shine into his soul. But, alas! now he
          is a dying, and his friends ask him, how death appears to him? whether
          any light appear? whether God have not given him some token of his
          favor? And he answers, No, with a poor, faltering, trembling voice, if
          able to speak at all. Or if his friends ask a signal of hope, he can
          give none.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now death comes on him more and more, and he is just on the brink of
          eternity. Who can express the fear, the misgivings, and hangings back,
          and the horrible fright and amazement, of his soul? Some who, in such
          circumstances, have been able to speak, have been known to cry out, O
          eternity! eternity! and some, O! a thousand worlds for an inch of
          time! O! if they might but live a little while longer! But it must not
          be. Go they must. They feel the frame of nature dissolving, and
          perceive the soul is just a going. For sometimes the exercise of
          reason seems to hold to the last.
        </p>
        <p>
          What, in such a case, is felt in the soul, in those last moments, when
          it is just breaking its bands with the body, about to fetch its leap,
          on the edge of eternity, and the very brink of hell, without any
          Savior, or the lest testimony of divine mercy. I say, what is
          sometimes felt by Christless souls in these moments, none can tell.
          Nor is it within the compass of our conception.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The misery of the departed soul of a sinner, besides what it now
          feels, consists in a great part in amazing fears of what is yet to
          come. When the union of the soul and body is actually broken, and the
          body has fetched its last gasp, the soul forsakes its old habitation,
          and then falls into the hands of devils, who fly upon it, and seize it
          more violently than ever hungry lions flew upon their prey. And with
          what horror will it fall into those cruel hands!
        </p>
        <p>
          If we imagine to ourselves the dreadful fear with which a lamb or kid
          falls into the paws of a world, which lays hold of it with open mouth;
          or if we imagine to ourselves the feeling of a little child, that has
          been pursued by a lion, when it is taken hold of, and sees the
          terrible creature open his devouring jaws to tear it in pieces; or the
          feeling of those two and forty children, who had mocked Elisha, when
          they fell into the paws of the bears that [tore] them in pieces; I say
          if we could have a perfect idea of that terror and astonishment which
          a little child has in such a case, yet we should have but a faint idea
          of what is felt in the departing soul of a sinner, when it falls into
          the hands of those cruel devils those roaring lions, which then seize
          of it!
        </p>
        <p>
          And when the soul is carried to hell, and there is tormented, suffers
          the wrath of the Almighty, and is overwhelmed and crushed with it, it
          will also be amazed with the apprehensions of what shall yet remain.
          To think of an eternity of this torment remaining, O how will it fill,
          and overbear, and sink down the wretched soul! How will the thought of
          the duration of this torment without end cause the heart to melt like
          wax! How will the thought of it sink the soul into the bottomless pit
          of darkness and gloominess! Even those proud and sturdy spirits, the
          devils, tremble at the thoughts of that greater torment which they are
          to suffer at the day of judgment. So will the poor damned souls of
          men. They have already more than they will be able to bear. How then
          will they tremble at the thought of having their misery so vastly
          augmented!
        </p>
        <p>
          Persons sometimes in this world are afraid of the day of judgment. If
          there be an earthquake, or if there be more than common thunder and
          lightning, or if there be some unusual sight in the heavens, their
          hearts are ready to tremble for fear that the day of judgment is at
          hand. O how then do the poor souls in hell fear it, who know so much
          more about it, who know by what they feel already, and know certainly,
          that whenever it comes they shall stand on the left hand of the judge,
          to receive the dreadful sentence. And that then, in soul and body,
          they must enter into those everlasting burnings which are prepared for
          the devil and his angels, and who probably know that their misery is
          to be an hundred-fold greater than it is now.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Fearfulness will surprise them at the last judgment. When Christ
          shall appear in the clouds of heaven, and the last trumpet shall
          sound, then will the hearts of wicked men be surprised with
          fearfulness. The poor damned soul, in expectation of it, trembles
          every day and every hour from the time of its departure from the body.
          It knows not, indeed, when it is to be, but it knows it is to be. But
          when the alarm is given in hell that the day is come, it will be a
          dreadful alarm indeed. It will, as it were, fill the caverns of hell
          with shrieks. And when the souls of the damned shall enter into their
          bodies, it will be with amazing horror of what is coming. And when
          they shall lift up their heads out of their graves, and shall see the
          judge, it will be a most terrible sight. Gladly would they return into
          hell, their former state of misery, to hide themselves from this awful
          sight, if that would excuse them.
        </p>
        <p>
          So those sinners in Zion, who shall then be found alive on the earth,
          when they shall see this sight, will be surprised with fearfulness.
          The fear and horror which many poor sinners feel when they are dying,
          is great, and beyond all that of which we can have any idea. But that
          is nothing to the horror that will seize them when they shall come to
          see this sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will not be a wicked man upon earth who will be able to bear it,
          let him be who he will. Let him be rich or poor, old or young, male or
          female, servant or master, king or subject, learned or unlearned. Let
          him be ever so proud, ever so courageous, and ever so sturdy. There is
          not one who will be able at all to support himself. When he shall see
          this sight, it will immediately sink his spirit. It will loose the
          joints of his loins. It will make his countenance more ghastly than
          death. The rich captains, and valiant generals and princes, who now
          scorn to show any fear at the face of an enemy, who scorn to tremble
          at the roaring of cannon, will tremble and shriek when they shall hear
          the last trumpet, and see the majesty of their judge. It will make
          their teeth to chatter, and make them fly to hide themselves in the
          caves and rocks of mountains, crying to the rocks and mountains to
          fall on them, and cover them from the wrath of the judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fearfulness will surprise them when they shall be dragged before the
          judgment-seat. The wicked hang back when they are about to meet death.
          But in no measure as they will hang back when they come to meet their
          great judge. And when they come to stand before the judge, and are put
          on his left hand, fearfulness and amazement will surprise them. The
          majesty of the judge will be intolerable to them. His pure and holy
          eye, which will behold and search them, and pierce them through, will
          be more terrible to their souls a thousand times than flashes of
          lightning piercing their hearts. They will they stand in a trembling,
          expectation, that by and by they shall hear the words of that dreadful
          sentence proceed out of the mouth of Christ. They will have a horrible
          expectation of that sentence. And what shall they do, whither shall
          they fly, so as to be out of its hearing? They cannot shut their ears,
          so as not to hear it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fearfulness will surprise them when the sentence shall come to be
          pronounced. At the close of the judgment, that dreadful doom will be
          uttered by the judge. And it will be the most terrible voice that ever
          was heard. The sound of the last trumpet, that shall call men to
          judgment, will be a more terrible sound to wicked men than ever they
          shall have heard till that time. But the sound of the last sentence
          will be much more terrible than that. There will not be one of all
          those millions at the left hand, whether high or low, king or subject,
          who will be able to support himself at all under the sound of that
          sentence. But they will all sink under it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, fearfulness will surprise them, when they shall come to see
          the fire kindle upon the world, in which they are to be tormented
          forever. When the sentence shall have been pronounced, Christ, with
          his blessed saints and glorious angels, will leave this lower world,
          and ascend into heaven. Then will the flames begin to kindle, and fire
          will probably be seen coming down from heaven. And soon will the fire
          lay hold of that accursed multitude. Then will their hearts be
          surprised with fearfulness. That fire will appear a dreadful fire
          indeed. O what chatterings of teeth, what shaking of loins, what
          distortions of body, will there be at that time, when they shall see,
          and begin to feel, the fierceness of the flames! What shall they do,
          whither shall they go, to avoid those flames? Where shall they hide
          themselves? If they creep into holes, or creep into caves of the
          earth, yea if they could creep down to the center of the earth, it
          will be in vain. For it will set on fire the bottoms of the mountains,
          and burn to the lowest hell. They will see no place to fly to, no
          place to hide themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then their hearts will be filled with fearfulness and will utterly
          sink in despair. Thus it shall hereafter be with every one that shall
          then be found to be a sinner, and especially with sinners in Zion.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>Why sinners in general will hereafter be surprised with fear.</p>
        <p>
          I. Fearfulness will surprise them because they will know that they are
          to be cast into devouring fire. There is nothing which seems to give
          one a more terrible idea of torment and misery than to think of being
          cast alive into a great fire, especially if we conceive of the senses
          remaining quick, and not benumbed by the fire. The wicked will
          hereafter have that to make them afraid, that they are not only to be
          cast into a fire, but into devouring fire; which implies, that it will
          be a fire of extraordinary fierceness of heat, and before which
          nothing can stand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fire into which men are to be cast is called a furnace of fire.
          Furnaces are contrived for an extreme degree of heat, this being
          necessary for the purposes for which they are designed, as the running
          and refining of metals, and the melting of materials into glass. The
          fire of such earthly furnaces may be called devouring fire, as the
          heat of some of them is such, that in them even stones will presently
          be dissolved. Now, if a person should be brought to the mouth of such
          a furnace, and there should see how the fire glows, so as presently to
          make everything cast into it all over white and bright with fire, and
          at the same time should know that he was immediately to be cast into
          this furnace, would not fearfulness surprise him?
        </p>
        <p>
          In some heathen countries, the manner of disposing of dead bodies is
          to dig a great pit, to put in it a great quantity of fuel, to put the
          dead bodies on the pile, and to set it on fire. This is some image of
          the burning of dead souls in the pit of hell. Now, if a person were
          brought to the edge of such a pit, all filled with glowing flames, to
          be immediately cast into it, would it not surprise the heart with
          fearfulness?
        </p>
        <p>
          The flames of a very great fire, as when a house is all on fire, give
          one some idea of the fierceness of the wrath of God. Such is the rage
          of the flames. And we see that the greater a fire is, the fiercer is
          its heat in every part. And the reason is because one part heats
          another. The heat in a particular place, besides the heat which
          proceeds out of the fuel in that place is increased by the additional
          heat of the fire all around it. Hence we may conceive something of
          what fierceness that fire will be, when this visible world shall be
          turned into one great furnace. That will be devouring fire indeed.
          Such will be the heat of it, that, as the apostle says, “the elements
          shall melt with fervent heat,” 2 Pet. 3:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men can artificially raise such a degree of heat with burning glasses,
          as will quickly melt the very stones and sand. And it is probable that
          the heat of that great fire which will burn the world, will be such as
          to melt the rocks, and the very ground, and turn them into a kind of
          liquid fire, so that the whole world will probably be converted into a
          great lake, or liquid globe of fire, a vast ocean of fire, in which
          the wicked shall be tossed to and fro, having no rest day nor night,
          vast waves or billows of fire continually rolling over their heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          But all this will be only an image of that dreadful fire of the wrath
          of God, which the wicked shall at the same time suffer in their souls.
          We read in Rev. 19:15 of “the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.”
          This is an extraordinary expression, carrying a terrible idea of the
          future misery of the wicked. If it had been only said of the wrath of
          God that would have expressed what is dreadful. If the wrath of a king
          be as the roaring of a lion, what is the wrath of God? But it is not
          only said the wrath of God, but the fierceness and wrath of God, or
          the rage of his wrath; and not only so, but the fierceness and wrath
          of Almighty God. O what is that! the fierceness and rage or fury of
          Omnipotence! of a being of infinite strength! What an idea does that
          give of the state of those worms that suffer the fierceness and wrath
          of such an Almighty Being! And is it any wonder that fearfulness
          surprises their hearts when they see this about to be executed upon
          them?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Another reason given in the text, why fearfulness will hereafter
          surprise sinners, is that they will be sensible this devouring fire
          will be everlasting. If a man were brought to the mouth of a great
          furnace to be cast into the midst of it, if at the same time he knew
          he should suffer torment but for one minute, yet that minute would be
          so terrible to him, that fearfulness would surprise and astonish him.
          How much more, if he were to be cast into a fire much fiercer, the
          fire in which wicked men are hereafter to be tormented! And if the
          thought of suffering this devouring fire for one minute would be
          enough to fill one with such surprising fearfulness, what will seize
          them, when they shall know that they are to bear it, not for one
          minute, nor for one day, nor for one year, nor for one age, nor for a
          hundred ages, nor for a million of ages, one after another, but
          forever and ever; without any end, and never, never be delivered!
        </p>
        <p>
          They shall know that the fire itself will be everlasting fire, a fire
          that never shall be quenched. Mark 9:43, 44, “To go into hell, into
          the fire that never shall be quenched; where their worm dieth not, and
          the fire is not quenched.” And they shall know that their torment in
          that fire never will have an end, Rev. 14:10, 11. They shall know that
          they shall forever be full of quick sense within and without; their
          heads, their eves, their tongues, their hands, their feet, their
          loins, and their vitals, shall forever be full of glowing melting
          fire, fierce enough to melt the very rocks and elements. And also that
          they shall eternally be full of the most quick and lively sense to
          feel the torment.
        </p>
        <p>
          They shall know that they shall never cease restlessly to plunge and
          roll in that mighty ocean of fire. They shall know that those billows
          of fire, which are greater than the greatest mountains, will never
          cease to roll over them, following one another forever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time they will have a more lively sense of eternity than
          we ever can have here. We can have but a little sense of what an
          eternal duration is. And indeed none can comprehend it. It swallows up
          all thought and imagination. If we set ourselves to think upon it, we
          are presently lost. But they will have another and far clearer sense
          of it than we have. O how vast will eternity appear to them, when they
          think of spending it in such burnings! This is another reason that
          fearfulness will surprise them. The thoughts of eternity will always
          amaze them, and will sink and depress them to a bottomless depth of
          despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The third reason given in the text why fearfulness will surprise
          them at the apprehension of this punishment is that they will know
          they shall not be able to bear it. When they shall see themselves
          going into that devouring fire, they will know that they are not able
          to bear it. They will know that they are not able to grapple with the
          fierceness and rage of those flames. For they will see the fierceness
          of the wrath of God in them. They will see an awful manifestation of
          Omnipotence in the fury of that glowing furnace. And in those views,
          their hearts will utterly fail them. Their hands will not be strong,
          nor can their hearts endure. They will see that their strength is
          weakness, and that they can do nothing in such a conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          When they shall have come to the edge of the pit and of the burning
          lake, and shall look into the furnace, then they will cry out with
          exclamations like these: O! what shall I do? How shall I bear the
          torments of this fire? How can I endure them? Who can endure? Where is
          the man so stout-hearted, where is the giant of such strength and such
          courage, that he can bear this? O! what shall I do? Must I be cast in
          thither? I cannot bear it. I can never endure it. O that I could
          return to my first nothing! How can I endure it one moment? How much
          less can I endure it forever and ever! And must I bear it forever?
          What! forever and ever, without any end, and never find any refuge,
          never be suffered to return to my first nothing, and be no nearer to
          the end of these sufferings after millions of ages? O what dismal
          contentions and shrieks, and shaking of loins, and gnashing of teeth,
          will there be then! No wonder that fearfulness will then surprise the
          wicked.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IV</p>
        <p>
          Why it will be especially thus with sinners in Zion, who dwell among
          God’s visible people.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will hereafter be a very great difference between sinners in
          Zion and other sinners; a great difference between the most pointed
          hypocrite of them all, and the drunkards, the adulterers, the
          Sodomites, the thieves, and murderers among the heathen, who sin
          against only the light of nature. The fearfulness which will be in no
          measure so amazing and horrible, as that which will seize the sinners
          in Zion. That fierceness and wrath of Almighty God, which they will
          suffer, will be mild and moderate in comparison with that which the
          sinners in Zion will suffer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wrath of God is in his word manifested against the wicked
          heathens. But it is ten times as much manifested against those sinners
          who make the profession and enjoy the privileges of the people of God;
          and yet remain enemies of God. Both the Old Testament and the New are
          full of terrible denunciations against such. Read the books of Moses,
          read the prophets, and you will find them full of dreadful
          threatenings against such. Read over the history of Christ’s life and
          the speeches which he made when upon earth. There you will see what
          woes and curses he frequently denounced against such. How often did he
          say, that it should be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the
          day of judgment, than for the cities in which most of his mighty works
          were done! Read over the history of the Acts of the Apostles, and
          their epistles. There you will find the same. It is the sinners in
          Zion, or hypocrites, that are always in Scripture spoken of as the
          people of God’s wrath. Isa. 10:6, “I will send him against a
          hypocritical nation, against the people of my wrath will I give him a
          charge, to take the spoil.” — The reasons are chiefly these:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That they sin against so much greater light. This is often spoken
          of in Scripture as an aggravation to the sin and wickedness of sinners
          in Zion. He that knows not his Lord’s will, and doeth it not, is
          declared not to be worthy of so many stripes, as he who, being
          informed of his Lord’s will, is in like manner disobedient. If men be
          blind, they have comparatively no sin. But then they see, when they
          have light to know their duty, and to know their obligation, then
          their sin is great, John 9:14. When the light that is in a man is
          darkness, how great is that darkness! And when men live in wickedness,
          in the midst of great light, that light is like to be the blackness of
          darkness indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That they sin against such professions and vows. The heathens
          never pretended to be the worshippers of the true God. They never
          pretended to be Christ’s disciples. They never came under any
          covenant-obligations to be such. But this is not the case with sinners
          in Zion. Now, God highly resents falsehood and treachery. Judas, who
          betrayed Christ with a kiss, was a greater sinner, and much more the
          object of God’s wrath, than Pilate, who condemned him to be crucified,
          and was his murderer.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. That they sin against so much greater mercy. They have the
          infinite mercy of God, in giving his own Son, often set before them.
          They have the dying love of Christ represented to them. They have this
          mercy, this glorious Savior, his blood and righteousness, often
          offered to them. They have a blessed opportunity to obtain salvation
          for their souls. A great price is put into their hands to this end.
          They have that precious treasure, the Holy Scriptures, and enjoy
          Sabbaths, and sacraments, and the various means of grace. But all
          these means and advantages, these opportunities, offers mercies, and
          invitations, they abuse, despise, and reject.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is no wrath like that which arises from mercy abused and
          rejected. When mercy is in this way turned into wrath, this is the
          fiercest wrath. — Sinners in Zion, beside their fall by the first
          Adam, have a fall also by the second. He is a stone of stumbling and a
          rock of offense, at which they stumble and fall. And there is no fall
          like this. The fall by the first Adam is light in comparison with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On these accounts, whenever we see the day of judgment, as every one
          of us shall see it, we shall easily distinguish between the sinners in
          Zion and other sinners by their shriller cries, their louder, more
          bitter, and dolorous shrieks, the greater amazement of their
          countenances, and the more dismal shaking of their limbs, and
          contortions of their bodies.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION V</p>
        <p>
          An earnest exhortation to sinners in Zion, now to fly from the
          devouring fire and everlasting burnings.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have often been exhorted to fly from the “wrath to come.” This
          devouring fire, these everlasting burnings, of which we have been
          speaking, are the wrath to come. You hear of this fire, of these
          burnings, and of that fearfulness which will seize and surprise
          sinners in Zion hereafter. And O what reason have you of thankfulness
          that you only hear of them, that you do not as yet feel them, and that
          they have not already taken hold of you! They are, as it were,
          following you, and coming nearer and nearer every day. Those fierce
          flames are already kindled in the wrath of God. Yea, the fierceness
          and wrath of Almighty God burn against you. It is ready for you. That
          pit is prepared for you with fire and much wood, and the wrath of the
          Lord, as a stream of brimstone, does kindle it.

          Lot was with great urgency hastened out of Sodom, and commanded to
          make haste, and fly for his life, and escape to the mountains, lest he
          should be consumed in those flames which burned up Sodom and Gomorrah.
          But that burning was a mere spark to that devouring fire, and those
          everlasting burnings, of which you are in danger. Therefore improve
          the present opportunity.

          Now, God is pleased again to put out his Spirit upon us. And he is
          doing great things amongst us. God is indeed come again, the same
          great God who so wonderfully appeared among us some years ago, and who
          has since, for our sins, departed from us, left us so long in so dull
          and dead a state, and has let sinners alone in their sins, so that
          there have been scarcely any sins to be seen of any such work as
          conversion. That same God is now come again. He is really come in like
          manner, and begins, as he did before, gloriously to manifest his
          mighty power, and the riches of his grace. He brings sinners out of
          darkness into marvelous light. He rescues poor captive souls out of
          the hands of Satan. He saves persons from the devouring fire. He
          plucks one and another as brands out of the burnings. He opens the
          prison-doors and knocks off their chains and brings out poor
          prisoners. He is now working salvation among us from this very
          destruction of which you have now heard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, now, then, is the time, now is the blessed opportunity to escape
          those everlasting burnings. Now God has again set open the same
          fountain among us, and gives one more happy opportunity for souls to
          escape. Now he has set open a wide door, and he stands in the
          door-way, calling and begging with a loud voice to the sinners of
          Zion: Come, saith he, come, fly from the wrath to come. Here is a
          refuge for you. Fly hither for refuge. Lay hold on the hope set before
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little while ago, it was uncertain whether we should ever see such
          an opportunity again. If it had always continued as it has been for
          some years past, almost all of you would surely have gone to hell. In
          a little time fearfulness would have surprised you and you would have
          been cast into that devouring fire and those everlasting burnings. But
          in infinite mercy God gives another opportunity. And blessed are your
          eyes, that they see it, if you did but know your own opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have had your life spared through these six years past, to this
          very time, to another outpouring of the Spirit. What would you have
          done if you had died before it came? How doleful would your case have
          been ! But you have reason to bless God that it was not so, and that
          you are yet alive, and now again see a blessed day of grace. And will
          you not improve it? Have you not so much love to your poor souls, as
          to improve such an opportunity as this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Some, there is reason to think, have lately fled for refuge to Christ.
          And will you be willing to stay behind still, poor miserable captives,
          condemned to suffer forever in the lake of fire? Hereafter you will
          see those of your neighbors and acquaintance who are converted,
          mounting up as with wings, with songs of joy, to meet their Lord. And
          if you remain unconverted, you at the same time will be surprised with
          fear and horror will take hold of you, because of the devouring fire,
          and the everlasting burnings.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is an awful thing to think of, that there are now some persons in
          this very congregation, here and there, who will be the subjects of
          that very misery of which we have now heard, although it be eternal!
          There are probably some now reading or hearing this discourse, who
          shall be seen at the day of judgment, among the devils, at the left
          hand of the judge, with freighted, ghastly countenances, wringing
          their hands, gnashing their teeth, shrieking and crying out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we know not their names, nor where to look for them. But God
          knoweth their names, and now seeth and knoweth what they think, and
          how much they regard the warnings which are given them this day. We
          have not the least reason to suppose any other than that some of you
          will hereafter see others entering into glory with Christ, and saints,
          and angels, while you, with dreadful horror, shall see the fire begin
          to kindle about you. It may be, that the persons are now blessing
          themselves in their own hearts, and each one saying with himself,
          Well, I do not intend it shall be I. Every one hopes to go to heave.
          None would by any means miss of it. If any thought they should miss of
          it, they would be greatly amazed. But all will not go thither; it will
          undoubtedly be the portion of some to toss and tumble forever among
          the fiery billows of God’s wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not to be supposed, but that there are some here who will not be
          in earnest. Let them have ever so good an opportunity to obtain
          heaven, they will not thoroughly improve it. Tell them of hell as
          often as you will, and set it out in as lively colors as you will,
          they will be slack and slothful. And they will never be likely to
          obtain heaven while they are sleeping, and dreaming, and intending,
          and hoping. The wrath of God, which pursues them, will take them by
          the heels. Hell, that follows after, will overtake them. And a tempest
          will steal them away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is it to be supposed, that all who are now seeking will hold out.
          Some will backslide. They will be unsteady. If now they seem to be
          pretty much engaged, it will not hold. Times will probably alter by
          and by, and they having not obtained grace, there will be many
          temptations to backsliding, with which they will comply. The hearts of
          men are very unsteady. They are not to be trusted. Men are very
          short-winded. They cannot tell how to have patience to wait upon God.
          They are soon discouraged. Some that are now under convictions may
          lose them. Perhaps they will not leave off seeking salvation at once.
          But they will come to it by degrees. After a while, they will begin to
          hearken to excuses, not to be quite so constant in duty. They will
          begin to think that they need not be quite so strict. They will say to
          themselves, they see no hurt in such and such things. They see into
          but they may practice them without any great guilt. Thus giving way to
          temptations, and hearkening to excuses, they will by degrees lose
          their convictions, and become secure in sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were some who were guilty of backsliding, the last time of the
          revival of religion among us. While the talk upon religious subjects
          was generally kept alive, they continued to seek. But when this began
          to abate, and they saw others less zealous than they had been, and
          especially when they saw some miscarriages of professors, they began
          to grow more careless, to seek less earnestly, and to plead these
          things as an excuse. And they are left behind still. They are to this
          day in a miserable condemned state, in danger of the devouring fire,
          and of everlasting burnings, in twice so dangerous a state as they
          were in before they were awakened. And God only knows what will become
          of them. And as it was then, so we dread it will be now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some who are now in a natural condition, are doubtless near death.
          They have not long to live in the world. And if they seek in a dull
          way, or if, after they have sought for a while, they are guilty of
          backsliding, death will come upon them long enough before there will
          come such another opportunity. When they leave off seeking, it will
          not be without a design of seeking again some time or other. But death
          will be too quick for them. It is not the manner of death to wait upon
          men, while they take time to indulge their sloth, and gratify their
          lusts. When his appointed time comes, he will do his work. Will you
          put off in hope of seeing another such time seven years hence? Alas!
          how many of those who are now in a natural condition may be in hell
          before another seven years shall have elapsed!
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore now let every one look to himself. It is for your own souls’
          salvation. If you be foolish, and will not hearken to counsel, will
          not improve the opportunity when it is given you, and will not enter
          into such an open door, you alone must bear it. If you shall miss this
          opportunity, and quench your convictions now, and there shall come
          another time of the outpouring of the Spirit, you will be far less
          likely to have any profit by it. As we see now God chiefly moves on
          the hearts of those who are very young, who are brought forward upon
          the stage of action since the last outpouring of the Spirit, who were
          not then come to years of so much understanding, and consequently not
          so much in the way of the influences of the Spirit. As to those who
          were grown up, and had convictions then, and quenched them, the most
          of these are abundantly more hardened, and seem to be more passed
          over. So it will probably be with you hereafter, if you miss this
          opportunity, and quench the convictions of the Spirit which you have
          now.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to you who had awakenings the last time of the outpouring of the
          Spirit, and have quenched them, and remain to this day in a natural
          condition, let me call upon you also, now that God is giving you one
          more such opportunity. If passing in impenitence through one such
          opportunity has so hardened you, and has been such a great
          disadvantage to you, how sad will your case be, if you shall now miss
          another! Will you not thoroughly awake out of sleep, bestir yourselves
          for your salvation, and resolve now to begin again, and never leave
          off more? Many fled for refuge from the devouring fire before, and you
          were left behind. Others have fled for refuge now, and still you are
          left behind. And will you always remain behind? Consider, can you
          dwell with devouring fire? Can you dwell with everlasting burnings?
          Shall children, babes and sucklings, go into the kingdom of God before
          you?
        </p>
        <p>
          How will you hereafter bear to see them coming and sitting down with
          Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of God, when yourselves are
          thrust out, and are surprised with fearfulness at the sight of that
          devouring fire, and those everlasting burnings, into which you are
          about to be cast? Take heed lest a like threatening be fulfilled upon
          you with that which we have in Num. 14:22, 23, “Because all those men
          which have seen my glory, and my miracles which I did in Egypt, and in
          the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not
          hearkened to my voice; surely they shall not see the land which I
          sware unto their fathers; neither shall any of them that provoked me
          see it.” Together with verse 31, “But your little ones, which ye said
          should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land
          which ye have despised.”
