        <h2>The Excellency of Jesus Christ – Revelation 5:5-6</h2>
        <p class="title">Dated August 1736. 3 sermons.</p>
        <p>
          Revelation 5:5-6, “And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not:
          behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath
          prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And
          I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts,
          and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain.”
        </p>
        <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
        <p>
          THE visions and revelations the apostle John had of the future events
          of God’s providence, are here introduced with a vision of the book of
          God’s decrees, by which those events were fore-ordained. This is
          represented in verse1 as a book in the right hand of him who sat on
          the throne, “written within and on the back side, and sealed with
          seven seals.” Books, in the form in which they were wont of old to be
          made, were broad leaves of parchment or paper, or something of that
          nature, joined together at one edge, and so rolled up together, and
          then sealed, or some way fastened together, to prevent their unfolding
          and opening. Hence we read of the roll of a book Jer. 36:2. It seems
          to have been such a book that John had a vision of here, and therefore
          it is said to be “written within and on the back side,” i. e. on the
          inside pages, and also on one of the outside pages, viz. that which it
          was rolled in, in rolling the book up together. And it is said to be
          “sealed with seven seals,” to signify that what was written in it was
          perfectly hidden and secret, or that God’s decrees of future events
          are sealed, and shut up from all possibility of being discovered by
          creatures, till God is pleased to make them known. We find that seven
          is often used in Scripture as the number of perfection, to signify the
          superlative or most perfect degree of anything, which probably arose
          from this, that on the seventh day God beheld the works of creation
          finished, and rested and rejoiced in them, as being complete and
          perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          When John saw this book, he tells us, he “saw a strong angel
          proclaiming with a loud voice, ‘Who is worthy to open the book, and to
          loose the seals thereof?’ And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither
          under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.”
          And that he wept much, because “no man was found worthy to open and
          read the book, neither to look thereon.” (Rev. 5:2-4) And then tells
          us how his tears were dried up, namely, that “one of the elders said
          unto him, “Weep not, Behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah hath
          prevailed” etc. as in the text. Though no man nor angel, nor any mere
          creature, was found either able to loose the seals, or worthy to be
          admitted to the privilege of reading the book, yet this was declared,
          for the comfort of this beloved disciple, that Christ was found both
          able and worthy. And we have an account in the succeeding chapters how
          he actually did it, opening the seals in order, first one and then
          another, revealing what God had decreed should come to pass hereafter.
          And we have an account in this chapter, of his coming and taking the
          book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne, and of the
          joyful praises that were sung to him in heaven and earth on that
          occasion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many things might be observed in the words of the text, but it is to
          my present purpose only to take notice of the two distinct
          appellations here given to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.He is called a Lion. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah. He
          seems to be called the Lion of the tribe of Judah, in allusion to what
          Jacob said in his blessing of the tribe on his death-bed, who when he
          came to bless Judah, compares him to a lion, Gen. 49:9, “Judah is a
          lion’s whelp; from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped
          down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him
          up?” And also to the standard of the camp of Judah in the wilderness,
          on which was displayed a lion, according to the ancient tradition of
          the Jews. It is much on account of the valiant acts of David that the
          tribe of Judah, of which David was, is in Jacob’s prophetical blessing
          compared to a lion, but more especially with an eye to Jesus Christ,
          who also was of that tribe, and was descended of David, and is in our
          text called “the Root of David.” Therefore Christ is here called “the
          Lion of the tribe of Judah.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He is called a Lamb. John was told of a Lion that had prevailed to
          open the book, and probably expected to see a lion in his vision. But
          while he is expecting, behold a Lamb appears to open the book, an
          exceeding diverse kind of creature from a lion. A lion is a devourer,
          one that is wont to make terrible slaughter of others, and no creature
          more easily falls a prey to him than a lamb. And Christ is here
          represented not only as a Lamb, a creature very liable to be slain,
          but a “Lamb as it had been slain,” that is, with the marks of its
          deadly wounds appearing on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That which I would observe from the words, for the subject of my
          present discourse, is this, viz. —
        </p>
        <p>
          “There is an admirable conjunction of diverse excellencies in Jesus
          Christ.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The lion and the lamb, though very diverse kinds of creatures, yet
          have each their peculiar excellencies. The lion excels in strength,
          and in the majesty of his appearance and voice: the lamb excels in
          meekness and patience, besides the excellent nature of the creature as
          good for food, and yielding that which is fit for our clothing and
          being suitable to be offered in sacrifice to God. But we see that
          Christ is in the text compared to both, because the diverse
          excellencies of both wonderfully meet in him, — In handling this
          subject I would
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Show wherein there is an admirable conjunction of diverse
          excellencies in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. How this admirable conjunction of excellencies appear in Christ’s
          acts.
        </p>
        <p>And then make application.</p>
        <p>
          I. I would show wherein there is an admirable conjunction of diverse
          excellencies in Jesus Christ. Which appears in three things:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, there is a conjunction of such excellencies in Christ, as in
          our manner of conceiving, are very diverse one from another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, there is in him a conjunction of such really diverse
          excellencies, as otherwise would have seemed to us utterly
          incompatible in the same subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, such diverse excellencies are exercised in him towards men that
          otherwise would have seemed impossible to be exercised towards the
          same object.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, there is a conjunction of such excellencies in Christ, as, in
          our manner of conceiving, are very diverse one from another. Such are
          the various divine perfections and excellencies that Christ is
          possessed of. Christ is a divine person; and therefore has all the
          attributes of God. The difference between these is chiefly relative,
          and in our manner of conceiving them. And those which, in this sense,
          are most diverse, meet in the person of Christ. I shall mention two
          instances.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. There do meet in Jesus Christ infinite highness and infinite
          condescension. Christ, as he is God, is infinitely great and high
          above all. He is higher than the kings of the earth, for he is King of
          kings, and Lord of lords. He is higher than the heavens, and higher
          than the highest angels of heaven. So great is he, that all men, all
          kings and princes, are as worms of the dust before him. All nations
          are as the drop of the bucket, and the light dust of the balance, yea,
          and angels themselves are as nothing before him. He is so high, that
          he is infinitely above any need of us, above our reach that we cannot
          be profitable to him, and above our conceptions that we cannot
          comprehend him. Pro. 30:4 “What is his name, and what is his Son’s
          name, if thou canst tell?” Our understandings, if we stretch them
          never so far, cannot reach up to his divine glory. Job 11:8 “It is
          high as heaven, what canst thou do?” Christ is the Creator and great
          Possessor of heaven and earth. He is sovereign Lord of all. He rules
          over the whole universe, and does whatsoever pleaseth him. His
          knowledge is without bound. His wisdom is perfect, and what none can
          circumvent. His power is infinite, and none can resist him. His riches
          are immense and inexhaustible. His majesty is infinitely awful.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet he is one of infinite condescension. None are so low or
          inferior, but Christ’s condescension is sufficient to take a gracious
          notice of them. He condescends not only to the angels, humbling
          himself to behold the things that are done in heaven, but he also
          condescends to such poor creatures as men, and that not only so as to
          take notice of princes and great men, but of those that are of meanest
          rank and degree, “the poor of the world,” Jam. 2:5. Such as are
          commonly despised by their fellow creatures, Christ does not despise.
          1 Cor. 1:28 “Base things of the world, and things that are despised,
          hath God chosen.” Christ condescends to take notice of beggars (Luke
          16:22) and people of the most despised nations. In Christ Jesus is
          neither “Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free” Col. 3:11. He that is
          thus high condescends to take a gracious notice of little children,
          Mat. 19:14, “Suffer little children to come unto me.” Yea, which is
          more, his condescension is sufficient to take a gracious notice of the
          most unworthy, sinful creatures, those that have no good deservings,
          and those that have infinite ill-deservings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yea, so great is his condescension, that it is not only sufficient to
          take some gracious notice of such as these, but sufficient for
          everything that is an act of condescension. His condescension is great
          enough to become their friend, to become their companion, to unite
          their souls to him in spiritual marriage. It is enough to take their
          nature upon him, to become one of them, that he may be one with them.
          Yea, it is great enough to abase himself yet lower for them, even to
          expose himself to shame and spitting; yea, to yield up himself to an
          ignominious death for them. And what act of condescension can be
          conceived of greater? Yet such an act as this, has his condescension
          yielded to, for those that are so low and mean, despicable and
          unworthy!
        </p>
        <p>
          Such a conjunction of infinite highness and low condescension, in the
          same person, is admirable. We see, by manifold instances, what a
          tendency a high station has in men, to make them to be of a quite
          contrary disposition. If one worm be a little exalted above another,
          by having more dust, or a bigger dunghill, how much does he make of
          himself! What a distance does he keep from those that are below him!
          And a little condescension is what he expects should be made much of,
          and greatly acknowledged. Christ condescends to wash our feet, but how
          would great men (or rather the bigger worms), account themselves
          debased by acts of far less condescension!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There meet in Jesus Christ, infinite justice and infinite grace. As
          Christ is a divine person, he is infinitely holy and just, hating sin,
          and disposed to execute condign punishment for sin. He is the Judge of
          the world, and the infinitely just Judge of it, and will not at all
          acquit the wicked, or by any means clear the guilty.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet he is infinitely gracious and merciful. Though his justice be
          so strict with respect to all sin, and every breach of the law, yet he
          has grace sufficient for every sinner, and even the chief of sinners.
          And it is not only sufficient for the most unworthy to show them
          mercy, and bestow some good upon them, but to bestow the greatest
          good. Yea, it is sufficient to bestow all good upon them, and to do
          all things for them. There is no benefit or blessing that they can
          receive, so great but the grace of Christ is sufficient to bestow it
          on the greatest sinner that ever lived. And not only so, but so great
          is his grace, that nothing is too much as the means of this good. It
          is sufficient not only to do great things, but also to suffer in order
          to do it, and not only to suffer, but to suffer most extremely even
          unto death, the most terrible of natural evils, and not only death,
          but the most ignominious and tormenting, and every way the most
          terrible that men could inflict; yea, and greater sufferings than men
          could inflict, who could only torment the body. He had sufferings in
          his soul, that were the more immediate fruits of the wrath of God
          against the sins of those he undertakes for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, there do meet in the person of Christ such really diverse
          excellencies, which otherwise would have been thought utterly
          incompatible in the same subject: such as are conjoined in no other
          person whatever, either divine, human, or angelical; and such as
          neither men nor angels would ever have imagined could have met
          together in the same person, had it not been seen in the person of
          Christ. I would give some instances.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the person of Christ do meet together infinite glory and lowest
          humility. Infinite glory, and the virtue of humility, meet in no other
          person but Christ. They meet in no created person, for no created
          person has infinite glory, and they meet in no other divine person but
          Christ. For though the divine nature be infinitely abhorrent to pride,
          yet humility is not properly predicable of God the Father, and the
          Holy Ghost, that exists only in the divine nature, because it is a
          proper excellency only of a created nature. For it consists radically
          in a sense of a comparative lowness and littleness before God, or the
          great distance between God and the subject of this virtue. But it
          would be a contradiction to suppose any such thing in God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in Jesus Christ, who is both God and man, those two diverse
          excellencies are sweetly united. He is a person infinitely exalted in
          glory and dignity. Phil. 2:6, “Being in the form of God, he thought it
          not robbery to be equal with God.” There is equal honor due to him
          with the Father. John 5:23. — “That all men should honor the Son, even
          as they honor the Father.” God himself says to him, “Thy throne, O
          God, is for ever and ever,” Heb. 1:8. And there is the same supreme
          respect and divine worship paid to him by the angels of heaven, as to
          God the Father, verse 6, “Let all the angels of God worship him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But however he is thus above all, yet he is lowest of all in humility.
          There never was so great an instance of this virtue among either men
          or angels, as Jesus. None ever was so sensible of the distance between
          God and him, or had a heart so lowly before God, as the man Christ
          Jesus. Mat. 11:29. What a wonderful spirit of humility appeared in
          him, when he was here upon earth, in all his behavior! In his
          contentment in his mean outward condition, contentedly living in the
          family of Joseph the carpenter and Mary his mother for thirty years
          together, and afterwards choosing outward meanness, poverty, and
          contempt, rather than earthly greatness: in his washing his disciples’
          feet, in all his speeches and deportment towards them, in his
          cheerfully sustaining the form of a servant through his whole life,
          and submitting to such immense humiliation at death!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the person of Christ do meet together infinite majesty and
          transcendent meekness. These again are two qualifications that meet
          together in no other person but Christ. Meekness, properly so called,
          is a virtue proper only to the creature. We scarcely ever find
          meekness mentioned as a divine attribute in Scripture, at least not in
          the New Testament. For thereby seems to be signified, a calmness and
          quietness of spirit, arising from humility in mutable beings that are
          naturally liable to be put into a ruffle by the assaults of a
          tempestuous and injurious world. But Christ, being both God and man,
          has both infinite majesty and superlative meekness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ was a person of infinite majesty. It is he that is spoken of,
          Psa. 45:3, “Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy
          glory and thy majesty.” It is he that is mighty, that rideth on the
          heavens, and his excellency on the sky. It is he that is terrible out
          of his holy places, who is mightier than the noise of many waters,
          yea, than the mighty waves of the sea; before whom a fire goeth and
          burneth up his enemies round about; at whose presence the earth quakes
          and the hills melt; who sitteth on the circle of the earth and all the
          inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; who rebukes the sea and
          maketh it dry and drieth up the rivers; whose eyes are as a flame of
          fire; from whose presence, and from the glory of whose power, the
          wicked shall be punished with everlasting destruction; who is the
          blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords; who
          has heaven for his throne and the earth for his footstool and is the
          high and lofty One who inhabits eternity; whose kingdom is an
          everlasting kingdom, and of whose dominion there is no end.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet he was the most marvelous instance of meekness, and humble
          quietness of spirit, that ever was, agreeable to the prophecies of
          him, Mat. 21:4, 5, “All this was done, that it might be fulfilled
          which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion,
          Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and
          a colt the foal of an ass.” And, agreeable to what Christ declares of
          himself, Mat. 11:29, “I am meek and lowly in heart.” And agreeable to
          what was manifest in his behavior, for there never was such an
          instance seen on earth of a meek behavior, under injuries and
          reproaches, and towards enemies, who when he was reviled, reviled not
          again. He had a wonderful spirit of forgiveness, was ready to forgive
          his worst enemies, and prayed for them with fervent and effectual
          prayers. With what meekness did he appear in the ring of soldiers that
          were contemning and mocking him. He was silent, and opened not his
          mouth, but went as a lamb to the slaughter. Thus is Christ a Lion in
          majesty and a Lamb in meekness.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There meet in the person of Christ the deepest reverence towards
          God and equality with God. Christ, when on earth, appeared full of
          holy reverence towards the Father. He paid the most reverential
          worship to him, praying to him with postures of reverence. Thus we
          read of his “kneeling down and praying,” Luke 22:41. This became
          Christ, as one who had taken on him the human nature, but at the same
          time he existed in the divine nature, whereby his person was in all
          respects equal to the person of the Father. God the Father has no
          attribute or perfection that the Son has not, in equal degree, and
          equal glory. These things meet in no other person but Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. There are conjoined in the person of Christ infinite worthiness of
          good, and the greatest patience under sufferings of evil. He was
          perfectly innocent, and deserved no suffering. He deserved nothing
          from God by any guilt of his own, and he deserved no ill from men.
          Yea, he was not only harmless and undeserving of suffering, but he was
          infinitely worthy — worthy of the infinite love of the Father, worthy
          of infinite and eternal happiness, and infinitely worthy of all
          possible esteem, love, and service from all men. And yet he was
          perfectly patient under the greatest sufferings that ever were endured
          in this world. Heb. 12:2, “He endured the cross, despising the shame.”
          He suffered not from his Father for his faults, but ours. He suffered
          from men not for his faults, but for those things on account of which
          he was infinitely worthy of their love and honor, which made his
          patience the more wonderful and the more glorious. 1 Pet. 2:20, etc.
          “For what glory is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye
          shall take it patiently, but if when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye
          take it patiently; this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were
          ye called; because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example,
          that we should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile
          found in his mouth: who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when
          he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that
          judgeth righteously: who his own self bare our sins in his own body on
          the tree, that we being dead to sin, should live unto righteousness:
          by whose stripes ye were healed.” There is no such conjunction of
          innocence, worthiness, and patience under sufferings, as in the person
          of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. In the person of Christ are conjoined an exceeding spirit of
          obedience, with supreme dominion over heaven and earth. Christ is the
          Lord of all things in two respects: he is so as God-man and Mediator,
          and thus his dominion is appointed, and given him of the Father.
          Having it by delegation from God, he is as it were the Father’s
          vicegerent. But he is Lord of all things in another respect, viz. as
          he is (by his original nature) God. So he is by natural right the Lord
          of all, and supreme over all as much as the Father. Thus, he has
          dominion over the world, not by delegation, but in his own right. He
          is not an under God, as the Arians suppose, but to all intents and
          purposes, supreme God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet in the same person is found the greatest spirit of obedience
          to the commands and laws of God that ever was in the universe, which
          was manifest in his obedience here in this world. John 14:31 “As the
          Father gave me commandment, even so I do.” John 15:10, “Even as I have
          kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.” The greatness
          of his obedience appears in its perfection, and in his obeying
          commands of such exceeding difficulty. Never anyone received commands
          from God of such difficulty, and that were so great a trial of
          obedience, as Jesus Christ. One of God’s commands to him was, that he
          should yield himself to those dreadful sufferings that he underwent.
          See John 10:18, “No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of
          myself.” — “This commandment received I of my Father.” And Christ was
          thoroughly obedient to this command of God. Heb. 5:8, “Though he were
          a Son, yet he learned obedience by the things that he suffered.” Phil.
          2:8, “He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the
          death of the cross.” Never was there such an instance of obedience in
          man or angel as this, though he was at the same time supreme Lord of
          both angels and men.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. In the person of Christ are conjoined absolute sovereignty and
          perfect resignation. This is another unparalleled conjunction. Christ,
          as he is God, is the absolute sovereign of the world, the sovereign
          disposer of all events. The decrees of God are all his sovereign
          decrees, and the work of creation, and all God’s works of providence,
          are his sovereign works. It is he that worketh all things according to
          the counsel of his own will. Col. 1:16, 17, “By him, and through him,
          and to him, are all things.” John 5:17, “The Father worketh hitherto,
          and I work.” Mat. 8:3, “I will, be thou clean.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But yet Christ was the most wonderful instance of resignation that
          ever appeared in the world. He was absolutely and perfectly resigned
          when he had a near and immediate prospect of his terrible sufferings,
          and the dreadful cup that he was to drink. The idea and expectation of
          this made his soul exceeding sorrowful, even unto death, and put him
          into such an agony that his sweat was as it were great drops or clots
          of blood, falling down to the ground. But in such circumstances he was
          wholly resigned to the will of God. Mat. 26:39, “O my Father, if it be
          possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but
          as thou wilt.” verse 42, “O my Father, if this cup may not pass from
          me, except I drink it, thy will be done.”
        </p>
        <p>
          7. In Christ do meet together self-sufficiency, and an entire trust
          and reliance on God, which is another conjunction peculiar to the
          person of Christ. As he is a divine person, he is self-sufficient,
          standing in need of nothing. All creatures are dependent on him, but
          he is dependent on none, but is absolutely independent. His proceeding
          from the Father, in his eternal generation or filiation, argues no
          proper dependence on the will of the Father. For that proceeding was
          natural and necessary, and not arbitrary. But yet Christ entirely
          trusted in God: his enemies say that of him, “He trusted in God that
          he would deliver him,” Mat. 27:43. And the apostle testifies, 1 Pet.
          2:23, “That he committed himself God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, such diverse excellencies are expressed in him towards men,
          that otherwise would have seemed impossible to be exercised towards
          the same object, as particularly these three, justice, mercy, and
          truth. The same that are mentioned in Psa. 85:10, “Mercy and truth are
          met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other.” The
          strict justice of God, and even his revenging justice, and that
          against the sins of men, never was so gloriously manifested as in
          Christ. He manifested an infinite regard to the attribute of God’s
          justice, in that when he had a mind to save sinners, he was willing to
          undergo such extreme sufferings, rather than that their salvation
          should be to the injury of the honor of that attribute. And as he is
          the Judge of the world, he does himself exercise strict justice, he
          will not clear the guilty, nor at all acquit the wicked in judgment.
          Yet how wonderfully is infinite mercy towards sinners displayed in
          him! And what glorious and ineffable grace and love have been and are
          exercised by him, towards sinful men! Though he be the just Judge of a
          sinful world, yet he is also the Savior of the world. Though he be a
          consuming fire to sin, yet he is the light and life of sinners. Rom.
          3:25, 26, “Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith
          in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins
          that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at
          this time his righteousness, that he might be just, and the justifier
          of him which believeth in Jesus.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So the immutable truth of God, in the threatenings of his law against
          the sins of men, was never so manifested as it is in Jesus Christ. For
          there never was any other so great a trial of the unalterableness of
          the truth of God in those threatenings, as when sin came to be imputed
          to his own Son. And then in Christ has been seen already an actual
          complete accomplishment of those threatenings, which never has been
          nor will be seen in any other instance, because the eternity that will
          be taken up in fulfilling those threatenings on others, never will be
          finished. Christ manifested an infinite regard to this truth of God in
          his sufferings. And in his judging the world, he makes the covenant of
          works, that contains those dreadful threatenings, his rule of
          judgment. He will see to it, that it is not infringed in the least jot
          or tittle. He will do nothing contrary to the threatenings of the law,
          and their complete fulfillment. And yet in him we have many great and
          precious promises, promises of perfect deliverance from the penalty of
          the law. And this is the promise that he has promised us, even eternal
          life. And in him are all the promises of God, yea, and Amen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus shown wherein there is an admirable conjunction of
          excellencies in Jesus Christ, I now proceed,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. To show how this admirable conjunction of excellencies appears in
          Christ’s acts.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it appears in what Christ did in taking on him our nature. In
          this act, his infinite condescension wonderfully appeared, that he who
          was God should become man, that the word should be made flesh, and
          should take on him a nature infinitely below his original nature! And
          it appears yet more remarkably in the low circumstances of his
          incarnation: he was conceived in the womb of a poor young woman, whose
          poverty appeared in this, when she came to offer sacrifices of her
          purification, she brought what was allowed of in the law only in case
          of poverty, as Luke 2:24, “According to what is said in the law of the
          Lord, a pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.” This was allowed
          only in case the person was so poor that she was not able to offer a
          lamb. Lev. 12:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          And though his infinite condescension thus appeared in the manner of
          his incarnation, yet his divine dignity also appeared in it. For
          though he was conceived in the womb of a poor virgin, yet he was
          conceived there by the power of the Holy Ghost. And his divine dignity
          also appeared in the holiness of his conception and birth. Though he
          was conceived in the womb of one of the corrupt race of mankind, yet
          he was conceived and born without sin, as the angel said to the
          blessed Virgin, Luke 1:35, “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and
          the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee, therefore also that
          holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of
          God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          His infinite condescension marvelously appeared in the manner of his
          birth. He was brought forth in a stable because there was no room for
          them in the inn. The inn was taken up by others, that were looked upon
          as persons of greater account. The blessed Virgin, being poor and
          despised, was turned or shut out. Though she was in such necessitous
          circumstances, yet those that counted themselves her betters would not
          give place to her. Therefore, in the time of her travail, she was
          forced to betake herself to a stable, and when the child was born, it
          was wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and laid in a manger. There Christ
          lay a little infant, and there he eminently appeared as a lamb. But
          yet this feeble infant, born thus in a stable, and laid in a manger,
          was born to conquer and triumph over Satan, that roaring lion. He came
          to subdue the mighty powers of darkness, and make a show of them
          openly: so to restore peace on earth, to manifest God’s goodwill
          towards men, and to bring glory to God in the highest. According[ly]
          the end of his birth was declared by the joyful songs of the glorious
          hosts of angels, who appeared to the shepherds at the same time that
          the infant lay in the manger, whereby his divine dignity was
          manifested.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, this admirable conjunction of excellencies appears in the acts
          and various passages of Christ’s life. Though Christ dwelt in mean
          outward circumstances, whereby his condescension and humility
          especially appeared, and his majesty was veiled, yet his divine
          divinity and glory did in many of his acts shine through the veil, and
          it illustriously appeared, that he was not only the Son of man, but
          the great God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, in the circumstances of his infancy, his outward meanness
          appeared, Yet there was something then to show forth his divine
          dignity, in the wise men’s being stirred up to come from the east to
          give honor to him, their being led by a miraculous star, and coming
          and falling down and worshipping him, and presenting him with gold,
          frankincense, and myrrh. His humility and meekness wonderfully
          appeared in his subjection to his mother and reputed father when he
          was a child. Herein he appeared as a lamb. But his divine glory broke
          forth and shone when, at twelve years old, he disputed with doctors in
          the temple. In that he appeared, in some measure, as the Lion of the
          tribe of Judah.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, after he entered on his public ministry, his marvelous
          humility and meekness was manifested in his choosing to appear in such
          mean outward circumstances; and in being contented in them, when he
          was so poor that he had not where to lay his head, and depended on the
          charity of some of his followers for his subsistence, as appears by
          Luke 8 at the beginning. How meek, condescending, and familiar his
          treatment of his disciples. His discourses with them, treating them as
          a father his children, yea, as friends and companions. How patient,
          bearing such affliction and reproach, and so many injuries from the
          scribes and Pharisees, and others. In these things he appeared as a
          Lamb. And yet he at the same time did in many ways show forth his
          divine majesty and glory, particularly in the miracles he wrought,
          which were evidently divine works, and manifested omnipotent power,
          and so declared him to be the Lion of the tribe of Judah. His
          wonderful and miraculous works plainly showed him to be the God of
          nature, in that it appeared by them that he had all nature in his
          hands, and could lay an arrest upon it, and stop and change its course
          as he pleased. In healing the sick, and opening the eyes of the blind,
          and unstopping the ears of the deaf, and healing the lame, he showed
          that he was the God that framed the eye, and created the ear, and was
          the author of the frame of man’s body. By the dead’s rising at his
          command, it appeared that he was the author and fountain of life, and
          that “God the Lord, to whom belong the issues from death.” By his
          walking on the sea in a storm, when the waves were raised, he showed
          himself to be that God spoken of in Job 9:8, “That treadeth on the
          waves of the sea.” By his stilling the storm, and calming the rage of
          the sea, by his powerful command, saying, “Peace, be still,” he showed
          that he has the command of the universe, and that he is that God who
          brings things to pass by the word of his power, who speaks and it is
          done, who commands and it stands fast; Psa. 65:7, “Who stilleth the
          noise of the seas, the noise of their waves.” And Psa. 107:29, “That
          maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.” And
          Psa. 89:8, 9, “O Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto
          thee, or to thy faithfulness round about thee? Thou rulest the raging
          of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.” Christ,
          by casting out devils, remarkably appeared as the Lion of the tribe of
          Judah, and showed that he was stronger than the roaring lion, that
          seeks whom he may devour. He commanded them to come out, and they were
          forced to obey. They were terribly afraid of him: they fall down
          before him, and beseech him not to torment them. He forces a whole
          legion of them to forsake their hold, by his powerful word, and they
          could not so much as enter into the swine without his leave. He showed
          the glory of his omniscience, by telling the thoughts of men, as we
          have often an account. Herein he appeared to be that God spoken of,
          Amos 4:13, “That declareth unto man what is his thought.” Thus, in the
          midst of his meanness and humiliation, his divine glory appeared in
          his miracles, John 2:11, “This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana
          of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And though Christ ordinarily appeared without outward glory, and in
          great obscurity, yet at a certain time he threw off the veil, and
          appeared in his divine majesty, so far as it could be outwardly
          manifested to men in this frail state, when he was transfigured in the
          mount. The apostle Peter (2 Pet. 1:16, 17) was an “eye-witness of his
          majesty, when he received from God the Father honor and glory, when
          there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my
          beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; which voice that came from
          heaven they heard, when they were with him in the holy mount.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And at the same time that Christ was wont to appear in such meekness,
          condescension, and humility, in his familiar discourses with his
          disciples, appearing therein as the Lamb of God, he was also wont to
          appear as The Lion of the tribe of Judah, with divine authority and
          majesty, in his so sharply rebuking the scribes and Pharisees and
          other hypocrites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, this admirable conjunction of excellencies remarkably appears
          in his offering up himself a sacrifice for sinners in his last
          sufferings. As this was the greatest thing in all the works of
          redemption, the greatest act of Christ in that work, so in this act
          especially does there appear that admirable conjunction of
          excellencies that has been spoken of. Christ never so much appeared as
          a lamb, as when he was slain: “He came like a lamb to the slaughter,”
          Isa. 53:7. Then he was offered up to God as a lamb without blemish,
          and without spot: then especially did he appear to be the anti-type of
          the lamb of the passover: 1 Cor 5:7, “Christ our Passover sacrificed
          for us.” And yet in that act he did in an especial manner appear as
          the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Yea, in this above all other acts, in
          many respects, as may appear in the following things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Then was Christ in the greatest degree of his humiliation, and yet
          by that, above all other things, his divine glory appears. Christ’s
          humiliation was great, in being born in such a low condition, of a
          poor virgin, and in a stable. His humiliation was great, in being
          subject to Joseph the carpenter, and Mary his mother, and afterwards
          living in poverty, so as not to have where to lay his head, and in
          suffering such manifold and bitter reproaches as he suffered, while he
          went about preaching and working miracles. But his humiliation was
          never so great as it was, in his last sufferings, beginning with his
          agony in the garden, till he expired on the cross. Never was he
          subject to such ignominy as then, never did he suffer so much pain in
          his body, or so much sorrow in his soul. Never was he in so great an
          exercise of his condescension, humility, meekness, and patience, as he
          was in these last sufferings. Never was his divine glory and majesty
          covered with so thick and dark a veil. Never did he so empty himself
          and make himself of no reputation, as at this time. And yet, never was
          his divine glory so manifested, by any act of his, as in yielding
          himself up to these sufferings. When the fruit of it came to appear,
          and the mystery and ends of it to be unfolded in its issue, then did
          the glory of it appear, [and] then did it appear as the most glorious
          act of Christ that ever he exercised towards the creature. This act of
          his is celebrated by the angels and hosts of heaven with peculiar
          praises, as that which is above all others glorious, as you may see in
          the context (Rev. 5:9-12) “And they sang a new song, saying, Thou art
          worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast
          slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred,
          and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God
          kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. And I beheld, and
          I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the
          beasts, and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times
          ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice
          Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and
          wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He never in any act gave so great a manifestation of love to God,
          and yet never so manifested his love to those that were enemies to
          God, as in that act. Christ never did anything whereby his love to the
          Father was so eminently manifested, as in his laying down his life,
          under such inexpressible sufferings, in obedience to his command, and
          for the vindication of the honor of his authority and majesty; nor did
          ever any mere creature give such a testimony of love to God as that
          was. And yet this was the greatest expression of his love to sinful
          men who were enemies to God, Rom. 5:10, “When we were enemies, we were
          reconciled to God, by the death of his Son.” The greatness of Christ’s
          love to such, appears in nothing so much as in its being dying love.
          That blood of Christ which fell in great drops to the ground, in his
          agony, was shed from love to God’s enemies, and his own. That shame
          and spitting, that torment of body, and that exceeding sorrow, even
          unto death, which he endured in his soul, was what he underwent from
          love to rebels against God to save them from hell, and to purchase for
          them eternal glory. Never did Christ so eminently show his regard to
          God’s honor, as in offering up himself a victim to justice. And yet in
          this above all, he manifested his love to them who dishonored God, so
          as to bring such guilt on themselves, that nothing less than his blood
          could atone for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Christ never so eminently appeared for divine justice, and yet
          never suffered so much from divine justice, as when he offered up
          himself a sacrifice for our sins. In Christ’s great sufferings, did
          his infinite regard to the honor of God’s justice distinguishingly
          appear, for it was from regard to that that he thus humbled himself.
          And yet in these sufferings, Christ was the mark of the vindictive
          expressions of that very justice of God. Revenging justice then spent
          all its force upon him, on account of our guilt, which made him sweat
          blood, and cry out upon the cross, and probably rent his vitals —
          broke his heart, the fountain of blood, or some other blood vessels —
          and by the violent fermentation turned his blood to water. For the
          blood and water that issued out of his side, when pierced by the
          spear, seems to have been extravasated blood, and so there might be a
          kind of literal fulfillment of Psa. 22:14, “I am poured out like
          water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax, it is
          melted in the midst of my bowels.” And this was the way and means by
          which Christ stood up for the honor of God’s justice, namely, by thus
          suffering its terrible executions. For when he had undertaken for
          sinners, and had substituted himself in their room, divine justice
          could have its due honor no other way than by his suffering its
          revenges. — In this the diverse excellencies that met in the person of
          Christ appeared, viz. his infinite regard to God’s justice, and such
          love to those that have exposed themselves to it, as induced him thus
          to yield himself a sacrifice to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Christ’s holiness never so illustriously shone forth as it did in
          his last sufferings, and yet he never was to such a degree treated as
          guilty. Christ’s holiness never had such a trial as it had then, and
          therefore never had so great a manifestation. When it was tried in
          this furnace, it came forth as gold, or as silver purified seven
          times. His holiness then above all appeared in his steadfast pursuit
          of the honor of God, and in his obedience to him. For his yielding
          himself unto death was transcendently the greatest act of obedience
          that ever was paid to God by anyone since the foundation of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet then Christ was in the greatest degree treated as a wicked
          person would have been. He was apprehended and bound as a malefactor.
          His accusers represented him as a most wicked wretch. In his
          sufferings before his crucifixion, he was treated as if he had been
          the worst and vilest of mankind. Then he was put to a kind of death,
          that none but the worst sort of malefactors were wont to suffer, those
          that were most abject in their persons, and guilty of the blackest
          crimes. And he suffered as though guilty from God himself, by reason
          of our guilt imputed to him. For he who knew no sin, was made sin for
          us. He was made subject to wrath, as if he had been sinful himself. He
          was made a curse for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ never so greatly manifested his hatred of sin, as against God,
          as in his dying to take away the dishonor that sin had done to God.
          Yet never was he to such a degree subject to the terrible effects of
          God’s hatred of sin, and wrath against it, as he was then. In this
          appears those diverse excellencies meeting in Christ, viz. love to
          God, and grace to sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. He never was so dealt with, as unworthy, as in his last sufferings,
          and yet it is chiefly on account of them that he is accounted worthy.
          He was therein dealt with as if he had not been worthy to live: they
          cry out, “Away with him! away with him! Crucify him.” John 19:15. And
          they prefer Barabbas before him. And he suffered from the Father, as
          one whose demerits were infinite, by reason of our demerits that were
          laid upon him. And yet it was especially by that act of his subjecting
          himself to those sufferings, that he merited, and on the account of
          which chiefly he was accounted worthy of the glory of his exaltation.
          Phil. 2:8, 9, “He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death;
          wherefore God hath highly exalted him.” And we see that it is on this
          account chiefly, that he is extolled as worthy by saints and angels in
          the context: “Worthy,” say they, “is the Lamb that was slain.” This
          shows an admirable conjunction in him of infinite dignity, and
          infinite condescension and love to the infinitely unworthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Christ in his last sufferings suffered most extremely from those
          towards whom he was then manifesting his greatest act of love. He
          never suffered so much from his Father (though not from any hatred to
          him, but from hatred to our sins), for he then forsook him, or took
          away the comforts of his presence. Then “it pleased the Lord to bruise
          him, and put him to grief.” as Isa. 53:10. And yet he never gave so
          great a manifestation of love to God as then, as has been already
          observed. So Christ never suffered so much from the hands of men as he
          did then, and yet never was in so high an exercise of love to men. He
          never was so ill-treated by his disciples, who were so unconcerned
          about his sufferings that they would not watch with him one hour in
          his agony. And when he was apprehended, all forsook him and fled,
          except Peter, who denied him with oaths and curses. And yet then he
          was suffering, shedding his blood, and pouring out his soul unto death
          for them. Yea, he probably was then shedding his blood for some of
          them that shed his blood, for whom he prayed while they were
          crucifying him; and who were probably afterwards brought home to
          Christ by Peter’s preaching. (Compare Luke 23:34; Acts 2:23, 36, 37,
          41, and chap. 3:17. and chap. 4:4.) This shows an admirable meeting of
          justice and grace in the redemption of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. It was in Christ’s last sufferings, above all, that he was
          delivered up to the power of his enemies, and yet by these, above all,
          he obtained victory over his enemies. Christ never was so in his
          enemies’ hands, as in the time of his last sufferings. They sought his
          life before, but from time to time they were restrained, and Christ
          escaped out of their hands. This reason is given for it: that his time
          was not yet come. But now they were suffered to work their will upon
          him, he was in a great degree delivered up to the malice and cruelty
          of both wicked men and devils. And therefore when Christ’s enemies
          came to apprehend him, he says to them, Luke 22:53, “When I was daily
          with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hand against me: but
          this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet it was principally by means of those sufferings that he
          conquered and overthrew his enemies. Christ never so effectually
          bruised Satan’s head, as when Satan bruised his heel. The weapon with
          which Christ warred against the devil, and obtained a most complete
          victory and glorious triumph over him, was the cross, the instrument
          and weapon with which he thought he had overthrown Christ, and brought
          on him shameful destruction. Col. 2:14, 15, “Blotting out the
          handwriting of ordinances, — nailing it to his cross: and having
          spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly,
          triumphing over them in it.” In his last sufferings, Christ sapped the
          very foundations of Satan’s kingdom. He conquered his enemies in their
          own territories, and beat them with their own weapons; as David cut
          off Goliath’s head with his own sword. The devil had, as it were,
          swallowed up Christ, as the whale did Jonah. But it was deadly poison
          to him: he gave him a mortal wound in his own bowels. He was soon sick
          of his morsel, and was forced to do by him as the whale did by Jonah.
          To this day he is heart-sick of what he then swallowed as his prey. In
          those sufferings of Christ was laid the foundation of all that
          glorious victory he has already obtained over Satan, in the overthrow
          of his heathenish kingdom in the Roman empire, and all the success the
          gospel has had since, and also of all his future and still more
          glorious victory that is to be obtained in the earth. Thus Samson’s
          riddle is most eminently fulfilled, Jdg. 14:14, “Out of the eater came
          forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.” And thus the
          true Samson does more towards the destruction of his enemies at his
          death than in his life, in yielding up himself to death, he pulls down
          the temple of Dagon, and destroys many thousands of his enemies, even
          while they are making themselves sport in his sufferings. So he whose
          type was the ark, pulls down Dagon, and breaks off his head and hands
          in his own temple, even while he is brought in there as Dagon’s
          captive. (1 Sam. 5:1-4)
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus Christ appeared at the same time, and in the same act, as both a
          lion and a lamb. He appeared as a lamb in the hands of his cruel
          enemies, as a lamb in the paws and between the devouring jaws of a
          roaring lion. Yea, he was a lamb actually slain by this lion: and yet
          at the same time, as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, he conquers and
          triumphs over Satan, destroying his own devourer, as Samson did the
          lion that roared upon him, when he rent him as he would a kid. And in
          nothing has Christ appeared so much as a lion, in glorious strength
          destroying his enemies, as when he was brought as a lamb to the
          slaughter. In his greatest weakness he was most strong; and when he
          suffered most from his enemies, he brought the greatest confusion on
          his enemies. — Thus this admirable conjunction of diverse excellencies
          was manifest in Christ, in his offering up himself to God in his last
          sufferings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, it is still manifest in his acts, in his present state of
          exaltation in heaven. Indeed, in his exalted state, he most eminently
          appears in manifestation of those excellencies, on the account of
          which he is compared to a lion; but still he appears as a lamb; Rev.
          14:1, “And I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on mount Sion;” as in his
          state of humiliation he chiefly appeared as a lamb, and yet did not
          appear without manifestation of his divine majesty and power, as the
          Lion of the tribe of Judah. Though Christ be now at the right-hand of
          God, exalted as King of heaven, and Lord of the universe, yet as he
          still is in the human nature, he still excels in humility. Though the
          man Christ Jesus be the highest of all creatures in heaven, yet he as
          much excels them all in humility as he does in glory and dignity, for
          none sees so much of the distance between God and him as he does. And
          though he now appears in such glorious majesty and dominion in heaven,
          yet he appears as a lamb in his condescending, mild, and sweet
          treatment of his saints there. For he is a Lamb still, even amidst the
          throne of his exaltation, and he that is the Shepherd of the whole
          flock is himself a Lamb, and goes before them in heaven as such. Rev.
          7:17, “For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed
          them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters, and God
          shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.” Though in heaven every
          knee bows to him, and though the angels fall down before him adoring
          him, yet he treats his saints with infinite condescension, mildness,
          and endearment. And in his acts towards the saints on earth, he still
          appears as a lamb, manifesting exceeding love and tenderness in his
          intercession for them, as one that has had experience of affliction
          and temptation. He has not forgot what these things are, nor has he
          forgot how to pity those that are subject to them. And he still
          manifests his lamb-like excellencies, in his dealings with his saints
          on earth, in admirable forbearance, love, gentleness, and compassion.
          Behold him instructing, supplying, supporting, and comforting them,
          often coming to them and manifesting himself to them by his Spirit,
          that he may sup with them, and they with him. Behold him admitting
          them to sweet communion, enabling them with boldness and confidence to
          come to him, and solacing their hearts. And in heaven Christ still
          appears, as it were, with the marks of his wounds upon him, and so
          appears as a Lamb as it had been slain. [This is] as he was
          represented in vision to St. John, in the text, when he appeared to
          open the book sealed with seven seals, which is part of the glory of
          his exaltation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, and lastly, this admirable conjunction of excellencies will be
          manifest in Christ’s acts at the last judgment. He then, above all
          other times, will appear as the Lion of the tribe of Judah in infinite
          greatness and majesty, when he shall come in the glory of his Father,
          with all the holy angels, and the earth shall tremble before him, and
          the hills shall melt. This is he (Rev. 20:11) “that shall sit on a
          great white throne, before whose face the earth and heaven shall flee
          away.” He will then appear in the most dreadful and amazing manner to
          the wicked. The devils tremble at the thought of that appearance, and
          when it shall be, the kings, and the great men, and the rich men, and
          the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bond-man, and every
          free-man, shall hide themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the
          mountains. [They] shall cry to the mountains and rocks to fall on
          them, to hide them from the face and wrath of the Lamb. And none can
          declare or conceive of the amazing manifestations of wrath in which he
          will then appear towards these, or the trembling and astonishment, the
          shrieking and gnashing of teeth, with which they shall stand before
          his judgment-seat, and receive the terrible sentence of his wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet he will at the same time appear as a Lamb to his saints. He
          will receive them as friends and brethren, treating them with infinite
          mildness and love. There shall be nothing in him terrible to them, but
          towards them he will clothe himself wholly with sweetness and
          endearment. The church shall be then admitted to him as his bride:
          that shall be her wedding-day. The saints shall all be sweetly invited
          to come with him to inherit the kingdom, and reign in it with him to
          all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          I. From this doctrine we may learn one reason why Christ is called by
          such a variety of names, and held forth under such a variety of
          representations, in Scripture. It is the better to signify and exhibit
          to us that variety of excellencies that meet together and are
          conjoined in him. Many appellations are mentioned together in one
          verse Isa. 9:6, “For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given,
          and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
          called Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father,
          the Prince of Peace.” It shows a wonderful conjunction of
          excellencies, that the same person should be a Son, born and given,
          and yet be the everlasting Father, without beginning or end, [and]
          that he should be a Child and yet be he whose name is Counselor, and
          the mighty God. Well may his name, in whom such things are conjoined,
          be called Wonderful.
        </p>
        <p>
          By reason of the same wonderful conjunction, Christ is represented by
          a great variety of sensible things, that are on some account
          excellent. Thus in some places he is called a Sun, as Mal. 4:2, in
          others a Star, Num. 24:17. And he is especially represented by the
          morning star, as being that which excels all other stars in
          brightness, and is the forerunner of the day, Rev. 22:16. And, as in
          our text, he is compared to a lion in one verse, and a lamb in the
          next, so sometimes he is compared to a roe or young hart, another
          creature most diverse from a lion. So in some places he is called a
          rock, in others he is compared to a pearl. In some places he is called
          a man of war, and the Captain of our Salvation, in other places he is
          represented as a bridegroom. In the second chapter of Canticles, the
          first verse, he is compared to a rose and a lily, that are sweet and
          beautiful flowers; in the next verse but one, he is compared to a tree
          bearing sweet fruit. In Isaiah 53:2 he is called a Root out of a dry
          ground, but elsewhere, instead of that, he is called the Tree of Life,
          that grows (not in a dry or barren ground, but) “in the midst of the
          paradise of God.” Rev. 2:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Let the consideration of this wonderful meeting of diverse
          excellencies in Christ induce you to accept of him, and close with him
          as your Savior. As all manner of excellencies meet in him, so there
          are concurring in him all manner of arguments and motives, to move you
          to choose him for your Savior, and everything that tends to encourage
          poor sinners to come and put their trust in him: his fullness and
          all-sufficiency as a Savior gloriously appear in that variety of
          excellencies that has been spoken of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fallen man is in a state of exceeding great misery, and is helpless in
          it. He is a poor weak creature, like an infant cast out in its blood
          in the day that it is born. But Christ is the Lion of the tribe of
          Judah: he is strong, though we are weak; he has prevailed to do that
          for us which no creature else could do. Fallen man is a mean
          despicable creature, a contemptible worm, but Christ, who has
          undertaken for us, is infinitely honorable and worthy. Fallen man is
          polluted, but Christ is infinitely holy; fallen man is hateful, but
          Christ is infinitely lovely. Fallen man is the object of God’s
          indignation, but Christ is infinitely dear to him. We have dreadfully
          provoked God, but Christ has performed that righteousness which is
          infinitely precious in God’s eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here is not only infinite strength and infinite worthiness, but
          infinite condescension, and love and mercy, as great as power and
          dignity. If you are a poor, distressed sinner, whose heart is ready to
          sink for fear that God never will have mercy on you, you need not be
          afraid to go to Christ, for fear that he is either unable or unwilling
          to help you. Here is a strong foundation, and an inexhaustible
          treasure, to answer the necessities of your poor soul. Here is
          infinite grace and gentleness to invite and embolden a poor, unworthy,
          fearful soul to come to it. If Christ accepts of you, you need not
          fear but that you will be safe, for he is a strong Lion for your
          defense. And if you come, you need not fear but that you shall be
          accepted, for he is like a Lamb to all that come to him, and receives
          then with infinite grace and tenderness. It is true he has awful
          majesty, he is the great God, and infinitely high above you. But there
          is this to encourage and embolden the poor sinner, that Christ is man
          as well as God. He is a creature, as well as the Creator, and he is
          the most humble and lowly in heart of any creature in heaven or earth.
          This may well make the poor unworthy creature bold in coming to him.
          You need not hesitate one moment; but may run to him, and cast
          yourself upon him. You will certainly be graciously and meekly
          received by him. Though he is a lion, he will only be a lion to your
          enemies, but he will be a lamb to you. It could not have been
          conceived, had it not been so in the person of Christ, that there
          could have been so much in any Savior, that is inviting and tending to
          encourage sinners to trust in him. Whatever your circumstances are,
          you need not be afraid to come to such a Savior as this. Be you never
          so wicked a creature, here is worthiness enough; be you never so poor,
          and mean, and ignorant a creature, there is no danger of being
          despised, for though he be so much greater than you, he is also
          immensely more humble than you. Any one of you that is a father or
          mother, will not despise one of your own children that comes to you in
          distress: much less danger is there of Christ despising you, if you in
          your heart come to him. Here let me a little expostulate with the
          poor, burdened, distressed soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. What are you afraid of, that you dare not venture your soul upon
          Christ? Are you afraid that he cannot save you: that he is not strong
          enough to conquer the enemies of your soul? But how can you desire one
          stronger than the “mighty God”? as Christ is called, Isa. 9:6. Is
          there need of greater than infinite strength? Are you afraid that he
          will not be willing to stoop so low as to take any gracious notice of
          you? But then, look on him, as he stood in the ring of soldiers,
          exposing his blessed face to be buffeted and spit upon by them! Behold
          him bound with his back uncovered to those that smote him! And behold
          him hanging on the cross! Do you think that he that had condescension
          enough to stoop to these things, and that for his crucifiers, will be
          unwilling to accept of you if you come to him? Or, are you afraid that
          if he does accept you, that God the Father will not accept of him for
          you? But consider, will God reject his own Son, in whom his infinite
          delight is, and has been, from all eternity, and who is so united to
          him, that if he should reject him he would reject himself?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What is there that you can desire should be in a Savior, that is
          not in Christ? Or, wherein should you desire a Savior should be
          otherwise than Christ is? What excellency is there wanting? What is
          there that is great or good? What is there that is venerable or
          winning? What is there that is adorable or endearing, or what can you
          think of that would be encouraging, which is not to be found in the
          person of Christ? Would you have your Savior to be great and
          honorable, because you are not willing to be beholden to a mean
          person? And is not Christ a person honorable enough to be worthy that
          you should be dependent on him? Is he not a person high enough to be
          appointed to so honorable a work as your salvation? Would you not only
          have a Savior of high degree, but would you have him, notwithstanding
          his exaltation and dignity, to be made also of low degree: that he
          might have experience of afflictions and trials, [and] that he might
          learn by the things that he has suffered, to pity them that suffer and
          are tempted? And has not Christ been made low enough for you? and has
          he not suffered enough? Would you not only have him possess experience
          of the afflictions you now suffer, but also of that amazing wrath that
          you fear hereafter, that he may know how to pity those that are in
          danger, and afraid of it? This Christ has had experience of, which
          experience gave him a greater sense of it, a thousand times, than you
          have, or any man living has. Would you have your Savior to be one who
          is near to God, that so his mediation might be prevalent with him? And
          can you desire him to be nearer to God than Christ is, who is his
          only-begotten Son, of the same essence with the Father? And would you
          not only have him near to God, but also near to you, that you may have
          free access to him? And would you have him nearer to you than to be in
          the same nature: united to you by a spiritual union, so close as to be
          fitly represented by the union of the wife to the husband, of the
          branch to the vine, of the member to the head — yea, so as to be one
          spirit? For so he will be united to you, if you accept of him. Would
          you have a Savior that has given some great and extraordinary
          testimony of mercy and love to sinners, by something that he has done,
          as well as by what he says? And can you think or conceive of greater
          things than Christ has done? Was it not a great thing for him, who was
          God, to take upon him human nature: to be not only God, but man
          thenceforward to all eternity? But would you look upon suffering for
          sinners to be a yet greater testimony of love to sinners, than merely
          doing, though it be ever so extraordinary a thing that he has done?
          And would you desire that a Savior should suffer more than Christ has
          suffered for sinners? What is there wanting, or what would you add if
          you could, to make him more fit to be your Savior? But further, to
          induce you to accept of Christ as your Savior, consider two things
          particularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) How much Christ appears as the Lamb of God in his invitations to
          you to come to him and trust in him. With what sweet grace and
          kindness does he, from time to time, call and invite you, as Pro. 8:4,
          “Unto you, O men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of men.” And
          Isa. 55:1-3, “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and
          he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea come, buy wine and
          milk without money, and without price.” How gracious is he here in
          inviting everyone that thirsts, and in so repeating his invitation
          over and over, “Come ye to the waters, come, buy and eat; yea come!”
          Mark the excellency of that entertainment which he invites you to
          accept of; “Come, buy wine and milk!” your poverty, having nothing to
          pay for it, shall be no objection, — “Come, he that hath no money,
          come without money, and without price!” What gracious arguments and
          expostulations he uses with you! “Wherefore do ye spend money for that
          which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfieth not?
          Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let
          your soul delight itself in fatness.” As much as to say [that] it is
          altogether needless for you to continue laboring and toiling for that
          which can never serve your turn, seeking rest in the world, and in
          your own righteousness: — I have made abundant provision for you, of
          that which is really good, and will fully satisfy your desires, and
          answer your end, and stand ready to accept of you: you need not be
          afraid. If you will come to me, I will engage to see all your wants
          supplied, and you made a happy creature. As he promises in the third
          verse, “Incline your ear, and come unto me: Hear, and your soul shall
          live, and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure
          mercies of David.” And so Pro. 9 at the beginning. How gracious and
          sweet is the invitation there! “Whoso is simple, let him turn in
          hither;” let you be never so poor, ignorant, and blind a creature, you
          shall be welcome. And in the following words, Christ sets forth the
          provision that he has made for you, “Come, eat of my bread, and drink
          of the wine which I have mingled.” You are in a poor famishing state,
          and have nothing wherewith to feed your perishing soul; you have been
          seeking something, but yet remain destitute. Hearken, how Christ calls
          you to eat of his bread, and to drink of the wine that he has mingled!
          And how much like a lamb does Christ appear in Mat. 11:28-30, “Come
          unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
          rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly
          in heart, and ye shall find rest to your souls. For my yoke is easy,
          and my burden is light.” O thou poor distressed soul! whoever thou
          art, consider that Christ mentions thy very case, when he calls to
          them who labor and are heavy laden! How he repeatedly promises you
          rest if you come to him! In the 28th verse he says, “I will give you
          rest.” And in the 29th verse, “Ye shall find rest to your souls.” This
          is what you want. This is the thing you have been so long in vain
          seeking after. O how sweet would rest be to you, if you could but
          obtain it! Come to Christ, and you shall obtain it. And hear how
          Christ, to encourage you, represents himself as a lamb! He tells you,
          that he is meek and lowly in heart, and are you afraid to come to such
          a one! And again, Rev. 3:20, “Behold, I stand at the door and knock:
          if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him,
          and I will sup with him and he with me.” Christ condescends not only
          to call you to him, but he comes to you. He comes to your door, and
          there knocks. He might send an officer and seize you as a rebel and
          vile malefactor, but instead of that, he comes and knocks at your
          door, and seeks that you would receive him into your house, as your
          Friend and Savior. And he not only knocks at your door, but he stands
          there waiting, while you are backward and unwilling. And not only so,
          but he makes promises what he will do for you, if you will admit him,
          what privileges he will admit you to; he will sup with you, and you
          with him. And again, Rev. 22:16, 17, “I am the root and the offspring
          of David, and the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the
          bride say, Come. And let him that heareth, say, come. And let him that
          is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take of the water of life
          freely.” How does Christ here graciously set before you his own
          winning attractive excellency! And how does he condescend to declare
          to you not only his own invitation, but the invitation of the Spirit
          and the bride, if by any means he might encourage you to come! And how
          does he invite everyone that will, that they may “take of the water of
          life freely,” that they may take it as a free gift, however precious
          it be, and though it be the water of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) If you do come to Christ, he will appear as a Lion, in his
          glorious power and dominion, to defend you. All those excellencies of
          his, in which he appears as a lion, shall be yours, and shall be
          employed for you in your defense, for your safety, and to promote your
          glory; he will be as a lion to fight against your enemies. He that
          touches you, or offends you, will provoke his wrath, as he that stirs
          up a lion. Unless your enemies can conquer this Lion, they shall not
          be able to destroy or hurt you. Unless they are stronger than he, they
          shall not be able to hinder your happiness. Isa. 31:4, “For thus hath
          the Lord spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring
          on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against
          him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the
          noise of them; so shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for mount
          Zion, and for the hill thereof.”
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Let what has been said be improved to induce you to love the Lord
          Jesus Christ, and choose him for your friend and portion. As there is
          such an admirable meeting of diverse excellencies in Christ, so there
          is everything in him to render him worthy of your love and choice, and
          to win and engage it. Whatsoever there is or can be desirable in a
          friend, is in Christ, and that to the highest degree that can be
          desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Would you choose for a friend a person of great dignity? It is a thing
          taking with men to have those for their friends who are much above
          them, because they look upon themselves honored by the friendship of
          such. Thus, how taking would it be with an inferior maid to be the
          object of the dear love of some great and excellent prince. But Christ
          is infinitely above you, and above all the princes of the earth, for
          he is the King of kings. So honorable a person as this offers himself
          to you, in the nearest and dearest friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
          And would you choose to have a friend not only great but good? In
          Christ infinite greatness and infinite goodness meet together, and
          receive luster and glory one from another. His greatness is rendered
          lovely by his goodness. The greater anyone is without goodness, so
          much the greater evil. But when infinite goodness is joined with
          greatness, it renders it a glorious and adorable greatness. So, on the
          other hand, his infinite goodness receives luster from his greatness.
          He that is of great understanding and ability, and is withal of a good
          and excellent disposition, is deservedly more esteemed than a lower
          and lesser being, with the same kind inclination and good will. Indeed
          goodness is excellent in whatever subject it be found. It is beauty
          and excellency itself, and renders all excellent that are possessed of
          it, and yet most excellent when joined with greatness. The very same
          excellent qualities of gold render the body in which they are inherent
          more precious, and of greater value, when joined with greater than
          when with lesser dimensions. And how glorious is the sight, to see him
          who is the great Creator and supreme Lord of heaven and earth, full of
          condescension, tender pity and mercy, towards the mean and unworthy!
          His almighty power, and infinite majesty and self-sufficiency, render
          his exceeding love and grace the more surprising. And how do his
          condescension and compassion endear his majesty, power, and dominion,
          and render those attributes pleasant, that would otherwise be only
          terrible! Would you not desire that your friend, though great and
          honorable, should be of such condescension and grace, and so to have
          the way opened to free access to him, that his exaltation above you
          might not hinder your free enjoyment of his friendship? — And would
          you choose not only that the infinite greatness and majesty of your
          friend should be, as it were, mollified and sweetened with
          condescension and grace, but would you also desire to have your friend
          brought nearer to you? Would you choose a friend far above you, and
          yet as it were upon a level with you too? Though it be taking with men
          to have a near and dear friend of superior dignity, yet there is also
          an inclination in them to have their friend a sharer with them in
          circumstances. Thus is Christ. Though he be the great God, yet he has,
          as it were, brought himself down to be upon a level with you, so as to
          become man as you are, that he might not only be your Lord, but your
          brother, and that he might be the more fit to be a companion for such
          a worm of the dust. This is one end of Christ’s taking upon him man’s
          nature, that his people might be under advantages for a more familiar
          converse with him, than the infinite distance of the divine nature
          would allow of. And upon this account the church longed for Christ’s
          incarnation, Song 8:1, “O that thou wert my brother that sucked the
          breast of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss
          thee, yea, I should not be despised.” One design of God in the gospel,
          is to bring us to make God the object of our undivided respect, that
          he may engross our regard every way, that whatever natural inclination
          there is in our souls, he may be the center of it: that God may be all
          in all. But there is an inclination in the creature, not only to the
          adoration of a Lord and Sovereign, but to complacence in some one as a
          friend, to love and delight in some one that may be conversed with as
          a companion. And virtue and holiness do not destroy or weaken this
          inclination of our nature. But so has God contrived in the affair of
          our redemption, that a divine person may be the object even of this
          inclination of our nature. And in order hereto, such a one is come
          down to us, and has taken our nature, and is become one of us, and
          calls himself our friend, brother, and companion. Psa. 122:8, “For my
          brethren and companions’ sake, will I now say, Peace be within thee.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But is it not enough in order to invite and encourage you to free
          access to a friend so great and high, that he is one of infinite
          condescending grace, and also has taken your own nature, and is become
          man? But would you, further to embolden and win you, have him a man of
          wonderful meekness and humility? Why, such a one is Christ! He is not
          only become man for you, but far the meekest and most humble of all
          men, the greatest instance of these sweet virtues that ever was, or
          will be. And besides these, he has all other human excellencies in the
          highest perfection. These, indeed, are no proper addition to his
          divine excellencies. Christ has no more excellency in his person,
          since his incarnation, than he had before, for divine excellency is
          infinite, and cannot be added to. Yet his human excellencies are
          additional manifestations of his glory and excellency to us, and are
          additional recommendations of him to our esteem and love, who are of
          finite comprehension. Though his human excellencies are but
          communications and reflections of his divine. Though this light, as
          reflected, falls infinitely short of the divine fountain of light in
          its immediate glory, yet the reflection shines not without its proper
          advantages, as presented to our view and affection. The glory of
          Christ in the qualifications of his human nature, appears to us in
          excellencies that are of our own kind, and are exercised in our own
          way and manner, and so in some respects, are peculiarly fitted to
          invite our acquaintance and draw our affection. The glory of Christ as
          it appears in his divinity, though far brighter, more dazzles our
          eyes, and exceeds the strength of our sight or our comprehension. But
          as it shines in the human excellencies of Christ, it is brought more
          to a level with our conceptions, and suitableness to our nature and
          manner, yet retaining a semblance of the same divine beauty, and a
          savor of the same divine sweetness. But as both divine and human
          excellencies meet together in Christ, they set off and recommend each
          other to us. It tends to endear the divine majesty and holiness of
          Christ to us, that these are attributes of one in our nature, one of
          us who is become our brother, and is the meekest and humblest of men.
          It encourages us to look upon these divine perfections, however high
          and great; since we have some near concern in and liberty freely to
          enjoy them. And on the other hand, how much more glorious and
          surprising do the meekness, the humility, obedience, resignation, and
          other human excellencies of Christ appear, when we consider that they
          are in so great a person, as the eternal Son of God, the Lord of
          heaven and earth!
        </p>
        <p>
          By your choosing Christ for your friend and portion, you will obtain
          these two infinite benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Christ will give himself to you, with all those various
          excellencies that meet in him, to your full and everlasting enjoyment.
          He will ever after treat you as his dear friend, and you shall ere
          long be where he is, and shall behold his glory, and dwell with him,
          in most free and intimate communion and enjoyment.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the saints get to heaven, they shall not merely see Christ, and
          have to do with him as subjects and servants with a glorious and
          gracious Lord and Sovereign, but Christ will entertain them as friends
          and brethren. This we may learn from the manner of Christ’s conversing
          with his disciples here on earth: though he was their sovereign Lord,
          and did not refuse, but required, their supreme respect and adoration,
          yet he did not treat them as earthly sovereigns are wont to do their
          subjects. He did not keep them at an awful distance, but all along
          conversed with them with the most friendly familiarity, as a father
          amongst a company of children, yea, as with brethren. So he did with
          the twelve, and so he did with Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. He told his
          disciples that he did not call them servants, but friends. We read of
          one of them that leaned on his bosom, and doubtless he will not treat
          his disciples with less freedom and endearment in heaven. He will not
          keep them at a greater distance for his being in a state of
          exaltation, but he will rather take them into a state of exaltation
          with him. This will be the improvement Christ will make of his own
          glory, to make his beloved friends partakers with him, to glorify them
          in his glory, as he says to his Father, John 17:22, 23, “And the glory
          which thou hast given me, have I given them, that they may be one,
          even as we are one I in them,” etc. We are to consider, that though
          Christ is greatly exalted, yet he is exalted, not as a private person
          for himself only, but as his people’s head. He is exalted in their
          name, and upon their account, as the first fruits, and as representing
          the whole harvest. He is not exalted that he may be at a greater
          distance from them, but that they may be exalted with him. The
          exaltation and honor of the head is not to make a greater distance
          between the head and the members, but the members have the same
          relation and union with the head they had before, and are honored with
          the head. Instead of the distance being greater, the union shall be
          nearer and more perfect. When believers get to heaven, Christ will
          conform them to himself, as he is set down in his Father’s throne, so
          they shall sit down with him on his throne, and shall in their measure
          be made like him.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Christ was going to heaven, he comforted his disciples with the
          thought that after a while, he would come again and take them to
          himself, that they might be with him. And we are not to suppose that
          when the disciples got to heaven, they found him keeping a greater
          distance than he used to do. No, doubtless, he embraced them as
          friends, and welcomed them to his and their Father’s house, and to his
          and their glory. They who had been his friends in this world, who had
          been together with him here, and had together partaken of sorrows and
          troubles, are now welcomed by him to rest, and to partake of glory
          with him. He took them and led them into his chambers, and showed them
          all his glory, as he prayed, John 17:24, “Father, I will that they
          also whom thou hast given me, be with me, that they may behold the
          glory which thou hast given me.” And he led them to his living
          fountains of waters, and made them partake of his delights, as he
          prays John 17:13, “That my joy may be fulfilled in themselves,” and
          set them down with him at his table in his kingdom, and made them
          partake with him of his dainties, according to his promise, Luke
          22:30, and led them into his banqueting house, and made them to drink
          new wine with him in the kingdom of his heavenly Father, as he
          foretold them when he instituted the Lord’s supper, Mat. 26:29.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yea the saints’ conversation with Christ in heaven shall not only be
          as intimate, and their access to him as free, as of the disciples on
          earth, but in many respects much more so. For in heaven, that vital
          union shall be perfect, which is exceeding imperfect here. While the
          saints are in this world, there are great remains of sin and darkness
          to separate or disunite them from Christ, which shall then all be
          removed. This is not a time for that full acquaintance, and those
          glorious manifestations of love, which Christ designs for his people
          hereafter; which seems to be signified by his speech to Mary
          Magdalene, when ready to embrace him [and] when she met him after his
          resurrection; John 20:17, “Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I
          am not yet ascended to my Father.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When the saints shall see Christ’s glory and exaltation in heaven, it
          will indeed possess their hearts with the greater admiration and
          adoring respect, but it will not awe them into any separation, but
          will serve only to heighten their surprise and joy, when they find
          Christ condescending to admit them to such intimate access, and so
          freely and fully communicating himself to them. So that if we choose
          Christ for our friend and portion, we shall hereafter be so received
          to him, that there shall be nothing to hinder the fullest enjoyment of
          him, to the satisfying the utmost cravings of our souls. We may take
          our full swing at gratifying our spiritual appetite after these holy
          pleasures. Christ will then say, as in Song 5:1, “Eat, O friends,
          drink, yea, drink abundantly O beloved.” And this shall be our
          entertainment to all eternity! There shall never be any end of this
          happiness, or anything to interrupt our enjoyment of it, or in the
          least to molest us in it!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. By your being united to Christ, you will have a more glorious union
          with and enjoyment of God the Father, than otherwise could be. For
          hereby the saints’ relation to God becomes much nearer: they are the
          children of God in a higher manner than otherwise could be. For, being
          members of God’s own Son, they are in a sort partakers of his relation
          to the Father. They are not only sons of God by regeneration, but by a
          kind of communion in the sonship of the eternal Son. This seems to be
          intended, Gal. 4:4-6, “God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made
          under the law, to redeem them that are under the law, that we might
          receive the adoption of sons. And because ye are sons, God hath sent
          forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.”
          The church is the daughter of God, not only as he has begotten her by
          his Word and Spirit, but as she is the spouse of his eternal Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we being members of the Son, are partakers in our measure of the
          Father’s love to the Son, and complacence in him. John 17:23, “I in
          them, and thou in me, — Thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.”
          And verse 26, “That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in
          them.” And chap. 16:27, “The Father himself loveth you, because ye
          have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.” So we
          shall, according to our capacities, be partakers of the Son’s
          enjoyment of God, and have his joy fulfilled in ourselves, John 17:13.
          And by this means we shall come to an immensely higher, more intimate
          and full enjoyment of God, than otherwise could have been. For there
          is doubtless an infinite intimacy between the Father and the Son which
          is expressed by his being in the bosom of the Father. And saints being
          in him, shall, in their measure and manner, partake with him in it,
          and of the blessedness of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus is the affair of our redemption ordered, that thereby we are
          brought to an immensely more exalted kind of union with God, and
          enjoyment of him, both the Father and the Son, than otherwise could
          have been. For Christ being united to the human nature, we have
          advantage for a more free and full enjoyment of him, than we could
          have had if he had remained only in the divine nature. So again, we
          being united to a divine person, as his members, can have a more
          intimate union and intercourse with God the Father, who is only in the
          divine nature, than otherwise could be. Christ, who is a divine
          person, by taking on him our nature, descends from the infinite
          distance and height above us, and is brought nigh to us, whereby we
          have advantage for the full enjoyment of him. And, on the other hand,
          we, by being in Christ a divine person, do as it were ascend up to
          God, through the infinite distance, and have hereby advantage for the
          full enjoyment of him also.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the design of Christ, that he and his Father, and his people,
          might all be united in one. John 17:21-23, “That they all may be one,
          as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one
          in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the
          glory which thou hast given me, I have given them, that they may be
          one, even as we are one; I in them and thou in me, that they may be
          made perfect in one.” Christ has brought it to pass, that those whom
          the Father has given him should be brought into the household of God,
          that he, his Father, and his people should be as one society, one
          family, [and] that the church should be as it were admitted into the
          society of the blessed Trinity.
