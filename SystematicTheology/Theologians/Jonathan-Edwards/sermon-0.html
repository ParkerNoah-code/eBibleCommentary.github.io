          Psalms 36:2, “For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his
          iniquity be found to be hateful.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In the foregoing verse, David says, “The transgression of the wicked
          saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes;”
          that is, when he saw that the wicked went on in sin, in an allowed way
          of wickedness, it convinced him, that he was not afraid of those
          terrible judgments, and of that wrath with which God hath threatened
          sinners. If the sinner were afraid of these, he could never go on so
          securely in sin, as he doth.<br />
          It was a strange thing that men, who enjoyed such light as they did in
          the land of Israel, who read and heard those many awful threatenings
          which were written in the book of the law, should not be afraid to go
          on in sin. But saith the Psalmist, They flatter themselves in their
          own eyes: they have something or other which they make a foundation of
          encouragement, whereby they persuade themselves that they shall escape
          those judgments, and that makes them put far away the evil day.<br />
          In this manner he proceeds, until his iniquity be found to be hateful;
          that is, until he finds by experience that it is a more dreadful thing
          to sin against God, and break his holy commands, than he imagined. He
          thinks sin to be sweet, and hides it as a sweet morsel under his
          tongue. He loves it and flatters himself in it, till at length he
          finds, by experience, that it is bitter as gall and wormwood. Though
          he thinks the commission of sin to be lovely, yet he will find the
          fruit of it to be hateful, and what he cannot endure. Pro 23:32, “At
          last it will bite like a serpent, and sting like an adder.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Here observe, the subject spoken of is the wicked man, of whom the
          Psalmist had been speaking in the foregoing verse. — His action in
          flattering himself in his own eyes; i.e. he makes himself and his case
          to appear to himself, or in his own eyes, better than it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          How long he continues so to do, until his iniquity be found to be
          hateful. Which may be taken for either his sin itself, the wicked will
          see how odious sin is to God, when he shall feel the effects of his
          hatred, and how hateful to angels and saints. Or rather the cause is
          here put for the effect, the tree for its fruit, and he will find his
          iniquity to be hateful, as he will find the hatefulness and feel the
          terribleness of the fruit of his iniquity. — Hence it appears that
          Wicked men generally flatter themselves with hopes of escaping
          punishment, till it actually comes upon them.<br />
          There are but few sinners who despair, who give up the cause and
          conclude with themselves, that they shall go to hell. Yet there are
          but few who do not go to hell. It is to be feared that many go to hell
          every day out of this country. Yet very few of them suffer themselves
          to believe that they are in any great danger of that punishment. They
          go on sinning and traveling in the direct road to the pit; yet by one
          they persuade themselves that they shall never fall into it,
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION I<br />
          Sinners flatter themselves with the hope of impunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE are so taught in the Word of God, Deu. 29:18, 19, “Lest there
          should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart
          turneth away this day from the Lord our God. Lest there should he
          among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood, and it come to pass
          when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his
          heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of
          mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst.” Where it is supposed that
          they whose hearts turn away from God, and are roots that bear gall and
          wormwood, generally bless themselves in their hearts, saying, We shall
          have peace.<br />
          See also Psa. 49:17, 18, “When he dieth, he shall carry nothing away:
          his glory shall not descend after him, though while he lived, he
          blessed his soul.” And Psa. 50:21, “These things thou hast done, and I
          kept silence: thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as
          thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thee.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very evident that sinners flatter themselves that they shall
          escape punishment, otherwise they would be in dreadful and continual
          distress. They could never live and go about so cheerfully as they now
          do. Their lives would be filled with sorrow and mourning, and they
          would be in continual uneasiness and distress, as much as those that
          are exercised with some violent pain of body. But it is apparent that
          men are careless and secure, that they are not much concerned about
          future punishment, and that they cheerfully pursue their business and
          recreations. Therefore they undoubtedly flatter themselves, that they
          shall not be eternally miserable in hell, as they are threatened in
          the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident that they flatter themselves with hopes that they shall
          escape punishment. Otherwise they would certainly be restrained, at
          least from many of those sins in which they now live. They would not
          proceed in willful courses of sin. The transgression of the wicked
          convinced the Psalmist, and is enough to convince everyone, that there
          is no fear of God before his eyes, and that he flatters himself in his
          own eyes. It would be impossible for men allowably from day to day to
          do those very things which they know are threatened with everlasting
          destruction, if they did not some way encourage themselves [that] they
          should nevertheless escape that destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION II<br />
          Some of the various ways wherein sinners flatter themselves in their
          own eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. SOME flatter themselves with a secret hope that there is no such
          thing as another world. They hear a great deal of preaching, and a
          great deal of talk about hell, and the eternal judgment. But those
          things do not seem to them to be real. They never saw hell, nor the
          devils and damned spirits. And therefore are ready to say with
          themselves, “How do I know that there is any such thing as another
          world?” When the beasts die, there is an end of them, and how do I
          know but that it will be so with me? Perhaps all these things are
          nothing but the inventions of men, nothing but cunningly devised
          fables.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such thoughts are apt to rise in the minds of sinners, and the devil
          sets in to enforce them. Such thoughts are an ease to them. Therefore
          they wish they were true, and that makes them the more ready to think
          that they are so. So that they are hardened in the way of sin, by
          infidelity and atheistic thoughts. Psa. 14:1, “ The fool hath said in
          his heart, There is no God.” Psa. 94:6, 7, “They slay the widow and
          the stranger, and murder the fatherless. Yet they say, the Lord shall
          not see; neither shall the God of Jacob regard it,”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Some flatter themselves that death is a great way off, and that
          they shall hereafter have much opportunity to seek salvation. And they
          think if they earnestly seek it, though it be a great while hence,
          they shall obtain. Although they see no reason to conclude that they
          shall live long, and perhaps they do not positively conclude that they
          shall, yet it doth not come into their minds that their lives are
          really uncertain, and that it is doubtful whether they will live
          another year. Such a thought as this doth not take any hold of them.
          And although they do not absolutely determine that they shall live to
          old age or to middle age, yet they secretly flatter themselves with
          such an imagination. They are disposed to believe so. They act upon it
          and run the venture of it.<br />
          Men will believe that things will be as they choose to have them,
          without reason, and sometimes without the appearance of reason, as is
          most apparent in this case, Psa. 49:11, “Their inward thought is, that
          their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling-places to all
          generations; they call their lands after their own names.” — The
          prepossession and desire of men to have it so, is the principal thing
          that makes them believe so. However, there are several other things
          which they use as arguments to flatter themselves. Perhaps they think
          that since they are at present in health, or in youth, or that since
          they are useful men, do a great deal of good, and both themselves and
          others pray for the continuance of their lives; they are not likely to
          be removed by death very soon. — If they shall live many years in the
          world, they think that it is very probable they shall be converted
          before they die. As they expect hereafter to have much more convenient
          opportunities to become converted, than they have now. And by some
          means or other, they think they shall get through their work before
          they arrive at old age.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Some flatter themselves that they lead moral and orderly lives, and
          therefore think that they shall not be damned. They think with
          themselves that they live not in any vice, that they take care to
          wrong no man, are just and honest dealers, that they are not addicted
          to hard drinking, or to uncleanness, or to bad language; that they
          keep the Sabbath strictly, are constant attendants on the public
          worship, and maintain the worship of God in their families. Therefore
          they hope that God will not cast them into hell. They see not why God
          should be so angry with them as that would imply, seeing they are so
          orderly and regular in their walk! They see not that they have done
          enough to anger him to that degree. And if they have angered him, they
          imagine they have also done a great deal to pacify him.<br />
          If they be not as yet converted, and it be necessary that they should
          experience any other conversion in order to their salvation, they hope
          that their orderly and strict lives will move God to give them
          converting grace. They hope that surely God will not see those that
          live as they do go to hell. Thus they flatter themselves, as those
          (Luke 18:9) “that trusted in themselves that they were righteous.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Some make the advantages under which they live an occasion of self
          flattery. They flatter themselves that they live in a place where the
          gospel is powerfully preached and among a religious people, where many
          have been converted. And they think it will be much easier for them to
          be saved on that account. Thus they abuse the grace of God to their
          destruction. They do that which the Scriptures call despising the
          riches of God’s goodness: Rom. 2:4, “Or despisest thou the riches of
          his goodness, and forbearance, and long suffering; not knowing that
          the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Some flatter themselves that they are born of godly parents, who are
          dear to God, who have often and earnestly prayed for them. They hope
          that their prayers will be heard, and that encourages them to go on in
          the way of neglecting their souls. The Jews had great dependence upon
          this, that they were the children of Abraham. In John 8:33, they make
          their boast. “We be Abraham’s seed;” and in verse 39, “Abraham is our
          father.”
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Some flatter themselves with their own intentions. They intend to
          neglect themselves, and give themselves liberty for a while longer,
          and then to reform. Though now they neglect their souls, and are going
          on in sin; yet they intend ere long to bestir themselves, to leave off
          their sins, and to set themselves to seek God. They hear that there is
          great encouragement for those who earnestly seek God, that they shall
          find him. So they intend to do; they propose to seek with a great deal
          of earnestness. They are told that there are many who seek to enter
          the kingdom of heaven who shall not be able. But they intend, not only
          to seek, but to strive, however, for the present they allow themselves
          in their ease, sloth, and pleasure, minding only earthly things.<br />
          Or if they should be seized with some mortal distemper, and should
          draw near to the grave, before the time which they lay out in their
          minds for reformation, they think how earnestly they would pray and
          cry to God for mercy. And as they hear God is a merciful God who
          taketh no delight in the death of sinners, they hence flatter
          themselves that they shall move God to have pity on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are but few who are sinners, knowing themselves to be such, who
          do not encourage themselves with intentions of future repentance and
          reformation. But few who do not flatter themselves, that they shall in
          good earnest set themselves to seek God some time or other. Hell is
          full of good intenders who never proved to be true performers: Acts
          24:25, “Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I
          will call for thee.”
        </p>
        <p>
          6. There are some who flatter themselves, that they do and have done,
          a great deal for their salvation, and therefore hope they shall
          obtain, when indeed they neither do what they ought to do, nor what
          they might do in their present state of unregeneracy. Nor are they in
          any likely way to be converted They think they are striving, when they
          neglect many moral and some instituted duties; nor do they exert
          themselves as if it were for their lives. They are not violent for the
          kingdom of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are doubtless many such. Many are concerned, and are seeking,
          and do many things, and think that they are in a very fair way to
          obtain the kingdom of God. Yet there is great danger that they will
          prove at last to be some of the foolish virgins, and be found without
          oil in their vessels.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Some hope by their strivings to obtain salvation of themselves.
          They have a secret imagination that they shall, by degrees, work in
          themselves sorrow and repentance of sin, and love towards God and
          Jesus Christ. Their striving is not so much an earnest seeking to God,
          as a striving to do themselves that which is the work of God. Many who
          are now seeking have this imagination; they labor, read, pray, hear
          sermons and go to private meetings, with the view of making themselves
          holy, and of working in themselves holy affections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many, who only project and design to turn to God hereafter, are apt to
          think that it is an easy thing to be converted, that it is a thing
          which will be in their own power at any time, when they shall
          earnestly set themselves to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Some sinners flatter themselves that they are already converted.
          They sit down and rest in a false hope, persuading themselves that all
          their sins are pardoned, that God loves them, that they shall go to
          heaven when they die, and that they need trouble themselves no more,
          Rev. 3:17, “Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,
          and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and
          miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Sinners very generally go on flattering themselves in some or other of
          these ways till their punishment actually overtakes them. These are
          the baits by which Satan catches souls and draws them into his snare.
          They are such self-flatteries as these that keep men from seeing their
          danger, and that make them go on securely, “as the bird hasteth to the
          snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Those that flatter themselves with hopes of living a great while
          longer in the world, very commonly continue so to do till death comes.
          Death comes upon them when they expect it not. They look upon it as a
          great way off, when there is but a step between them and death. They
          thought not of dying at that time, nor at anytime near it. When they
          were young, they proposed to live a good while longer. And if they
          happen to live till middle age, they still maintain the same thought,
          that they are not yet near death. And so that thought goes along with
          them as long as they live, or till they are just about to die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men often have a dependence on their own righteousness, and as long as
          they live are never brought off from it. Multitudes uphold themselves
          with their own intentions till all their prospects are dashed in
          pieces by death. They put off the work which they have to do till such
          a time. And when that comes, they put it off to another time; until
          death, which cannot be put off, overtakes them. There are many also
          that hold a false hope, a persuasion that they belong to God. And as
          long as they live, by all the marks and signs which are given of a
          true convert, they never will be persuaded to let go their hope till
          it is rent from them by death.<br />
          Thus men commonly uphold themselves, and make themselves easy, till
          hell-fire makes them uneasy. Everlasting ruin comes upon them as a
          snare, and all their hopes are at once cut off, and turned into
          everlasting despair: 1 Thes. 5:3, “When they shall say, Peace and
          safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a
          woman with child; and they shall not escape.”
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION III<br />
          The subject applied
        </p>
        <p>
          1. HENCE we learn one reason why there are but few saved, and why so
          many perish from under the gospel. All men know that they must die,
          and all that sit under the light of the gospel have been told many a
          time, that after this there is an other world, that there are but two
          states in that other world — a state of eternal happiness, and a state
          of eternal misery — that there is but one way of escaping the misery
          and obtaining the blessedness of eternity, which is by obtaining an
          interest in Christ, through faith in him, and that this life is the
          only opportunity of obtaining an interest in Christ. Yet men are so
          much given to flatter themselves in those ways which we have
          mentioned, that there are but few that seasonably take care of their
          salvation. Indeed they cannot but be in some measure concerned about
          their souls. Yet they flatter themselves with one thing or other, so
          that they are kept steadily and uninterruptedly going on in the broad
          way to destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Hence we learn the reason why awakening truths of Scripture, and
          awakening sermons, make no more impression upon men. It is in itself a
          wonderful and surprising thing that God’s denunciations of eternal
          misery and threatenings of casting sinners into the lake that burneth
          with fire and brimstone for ever and ever, do not affect them [or] do
          not startle them. But the truth is, they flatter themselves by such
          means as we have mentioned, that this dreadful misery is not for them;
          that they shall escape it, though multitudes of others are involved in
          it. They take not these threatenings to themselves. They seem to think
          that they do not belong to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          How many are there, who for all the awakening sermons they have heard,
          are yet secure in sin! And who, although they are sensible that they
          are in a Christless condition, and are still going on in sin, yet
          intend to go to heaven, and expect that by some means or other they
          shall arrive there. They are often told that God is very angry with
          them. Yet they think God is a very merciful God and they shall be able
          to pacify him. If they be told how uncertain life is, that doth not
          awaken them, because they flatter themselves with long life. If they
          be told how dangerous it is to delay the business of religion, they
          promise themselves, that they will hereafter engage in it with more
          earnestness than others, and so obtain the end, the salvation of their
          souls. Others, when they are told that many shall seek who shall not
          he able to obtain, think surely that they, having done so much for
          salvation, shall not be denied.

          3. Let every sinner examine, whether he do not flatter himself in some
          of those ways which have been mentioned. What is it in your own minds
          which makes you think it is safe for you to delay turning to God? What
          is it that encourages you to run such a venture as you do, by delaying
          this necessary work? Is it that you hope there is no such state as
          heaven or hell and have a suspicion that there is no God ? Is it this
          that makes you secure? Or is it that you are not much afraid but that
          you shall have opportunity enough, a great while hence, to mind such
          things? Is it an intention of a future seeking a more convenient
          season? And are you persuaded that God will hearken to you then, after
          you shall have so long turned a deaf ear to his commands and gracious
          invitations? Are you encouraged to commit sin, because you hope to
          repent of it? Are you encouraged by the mercy of God to be his
          enemies? And do you resolve still to provoke him to anger because you
          think he is easily pacified?
        </p>
        <p>
          Or do you think that your conversion is in your own power, and that
          you can turn to God when you please? Is it because you have been born
          of godly parents that you are so secure? Or do you imagine that you
          are in a fair way to be converted? Do you think that what you have
          done in religion will engage God to pity you, and that he never can
          have the heart to condemn one who has lived in so orderly a manner? Or
          do you think that you are indeed converted already? And doth that
          encourage you to take a liberty in sinning ? Or are you secure because
          you are so stupid as to think nothing about these things? Do you let
          these concerns wholly alone, and scarcely ever think at all how it
          will be with you after you are dead? — Certainly it must be one or
          more of these things which keeps you in your security and encourages
          you to go on in sin. Examine, therefore, and see which of them it is.

          4. Be persuaded to leave off thus flattering yourselves in your own
          eyes. You are therein informed that those who do as you do, commonly
          continue so doing till their punishment actually comes upon them.
          Thereby you may be convinced of the vanity of all such flatteries. Be
          afraid of that which you are sure is the devil’s bait. “Surely in vain
          is the net spread in the sight of any bird,” Pro. 1:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are not only told in the Scriptures that sinners are generally
          thus allured to hell, but your own reason may convince you that it is
          so. For doubtless other sinners have as much ground to hope to escape
          punishment as you. And it is evident, that they generally do hope to
          escape. Men under the gospel almost universally think they shall not
          go to hell. If it were otherwise, they could have no peace or comfort
          in the world. Yet what multitudes have we reason to conclude go down
          from under the preaching of the gospel to the pit of destruction! Now,
          this is surely enough to convince any sober, prudent person of the
          folly of such flattery, and of the folly of everyone that doth not
          immediately set about his great work with his might. If you could have
          access to the damned, you would hear many of them curse themselves,
          for thus flattering themselves while they lived in this world. And you
          would have the same doctrine preached to you by their wailings and
          yellings which is now preached to you from the pulpit.<br />
          If your temptation to security be unbelief of the fundamental
          doctrines of religion, such as the being of God, of another world, and
          an eternal judgment, you may consider, that though that makes you
          secure at present, yet it will not do always. It will not stand by
          when you come to die. The fool often in health saith, There is no God.
          But when he comes to die, he cannot rest in any such supposition. Then
          he is generally so much convinced in his own conscience that there is
          a God, that he is in dreadful amazement for fear of his eternal wrath.
          It is folly, therefore, to flatter yourselves with any supposition now
          which you will not then be able to hold. — If you depend on long life,
          consider how many who have depended on the same thing, and had as much
          reason to depend on it as you, have died within your remembrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it because you are outwardly of an orderly life and conversation,
          that you think you shall be saved? How unreasonable is it to suppose
          that God should be so obliged by those actions, which he knows are not
          done from the least respect or regard to him, but wholly with a
          private view! Is it because you are under great advantages that you
          are not much afraid but that you shall some time or other be
          converted, and therefore neglect yourselves and your spiritual
          interests? And were not the people of Bethsaida, Chorazin and
          Capernaum, under as great advantages as you, when Christ himself
          preached the gospel to them, almost continually, and wrought such a
          multitude of miracles among them? Yet he says, that it shall be more
          tolerable in the day of judgment for Sodom and Gomorrah, than for
          those cities.<br />
          Do you expect you shall be saved, however you neglect yourselves,
          because you were born of godly parents? Hear what Christ saith, Mat.
          3:9, “Think not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham to our
          father.” Do you flatter yourselves that you shall obtain mercy, though
          others do not, because you intend hereafter to seek it more earnestly
          than others? Yet you deceive yourselves if you think that you intend
          better than many of those others, or better than many who are now in
          hell once intended.<br />
          If you think you are in a way of earnest seeking, consider, whether or
          no you do not mind other things yet more? If you imagine that you have
          it in your own power to work yourselves up to repentance, consider,
          that you must assuredly give up that imagination before you can have
          repentance wrought in you. If you think yourselves already converted,
          and that encourages you to give yourselves the greater liberty in
          sinning, this is a certain sign that you are not converted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherefore abandon all these ways of flattering yourselves. No longer
          follow the devil’s bait and let nothing encourage you to go on in sin;
          but immediately and henceforth seek God with all your heart, and soul,
          and strength.
