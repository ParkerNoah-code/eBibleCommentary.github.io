        <p>John 5:35, “He was a burning and a shining light.”</p>
        <p>
          THAT discourse of our blessed Savior we have an account of in this
          chapter from the 17th verse to the end, was occasioned by the Jews’
          murmuring against him, and persecuting him for his healing the
          impotent man at the pool of Bethesda, and bidding him to take up his
          bed and walk on the sabbath day. Christ largely vindicates himself in
          this discourse by asserting his fellowship with God the Father in
          nature and operations. And thereby implicitly showing himself to be
          Lord of the sabbath, and by declaring to the Jews that God the Father,
          and he with him, did work hitherto, to even to this time. Although it
          be said that God rested on the seventh day from all his works, yet
          indeed God continues to work hitherto, even to this very day, with
          respect to his greatest work, the work of redemption, or new creation,
          which he carries on by Jesus Christ, his Son. Pursuant to the designs
          of which work was his showing mercy to fallen men by healing their
          diseases, and delivering them from the calamities they brought on
          themselves by sin. This great work of redemption God carries on from
          the beginning of the world to this time; and his rest from it will not
          come till the resurrection, which Christ speaks of in the 21st and
          following verses: the finishing of this redemption as to its
          procurement, being in his own resurrection; and as to the application,
          in the general resurrection and eternal judgment, spoken of from verse
          20 to verse 30. So that notwithstanding both the rest on the seventh
          day, and also the rest that Joshua gave the children of Israel in
          Canaan; yet the great rest of the Redeemer from his work, and so of
          his people with him and in him, yet remains, as the apostle observes,
          Heb. Chap. 4. This will be at the resurrection and general judgment;
          which Christ here teaches the Jews was to be brought to pass by the
          Son of God by the Father’s appointment, and so the works of God to be
          finished by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And inasmuch as this vindication was so far from satisfying the Jews,
          that it did but further enrage them, because hereby he made himself
          equal with God, Christ therefore refers them to the witness of John
          the Baptist; whose testimony they must acquiesce in, or else be
          inconsistent with themselves; because they had generally acknowledged
          John to be a great prophet, and seemed for a while mightily affected
          and taken with it, that God after so long a withholding the spirit of
          prophecy, had raised up so great a prophet among them and it is
          concerning him that Christ speaks in this verse wherein is the text,
          “He was a burning and a shining light; and ye were willing for a
          season to rejoice in his light.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to a right understanding and improvement of the words of the
          text, we may observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. What Christ here takes notice of in John, and declares concerning
          him, viz. That he was a burning and a shining light. He was a light to
          the church of Israel, to reveal the mind and will of God to them,
          after a long-continued dark season, and after they had been destitute
          of any prophet to instruct them for some ages. He arose on Israel, as
          the morning star, the forerunner of the Sun of righteousness, to
          introduce the day-spring, or dawning of the gospel day, to give light
          to them that till then had sat in the darkness of perfect night, which
          was the shadow of death; to give them the knowledge of salvation; as
          Zacharias his father declares at his circumcision. Luke 1:76-79, “And
          thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou
          shalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his ways; to give
          knowledge of salvation unto his people, by the remission of their
          sins, through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the day-spring from
          on high hath visited us, to give light to them that sit in darkness
          and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And he was a burning light, as he was full of a spirit of fervent
          piety and holiness, being filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother’s
          womb, having his heart warmed and inflamed with a great love to
          Christ, being that friend of the bridegroom that stood and heard him,
          and rejoiced greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice; and was glad
          that Christ increased, though he decreased, John 3:29, 30. And was
          animated with a holy zeal in the work of the ministry: he came, in
          this respect, in the spirit and power of Elias. As Elias was zealous
          in bearing testimony against the corruption, apostasies, and
          idolatries of Israel in his day, so was John the Baptist in testifying
          against the wickedness of the Jews in his day. As Elias zealously
          reproved the sins of all sorts of persons in Israel, not only the sins
          of the common people, but of their great ones, Ahab, Ahaziah, and
          Jezebel, and their false prophets; with what zeal did John the Baptist
          reprove all sorts of persons, not only the publicans and soldiers, but
          the Pharisees and Sadducees, telling them plainly that they were a
          generation of vipers, and rebuked the wickedness of Herod in his most
          beloved lust, though Herod sought his life for it, as Ahab and Ahaziah
          did Elijah’s! As Elias was much in warning the people of God’s
          approaching judgments, denouncing God’s awful wrath against Ahab,
          Jezebel, and Ahaziah, and the prophets of Baal, and the people in
          general; so was John the Baptist much in warning the people to fly
          from the wrath to come, telling them in the most awakening manner,
          that the “axe was laid at the root of the tree, and that every tree
          that brought not forth good fruit should be hewn down and cast into
          the fire; and that he that came after him had his fan in his hand, and
          that he would thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into
          the garner, and burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
        </p>
        <p>
          John the Baptist was not only a burning but a shining light. He was so
          in his doctrine, having more of the gospel in his preaching than the
          former prophets, or at least the gospel exhibited with greater light
          and clearness, more plainly pointing forth the person that was to be
          the great Redeemer, and declaring his errand into the world, to take
          away the sin of the world, as a lamb offered in sacrifice to God, and
          the necessity that all, even the most strictly moral God, and the
          necessity that all, even the most strictly moral and religious, stood
          in front of him, being by nature a generation of vipers. And the
          spiritual nature of his kingdom, consisting not in circumcision, or
          outward baptism, or any other external performance or privileges, but
          in the powerful influences of the Holy Ghost in their hearts, a being
          baptized with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this clearness with which he gave knowledge of salvation to God’s
          people, John was a bright light, and among them that had been born of
          women there had not arisen a greater than he. In this brightness this
          harbinger of the gospel day excelled all the other prophets, as the
          morning star reflects more of the light of the sun than any other
          star, and is the brightest of all the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also shown bright in his conversation, and his eminent
          mortification and renunciation of the enjoyments of the world. His
          great diligence and laboriousness in his work, his impartiality in it,
          declaring the mind and will of God to all sorts without distinction;
          his great humility, rejoicing in the increase of the honor of Christ,
          though his honor was diminished, as the brightness of the morning star
          diminishes as the light of the sun increases; and in his faithfulness
          and courage, still declaring the mind and will of God, though it cost
          him his own life. Thus his light shone before men.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We may observe to what purpose Christ declares these things of John
          in the text, viz., to show how great and excellent a person he was,
          and worthy that the Jews should regard his testimony: great are the
          things which Christ elsewhere says of John the Baptist, as in Mat.
          11:7-14. He speaks of him as a prophet; and more than a prophet; and
          one, than whom, there had not risen a greater among them that had been
          born of women. He observes how great and excellent a light he was in
          the text, to show the Jews how inexcusable they were in not receiving
          the testimony he had given of him; as you may see (John 5:31-33).
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore that which I would observe from the text to be the subject
          of my present discourse is this:
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the excellency of a minister of the gospel to be both a burning
          and a shining light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we see it is in Christ’s esteem, the great Prophet of God, and
          Light of the world, Head of the church, and Lord of the harvest, and
          the great Lord and Master, whose messengers all ministers of the
          gospel are.
        </p>
        <p>
          John the Baptist was a minister of the gospel. And he was so more
          eminently than the ancient prophets. For though God at sundry times,
          and in divers manners, spake the gospel by them; yet John the Baptist
          was a great minister of the gospel in a manner distinguished from
          them. He is reckoned in Scripture the first that introduced the gospel
          day, after the law and the prophets, Luke 16:16, “The law and the
          prophets were until John; since that time the kingdom of God is
          preached.” And his preaching is called the beginning of the gospel of
          Jesus Christ, the son of God, Mark 1:1. He came on that errand, to
          give knowledge of salvation to God’s people, through the remission of
          their sins (as his father Zacharias observes, Luke 1:77), and to
          preach these glad tidings that the kingdom of heaven was at hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          John being thus eminently a minister of the gospel, and a burning and
          shining light, being taken notice of by Christ as his great
          excellency, we may justly hence observe, that herein consists the
          proper excellency of ministers of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would, by divine assistance, handle the subject in the following
          method:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I would show that Christ’s design in the appointment of the order
          and office of ministers of the gospel is that they may be lights to
          the souls of men.
        </p>
        <p>II. I would show what is implied in their being burning lights.</p>
        <p>III. I would show what is implied in their being shining lights.</p>
        <p>
          IV. I would show that it is the proper excellency of ministers of the
          gospel to have these things united in them, to be both burning and
          shining lights.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. I would apply these things to all that Christ has called to the
          work of the gospel ministry, showing how much it concerns them
          earnestly to endeavor that they may be burning and shining lights.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Show what ministers of the gospel ought to do that they may be so.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. Say something briefly concerning the duty of a people that are
          under the care of a gospel minister, correspondent to those things
          that Christ has taught us concerning the end and excellency of a
          gospel minister.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I would observe that Christ’s design in the appointment of the
          order and office of ministers of the gospel was, that they might be
          lights to the souls of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Satan’s kingdom is a kingdom of darkness. The devils are the rulers of
          the darkness of this world. But Christ’s kingdom is a kingdom of
          light. The designs of his kingdom are carried on by light. His people
          are not of the night, nor of darkness, but are the children of the
          light, as they are the children of God, who is the Father of lights,
          and as it were a boundless fountain of infinite pure and bright light.
          1 John 1:5; Jam. 1:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          Man by the fall extinguished that divine light that shone in this
          world in its first estate. The Scripture represents the wickedness of
          man as reducing the world to that state wherein it was when it was yet
          without form and void, and darkness filled it. Jer. 4:22, 23, “For my
          people is foolish, they have not known me: they are sottish children;
          and they have non understanding: they are wise to do evil; but to do
          good they have no knowledge. I beheld the earth, and lo, it was
          without form and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.” But
          God in infinite mercy has made glorious provision for the restoration
          of light to this fallen dark world. He has sent him who is the
          brightness of his own glory into the world, to be the light of the
          world. “He is the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into
          the world,” i.e. every man in the world that ever has any true light.
          But in his wisdom and mercy, he is pleased to convey his light to men
          by means and instruments. And has sent forth his messengers, and
          appointed ministers in his church to be subordinate lights, and to
          shine with the communications of his light, and to reflect the beams
          of his glory on the souls of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an analogy between the divine constitution and disposition of
          things in the natural and in the spiritual world. The wise Creator has
          not left the natural world without light. But in this our solar system
          has set one great light, immensely exceeding all the rest, shining
          perpetually with a transcendent fullness and strength, to enlighten
          the whole. And he hath appointed other lesser, subordinate, or
          dependent lights, that shine with the communications and reflections
          of something of his brightness. So it is in the spiritual world; there
          God hath appointed Jesus Christ as the Sun of righteousness. The
          church of God has not the sun to be her light by day, nor for
          brightness does the moon give light to her, but the Lord is her
          everlasting light, and her God her glory. The new Jerusalem has no
          need of the sun, nor the moon; for the Lamb is the light thereof. And
          the ministers of Christ are, as it were, the stars that encompass this
          glorious fountain of light, to receive and reflect his beams, and give
          light to the souls of men. As Christ therefore is in Scripture called
          the Sun, so are his ministers called stars. So are the twelve
          apostles, the chief ministers of the Christian church, called, Rev.
          12:1, “And there appeared a great wonder in heaven, a woman clothed
          with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown
          of twelve stars.” And so are the ordinary ministers of the gospel
          called, Rev. 1:16, “And he had in his right hand seven stars.” And
          verse 20, “The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my
          right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks; the seven stars are the
          angels of the seven churches.” Here also ministers of the gospel are
          implicitly compared to those lamps that enlightened the temple at
          Jerusalem, upon the tops of the golden candlesticks: and more
          expressly in Zec. 4:2, “I have looked, and behold a candlestick, all
          of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon.”
        </p>
        <p>
          These lamps have all their oil from Christ, and are enkindled by his
          flame, and shine by his beams; and being thus dependent on him, they
          are near to him, and held in his right hand, that they may receive
          light from him, to communicate to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of a light is threefold; to discover, to refresh, and to
          direct.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first use of a light is to discover things, or make them manifest.
          Without light nothing is to be seen. Eph. 5:13, “Whatsoever doth make
          manifest is light.” Ministers are set to be lights to the souls of men
          in this respect, as they are to be the means of imparting divine truth
          to them, and bringing into their view the most glorious and excellent
          objects, and of leading them to and assisting them in the
          contemplation of those things that angels desire to look into. The
          means of their obtaining that knowledge is infinitely more important,
          and more excellent and useful, than that of the greatest statesmen or
          philosophers, even that which is spiritual and divine. They are set to
          be the means of bringing men out of darkness into God’s marvelous
          light, and of bringing them to the infinite fountain of light, that in
          his light they may see light: they are set to instruct men, and impart
          to them that knowledge by which they may know God and Jesus Christ,
          whom to know is life eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another use of light is to refresh and delight the beholders. Darkness
          is dismal. The light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is to behold
          the sun. Light is refreshing to those who have long sat in darkness.
          They therefore that watch and keep awake through a dark night, long
          and wait for the light of the morning; and the wise man observes, Pro.
          15:30, “That the light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart.” Spiritual
          light is especially refreshing and joyful. Psa. 97:11, “Light is sown
          for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.” They that
          see the light of Christ, the star that hath arisen out of Jacob, are
          refreshed and do rejoice, and the wise men that saw the star that
          showed them where Christ was, Mat. 2:10, “And when they saw the star,
          they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ministers are set in the church of God to be the instruments of this
          comfort and refreshment to the souls of men, to be the instruments of
          leading souls to the God of all consolation, and fountain of their
          happiness. They are sent as Christ was, and as coworkers with him, to
          preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken-hearted, to
          proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to
          them that are bound, and to comfort all that mourn. They are to lead
          those that “labor and are heavy laden” to their true rest, and to
          speak a word in season to him that is weary. They are set to be
          ministers of the consolation and joy of the saints. 2 Cor. 1:24, “We
          have not dominion over your faith; but are helpers of your joy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The third use of light is to direct. ’Tis by light that we see where
          to go. “He that walks in darkness knows not whither he goes,” and is
          in danger of stumbling and falling into mischief. ‘Tis by light that
          men see what to do, and are enabled to work. In the night, Christ
          tells us, no man can work. Ministers are set to be lights to men’s
          souls in this respect also. As Zacharias observes of John the Baptist,
          Luke 1:79, “To guide our feet in the way of peace.” Ministers have the
          record of God committed to them that they may hold that forth, which
          God has given to be to man as a light shining in a dark place, to
          guide them in the way through this dark world, to regions of eternal
          light. Ministers are set to be instruments of conveying to men that
          true wisdom spoken of Job 28, “Which cannot be gotten for gold, nor
          shall silver be weighed for the price thereof; which cannot be valued
          with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.”
        </p>
        <p>I proceed now to the</p>
        <p>
          II. Thing proposed, viz. to show what is implied in a minister of the
          gospel’s being a burning light.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are these two things that seem naturally to be understood by
          this expression, viz. that his heart be filled with much of the holy
          ardor of a spirit of true piety; and that he be fervent and zealous in
          his administrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that his heart be full of much of the holy ardor of a spirit of
          true piety. We read of the power of godliness. True grace is no dull,
          inactive, ineffectual principle. It is a powerful thing. There is an
          exceeding energy in it. And the reason is, that God is in it; it is a
          divine principle, a participation of the divine nature, and a
          communication of divine life, of the life of a risen Savior, who
          exerts himself in the hearts of the saints, after the power of an
          endless life. They that have true grace in them, they live; but not by
          their own life; but Christ lives in them. His Holy Spirit becomes in
          them a living principle and spring of divine life; the energy and
          power of which is in Scripture compared to fire. Mat. 3:11, “ I indeed
          baptize you with water; but he that cometh after me is mightier than
          I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with the
          Holy Ghost, and with fire.” True piety is not a thing remaining only
          in the head, or consisting in any speculative knowledge or opinions,
          or outward morality, or forms of religion. It reaches the heart, is
          chiefly seated there, and burns there. There is a holy ardor in
          everything that belongs to true grace. True faith is an ardent thing,
          and so is true repentance. There is a holy power and ardor in true
          spiritual comfort and joy; yea, even in true Christian humility,
          submission, and meekness. The reason is, that divine love or charity
          is the sum of all true grace, which is a holy flame enkindled in the
          soul. It is by this therefore especially, that a minister of the
          gospel is a burning light. A minister that is so has his soul
          enkindled with the heavenly flame. His heart burns with love to
          Christ, and fervent desires of the advancement of his kingdom and
          glory. And also [it burns] with ardent love to the souls of men, and
          desires for their salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the inward holy ardor of his soul is exercised and manifested
          in his being zealous and fervent in his administrations. For he is a
          burning light. [This] implies that his spiritual heat and holy ardor
          is not for himself only, but is communicative and for the benefit of
          others. He is ardent, as he is a light, or in the performance of the
          duties of that office wherein he is set to be a light in the church of
          Christ. His fervent zeal, which has its foundation and spring in that
          holy and powerful flame of love to God and man, that is in his heart,
          appears in the fervency of his prayers to God, for and with his
          people. And in the earnestness and power with which he preaches the
          Word of God, declares to sinners their misery, and warns them to fly
          from the wrath to come, and reproves and testifies against all
          ungodliness; and the unfeigned earnestness and compassion with which
          he invites the weary and heavy laden to their Savior; and the fervent
          love with which he counsels and comforts the saints; and the holy
          zeal, courage, and stedfastness, with which he maintains the exercise
          of discipline in the house of God, notwithstanding all the opposition
          he meets with in that difficult part of the ministerial work; and in
          the diligence and earnestness with which he attends every duty of his
          ministerial function, whether public or private.
        </p>
        <p>But I hasten to the</p>
        <p>
          III. Thing proposed in the handling of this subject, viz. to show what
          is implied in a minister’s being a shining light.
        </p>
        <p>There are three things that seem to be naturally signified by it.</p>
        <p>
          First, that he be pure, clear, and full in his doctrine. A minister is
          set to be a light to men’s souls, by teaching, or doctrine. And if he
          be a shining light in this respect, the light of his doctrine must be
          bright and full. It must be pure without mixtures of darkness. And
          therefore he must be sound in the faith, not one that is of a
          reprobate mind. In doctrine he must show uncorruptness; otherwise his
          light will be darkness. He must not lead his people into errors, but
          teach them the truth only, guiding their feet into the way of peace,
          and leading them in the right ways of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          He must be one that is able to teach; not one that is raw, ignorant,
          or unlearned, and but little versed in the things that he is to teach
          others; not a novice, or one that is unskillful in the word of
          righteousness. He must be one that is well studied in divinity, well
          acquainted with the written Word of God, mighty in the Scriptures, and
          able to instruct and convince gainsayers.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in order to be a shining light, he must be one that really knows
          what religion is; one that is truly acquainted with that Savior and
          way of salvation, that he is to teach to others, that he may speak the
          things that he knows, and testify the things that he has seen, and not
          be a blind leader of the blind. He must be one that is acquainted with
          experimental religion, and not ignorant of the inward operations of
          the Spirit of God, nor of Satan’ s devices; able to guide souls under
          their particular difficulties. Thus he must be a scribe well
          instructed in things that pertain to the kingdom of God; one that
          brings forth out of his treasures things new and old.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in order to his being a shining light, his doctrine must be full.
          He must not only be able to teach, but apt to teach, ready to instruct
          the ignorant, and them that are out of the way, and diligent in
          teaching in public and private; and careful and faithful to declare
          the whole counsel of God, and not keep back anything that may be
          profitable to his hearers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also his being a shining light implies that his instructions are clear
          and plain, accommodated to the capacity of his hearers, and tending to
          convey light to their understandings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, another thing requisite in order to a minister’s being a
          shining light, is that he be discreet in all his administrations. The
          fervent zeal that thus should animate and actuate him in his
          administrations should be regulated by discretion. He should not only
          be knowing, and able to communicate knowledge and formed to do it; but
          also wise, and know how to conduct himself in the house of God, as a
          wise builder, and a wise steward. And as he is one that God hath sent
          forth to labor in his field, and committed the care of his vineyard
          to, so he should conduct himself there as one whom his God doth
          instruct to discretion. He should not only be as harmless as a dove,
          but as wise as a serpent; showing himself a workman that needs not to
          be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth; and one that knows how
          to govern the church of God, and to walk in wisdom towards those that
          are without.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, another thing implied in a minister’s being a shining light is
          that he shines in his conversation. If he shines never so much in his
          doctrine and administrations in the house of God, yet if there be not
          an answerable brightness in his conversation, it will have a tendency
          to render all ineffectual. Christ, in Mat. 5:14, 15, 16, says to his
          disciples (having undoubtedly a special respect to those of them that
          were to be sent forth to preach the gospel), “Ye are the light of the
          world: Men do not light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a
          candlestick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.” And
          how does Christ direct them to give light to others? “Let your light,”
          says he, “so shine before men, that others, seeing your good works,
          may glorify your Father which is in heaven,” And he tells the same
          disciples again, John 15:8, “Herein is my Father glorified, that ye
          bear much fruit.” And how should they bring forth fruit? Christ tells
          them, verse 10, “If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my
          love,” and verse 14, “Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command
          you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          God sent his Son into the world to be the light of the world these two
          ways, viz. by revealing his mind and will to the world, and also by
          setting the world a perfect example. So ministers are set to be
          lights, not only as teachers, but as ensamples to the flock, 1 Peter
          5:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same things that ministers recommend to their hearers in their
          doctrine, they should also show them an example of in their practice.
          Thus the apostle says to Timothy, 1 Tim. 4:11, “These things command
          and teach,” and then adds in the next verse, “Be thou an example of
          the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
          faith, in purity.” So he directs Titus, in his teaching, to recommend
          sobriety, gravity, temperance, patience, and other virtues, in the
          beginning of the second chapter of Titus. But then adds in the 7th
          verse, “In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We see in natural bodies, that when heat is raised in them to a high
          degree, at length they begin to shine. And, as I observed before, a
          principle of true grace in the soul is like an inward heat, a holy
          ardor of a heavenly fire enkindled in the soul. This in ministers of
          the gospel ought to be to that degree, as to shine forth brightly in
          all their conversation. And there should as it were be a light about
          them wherever they go, exhibiting to all that behold them, the
          amiable, delightful image of the beauty and brightness of their
          glorious Master.
        </p>
        <p>I proceed to the</p>
        <p>
          IV. Thing proposed, which is to show that the excellency of a minister
          of the gospel consists in his being thus both a burning and a shining
          light.
        </p>
        <p>This is manifest in two things:</p>
        <p>
          First, herein his ministry is acceptable and amiable in the sight of
          God and men.
        </p>
        <p>
          When light and heat are thus united in a minister of the gospel, it
          shows that each is genuine, and of a right kind, and that both are
          divine. Divine light is attended with heat. And so, on the other hand,
          a truly divine and holy heat and ardor is ever accompanied with light.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the glory of the sun that such a bright and glorious light, and
          such a powerful, refreshing, vivifying heat, are both together
          diffused from that luminary. When there is light in a minister,
          consisting in human learning, great speculative knowledge, and the
          wisdom of this world, without a spiritual warmth and ardor in his
          heart, and a holy zeal in his ministrations, his light is like the
          light of an ignis fatuus, and some kinds of putrefying carcasses that
          shine in the dark, though they are of a stinking savor. And if on the
          other hand a minister has warmth and zeal, without light, his heat has
          nothing excellent in it, but is rather to be abhorred; being like the
          heat of the bottomless pit, where though the fire be great, yet there
          is no light. To be hot in this manner, and not lightsome, is to be
          like an angel of darkness. But ministers by having light and heat
          united in them, will be like the angels of light; which for their
          light and brightness are called morning stars. Job 38:7, “When the
          morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.”
          And because of that holy ardor of divine love and zeal with which they
          burn, they are compared to a flaming fire. Psa. 4, “Who maketh his
          angels spirits, and his ministers a flaming fire,” and are therefore
          called seraphims, which is a word that is derived from a root that
          signifies to burn. So that by ministers of the gospel being burning
          and shining lights, the angels of the churches will become like the
          angels of heaven, and those stars held in the right hand of Christ
          here below, will be like those morning stars above, and which is much
          more. Hereby ministers will be like their glorious Lord and Master;
          who is not only the Master of ministers of the gospel, but is the Head
          and Lord of the glorious angels, whom they adore, and who communicates
          to them the brightness in which they shine, and the flame with which
          they burn, and is the glorious luminary and sun of the heavenly world,
          from whence all the inhabitants of that world have their light and
          life, and all their glory. In this Sun of righteousness is that light,
          whose brightness is such that the light of the sun in the firmament in
          comparison of it is as darkness, yea, black as sackcloth of hair. For
          he is the infinite brightness of God’s glory; and of him it is said,
          Isa. 24:23, “Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed,
          when the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount of Zion, and in Jerusalem,
          before his ancients, gloriously.” And accompanying this bright light
          in him, is the infinitely intense flame of love. There is no love to
          be compared to his; nor ever was love both to God and man so
          manifested, as has been in what Christ has done and suffered. For
          herein was love! Ministers, by being burning and shining lights,
          become the sons of God, of whom we read that he is light, and that he
          is love. 1 John 1:5, “This then is the message which we have heard of
          him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no
          darkness at all.” And chap. 4:16, “And we have known and believed the
          love that God hath to us: God is love, and he that dwelleth in love,
          dwelleth in God, and God in him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore it must needs be that ministers, by being burning and
          shining lights, are acceptable and amiable in the sight of God, as he
          delights in his own image and in the image of his Son. And hereby also
          they will be honorable and amiable in the sight of men, all such as
          have any sense of that which is truly excellent and beautiful. And it
          is the way to have their ministry pleasant and delightful to those of
          this character that sit under it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, herein a minister of the gospel will be likely to answer the
          ends of his ministry. By this means his ministry will not only be
          amiable, but profitable. If a minister has light without heat, and
          entertains his auditory with learned discourses, without a savior of
          the power of godliness, or any appearance of fervency of spirit, and
          zeal for God and the good of souls, he may gratify itching ears, and
          fill the heads of his people with empty notions. But it will not be
          very likely to reach their hearts, or save their souls. And if, on the
          other hand, he be driven on with a fierce and intemperate zeal, and
          vehement heat, without light, he will be likely to kindle the like
          unhallowed flame in his people, and to fire their corrupt passions and
          affections; but will make them never the better, nor lead them a step
          towards heaven, but drive them apace the other way.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if he approves himself in his ministry, as both a burning a
          shining light, this will be the way to promote true Christianity
          amongst his people, and to make them both wise, good, and cause
          religion to flourish among them in the purity and beauty of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When divine light and heat attend each other in ministers of the
          gospel, their light will be like the beams of the sun, that do not
          only convey light, but give life. And converts will be likely to
          spring up under their ministry, as the grass and the plants of the
          field under the influences of the sun. And the souls of the saints
          will be likely to grow, and appear beautiful as the lily, and to
          revive as the corn, and grow as the vine, and their scent to be as the
          wine of Lebanon; and their light will be like the light of Christ,
          which is the light of life, John 8:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the sun should shine upon the earth with the same brightness that
          it doth now, yet if it were without any heat, it would give life to
          nothing. The world would be a desolate wilderness, with nothing
          growing in it. The death of every living thing must be the
          consequence. And the sun’s light could be of no service to us, but to
          cause us to see our own and others’ misery, without being able to help
          ourselves or them. On the other hand, if the sun diffused the same
          heat that now it does, but the world was destitute at the same time of
          any light, it would be equally unserviceable. Mankind having no light
          to guide them in their business, in tilling the field, or gathering
          the produce of the earth, we should be like the Egyptians in the three
          days’ darkness, who saw not one another, nor rose from their place.
          And thus also death would be the unavoidable consequence. But by light
          and heat accompanying one another, the whole face of the earth becomes
          fruitful, and is adorned, and all things are quickened and flourish,
          and mankind enjoy both life and comfort.
        </p>
        <p>I proceed to the</p>
        <p>
          V. Thing proposed in handling the doctrine, to apply these things to
          all here present, that Christ has called to the work of the gospel
          ministry, observing how much it concerns such to endeavor to be
          burning and shining lights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our office and work is most honorable, in that we are set by Christ to
          be lights or luminaries in the spiritual world. Light is the most
          glorious thing in the material world, and there are, it may be, no
          parts of the natural world that have so great an image of the goodness
          of God, as the lights or luminaries of heaven; and especially the sun,
          who is constantly communicating his benign influence to enlighten,
          quicken, and refresh the world by his beams; which is probably the
          reason that the worship of the sun was (as is supposed) the first
          idolatry that mankind fell into. But so are ministers honored by their
          great Lord and Master, that they are set to be that to men’s souls,
          that the lights of heaven are to their bodies; and that they might be
          the instruments and vehicles of God’s greatest goodness, and the most
          precious fruits of his eternal love to them, and means of that life,
          and refreshment, and joy, that are spiritual and eternal, and
          infinitely more precious than any benefit received by the benign beams
          of the sun in the firmament. And we shall be likely indeed to be the
          instruments of those unspeakable benefits to the souls of our
          fellow-creatures, if we have those qualifications, which have been
          shown to be the true and proper excellency of ministers of the gospel.
          Herein our glory will answer the honorable station Christ has set us
          in. And hereby our ministry will be likely to be as beneficial as our
          office is honorable. We shall be like Christ, and shall shine with his
          beams. Christ will live in us, and be seen in his life and beauty in
          our ministry, and in our conversation, and we shall be most likely to
          be the means of bringing others to him, and of their receiving of his
          light, and being made partakers of his life, and having his joy
          fulfilled in them. And this will be the way for us hereafter to be as
          much advanced and distinguished in our reward, as we are honored in
          the office and business we are called to here. In this way, those whom
          Christ has set to be lights in his church, and to be stars in the
          spiritual world here, shall be lights also in the church triumphant,
          and shine as stars for ever in heaven. Dan. 12:3, “And they that be
          wise, shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that
          turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever.

          But if we fail of the proper excellency of ministers of the gospel, we
          shall not be in the sight of God the more worthy or honorable for our
          high office, but the more abominable and inexcusable. Our wickedness
          being aggravated by God’s great goodness and condescension to us, and
          the peculiar obligations that he laid upon us; and instead of being
          eminently beneficial and great blessings, as lights to reflect the
          beams of Christ’s glory and love, we shall be so much the more hurtful
          and pernicious, for our being in such a station. And so shall be
          likely hereafter to suffer a so much more dreadful punishment. The
          devils in hell are so much the more odious to God, and more the
          objects of his wrath, because he set them in the dignity and glory of
          angels, the excellency of which state they are fallen from. And it is
          likely that those in hell that will be nearest to the fallen angels,
          in their state of misery, will be those that Christ once set to be
          angels of the churches, but through their unfaithfulness, failed of
          their proper excellency and end.

          Here I would apply myself in a few words to the person whose intended
          ordination, this day, to the great work of the gospel ministry, is the
          occasion of this discourse.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have now, dear sir, heard something of the nature and design of
          that office to which you are this day, in the name of Christ, to be
          solemnly set apart. You are therein called to be a light to the souls
          of men, a lamp in God’s temple, and a star in the spiritual world. And
          you have heard wherein, in Christ’s esteem, consists the proper
          excellency of one in that office, and how in this a minister of the
          gospel becomes like his glorious Master, and glorifies him, and is
          likely to be the instrument of the salvation and happiness of the
          souls of men, and to receive a glorious reward from the hands of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          These, sir, are the motives that you are to be influenced by, to
          endeavor to be a burning and a shining light in the work of the
          ministry. As to the things of this world, you are not to expect
          outward ease, pleasure, and plenty; nor are you to depend on the
          friendship and respect of men; but should prepare to endure hardness,
          as one that is going forth as a soldier to war. But they are higher
          things than these, more excellent benefits than the world can afford,
          that Christ offers to those that approve themselves to him in this
          work.
        </p>
        <p>
          God in his providence has brought you far from your native land, and
          from your friends and acquaintance there. But you will have reason,
          not withstanding, to acknowledge the good hand of his providence
          towards you, if he is pleased to make you a burning and shining light
          in this part of his church, and by the influence of your light and
          heat (or rather by his divine influence with your ministry) to cause
          this wilderness to bud and blossom as the rose, and give it the
          excellency of Carmel and Sharon, and to cause you to shine in the
          midst of this people with warm and lightsome, quickening and
          comforting, beams, causing their souls to flourish, rejoice, and bear
          fruit like a garden of pleasant fruits under the beams of the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          By this means you will be to their souls the vehicle of the influences
          and blessings of the heavenly world, which is a world of light and
          love, shall be ever held in Christ’s right hand, and shall be terrible
          to the powers of darkness; and shall see more and more of the light of
          Christ’s glory and grace in this place, with you and this people, and
          shall hereafter not only shine yourself, as the brightness of the
          firmament, but shall meet with them in glory also, who shall shine
          there around you, as a bright constellation in the highest heaven;
          where they shall be your everlasting crown of rejoicing.
        </p>
        <p>But I hasten to the</p>
        <p>
          VI. Thing proposed, which was to show what course ministers of the
          gospel ought to take, or what things they should do, that they may be
          burning and shining lights.
        </p>
        <p>And here I shall be just mention things, without enlarging.</p>
        <p>
          And in order to this, ministers should be diligent in their studies,
          and in the work of the ministry to which they are called; giving
          themselves wholly to it; taking heed to themselves that their hearts
          be not engaged, and their minds swallowed up, and their time consumed,
          in pursuits after the profits and vain glory of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          And particularly, ministers should be very conversant with the Holy
          Scriptures; making it very much their business, with the utmost
          diligence and strictness, to search those holy writings. For they are
          as it were the beams of the light of the Sun of righteousness; they
          are the light by which ministers must be enlightened, and the light
          they are to hold forth to their hearers; and they are the fire whence
          their hearts and the hearts of their hearers must be enkindled.
        </p>
        <p>
          They should earnestly seek after much of the spiritual knowledge of
          Christ, and that they may live in the clear views of his glory. For by
          this means they will be changed into the image of the same glory and
          brightness, and will come to their people as Moses came down to the
          congregation of Israel, after he had seen God’s back parts in the
          mount, with his face shining. If the light of Christ’s glory shines
          upon them, it will be the way for them to shine with the same kind of
          light on their hearers, and to reflect the same beams, which have
          heat, as well of as brightness. The light of the knowledge of the
          glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, is the treasure the apostle
          speaks of, that ministers have, as in earthen vessels. 2 Cor. 4:6, 7,
          “For God, who commanded the light to shined out of darkness, hath
          shines into your hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the
          glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure
          in earthen vessels.” This was probably typified of old, by the burning
          lights and lamps which Gideon’s soldiers had in one hand in earthen
          pitchers, while they held a trumpet in the other, with which they
          sounded (typifying the preaching of the gospel). And thus with the
          sound of these trumpets, and these burning lights or earthen vessels,
          they overcame the enemies of God and his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ministers, in order to their being burning and shining lights, should
          walk closely with God, and keep near to Christ; that they may ever be
          enlightened and enkindled by him. And they should be much in seeking
          God, and conversing with him by prayer, who is the fountain of light
          and love. And knowing their own emptiness and helplessness, [they]
          should be ever dependent on Christ; being sensible with Jeremiah that
          they are children, should sit as children at Christ’s feet to hear his
          word, and be instructed by him. And being sensible with Isaiah that
          they are men of unclean lips, should seek that their lips may be, as
          it were, touched with a live coal from the altar, as it were by the
          bright and burning seraphim.
        </p>
        <p>I come now to the</p>
        <p>
          VII. And last things proposed, to say something very briefly
          concerning the duties of a people that are under the care of a
          minister, corresponding with these things that Christ has taught us
          concerning the nature and end of this sacred office. And here I would
          have a special respect to the people of God in this place, who are
          about to have the care of their souls committed to him, that is now
          solemnly to be set apart to the work of the ministry.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be, as you have heard, the proper excellency of a minister of
          the gospel to be a burning and a shining light, then it is your duty
          earnestly to pray for your minister, that he may be filled with divine
          light, and with the power of the Holy Ghost, to make him so. For
          herein you will but pray for the greatest benefit to yourselves. For
          if your minister burns and shines, it will be for your light and life.
          That which has been spoken of, as it is the chief excellency of a
          minister, so it renders a minister the greatest blessing of anything
          in the world that ever God bestows on a people.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as it is your duty, to pray that your minister may by this mean
          become such a blessing to you, so you should do your part to make him
          so, by supporting him, and putting him under the best advantage, with
          a mind free from worldly cares, and the pressure of outward wants and
          difficulties, to give himself wholly to his work. And by all proper
          acts of respect, and kindness, and assistance, [you are] to encourage
          his heart, and strengthen his hands. And to take heed that instead of
          this you do not take a course to obscure and extinguish the light that
          would shine among you, and to smother and suppress the flame, by
          casting dirt upon it; by necessitating your minister by your
          penuriousness towards him, to be involved in worldly care; and by
          discouraging his heart by disrespect unkindness. And particularly when
          your minister shows himself to be a burning light, by burning with a
          proper zeal against any wickedness that may be breaking out amongst
          his people, and manifests it by bearing a proper testimony against it
          in the preaching of the word, or by a faithful exercise of the
          discipline of God’s house, instead of taking it thankfully, and
          yielding to him in it, as you ought, does not raise another fire of a
          contrary nature against it. Viz. the fire of your unhallowed passions,
          reflecting upon and reproaching him for his faithfulness. Herein you
          will act very unbecoming a Christian people, and show yourselves very
          ungrateful to your minister, and to Christ, who has bestowed upon you
          so faithful a minister. And will also, while you fight against him,
          and against Christ, fight most effectually against your own souls. If
          Christ gives you a minister that is a burning and shining light, take
          heed that you do not hate the light, because your deeds are reproved
          by it. But love and rejoice in his light; and that not only for a
          season, like John the Baptist’s apostatizing hearers; and come to the
          light. Let your frequent resort be to your minister for instruction in
          soul cases, and under all spiritual difficulties. And be open to the
          light and willing to receive it. And be obedient to it. And thus walk
          as the children of light, and follow your minister wherein he is a
          follower of Christ, i.e. wherein he is as a burning and shining light.
          If you continue so to do, your path will be the path of the just,
          which shines more and more to the perfect day, and the end of your
          course shall be in those blissful regions of everlasting light above,
          where you shall shine forth with your minister, and both with Christ,
          as the sun, in the kingdom of the heavenly Father.
