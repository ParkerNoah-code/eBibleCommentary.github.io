        <h2>Christian Knowledge – Hebrews 5:12</h2>
        <p class="title">
          Hebrews 5:12, “For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have
          need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the
          oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of
          strong meat.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THESE words are a complaint, which the apostle makes against the
          Christian Hebrews, for their want of such proficiency in the knowledge
          of the doctrines and mysteries of religion, as might have been
          expected of them. The apostle complains, that they had not made that
          progress in their acquaintance with the things taught in the oracles
          of God, which they ought to have made. And he means to reprove them,
          not merely for their deficiency in spiritual and experimental
          knowledge of divine things, but for their deficiency in a doctrinal
          acquaintance with the principles of religion, and the truths of
          Christian divinity, as is evident by the manner in which the apostle
          introduces this reproof. The occasion of his introducing it is this:
          in the next text but one preceding, he mentions Christ as being
          “Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchizedek.” In the
          Old Testament, the oracles of God, Melchizedek was held forth as an
          eminent type of Christ, and the account we there have of him contains
          many gospel mysteries. These mysteries the apostle was willing to
          point out to the Christian Hebrews, but he apprehended that through
          their weakness in knowledge, they would not understand him, and
          therefore breaks off for the present from saying anything about
          Melchizedek, thus (Heb. 5:11) “Of whom we have many things to say, and
          hard to be uttered; seeing ye are all dull of hearing.” i.e. There are
          many things concerning Melchizedek which contain wonderful gospel
          mysteries, and which I would take notice of to you, were it not that I
          am afraid, that through your dullness, and backwardness in
          understanding these things, you would only be puzzled and confounded
          by my discourse, and so receive no benefit, and that it would be too
          hard for you: as meat that is too strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then come in the words of the text: “For when for the time ye ought to
          be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first
          principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of
          milk, and not of strong meat.” As much as to say, Indeed it might have
          been expected of you, that you should have known enough of the Holy
          Scriptures, to be able to understand and digest such mysteries: but it
          is not so with you. The apostle speaks of their proficiency in such
          knowledge as is conveyed by human teaching, as appears by that
          expression, “When for the time ye ought to be teachers;” which
          includes not only a practical and experimental, but also a doctrinal,
          knowledge of the truths and mysteries of religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the apostle speaks of such knowledge, whereby Christians are
          enabled to understand those things in divinity which are more abstruse
          and difficult to be understood, and which require great skill in
          things of this nature. This is more fully expressed in the two next
          verses: “For every one that useth milk is unskillful in the word of
          righteousness; for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them
          that are of full age, even those who, by reason of use, have their
          senses exercised to discern both good and evil.” It is such knowledge,
          that proficiency in it shall carry persons beyond the first principles
          of religion. As here, “Ye have need that one teach you again which be
          the first principles of the oracles of God.” Therefore the apostle, in
          the beginning of the next chapter, advises them “to leave the first
          principles of the doctrine of Christ, and to go on unto perfection.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We may observe that the fault of this defect appears, in that they had
          not made proficiency according to their time. — For the time, they
          ought to have been teachers. As they were Christians, their business
          was to learn and gain Christian knowledge. They were scholars in the
          school of Christ; and if they had improved their time in learning, as
          they ought to have done, they might, by the time when the apostle
          wrote, have been fit to be teachers in this school. To whatever
          business anyone is devoted, it may be expected that his perfection in
          it shall be answerable to the time he has had to learn and perfect
          himself. — Christians should not always remain babes, but should grow
          in Christian knowledge. Leaving the food of babes, they should learn
          to digest strong meat.
        </p>
        <p>
          DOCTRINE. Every Christian should make a business of endeavoring to
          grow in knowledge in divinity. — This is indeed esteemed the business
          of divines and ministers: it is commonly thought to be their work, by
          the study of the Scriptures, and other instructive books, to gain
          knowledge. Most seem to think that it may be left to them, as what
          belongeth not to others. But if the apostle had entertained this
          notion, he would never have blamed the Christian Hebrews for not
          having acquired knowledge enough to be teachers. Or if he had thought
          that this concerned Christians in general only as a thing by the by,
          and that their time should not in a considerable measure be taken up
          with this business, he never would have so much blamed them, that
          their proficiency in knowledge had not been answerable to the time
          which they had had to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          In handling this subject, I shall show — what is intended by divinity
          — what kind of knowledge in divinity is intended — why knowledge in
          divinity is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          And why all Christians should make a business of endeavoring to grow
          in this knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>
          What is intended by divinity, as the object of Christian knowledge
        </p>
        <p>
          VARIOUS definitions have been given of this subject by those who have
          treated on it. I shall not now stand to inquire which, according to
          the rules of art, is the most accurate definition, but shall so define
          or describe it, as I think has the greatest tendency to convey a
          proper notion of it. — It is that science or doctrine which
          comprehends all those truths and rules which concern the great
          business of religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are various kinds of arts and sciences taught and learned in the
          schools, which are conversant about various objects: about the works
          of nature in general, as philosophy; or the visible heavens, as
          astronomy; or the sea, as navigation; or the earth, as geography; or
          the body of man, as physic and anatomy; or the soul of man with regard
          to its natural powers and qualities, as logic and pneumatology; or
          about human government, as politics and jurisprudence. But one
          science, or kind of knowledge and doctrine, is above all the rest; as
          it treats concerning God and the great business of religion. Divinity
          is not learned, as other sciences, merely by the improvement of man’s
          natural reason, but is taught by God himself in a book full of
          instruction, which he has given us for that end. This is the rule
          which God has given to the world to be their guide in searching after
          this kind of knowledge, and is a summary of all things of this nature
          needful for us to know. Upon this account divinity is rather called a
          doctrine, than an art or science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed there is what is called natural religion. There are many truths
          concerning God, and our duty to him, which are evident by the light of
          nature. But Christian divinity, properly so called, is not evident by
          the light of nature. It depends on revelation. Such are our
          circumstances now in our fallen state, that nothing which it is
          needful for us to know concerning God, is manifest by the light of
          nature, in the manner in which it is necessary for us to know it. For
          the knowledge of no truth in divinity is of significance to us, any
          otherwise than as it some way or other belongs to the gospel scheme,
          or as it relates to a Mediator. But the light of nature teaches us no
          truth in this matter. Therefore it cannot be said that we come to the
          knowledge of any part of Christian truth by the light of nature. It is
          only the Word of God, contained in the Old and New Testament, which
          teaches us Christian divinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          This comprehends all that is taught in the Scriptures, and so all that
          we need know, or is to be known, concerning God and Jesus Christ,
          concerning our duty to God, and our happiness in God. Divinity is
          commonly defined, the doctrine of living to God; and by some who seem
          to be more accurate, the doctrine of living to God by Christ. It
          comprehends all Christian doctrines as they are in Jesus, and all
          Christian rules directing us in living to God by Christ. There is no
          one doctrine, no promise, no rule, but what some way or other relates
          to the Christian and divine life, or our living to God by Christ. They
          all relate to this, in two respects, viz. as they tend to promote our
          living to God here in this world, in a life of faith and holiness, and
          also as they tend to bring us to a life of perfect holiness and
          happiness, in the full enjoyment of God hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>What kind of knowledge in divinity, is intended in the doctrine</p>
        <p>
          THERE are two kinds of knowledge of divine truth, viz. speculative and
          practical, or in other terms, natural and spiritual. The former
          remains only in the head. No other faculty but the understanding is
          concerned in it. It consists in having a natural or rational knowledge
          of the things of religion, or such a knowledge as is to be obtained by
          the natural exercise of our own faculties, without any special
          illumination of the Spirit of God. The latter rests not entirely in
          the head, or in the speculative ideas of things, but the heart is
          concerned in it: it principally consists in the sense of the heart.
          The mere intellect, without the will or the inclination, is not the
          seat of it. And it may not only be called seeing, but feeling or
          tasting. Thus there is a difference between having a right speculative
          notion of the doctrines contained in the Word of God, and having a due
          sense of them in the heart. In the former consists the speculative or
          natural knowledge, in the latter consists the spiritual or practical
          knowledge of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither of these is intended in the doctrine exclusively of the other,
          but it is intended that we should seek the former in order to the
          latter. The latter, or the spiritual and practical, is of the greatest
          importance. For a speculative without a spiritual knowledge, is to no
          purpose, but to make our condemnation the greater. Yet a speculative
          knowledge is also of infinite importance in this respect, that without
          it we can have no spiritual or practical knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have already shown that the apostle speaks not only of a spiritual
          knowledge, but of such as can be acquired, and communicated from one
          to another. Yet it is not to be thought that he means this exclusively
          of the other. But he would have the Christian Hebrews seek the one, in
          order to the other. Therefore the former is first and most directly
          intended. It is intended that Christians should, by reading and other
          proper means, seek a good rational knowledge of the things of
          divinity, while the latter is more indirectly intended, since it is to
          be sought by the other. But I proceed to:
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>The usefulness and necessity of the knowledge of divine truths</p>
        <p>
          THERE is no other way by which any means of grace whatsoever can be of
          any benefit, but by knowledge. All teaching is in vain, without
          learning. Therefore the preaching of the gospel would be wholly to no
          purpose, if it conveyed no knowledge to the mind. There is an order of
          men which Christ has appointed on purpose to be teachers in his
          church. But they teach in vain, if no knowledge in these things is
          gained by their teaching. It is impossible that their teaching and
          preaching should be a mean of grace, or of any good in the hearts of
          their hearers, any otherwise than by knowledge imparted to the
          understanding. Otherwise it would be of as much benefit to the
          auditory, if the minister should preach in some unknown tongue. All
          the difference is that preaching in a known tongue conveys something
          to the understanding, which preaching in an unknown tongue doth not.
          On this account, such preaching must be unprofitable. In such things
          men receive nothing, when they understand nothing, and are not at all
          edified, unless some knowledge be conveyed; agreeable to the apostle’s
          arguing, 1 Cor. 14:2-6.
        </p>
        <p>
          No speech can be a mean of grace, but by conveying knowledge.
          Otherwise the speech is as much lost as if there had been no man
          there, and if he that spoke, had spoken only into the air, as it
          follows in the passage just quoted, verse 6-10. God deals with man as
          with a rational creature, and when faith is in exercise, it is not
          about something he knows not what. Therefore hearing is absolutely
          necessary to faith, because hearing is necessary to understanding,
          Rom. 10:14, “How shall they believe in him of whom they have not
          heard?” In like manner, there can be no love without knowledge. It is
          not according to the nature of the human soul, to love an object which
          is entirely unknown. The heart cannot be set upon an object of which
          there is no idea in the understanding. The reasons which induce the
          soul to love, must first be understood, before they can have a
          reasonable influence on the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          God has given us the Bible, which is a book of instructions. But this
          book can be of no manner of profit to us, any otherwise than as it
          conveys some knowledge to the mind. It can profit us no more than if
          it were written in the Chinese or Tartarian language, of which we know
          not one word. So the sacraments of the gospel can have a proper effect
          no other way, than by conveying some knowledge. They represent certain
          things by visible signs. And what is the end of signs, but to convey
          some knowledge of the things signified? Such is the nature of man,
          that no object can come at the heart but through the door of the
          understanding, and there can be no spiritual knowledge of that of
          which there is not first a rational knowledge. It is impossible that
          anyone should see the truth or excellency of any doctrine of the
          gospel, who knows not what that doctrine is. A man cannot see the
          wonderful excellency and love of Christ in doing such and such things
          for sinners, unless his understanding be first informed how those
          things were done. He cannot have a taste of the sweetness and
          excellency of divine truth, unless be first have a notion that there
          is such a thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without knowledge in divinity, none would differ from the most
          ignorant and barbarous heathens. The heathens remain in gross
          darkness, because they are not instructed, and have not obtained the
          knowledge of divine truths.
        </p>
        <p>
          If men have no knowledge of these things, the faculty of reason in
          them will be wholly in vain. The faculty of reason and understanding
          was given for actual understanding and knowledge. If a man have no
          actual knowledge, the faculty or capacity of knowing is of no use to
          him. And if he have actual knowledge, yet if he be destitute of the
          knowledge of those things which are the last end of his being, and for
          the sake of the knowledge of which he had more understanding given him
          than the beasts, then still his faculty of reason is in vain. He might
          as well have been a beast as a man. But divine subjects are the things
          to know which we had the faculty of reason given us. They are the
          things which appertain to the end of our being, and to the great
          business for which we are made. Therefore a man cannot have his
          faculty of understanding to any good purpose, further than he has
          knowledge of divine truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that this kind of knowledge is absolutely necessary. — Other kinds
          of knowledge may be very useful. Some other sciences, such as
          astronomy, natural philosophy, and geography, may be very excellent in
          their kind. But the knowledge of this divine science is infinitely
          more useful and important than that of all other sciences whatever.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IV</p>
        <p>
          Why all Christians should make a business of endeavoring to grow in
          the knowledge of divinity
        </p>
        <p>
          CHRISTIANS ought not to content themselves with such degrees of
          knowledge of divinity as they have already obtained. It should not
          satisfy them, as they know as much as is absolutely necessary to
          salvation, but should seek to make progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          This endeavor to make progress in such knowledge ought not to be
          attended to as a thing by the bye, but all Christians should make a
          business of it. They should look upon it as a part of their daily
          business, and no small part of it neither. It should be attended to as
          a considerable part of the work of their high calling. — For,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Our business should doubtless much consist in employing those
          faculties, by which we are distinguished from the beasts, about those
          things which are the main end of those faculties. The reason why we
          have faculties superior to those of the brutes given us, is that we
          are indeed designed for a superior employment. That which the Creator
          intended should be our main employment, is something above what he
          intended the beast for, and therefore has given us superior powers.
          Therefore, without doubt, it should be a considerable part of our
          business to improve those superior faculties. But the faculty by which
          we are chiefly distinguished from the brutes, is the faculty of
          understanding. It follows then, that we should make it our chief
          business to improve this faculty, and should by no means prosecute it
          as a business by the bye. For us to make the improvement of this
          faculty a business by the bye, is in effect for us to make the faculty
          of understanding itself a by-faculty, if I may so speak, a faculty of
          less importance than others: whereas indeed it is the highest faculty
          we have.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we cannot make a business of the improvement of our intellectual
          faculty, any otherwise than by making a business of improving
          ourselves in actual knowledge. So that those who make not this very
          much their business, but instead of improving their understanding to
          acquire knowledge, are chiefly devoted to their inferior power — to
          please their senses, and gratify their animal appetites — not only
          behave themselves in a manner not becoming Christians, but also act as
          if they had forgotten that they are men, and that God has set them
          above the brutes by giving them understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          God has given to man some things in common with the brutes, as his
          outward senses, his bodily appetites, a capacity of bodily pleasure
          and pain, and other animal faculties. Some things he has given him
          superior to the brutes: the chief of which is a faculty of
          understanding and reason. Now God never gave man these faculties to be
          subject to those which he has in common with the brutes. This would be
          great confusion, and equivalent to making man to be a servant of the
          beasts. On the contrary, he has given those inferior powers to be
          employed in subserviency to man’s understanding. Therefore it must be
          a great part of man’s principal business to improve his understanding
          by acquiring knowledge. If so, then it will follow that it should be a
          main part of his business to improve his understanding in acquiring
          divine knowledge, or the knowledge of the things of divinity. For the
          knowledge of these things is the principal end of this faculty. God
          gave man the faculty of understanding, chiefly, that he might
          understand divine things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wiser heathens were sensible that the main business of man was the
          improvement and exercise of his understanding. But they knew not the
          object about which the understanding should chiefly be employed. That
          science which many of them thought should chiefly employ the
          understanding, was philosophy, and accordingly they made it their
          chief business to study it. But we who enjoy the light of the gospel
          are more happy. We are not left, as to this particular, in the dark.
          God has told us about what things we should chiefly employ our
          understandings, having given us a book full of divine instructions,
          holding forth many glorious objects about which all rational creatures
          should chiefly employ their understandings. These instructions are
          accommodated to persons of all capacities and conditions, and proper
          to be studied, not only by men of learning, but by persons of every
          character, learned and unlearned, young and old, men and women.
          Therefore the acquisition of knowledge in these things should be a
          main business of all those who have the advantage of enjoying the Holy
          Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The truths of divinity are of superlative excellency, and are
          worthy that all should make a business of endeavoring to grow in the
          knowledge of them. They are as much above those things which are
          treated of in other sciences, as heaven is above the earth. God
          himself, the eternal Three in one, is the chief object of this
          science, and next Jesus Christ, as God-man and Mediator, and the
          glorious work of redemption, the most glorious work that ever was
          wrought. Then [it is] the great things of the heavenly world, the
          glorious and eternal inheritance purchased by Christ and promised in
          the gospel, the work of the Holy Spirit of God on the hearts of men,
          our duty to God, and the way in which we ourselves may become like
          angels and like God himself in our measure. All these are objects of
          this science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such things as these have been the main subject of the study of the
          holy patriarchs, prophets, and apostles, and the most excellent men
          that ever existed. They are also the subject of study to the angels in
          heaven, 1 Pet. 1:10-12. — They are so excellent and worthy to be known
          that the knowledge of them will richly pay for all the pains and labor
          of an earnest seeking of it. If there were a great treasure of gold
          and pearls accidentally found, and opened with such circumstances that
          all might have as much as they could gather, would not everyone think
          it worth his while to make a business of gathering while it should
          last? But that treasure of divine knowledge, which is contained in the
          Scriptures, and is provided for everyone to gather to himself as much
          of it as he can, is far more rich than anyone of gold and pearls. How
          busy are all sorts of men, all over the world, in getting riches! But
          this knowledge is a far better kind of riches than that after which
          they so diligently and laboriously pursue.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Divine truths not only concern ministers, but are of infinite
          importance to all Christians. It is not with the doctrine of divinity
          as it is with the doctrines of philosophy and other sciences. These
          last are generally speculative points, which are of little concern in
          human life, and it very little alters the case as to our temporal or
          spiritual interests, whether we know them or not. Philosophers differ
          about them, some being of one opinion, and others of another. And
          while they are engaged in warm disputes about them, others may well
          leave them to dispute among themselves, without troubling their heads
          much about them: it being of little concern to them, whether the one
          or the other be in the right. — But it is not thus in matters of
          divinity. The doctrines of this nearly concern everyone. They are
          about those things which relate to every man’s eternal salvation and
          happiness. The common people cannot say, “Let us leave these matters
          to ministers and divines. Let them dispute them out among themselves
          as they can. They concern not us,” for they are of infinite importance
          to every man. Those doctrines which relate to the essence, attributes,
          and subsistencies of God, concern all, as it is of infinite importance
          to common people, as well as to ministers, to know what kind of being
          God is. For he is a Being who has made us all, “in whom we live, and
          move, and have our being;” who is the Lord of all, the Being to whom
          we are all accountable, who is the last end of our being, and the only
          fountain of our happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrines also which relate to Jesus Christ and his mediation, his
          incarnation, his life and death, his resurrection and ascension, his
          sitting at the right hand of the Father, his satisfaction and
          intercession, infinitely concern common people as well as divines.
          They stand in as much need of this Savior, and of an interest in his
          person and offices, and the things which he has done and suffered, as
          ministers and divines. — The same may be said of the doctrines which
          relate to the manner of a sinner’s justification, or the way in which
          he becomes interested in the mediation of Christ. They equally concern
          all, for all stand in equal necessity of justification before God.
          That eternal condemnation, to which we are all naturally exposed, is
          equally dreadful. So with respect to those doctrines which relate to
          the work of the Spirit of God on the heart, in the application of
          redemption in our effectual calling and sanctification, all are
          equally concerned in them. There is no doctrine of divinity whatever,
          which doth not some way or other concern the eternal interest of every
          Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. We may argue in favor of the same position, from the great things
          which God has done in order to give us instruction in these things. As
          to other sciences, he has left us to ourselves, to the light of our
          own reason. But divine things being of infinitely greater importance
          to us, he has not left us to an uncertain guide, but has himself given
          us a revelation of the truth in these matters, and has done very great
          things to convey and confirm it to us. [He has] raised up many
          prophets in different ages, immediately inspiring them with his Holy
          Spirit, and confirming their doctrine with innumerable miracles or
          wonderful works out of the established course of nature. Yea, he
          raised up a succession of prophets, which was upheld for several ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was very much for this end that God separated the people of Israel,
          in so wonderful a manner, from all other people, and kept them
          separate, that to them he might commit the oracles of God, and that
          from them they might be communicated to the world. He has also often
          sent angels to bring divine instructions to men, and has often himself
          appeared in miraculous symbols or representations of his presence. Now
          in these last days [he] has sent his own Son into the world, to be his
          great prophet, to teach us divine truth. Heb. 1:1, etc. God has given
          us a book of divine instructions, which contains the sum of divinity.
          Now, these things has God done, not only for the instruction of
          ministers and men of learning, but for the instruction of all men, of
          all sorts, learned and unlearned, men, women, and children. And
          certainly if God doth such great things to teach us, we ought to do
          something to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          God giving instructions to men in these things is not a business by
          the by, but what he has undertaken and prosecuted in a course of great
          and wonderful dispensations, as an affair in which his heart has been
          greatly engaged, which is sometimes in Scripture signified by the
          expression of God’s rising early to teach us, and to send us prophets
          and teachers, Jer. 7:25, “Since that day that your fathers came forth
          out of the land of Egypt, unto this day, I have even sent unto you all
          my servants the prophets, daily rising up early, and sending them.”
          And verse 13, “I spake unto you, rising up early, and speaking.” This
          is a figurative speech, signifying that God has done this as a
          business of great importance, in which he took great care, and had his
          heart much engaged. Because persons are wont to rise early to
          prosecute such business as they are earnestly engaged in. — If God has
          been so engaged in teaching, certainly we should not be negligent in
          learning, but should make growing in knowledge a great part of the
          business of our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It may be argued from the abundance of the instructions which God
          has given us, from the largeness of that book which God has given to
          teach us divinity, and from the great variety that is therein
          contained. Much was taught by Moses of old, which we have transmitted
          down to us. After that, other books were from time to time added. Much
          is taught us by David and Solomon, and many and excellent are the
          instructions communicated by the prophets. Yet God did not think all
          this enough, but after this sent Christ and his apostles, by whom
          there is added a great and excellent treasure to that holy book, which
          is to be our rule in the study of this important subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          This book was written for the use of all. All are directed to search
          the Scriptures, John 5:39, “Search the Scriptures, for in them ye
          think ye have eternal life; and they are they that testify of me;” and
          Isa. 34:16, “Seek ye out of the book of the Lord, and read.” They that
          read and understand are pronounced blessed, Rev. 1:3, “Blessed is he
          that readeth, and they that understand the words of this prophecy.” If
          this be true of that particular book of the Revelation, much more is
          it true of the Bible in general. Nor is it to be believed that God
          would have given instructions in such abundance, if he had intended
          that receiving instruction should be only a bye concern with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to be considered, that all those abundant instructions which are
          contained in the Scriptures were written that they might be
          understood: otherwise they are not instructions. That which is not
          given that the learner may understand it, is not given for the
          learner’s instruction. Unless we endeavor to grow in the knowledge of
          divinity, a very great part of those instructions will to us be in
          vain. For we can receive benefit by no more of the Scriptures than we
          understand. We have reason to bless God that he has given us such
          various and plentiful instruction in his Word, but we shall be
          hypocritical in so doing, if we after all content ourselves with but
          little of this instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          When God has opened a very large treasure before us for the supply of
          our wants, and we thank him that he has given us so much, if at the
          same time we be willing to remain destitute of the greatest part of
          it, because we are too lazy to gather it, this will not show the
          sincerity of our thankfulness. We are now under much greater
          advantages to acquire knowledge in divinity, than the people of God
          were of old, because since that time the canon of Scripture is much
          increased. But if we be negligent of our advantages, we may be never
          the better for them, and may remain with as little knowledge as they.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. However diligent we apply ourselves, there is room enough to
          increase our knowledge in divine truth. None have this excuse to make
          for not diligently applying themselves to gain knowledge in divinity,
          that they already know all. Nor can they make this excuse, that they
          have no need diligently to apply themselves, in order to know all that
          is to be known. None can excuse themselves for want of business in
          which to employ themselves. There is room enough to employ ourselves
          forever in this divine science with the utmost application. Those who
          have applied themselves most closely, have studied the longest and
          have made the greatest attainments in this knowledge, know but little
          of what is to be known. The subject is inexhaustible. That Divine
          Being, who is the main subject of this science, is infinite, and there
          is no end to the glory of his perfections. His works at the same time
          are wonderful, and cannot be found out to perfection, especially the
          work of redemption, about which the science of divinity is chiefly
          conversant, is full of unsearchable wonders.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Word of God, which is given for our instruction in divinity,
          contains enough in it to employ us to the end of our lives, and then
          we shall leave enough uninvestigated to employ the heads of the ablest
          divines to the end of the world. The psalmist found an end to the
          things that are human, but he could never find an end to what is
          contained in the Word of God: Psa. 119:96, “I have seen an end to all
          perfection; but thy command is exceeding broad.” There is enough in
          this divine science to employ the understandings of saints and angels
          to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. It doubtless concerns everyone to endeavor to excel in the
          knowledge of things which pertain to his profession, or principal
          calling. If it concerns men to excel in anything, or in any wisdom or
          knowledge at all, it certainly concerns them to excel in the affairs
          of their main profession and work. But the calling and work of every
          Christian is to live to God. This is said to be his high calling,
          Phil. 3:14. This is the business, and if I may so speak, the trade of
          a Christian, his main work, and indeed should be his only work. No
          business should be done by a Christian, but as it is some way or other
          a part of this. Therefore certainly the Christian should endeavor to
          be well acquainted with those things which belong to this work, that
          he may fulfill it, and be thoroughly furnished to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It becomes one who is called to be a soldier, to excel in the art of
          war. It becomes a mariner, to excel in the art of navigation. It
          becomes a physician, to excel in the knowledge of those things which
          pertain to the art of physic. So it becomes all such as profess to be
          Christians, and to devote themselves to the practice of Christianity,
          to endeavor to excel in the knowledge of divinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. It may be argued hence that God has appointed an order of men for
          this end, to assist persons in gaining knowledge in these things. He
          has appointed them to be teachers, 1 Cor. 12:28, and God has set some
          in the church: first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers,
          Eph. 4:11, 12, “He gave some apostles, some prophets, some
          evangelists, some pastors and teachers, for the perfecting of the
          saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of
          Christ.” If God has set them to be teachers, making that their
          business, then he has made it their business to impart knowledge. But
          what kind of knowledge? Not the knowledge of philosophy, or of human
          laws, or of mechanical arts, but of divinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If God has made it the business of some to be teachers, it will follow
          that he has made it the business of others to be learners. For
          teachers and learners are correlates, one of which was never intended
          to be without the other. God has never made it the duty of some to
          take pains to teach those who are not obliged to take pains to learn.
          He has not commanded ministers to spend themselves, in order to impart
          knowledge to those who are not obliged to apply themselves to receive
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name by which Christians are commonly called in the New Testament
          is disciples, the signification of which word is scholars or learners.
          All Christians are put into the school of Christ, where their business
          is to learn, or receive knowledge from Christ, their common master and
          teacher, and from those inferior teachers appointed by him to instruct
          in his name.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. God has in the Scriptures plainly revealed it to be his will, that
          all Christians should diligently endeavor to excel in the knowledge of
          divine things. It is the revealed will of God that Christians should
          not only have some knowledge of things of this nature, but that they
          should be enriched with all knowledge, 1 Cor. 1:4, 5, “I thank my God
          always on your behalf, for the grace of God that is given you by Jesus
          Christ, that in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance,
          and in all knowledge.” So the apostle earnestly prayed, that the
          Christian Philippians might abound more and more, not only in love,
          but in Christian knowledge; Phil. 1:9, “And this I pray, that your
          love may abound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all judgment.”
          So the apostle Peter advises to “give all diligence to add to faith
          virtue, and to virtue knowledge,” 2 Pet. 1:5, and the apostle Paul, in
          the next chapter to that wherein is the text, counsels the Christian
          Hebrews, leaving the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, to go
          on to perfection. He would by no means have them always to rest only
          in those fundamental doctrines of repentance, and faith, and the
          resurrection from the dead, and the eternal judgment, in which they
          were instructed when baptized, at their first initiation in
          Christianity. (See Heb. 6, etc.)
        </p>
        <p>SECTION V</p>
        <p>
          An exhortation that all may diligently endeavor to gain Christian
          knowledge
        </p>
        <p>
          CONSIDER yourselves as scholars or disciples, put into the school of
          Christ, and therefore be diligent to make proficiency in Christian
          knowledge. Content not yourselves with this, that you have been taught
          your catechism in your childhood, and that you know as much of the
          principles of religion as is necessary to salvation, else you will be
          guilty of what the apostle warns against, viz. going no further than
          laying the foundation of repentance from dead works, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are all called to be Christians, and this is your profession.
          Endeavor, therefore, to acquire knowledge in things which pertain to
          your profession. Let not your teachers have cause to complain that
          while they spend and are spent, to impart knowledge to you, you take
          little pains to learn. It is a great encouragement to an instructor,
          to have such to teach as make a business of learning, bending their
          minds to it. This makes teaching a pleasure, when otherwise it will be
          a very heavy and burdensome task.
        </p>
        <p>
          You all have by you a large treasure of divine knowledge, in that you
          have the Bible in your hands. Therefore be not contented in possessing
          but little of this treasure. God has spoken much to you in the
          Scriptures. Labor to understand as much of what he says as you can.
          God has made you all reasonable creatures, therefore let not the noble
          faculty of reason or understanding lie neglected. Content not
          yourselves with having so much knowledge as is thrown in your way, and
          receive in some sense unavoidably by the frequent inculcation of
          divine truth in the preaching of the Word, of which you are obliged to
          be hearers, or accidentally gain in conversation. But let it be very
          much your business to search for it, and that with the same diligence
          and labor with which men are wont to dig in mines of silver and gold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially I would advise those who are young to employ themselves in
          this way. Men are never too old to learn, but the time of youth is
          especially the time for learning. It is peculiarly proper for gaining
          and storing up knowledge. — Further, to stir up all, both old and
          young, to this duty, let me entreat you to consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. If you apply yourselves diligently to this work, you will not want
          employment, when you are at leisure from your common secular business.
          In this way, you may find something in which you may profitably employ
          yourselves. You will find something else to do, besides going about
          from house to house, spending one hour after another in unprofitable
          conversation, or at best, to no other purpose but to amuse yourselves,
          to fill up and wear away your time. And it is to be feared that very
          much of the time spent in evening visits, is spent to a much worse
          purpose than that which I have now mentioned. Solomon tells us, Pro.
          10:19, “That in the multitude of words, there wanteth not sin.” And is
          not this verified in those who find little else to do but to go to one
          another’s houses, and spend the time in such talk as comes next, or
          such as anyone’s present disposition happens to suggest?
        </p>
        <p>
          Some diversion is doubtless lawful, but for Christians to spend so
          much of their time, so many long evenings, in no other conversation
          than that which tends to divert and amuse, if nothing worse, is a
          sinful way of spending time, and tends to poverty of soul at least, if
          not to outward poverty, Pro. 14:23, “In all labor there is profit; but
          the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.” Besides, when persons
          for so much of their time have nothing else to do but to sit and talk
          and chat, there is great danger of falling into foolish and sinful
          conversation, venting their corrupt dispositions, in talking against
          others, expressing their jealousies and evil surmises concerning their
          neighbors, not considering what Christ has said, Mat. 12:36, “Of every
          idle word that men shall speak, shall they give account in the day of
          judgment.”
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would comply with what you have heard from this doctrine, you
          would find something else to employ your time besides contention, or
          talking about those public affairs which tend to contention. Young
          people might find something else to do besides spending their time in
          vain company: something that would be much more profitable to
          themselves, as it would really turn to some good account, something in
          doing which they would both be more out of the way of temptation, and
          be more in the way of duty, and of a divine blessing. And even aged
          people would have something to employ themselves in, after they are
          become incapable of bodily labor. Their time, as is now often the
          case, would not lie heavy upon their hands, as they would with both
          profit and pleasure be engaged in searching the Scriptures, and in
          comparing and meditating upon the various truths which they should
          find there.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This would be a noble way of spending your time. — The Holy Spirit
          gives the Bereans this epithet, because they diligently employed
          themselves in this business: Acts 17:11, “These were more noble than
          those of Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all
          readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those
          things were so.” Similar to this is very much the employment of
          heaven. The inhabitants of that world spend much of their time in
          searching into the great things of divinity, and endeavoring to
          acquire knowledge in them, as we are told of the angels, 1 Pet. 1:12,
          “Which things the angels desire to look into.” This will be very
          agreeable to what you hope will be your business to all eternity, as
          you doubtless hope to join in the same employment with the angels of
          light. Solomon says, Pro. 25:2, “It is the honor of kings to search
          out a matter;” and certainly, above all others, to search out divine
          matters. Now, if this be the honor even of kings, is it not much more
          your honor?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This is a pleasant way of improving time. Knowledge is pleasant and
          delightful to intelligent creatures, and above all, the knowledge of
          divine things. For in them are the most excellent truths, and the most
          beautiful and amiable objects held forth to view. However tedious the
          labor necessarily attending this business may be, yet the knowledge
          once obtained will richly requite the pains taken to obtain it. “When
          wisdom entereth the heart, knowledge is pleasant to the soul.” Pro.
          2:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This knowledge is exceedingly useful in Christian practice. Such as
          have much knowledge in divinity have great means and advantages for
          spiritual and saving knowledge. For no means of grace have a saving
          effect, otherwise than by the knowledge they impart. The more you have
          of a rational knowledge of divine things, the more opportunity will
          there be, when the Spirit shall be breathed into your heart, to see
          the excellency of these things, and to taste the sweetness of them.
          The heathens, who have no rational knowledge of the things of the
          gospel, have no opportunity to see the excellency of them. Therefore
          the more rational knowledge of these things you have, the more
          opportunity and advantage you have to see the divine excellency and
          glory of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the more knowledge you have of divine things, the better will
          you know your duty. Your knowledge will be of great use to direct you
          as to your duty in particular cases. You will also be the better
          furnished against the temptations of the devil. For the devil often
          takes advantage of persons’ ignorance to ply them with temptations
          which otherwise would have no hold of them. By having much knowledge,
          you will be under greater advantages to conduct yourselves with
          prudence and discretion in your Christian course, and so to live much
          more to the honor of God and religion. Many who mean well, and are
          full of a good spirit, yet for want of prudence, conduct themselves so
          as to wound religion. Many have a zeal of God, which doth more hurt
          than good, because it is not according to knowledge, Rom. 10:2. The
          reason why many good men behave no better in many instances, is not so
          much that they want grace, as that they want knowledge. Beside, an
          increase of knowledge would be a great help to profitable
          conversation. It would supply you with matter for conversation when
          you come together, or when you visit your neighbors, so you would have
          less temptation to spend the time in such conversation as tends to
          your own and others’ hurt.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Consider the advantages you are under to grow in the knowledge of
          divinity. We are under far greater advantages to gain much of this
          knowledge now than God’s people under the Old Testament, both because
          the canon of Scripture is so much enlarged since that time, and also
          because evangelical truths are now so much more plainly revealed. So
          that common men are now in some respects under advantages to know more
          than the greatest prophets were then. Thus that saying of Christ is in
          a sense applicable to us, Luke 10:23, 24, “Blessed are the eyes which
          see the things which ye see. For I tell you, that many prophets and
          kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen
          them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard
          them.” We are in some respects under far greater advantages for
          gaining knowledge, now in these latter ages of the church, than
          Christians were formerly, especially by reason of the art of printing,
          of which God has given us the benefit, whereby Bibles and other books
          of divinity are exceedingly multiplied, and persons may now be
          furnished with helps for the obtaining of Christian knowledge, at a
          much easier and cheaper rate than they formerly could.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. We know not what opposition we may meet with in the religious
          principles which we hold. We know that there are many adversaries to
          the gospel and its truths. If therefore we embrace those truths, we
          must expect to be attacked by the said adversaries. Unless we be well
          informed concerning divine things, how shall we be able to defend
          ourselves? Beside, the apostle Paul enjoins it upon us, always to be
          ready to give an answer to every man who asketh us a reason of the
          hope that is in us. But this we cannot expect to do without
          considerable knowledge in divine things.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION VI</p>
        <p>Directions for the acquisition of Christian knowledge</p>
        <p>
          1. BE assiduous in reading the Holy Scriptures. This is the fountain
          whence all knowledge in divinity must be derived. Therefore let not
          this treasure lie by you neglected. Every man of common understanding
          who can read, may if he please, become well acquainted with the
          Scriptures. And what an excellent attainment would this be!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Content not yourselves with only a cursory reading, without
          regarding the sense. This is an ill way of reading, to which, however,
          many accustom themselves all their days. When you read, observe what
          you read. Observe how things come in. Take notice of the drift of the
          discourse, and compare one scripture with another. For the Scripture,
          by the harmony of its different parts, casts great light upon itself.
          — We are expressly directed by Christ to search the Scriptures, which
          evidently intends something more than a mere cursory reading. And use
          means to find out the meaning of the Scripture. When you have it
          explained in the preaching of the Word, take notice of it. If at any
          time a scripture that you did not understand be cleared up to your
          satisfaction, mark it, lay it up, and if possible remember it.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Procure, and diligently use, other books which may help you to grow
          in this knowledge. There are many excellent books extant, which might
          greatly forward you in this knowledge, and afford you a very
          profitable and pleasant entertainment in your leisure hours. There is
          doubtless a great defect in many, that through a lothness to be at a
          little expense, they furnish themselves with no more helps of this
          nature. They have a few books indeed, which now and then on sabbath
          days they read. But they have had them so long, and read them so
          often, that they are weary of them, and it is now become a dull story,
          a mere task to read them.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Improve conversation with others to this end. How much might
          persons promote each other’s knowledge in divine things, if they would
          improve conversation as they might, if men that are ignorant were not
          ashamed to show their ignorance and were willing to learn of others,
          if those that have knowledge would communicate it without pride and
          ostentation, and if all were more disposed to enter on such
          conversation as would be for their mutual edification and instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Seek not to grow in knowledge chiefly for the sake of applause, and
          to enable you to dispute with others, but seek it for the benefit of
          your souls, and in order to practice. — If applause be your end, you
          will not be so likely to be led to the knowledge of the truth, but may
          justly, as often is the case of those who are proud of their
          knowledge, be led into error to your own perdition. This being your
          end, if you should obtain much rational knowledge, it would not be
          likely to be of any benefit to you, but would puff you up with pride:
          1 Cor. 8:1, “Knowledge puffeth up.”
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Seek to God, that he would direct you, and bless you, in this
          pursuit after knowledge. This is the apostle’s direction, Jam. 1:5,
          “If any man lack wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all
          liberally, and upbraideth not.” God is the fountain of all divine
          knowledge: Pro. 2:6, “The Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh
          knowledge and understanding.” Labor to be sensible of your own
          blindness and ignorance, and your need of the help of God, lest you be
          led into error, instead of true knowledge: 1 Cor. 3:18, “If any man
          would be wise, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.”
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Practice according to what knowledge you have. This will be the way
          to know more. The psalmist warmly recommends this way of seeking
          knowledge in divine truth, from his own experience, Psa. 119:100, “I
          understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.”
          Christ also recommends the same John 7:17, “If any man will do his
          will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether
          I speak of myself.”
