          2 Corinthians 1:14, “As also you have acknowledged us in part, that we
          are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord
          Jesus.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THE apostle, in the preceding part of the chapter, declares what great
          troubles he met with in the course of his ministry. In the text, and
          two foregoing verses, he declares what were his comforts and supports
          under the troubles he met with. There are four things in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That he had approved himself to his own conscience, verse 12, “For
          our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in
          simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the
          grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more
          abundantly to you-wards.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Another thing he speaks of as matter of comfort, is that as he had
          approved himself to his own conscience, so he had also to the
          consciences of his hearers, the Corinthians, to whom he now wrote, and
          that they should approve of him at the day of judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The hope he had of seeing the blessed fruit of his labors and
          sufferings in the ministry, in their happiness and glory, in that
          great day of accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. That in his ministry among the Corinthians, he had approved himself
          to his Judge, who would approve and reward his faithfulness in that
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          These three last particulars are signified in my text, and the
          preceding verse, and indeed all the four are implied in the text. It
          is implied that the Corinthians had acknowledged him as their
          spiritual father, and as one that had been faithful among them, and as
          the means of their future joy and glory at the day of judgment. It is
          implied that the apostle expected at that time to have a joyful
          meeting with them before the Judge, and with joy to behold their
          glory, as the fruit of his labors, and so they would be his rejoicing.
          It is implied also that he then expected to be approved of the great
          Judge, when he and they should meet together before him, and that he
          would then acknowledge his fidelity, and that this had been the means
          of their glory, and that thus he would, as it were, give them to him
          as his crown of rejoicing. But this the apostle could not hope for,
          unless he had the testimony of his own conscience in his favor. And
          therefore the words do imply, in the strongest manner, that he had
          approved himself to his own conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one thing implied in each of these particulars, and in every
          part of the text, which I shall make the subject of my present
          discourse, viz.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE.</p>
        <p>
          Ministers, and the people that have been under their care, must meet
          one another before Christ’s tribunal at the day of judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ministers, and the people that have been under their care, must be
          parted in this world, how well soever they have been united. If they
          are not separated before, they must be parted by death, and they may
          be separated while life is continued. We live in a world of change,
          where nothing is certain or stable, and where a little time, a few
          revolutions of the sun, brings to pass strange things, surprising
          alterations, in particular persons in families, in towns and churches,
          in countries and nations. It often happens, that those who seem most
          united, in a little time are most disunited, and at the greatest
          distance. Thus ministers and people, between whom there has been the
          greatest mutual regard and strictest union, may not only differ in
          their judgments, and be alienated in affection, but one may rend from
          the other, and all relation between them be dissolved. The minister
          may be removed to a distant place, and they may never have any more to
          do one with another in this world. But if it be so, there is one
          meeting more that they must have, and that is in the last great day of
          accounts. Here I would show,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In what manner ministers, and the people which have been under
          their care, shall meet one another at the day of judgment.<br />
          II. For what purposes.<br />
          III. For what reasons God has so ordered it, that ministers and their
          people shall then meet together in such a manner, and for such
          purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I would show, in some particulars, in what manner ministers and the
          people which have been under their care, shall meet one another at the
          day of judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, they shall not meet at the day merely as all the world must
          then meet together. I would observe a difference in two things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. As to a clear actual view, and distinct knowledge and notice, of
          each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the whole world will be then present, all mankind of all
          generations gathered in one vast assembly, with all of the angelic
          nature, both elect and fallen angels, yet we need not suppose that
          everyone will have a distinct and particular knowledge of each
          individual of the whole assembled multitude, which will undoubtedly
          consist of many millions of millions. Though it is probable that men’s
          capacities will be much greater than in their present state, yet they
          will not be infinite. Though their understanding and comprehension
          will be vastly extended, yet men will not be deified. There will
          probably be a very enlarged view that particular persons will have of
          the various parts and members of that vast assembly, and so of the
          proceedings of that great day. But yet it must needs be, that
          according to the nature of finite minds, some persons and some things,
          at that day, shall fall more under the notice of particular persons
          than others. This (as we may well suppose) according as they shall
          have a nearer concern with some than others in the transactions of the
          day. There will be special reason why those who have had special
          concerns together in this world, in their state of probation, and
          whose mutual affairs will be then to be tried and judged, should
          especially be set in one another’s view. Thus we may suppose, that
          rulers and subjects, earthly judges and those whom they have judged,
          neighbors who have had mutual converse, dealings, and contests, heads
          of families and their children and servants, shall then meet, and in a
          peculiar distinction be set together. And especially will it be thus
          with ministers and their people. It is evident by the text, that these
          shall be in each other’s view, shall distinctly know each other, and
          shall have particular notice one of another at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They shall meet together, as having special concern one with
          another in the great transactions of that day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although they shall meet the whole world at that time, yet they will
          not have any immediate and particular concern with all. Yea, the far
          greater part of those who shall then be gathered together, will be
          such as they have had no intercourse with in their state of probation,
          and so will have no mutual concerns to be judged of. But as to
          ministers and the people that have been under their care, they will be
          such as have had much immediate concern one with another, in matters
          of the greatest moment. Therefore they especially must meet, and be
          brought together before the Judge, as having special concern one with
          another in the design and business of that great day of accounts. —
          Thus their meeting, as to the manner of it, will be diverse from the
          meeting of mankind in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, their meeting at the day of judgment will be very diverse from
          their meetings one with another in this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ministers and their people, while their relation continues, often meet
          together in this world. They are wont to meet from sabbath to sabbath,
          and at other times, for the public worship of God, and administration
          of ordinances, and the solemn services of God’s house. And besides
          these meetings, they have also occasions to meet for the determining
          and managing their ecclesiastical affairs, for the exercise of church
          discipline, and the settling and adjusting those things which concern
          the purity and good order of public administrations. But their meeting
          at the day of judgment will be exceeding diverse, in its manner and
          circumstances, from any meetings and interviews they have one with
          another in the present state. I would observe how, in a few
          particulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Now they meet together in a preparatory mutable state, but then in
          an unchangeable state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now sinners in the congregation meet their minister in a state wherein
          they are capable of a saving change, capable of being turned, through
          God’s blessing on the ministrations and labors of their pastor, from
          the power of Satan unto God; and being brought out of a state of
          guilt, condemnation, and wrath, to a state of peace and favor with
          God, to the enjoyment of the privileges of his children, and a title
          to their eternal inheritance. And saints now meet their minister with
          great remains of corruption, and sometimes under great spiritual
          difficulties and affliction: and therefore are yet the proper subjects
          of means for a happy alteration of their state, which they have reason
          to hope for in the attendance on ordinances, and of which God is
          pleased commonly to make his ministers the instruments. Ministers and
          their people now meet in order to the bringing to pass such happy
          changes: they are the great benefits sought in their solemn meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when they shall meet together at the day of judgment, it will be
          far otherwise. They will all meet in an unchangeable state. Sinners
          will be in an unchangeable state. They who then shall be under the
          guilt and power of sin, and have the wrath of God abiding on them,
          shall be beyond all remedy or possibility of change, and shall meet
          their ministers without any hopes of relief or remedy, or getting any
          good by their means. And as for the saints, they will be already
          perfectly delivered from all their corruption, temptation, and
          calamities of every kind, and set forever out of their reach; and no
          deliverance, no happy alteration, will remain to be accomplished in
          the use of means of grace, under the administrations of ministers. It
          will then be pronounced, “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still;
          and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is
          righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be
          holy still.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Then they shall meet together in a state of clear, certain, and
          infallible light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ministers are set as guides and teachers, and are represented in
          Scripture as lights set up in the churches, and in the present state
          meet their people, from time to time, in order to instruct and
          enlighten them, to correct their mistakes, and to be a voice behind
          them, when they turn aside to the right hand or the left, saying,
          “This is the way, walk ye in it;” to evince and confirm the truth by
          exhibiting the proper evidences of it. They to refute errors and
          corrupt opinions, to convince the erroneous, and establish the
          doubting. But when Christ shall come to judgment, every error and
          false opinion shall be detected. All deceit and delusion shall vanish
          away before the light of that day, as the darkness of the night
          vanishes at the appearance of the rising sun. Every doctrine of the
          Word of God shall then appear in full evidence, and none shall remain
          unconvinced. All shall know the truth with the greatest certainty, and
          there shall be no mistakes to rectify.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now ministers and their people may disagree in their judgments
          concerning some matters of religion, and may sometimes meet to confer
          together concerning those things wherein they differ, and to hear the
          reasons that may be offered on one side and the other; and all may be
          ineffectual as to any conviction of the truth. They may meet and part
          again, no more agreed than before, and that side which was in the
          wrong may remain so still. Sometimes the meetings of ministers with
          their people, in such a case of disagreeing sentiments, are attended
          with unhappy debate and controversy, managed with much prejudice and
          want of candor; not tending to light and conviction, but rather to
          confirm and increase darkness, and establish opposition to the truth,
          and alienation of affection one from another. But when they shall meet
          together at the day of judgment, before the tribunal of the great
          Judge, the mind and will of Christ will be made known, and there shall
          no longer be any debate or difference of opinions. The evidence of the
          truth shall appear beyond all dispute, and all controversies shall be
          finally and forever decided.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now ministers meet their people in order to enlighten and awaken the
          consciences of sinners: setting before them the great evil and danger
          of sin, the strictness of God’s law, their own wickedness of heart and
          practice, the great guilt they are under, the wrath that abides upon
          them, and their impotence, blindness, poverty, and helpless and undone
          condition. But all is often in vain. They remain still,
          notwithstanding all their ministers can say, stupid and unawakened,
          and their consciences unconvinced. But it will not be so at their last
          meeting at the day of judgment. Sinners, when they shall meet their
          minister before their great Judge, will not meet him with a stupid
          conscience. They will then be fully convinced of the truth of those
          things which they formerly heard from him, concerning the greatness
          and terrible majesty of God, his holiness and hatred of sin, his awful
          justice in punishing it, the strictness of his law and the
          dreadfulness and truth of his threatenings, and their own unspeakable
          guilt and misery. And they shall never more be insensible of these
          things. The eyes of conscience will now be fully enlightened, and
          never shall be blinded again. The mouth of conscience shall now be
          opened, and never shall be shut any more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now ministers meet with their people, in public and private, in order
          to enlighten them concerning the state of their souls; to open and
          apply the rules of God’s Word to them, in order to their searching
          their own hearts, and discerning their state. But now ministers have
          no infallible discernment of the state of their people; and the most
          skillful of them are liable to mistakes, and often are mistaken in
          things of this nature. Nor are the people able certainly to know the
          state of their minister, or one another’s state: very often those pass
          among them for saints, and it may be eminent saints, that are grand
          hypocrites. And on the other hand, those are sometimes censured, or
          hardly received into their charity, that are indeed some of God’s
          jewels. And nothing is more common than for men to be mistaken
          concerning their own state. Many that are abominable to God, and the
          children of his wrath, think highly of themselves, as his precious
          saints and dear children. Yea, there is reason to think that often
          some that are most bold in their confidence of their safe and happy
          state, and think themselves not only true saints, but the most eminent
          saints in the congregation, are in a peculiar manner a smoke in God’s
          nostrils. And thus it undoubtedly often is in those congregations
          where the Word of God is most faithfully dispensed, notwithstanding
          all that ministers can say in their clearest explications, and most
          searching applications of the doctrines and rules of God’s Word to the
          souls of their hearers. But in the day of judgment they shall have
          another sort of meeting. Then the secrets of every heart shall be made
          manifest, and every man’s state shall be perfectly known. 1 Cor. 4:5,
          “Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who
          both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make
          manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have
          praise of God.” Then none shall be deceived concerning his own state,
          nor shall be any more in doubt about it. There shall be an eternal end
          to all the self-conceit and vain hopes of deluded hypocrites, and all
          the doubts and fears of sincere Christians. And then shall all know
          the state of one another’s souls. The people shall know whether their
          minister has been sincere and faithful, and the minister shall know
          the state of every one of their people, and to who the word and
          ordinances of God have been a savor of life unto life, and to whom a
          savor of death unto death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now in this present state it often happens that when ministers and
          people meet together to debate and manage their ecclesiastical
          affairs, especially in a state of controversy, they are ready to judge
          and censure with regard to each other’s views, designs, and the
          principles and ends by which each is influenced, and are greatly
          mistaken in their judgment and wrong one another in their censures.
          But at that future meeting, things will be set in a true and perfect
          light, and the principles and aims that everyone has acted from, shall
          be certainly known. There will be an end to all errors of this kind,
          and all unrighteous censures.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In this world, ministers and their people often meet together to
          hear of and wait upon an unseen Lord. But at the judgment, they shall
          meet in his most immediate and visible presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ministers, who now often meet their people to preach to them the King
          eternal, immortal, and invisible, to convince them that there is a God
          and declare to them what manner of being he is, and to convince them
          that he governs and will judge the world, and that there is a future
          state of rewards and punishments, and to preach to them a Christ in
          heaven, at the right hand of God, in an unseen world — shall then meet
          their people in the most immediate sensible presence of this great
          God, Savior, and Judge, appearing in the most plain, visible, and open
          manner, with great glory, with all his holy angels, before them and
          the whole world. They shall not meet them to hear about an absent
          Christ, an unseen Lord, and future Judge; but to appear before that
          Judge — being set together in the presence of that supreme Lord — in
          his immense glory and awful majesty, of whom they have heard so often
          in their meetings together on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The meeting at the last day, of ministers and the people that have
          been under their care, will not be attended by anyone with a careless,
          heedless heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          With such a heart are their meetings often attended in this world by
          many persons, having little regard to him whom they pretend unitedly
          to adore in the solemn duties of his public worship, taking little
          heed to their own thoughts or frame of their minds, not attending to
          the business they are engaged in, or considering the end for which
          they are come together. But at that great day there will not be one
          careless heart: no sleeping, no wandering of mind from the great
          concern of the meeting, no inattentiveness to the business of the day,
          no regardlessness of the presence they are in or of those great things
          which they shall hear from Christ, or that they formerly heard from
          him, and of him, by their ministers in their state of trial, or which
          they shall now hear their ministers declaring concerning them before
          their Judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having observed these things, concerning the manner and circumstances
          of this future meeting, before the tribunal of Christ at the day of
          judgment, I now proceed,
        </p>
        <p>II. To observe to what purposes they shall then meet.</p>
        <p>
          First, to give an account, before the great Judge, of their behavior
          one to another, in the relation they bore to each other in this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ministers are sent forth by Christ to their people on his business.
          They are his servants and messengers; and, when they have finished
          their service, they must return to their master to give him an account
          of what they have done, and of the entertainment they have had in
          performing their ministry. Thus we find, in Luke 14:16-21, that when
          the servant who was sent forth to call the guests to the great supper,
          had finished his appointed service, he returned to his master, and
          gave him an account of what he had done, and of the entertainment he
          had received. And when the master, being angry, sent his servant to
          others, he returns again and gives his master an account of his
          conduct and success. So we read, in Heb. 13:17, of ministers or rulers
          in the house of God, that “they watch for souls, as those that must
          give account.” And we see by the forementioned Luke 14 that ministers
          must give an account to their master, not only of their own behavior
          in the discharge of their office, but also of their people’s reception
          of them, and of the treatment they have met with among them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faithful ministers will then give an account with joy, concerning
          those who have received them well, and made a good improvement of
          their ministry; and these will be given them, at that day, as their
          crown of rejoicing. And, at the same time, they will give an account
          of the ill treatment of such as have not well received them and their
          messages from Christ. They will meet these, not as they used to do in
          this world, to counsel and warn them, but to bear witness against
          them, as their judges and assessors with Christ, to condemn them. And,
          on the other hand, the people will at that day rise up in judgment
          against wicked and unfaithful ministers, who have sought their own
          temporal interest more than the good of the souls of their flock.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, at that time ministers, and the people who have been under
          their care, shall meet together before Christ, that he may judge
          between them, as to any controversies which have subsisted between
          them in this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          It often comes to pass in this evil world, that great differences and
          controversies arise between ministers and the people under their
          pastoral care. Though they are under the greatest obligations to live
          in peace, above persons in almost any relation whatever, and although
          contests and dissensions between persons so related are the most
          unhappy and terrible in their consequences on many accounts of any
          sort of contentions, yet how frequent have such contentions been!
          Sometimes a people contest with their ministers about their doctrine,
          sometimes about their administrations and conduct, and sometimes about
          their maintenance. Sometimes such contests continue a long time, and
          sometimes they are decided in this world, according to the prevailing
          interest of one party or the other, rather than by the Word of God,
          and the reason of things. And sometimes such controversies never have
          any proper determination in this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          But at the day of judgment there will be a full, perfect, and
          everlasting decision of them. The infallible Judge, the infinite
          fountain of light, truth, and justice, will judge between the
          contending parties, and will declare what is the truth, who is in the
          right, and what is agreeable to his mind and will. And in order
          hereto, the parties must stand together before him at the last day,
          which will be the great day of finishing and determining all
          controversies, rectifying all mistakes, and abolishing all unrighteous
          judgments, errors, and confusions, which have before subsisted in the
          world of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, ministers, and the people that have been under their care, must
          meet together at that time to receive an eternal sentence and
          retribution from the Judge, in the presence of each other, according
          to their behavior in the relation they stood in one to another in the
          present state.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Judge will not only declare justice, but he will do justice
          between ministers and their people. He will declare what is right
          between them, approving him that has been just and faithful, and
          condemning the unjust. Perfect truth and equity shall take place in
          the sentence which he passes, in the rewards he bestows, and the
          punishments which he inflicts. There shall be a glorious reward to
          faithful ministers, to those who have been successful. Dan. 12:3, “And
          they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and
          they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever:”
          and also to those who have been faithful, and yet not successful, Isa.
          49:4, “Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength
          for nought; yet surely my judgment is with the Lord, and my reward
          with my God.” And those who have well received and entertained them
          shall be gloriously rewarded, Mat. 10:40, 41, “He that receiveth you,
          receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me. He
          that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a
          prophet’s reward, and he that receiveth a righteous man, in the name
          of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man’s reward.” Such
          people, and their faithful ministers, shall be each other’s crown of
          rejoicing, 1 Thes. 2:19, 20, “For what is our hope, or joy, or crown
          of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ
          at his coming? For ye are our glory and joy.” And in the text, “We are
          your rejoicing, as ye also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.”
          But they that evil entreat Christ’s faithful ministers, especially in
          that wherein they are faithful, shall be severely punished; Mat.
          10:14, 15, “And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words,
          when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your
          feet. Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for the
          sinners of Sodom and Gomorrah, in the day of judgment, than for that
          city.” Deu. 33:8-11, “And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummin and thy
          Urim be with thy holy one. They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and
          Israel thy law. Bless, Lord, his substance, and accept the work of his
          hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of
          them that hate him, that they rise not again.” On the other hand,
          those ministers who are found to have been unfaithful, shall have a
          most terrible punishment. See Eze. 33:6; Mat. 23:1-33.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus justice shall be administered at the great day to ministers and
          their people: and to that end they shall meet together, that they may
          not only receive justice to themselves, but see justice done to the
          other party. For this is the end of that great day, to reveal or
          declare the righteous judgment of God; Rom. 2:5. Ministers shall have
          justice done them, and they shall see justice done to their people.
          And the people shall receive justice themselves from their Judge, and
          shall see justice done to their minister. And so all things will be
          adjusted and settled forever between them: everyone being sentenced
          and recompensed according to his works, either in receiving and
          wearing a crown of eternal joy and glory, or in suffering everlasting
          shame and pain. — I come now to the next thing proposed, viz.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. To give some reasons why we may suppose God has so ordered it,
          that ministers, and the people that have been under their care, shall
          meet together at the day of judgment, in such a manner and for such
          purposes.
        </p>
        <p>There are two things which I would now observe.</p>
        <p>
          First, the mutual concerns of ministers and their people are of the
          greatest importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scripture declares that God will bring every work into judgment,
          with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil. It
          is fit that all the concerns and all the behavior of mankind, both
          public and private, should be brought at last before God’s tribunal,
          and finally determined by an infallible judge. But it is especially
          requisite that it should be thus, as to affairs of very great
          importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the mutual concerns of a Christian minister and his church and
          congregation, are of the vastest importance: in many respects, of much
          greater moment than the temporal concerns of the greatest earthly
          monarchs, and their kingdoms or empires. It is of vast consequence how
          ministers discharge their office, and conduct themselves towards their
          people in the work of the ministry, and in affairs appertaining to it.
          It is also a matter of vast importance, how a people receive and
          entertain a faithful minister of Christ, and what improvement they
          make of his ministry. These things have a more immediate and direct
          respect to the great and last end for which man was made, and the
          eternal welfare of mankind, than any of the temporal concerns of men,
          whether private or public. And therefore it is especially fit that
          these affairs should be brought into judgment, and openly determined
          and settled, in truth and righteousness, and that to this end,
          ministers and their people should meet together before the omniscient
          and infallible Judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the mutual concerns of ministers and their people have a
          special relation to the main things appertaining to the day of
          judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          They have a special relation to that great and divine person who will
          then appear as Judge. Ministers are his messengers, sent forth by him,
          and in their office and administrations among their people, represent
          his person, stand in his stead, as those that are sent to declare his
          mind, to do his work, and to speak and act in his name. And therefore
          it is especially fit that they should return to him to give an account
          of their work and success. The king is judge of all his subjects, they
          are all accountable to him. But it is more especially requisite that
          the king’s ministers, who are especially entrusted with the
          administrations of his kingdom, and who are sent forth on some special
          negotiation, should return to him, to give an account of themselves,
          and their discharge of their trust, and the reception they have met
          with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ministers are not only messengers of the person who at the last day
          will appear as Judge, but the errand they are sent upon, and the
          affairs they have committed to them as his ministers, most immediately
          concern his honor, and the interest of his kingdom. The work they are
          sent upon is to promote the designs of his administration and
          government, therefore their business with their people has a near
          relation to the day of judgment. For the great end of that day is
          completely to settle and establish the affairs of his kingdom, to
          adjust all things that pertain to it, that everything that is opposite
          to the interests of his kingdom may be removed, and that everything
          which contributes to the completeness and glory of it may be perfected
          and confirmed, that this great King may receive his due honor and
          glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the mutual concerns of ministers and their people have a direct
          relation to the concerns of the day of judgment, as the business of
          ministers with their people is to promote the eternal salvation of the
          souls of men, and their escape from eternal damnation. The day of
          judgment is the day appointed for that end, openly to decide and
          settle men’s eternal state, to fix some in a state of eternal
          salvation, and to bring their salvation to its utmost consummation,
          and to fix others in a state of everlasting damnation and most perfect
          misery. The mutual concerns of ministers and people have a most direct
          relation to the day of judgment, as the very design of the work of the
          ministry is the people’s preparation for that day. Ministers are sent
          to warn them of the approach of that day, to forewarn them of the
          dreadful sentence then to be pronounced on the wicked, and declare to
          them the blessed sentence then to be pronounced on the righteous, and
          to use means with them that they may escape the wrath which is then to
          come on the ungodly, and obtain the reward then to be bestowed on the
          saints.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as the mutual concerns of ministers and their people have so near
          and direct a relation to that day, it is especially fit that those
          concerns should there settled and issued, and that in order to this,
          ministers and their people should meet and appear together before the
          great Judge at that day.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          The improvement I would make of the subject is to lead the people here
          present, who have been under my pastoral care, to some reflections,
          and give them some advice suitable to our present circumstances,
          relating to what has been lately done in order to our being separated,
          but expecting to meet each other before the great tribunal at the day
          of judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deep and serious consideration of our future most solemn meeting,
          is certainly most suitable at such a time as this. There having so
          lately been that done, which, in all probability, will (as to the
          relation we have heretofore stood in) be followed with an everlasting
          separation.
        </p>
        <p>
          How often have we met together in the house of God in this relation!
          How often have I spoke to you, instructed, counseled, warned,
          directed, and fed you, and administered ordinances among you, as the
          people which were committed to my care, and of whose precious souls I
          had the charge! But in all probability this never will be again.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prophet Jeremiah, chap. 25:3, puts the people in mind how long he
          had labored among them in the work of the ministry: “From the
          thirteenth year of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto
          this day (that is, the three and twentieth year), the word of the Lord
          came unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking.”
          I am not about to compare myself with the prophet Jeremiah, but in
          this respect I can say as he did that “I have spoken the Word of God
          to you, unto the three and twentieth year, rising early and speaking.”
          It was three and twenty years, the 15th day of last February, since I
          have labored in the work of the ministry, in the relation of a pastor
          to this church and congregation. And though my strength has been
          weakness, having always labored under great infirmity of body, besides
          my insufficiency for so great a charge in other respects, yet I have
          not spared my feeble strength, but have exerted it for the good of
          your souls. I can appeal to you, as the apostle does to his hearers,
          Gal. 4:13, “Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the
          gospel unto you.” I have spent the prime of my life and strength in
          labors for your eternal welfare. You are my witnesses that what
          strength I have had I have not neglected in idleness, nor laid out in
          prosecuting worldly schemes, and managing temporal affairs, for the
          advancement of my outward estate, and aggrandizing myself and family.
          But [I] have given myself to the work of the ministry, laboring in it
          night and day, rising early and applying myself to this great business
          to which Christ appointed me. I have found the work of the ministry
          among you to be a great work indeed, a work of exceeding care, labor
          and difficulty. Many have been the heavy burdens that I have borne in
          it, to which my strength has been very unequal. God called me to bear
          these burdens; and I bless his name that he has so supported me as to
          keep me from sinking under them, and that his power herein has been
          manifested in my weakness. So that although I have often been troubled
          on every side, yet I have not been distressed; perplexed, but not in
          despair; cast down, but not destroyed. — But now I have reason to
          think my work is finished which I had to do as your minister: you have
          publicly rejected me, and my opportunities cease.
        </p>
        <p>
          How highly therefore does it now become us to consider of that time
          when we must meet one another before the chief Shepherd! When I must
          give an account of my stewardship, of the service I have done for, and
          the reception and treatment I have had among the people to whom he
          sent me. And you must give an account of your own conduct towards me,
          and the improvement you have made of these three and twenty years of
          my ministry. For then both you and I must appear together, and we both
          must give an account, in order to an infallible, righteous and eternal
          sentence to be passed upon us, by him who will judge us with respect
          to all that we have said or done in our meeting here, and all our
          conduct one towards another in the house of God and elsewhere. [He]
          will try our hearts, and manifest our thoughts, and the principles and
          frames of our minds. He will judge us with respect to all the
          controversies which have subsisted between us, with the strictest
          impartiality, and will examine our treatment of each other in those
          controversies. There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed,
          nor hid which shall not be known. All will be examined in the
          searching, penetrating light of God’s omniscience and glory, and by
          him whose eyes are as a flame of fire. Truth and right shall be made
          plainly to appear, being stripped of every veil. And all error,
          falsehood, unrighteousness, and injury shall be laid open, stripped of
          every disguise. Every specious pretense, every cavil, and all false
          reasoning shall vanish in a moment, as not being able to bear the
          light of that day. And then our hearts will be turned inside out, and
          the secrets of them will be made more plainly to appear than our
          outward actions do now. Then it shall appear what the ends are which
          we have aimed at, what have been the governing principles which we
          have acted from, and what have been the dispositions we have exercised
          in our ecclesiastical disputes and contests. Then it will appear
          whether I acted uprightly, and from a truly conscientious, careful
          regard to my duty to my great Lord and Master, in some former
          ecclesiastical controversies, which have been attended with exceeding
          unhappy circumstances and consequences. It will appear whether there
          was any just cause for the resentment which was manifested on those
          occasions. And then our late grand controversy, concerning the
          qualifications necessary for admission to the privileges of members,
          in complete standing, in the visible church of Christ, will be
          examined and judged in all its parts and circumstances, and the whole
          set forth in a clear, certain, and perfect light. Then it will appear
          whether the doctrine which I have preached and published concerning
          this matter be Christ’s own doctrine, whether he will not own it as
          one of the precious truths which have proceeded from his own mouth,
          and vindicate and honor as such before the whole universe. Then it
          will appear what is meant by “the man that comes without the wedding
          garment;” for that is the day spoken of, Mat. 22:13, wherein such a
          one shall be “bound hand and foot, and cast into outer darkness, where
          shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” And then it will appear
          whether, in declaring this doctrine, and acting agreeable to it, and
          in my general conduct in the affair, I have been influenced from any
          regard to my own temporal interest, or honor, or desire to appear
          wiser than others, or have acted from any sinister, secular views
          whatsoever, and whether what I have done has not been from a careful,
          strict, and tender regard to the will of my Lord and Master, and
          because I dare not offend him, being satisfied what his will was,
          after a long, diligent, impartial, and prayerful inquiry. Then it will
          be seen whether I had this constantly in view and prospect, to engage
          me to great solicitude not rashly to determine the question, that such
          a determination would not be for my temporal interest, but every way
          against it, bringing a long series of extreme difficulties, and
          plunging me into an abyss of trouble and sorrow. And then it will
          appear whether my people have done their duty to their pastor with
          respect to this matter; whether they have shown a right temper and
          spirit on this occasion; whether they have done me justice in hearing,
          attending to and considering what I had to say in evidence of what I
          believed and taught as part of the counsel of God; whether I have been
          treated with that impartiality, candor, and regard which the just
          Judge esteemed due; and whether, in the many steps which have been
          taken, and the many things that have been said and done in the course
          of this controversy, righteousness, and charity, and Christian decorum
          have been maintained; or, if otherwise, to how great a degree these
          things have been violated. Then every step of the conduct of each of
          us in this affair, from first to last, and the spirit we have
          exercised in all, shall be examined and manifested, and our own
          consciences shall speak plain and loud, and each of us shall be
          convinced, and the world shall know; and never shall there be any more
          mistake, misrepresentation, or misapprehension of the affair to
          eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          This controversy is now probably brought to an issue between you and
          me as to this world. It has issued in the event of the week before
          last, but it must have another decision at that great day, which
          certainly will come, when you and I shall meet together before the
          great judgment seat. Therefore I leave it to that time, and shall say
          no more about it at present. — But I would now proceed to address
          myself particularly to several sorts of persons.
        </p>
        <p>I. To those who are professors of godliness amongst us.</p>
        <p>
          I would now call you to a serious consideration of that great day
          wherein you must meet him who has heretofore been your pastor, before
          the Judge whose eyes are as a flame of fire. — I have endeavored,
          according to my best ability, to search the Word of God, with regard
          to the distinguishing notes of true piety, those by which persons
          might best discover their state, and most surely and clearly judge of
          themselves. And these rules and marks I have from time to time applied
          to you, in the preaching of the Word to the utmost of my skill, and in
          the most plain and search manner that I have been able, in order to
          the detecting the deceived hypocrite, and establishing the hopes and
          comforts of the sincere. And yet it is to be feared, that after all
          that I have done, I now leave some of you in a deceived, deluded
          state. For it is not to be supposed that among several hundred
          professors, none are deceived.
        </p>
        <p>
          Henceforward I am like to have no more opportunity to take the care
          and charge of your souls, to examine and search them. But still I
          entreat you to remember and consider the rules which I have often laid
          down to you during my ministry, with a solemn regard to the future day
          when you and I must meet together before our Judge, when the uses of
          examination you have heard from me must be rehearsed again before you,
          and those rules of trial must be tried, and it will appear whether
          they have been good or not. It will also appear whether you have
          impartially heard them, and tried yourselves by them. The Judge
          himself, who is infallible, will try both you and me. And after this
          none will be deceived concerning the state of their souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have often put you in mind, that whatever your pretenses to
          experiences, discoveries, comforts, and joys have been, at that day
          everyone will be judged according to his works, and then you will find
          it so. May you have a minister of greater knowledge of the Word of
          God, and better acquaintance with soul cases, and of greater skill in
          applying himself to souls, whose discourses may be more searching and
          convincing, that such of you as have held fast deceit under my
          preaching, may have your eyes opened by his: that you may be
          undeceived before that great day.
        </p>
        <p>
          What means and helps for instruction and self-examination you may
          hereafter have is uncertain. But one thing is certain: that the time
          is short, your opportunity for rectifying mistakes in so important a
          concern will soon come to an end. We live in a world of great changes.
          There is now a great change come to pass. You have withdrawn
          yourselves from my ministry, under which you have continued for so
          many years. But the time is coming, and will soon come, when you will
          pass out of time into eternity, and so will pass from under all means
          of grace whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
          The greater part of you who are professors of godliness have (to use
          the phrase of the apostle) “acknowledged me, in part:” you have
          heretofore acknowledged me to be your spiritual father, the instrument
          of the greatest good to you that can be obtained by any of the
          children of men. Consider of that day when you and I shall meet before
          our Judge, when it shall be examined whether you have had from me the
          treatment which is due to spiritual children, and whether you have
          treated me as you ought to have treated a spiritual father. — As the
          relation of a natural parent brings great obligations on children in
          the sight of God, so much more, in many respects, does the relation of
          a spiritual father bring great obligations on such of whose
          conversation and eternal salvation they suppose God has made them the
          instruments, 1 Cor. 4:15, “For though you have ten thousand
          instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ
          Jesus, I have begotten you through the gospel.”
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now I am taking my leave of this people I would apply myself to
          such among them as I leave in a Christless, graceless condition, and
          would call on such seriously to consider of that solemn day when they
          and I must meet before the Judge of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          My parting with you is, in some respects, in a peculiar manner a
          melancholy parting, inasmuch as I leave you in most melancholy
          circumstances, because I leave you in the gall of bitterness and bond
          of iniquity, having the wrath of God abiding on you, and remaining
          under condemnation to everlasting misery and destruction. Seeing I
          must leave you, it would have been a comfortable and happy
          circumstance of our parting, if I had left you in Christ, safe and
          blessed in that sure refuge and glorious rest of the saints. But it is
          otherwise. I leave you far off, aliens and strangers, wretched
          subjects and captives of sin and Satan, and prisoners of vindictive
          justice: without Christ, and without God in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your consciences bear me witness that while I had opportunity, I have
          not ceased to warn you, and set before you your danger. I have studied
          to represent the misery and necessity of your circumstances in the
          clearest manner possible. I have tried all ways that I could think of
          tending to awaken your consciences, and make you sensible of the
          necessity of your improving your time, and being speedy in flying from
          the wrath to come, and thorough in the use of means for your escape
          and safety. I have diligently endeavored to find out and use the most
          powerful motives to persuade you to take care for your own welfare and
          salvation. I have not only endeavored to awaken you, that you might be
          moved with fear, but I have used my utmost endeavors to win you: I
          have sought out acceptable words, that if possible I might prevail
          upon you to forsake sin, and turn to God, and accept of Christ as your
          Savior and Lord. I have spent my strength very much in these things.
          But yet, with regard to you whom I am addressing, I have not been
          successful, but have this day reason to complain in those words, Jer.
          6:29: “The bellows are burnt, the lead is consumed of the fire, the
          founder melteth in vain, for the wicked are not plucked away.” It is
          to be feared that all my labors, as to many of you, have served no
          other purpose but to harden you, and that the word which I have
          preached, instead of being a savor of life unto life, has been a savor
          of death unto death. Though I shall not have any account to give for
          the future of such as have openly and resolutely renounced my
          ministry, as of a trust committed to me, yet remember you must give
          account for yourselves, of your care of your own souls, and your
          improvement of all means past and future, through your whole lives.
          God only knows what will become of your poor perishing souls, what
          means you may hereafter enjoy, or what disadvantages and temptations
          you may be under. May God in his mercy grant that however all past
          means have been unsuccessful, you may have future means which may have
          a new effect, and that the Word of God, as it shall be hereafter
          dispensed to you, may prove as the fire and the hammer that breaketh
          the rock in pieces. However, let me now at parting exhort and beseech
          you not wholly to forget the warnings you have had while under my
          ministry. When you and I shall meet at the day of judgment, then you
          will remember them. The sight of me, your former minister, on that
          occasion, will soon revive them in your memory; and that in a very
          affecting manner. O do not let that be the first time that they are so
          revived.
        </p>
        <p>
          You and I are now parting one from another as to this world. Let us
          labor that we may not be parted after our meeting at the last day. If
          I have been your faithful pastor (which will that day appear whether I
          have or no), then I shall be acquitted, and shall ascend with Christ.
          O do your part that in such a case, you may not be forced eternally to
          part from me, and all that have been faithful in Christ Jesus. This is
          a sorrowful parting, but that would be a more sorrowful. — This you
          may perhaps bear without being much affected with it, if you are not
          glad of it, but such a parting in that day will most deeply, sensibly,
          and dreadfully affect you.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I would address myself to those who are under some awakenings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blessed be God that there are some such, and that (although I have
          reason to fear I leave multitudes in this large congregation in a
          Christless state) yet I do not leave them all in total stupidity and
          carelessness about their souls. Some of you that I have reason to hope
          are under some awakenings, have acquainted me with your circumstances,
          which has a tendency to cause me, now I am leaving you, to take my
          leave with peculiar concern for you. What will be the issue of your
          present exercise of mind, I know not, but it will be known at that
          day, when you and I shall meet before the judgment seat of Christ.
          Therefore now be much in consideration of that day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I am parting with this flock, I would once more press upon you the
          counsels I have heretofore given, to take heed of slightly so great a
          concern, to be thorough and in good earnest in the affair, and to
          beware of backsliding, to hold on and hold out to the end. And cry
          mightily to God, that these great changes which pass over this church
          and congregation do not prove your overthrow. There is great
          temptation in them, and the devil will undoubtedly seek to make his
          advantage of them, if possible to cause your present convictions and
          endeavors to be abortive. You had need to double your diligence, and
          watch and pray, lest you be overcome by temptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whoever may hereafter stand related to you as your spiritual guide, my
          desire and prayer is that the great Shepherd of the sheep would have a
          special respect to you, and be your guide (for there is none teacheth
          like him), and that he who is the infinite fountain of light, would
          “open your eyes, and turn you from darkness unto light, and from the
          power of Satan unto God; that you may receive forgiveness of sins, and
          inheritance among them that are sanctified, through faith that is in
          Christ;” that so in that great day, when I shall meet you again before
          your Judge and mine, we may meet in joyful and glorious circumstances,
          never to be separated any more.
        </p>
        <p>IV. I would apply myself to the young people of the congregation.</p>
        <p>
          Since I have been settled in the work of the ministry in this place, I
          have ever had a peculiar concern for the souls of the young people,
          and a desire that religion might flourish among them; and have
          especially exerted myself in order to it. Because I knew the special
          opportunity they had beyond others, and that ordinarily those for whom
          God intended mercy, were brought to fear and love him in their youth.
          And it has ever appeared to me a peculiarly amiable thing, to see
          young people walking in the ways of virtue and Christian piety, having
          their hearts purified and sweetened with a principle of divine love.
          How exceeding beautiful, and conducive to the adorning and happiness
          of the town, if the young people could be persuaded, when they meet
          together, to converse as Christians and as the children of God,
          avoiding impurity, levity and extravagance, keeping strictly to rules
          of virtue and conversing together of the things of God, and Christ,
          and heaven! This is what I have longed for, and it has been exceeding
          grievous to me when I have heard of vice, vanity and disorder among
          our youth. And so far as I know my own heart, it was from hence that I
          formerly led this church to some measures, for the suppressing vice
          among our young people, which gave so great offense, and by which I
          became so obnoxious. I have sought the good, and not the hurt of our
          young people. I have desired their truest honor and happiness, and not
          their reproach: knowing that true virtue and religion tended not only
          to the glory and felicity of young people in another world, but their
          greatest peace and prosperity, and highest dignity and honor in this
          world, and above all things to sweeten, and render pleasant and
          delightful, even the days of youth.
        </p>
        <p>
          But whether I have loved you, and sought your good more or less, now
          committing your souls to him who once committed the pastoral care of
          them to me — nothing remains, but only (as I am now taking my leave of
          you) earnestly to beseech you, from love to yourselves, if you have
          none to me, not to despise and forget the warnings and counsels I have
          so often given you. Remember the day when you and I must meet again
          before the great Judge of quick and dead, when it will appear whether
          the things I have taught you were true, whether the counsels I have
          given you were good, and whether I truly sought your welfare, and
          whether you have well improved my endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have, from time to time, earnestly warned you against frolicking (as
          it is called), and some other liberties commonly taken by young people
          in the land. And whatever some may say in justification of such
          liberties and customs, and may laugh at warnings against them, I now
          leave you my parting testimony against such things, not doubting but
          God will approve and confirm it in that day when we shall meet before
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. I would apply myself to the children of the congregation, the lambs
          of this flock, who have been so long under my care.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have just now said that I have had a peculiar concern for the young
          people, and in so saying I did not intend to exclude you. You are in
          youth, and in the most early youth. Therefore I have been sensible
          that if those that were young had a precious opportunity for their
          souls’ good, you who are very young had, in many respects, a
          peculiarly precious opportunity. And accordingly I have not neglected
          you. I have endeavored to do the part of a faithful shepherd, in
          feeding the lambs as well as the sheep. Christ did once commit the
          care of your souls to me as your minister; and you know, dear
          children, how I have instructed you, and warned you from time to time.
          You know how I have often called you together for that end, and some
          of you, sometimes, have seemed to be affected with what I have said to
          you. But I am afraid it has had no saving effect as to many of you,
          but that you remain still in an unconverted condition, without any
          real saving work wrought in your souls, convincing you thoroughly of
          your sin and misery, causing you to see the great evil of sin, and to
          mourn for it, and hate it above all things, and giving you a sense of
          the excellency of the Lord Jesus Christ, bringing you with all your
          hearts to cleave to him as your Savior, weaning your hearts from the
          world, and causing you to love God above all, and to delight in
          holiness more than in all the pleasant things of this earth. And I
          must now leave you in a miserable condition, having no interest in
          Christ, and so under the awful displeasure and anger of God, and in
          danger of going down to the pit of eternal misery. — Now I must bid
          you farewell. I must leave you in the hands of God. I can do no more
          for you than to pray for you. Only I desire you not to forget, but
          often think of the counsels and warnings I have given you, and the
          endeavors I have used, that your souls might be saved from everlasting
          destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear children, I leave you in an evil world, that is full of snares
          and temptations. God only knows what will become of you. This the
          Scripture has told us that there are but few saved, and we have
          abundant confirmation of it from what we see. This we see, that
          children die as well as others. Multitudes die before they grow up,
          and of those that grow up, comparatively few ever give good evidence
          of saving conversion to God. I pray God to pity you, and take care of
          you, and provide for you the best means for the good of your souls,
          and that God himself would undertake for you to be your heavenly
          Father, and the mighty Redeemer of your immortal souls. Do not neglect
          to pray for yourselves. Take heed you be not of the number of those
          who cast off fear, and restrain prayer before God. Constantly pray to
          God in secret, and often remember that great day when you must appear
          before the judgment seat of Christ, and meet your minister there, who
          has so often counseled and warned you.
