          2 Corinthians 5:8, “We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be
          absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THE apostle in this place is giving a reason why he went on with so
          much boldness and immovable steadfastness, through such labors,
          sufferings, and dangers of his life, in the service of his Lord, for
          which his enemies, the false teachers among the Corinthians, sometimes
          reproached him as being beside himself, and driven on by a kind of
          madness. — In the latter part of the preceding chapter, the apostle
          informs the Christian Corinthians, that the reason why he did thus,
          was that he firmly believed the promises that Christ had made to his
          faithful servants of a glorious future eternal reward, and knew that
          these present afflictions were light, and but for a moment, in
          comparison of that far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. The
          same discourse is continued in this chapter, wherein the apostle
          further insists on the reason he had given of his constancy in
          suffering, and exposing himself to death in the work of the ministry,
          even the more happy state he expected after death. And this is the
          subject of the text, wherein may be observed,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The great future privilege, which the apostle hoped for: that of
          being present with Christ. The words in the original properly signify
          dwelling with Christ, as in the same country or city, or making a home
          with Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. When the apostle looked for this privilege, viz. when he should be
          absent from the body. Not to wait for it till the resurrection, when
          soul and body should be united again. He signifies the same thing in
          his epistle to the Philippians, chap. 1:22, 23: “But if I live in the
          flesh, this is the fruit of my labor. Yet what I shall choose, I wot
          not. For I am in a strait between two; having a desire to depart, and
          to be with Christ.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The value the apostle set on this privilege. It was such that for
          the sake of it, he chose to be absent from the body. He was willing
          rather, or (as the word properly signifies) it were more pleasing to
          him, to part with the present life, and all its enjoyments, for the
          sake of being possessed of this great benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The present benefit, which the apostle had, by his faith and hope
          of this future privilege, viz. that hence he received courage,
          assurance, and constancy of mind: agreeable to the proper import of
          the word that is rendered, “we are confident.” The apostle is now
          giving a reason of that fortitude and immovable stability of mind with
          which he went through those extreme labors, hardships and dangers,
          which he mentions in this discourse. So that in the midst of all he
          did not faint, was not discouraged, but had constant light, and inward
          support, strength, and comfort in the midst of all: agreeable to the
          16th verse of the foregoing chapter, “For which cause, we faint not;
          but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day
          by day.” And the same is expressed more particularly in the 8th, 9th,
          and 10th verses, of that chapter, “We are troubled on every side, yet
          not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but
          not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in
          the body, the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus
          might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.” And in the next chapter,
          verses 4-10: “In all things approving ourselves as the ministers of
          God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
          in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in
          fastings, by pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness,
          by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the
          power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on
          the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as
          deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and
          behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway
          rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet
          possessing all things.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the many useful observations there might be raised from the
          text, I shall at this time only insist on that which lies most plainly
          before us in the words, viz. — The souls of true saints, when they
          leave their bodies at death, go to be with Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The souls of true saints go to be with Christ, in the following
          respects:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. They go to dwell in the same blessed abode with the glorified human
          nature of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The human nature of Christ is yet in being. He still continues, and
          will continue to all eternity, to be both God and man. His whole human
          nature remains: not only his human soul, but also his human body. His
          dead body rose from the dead, and the same that was raised from the
          dead, is exalted and glorified at God’s right hand, that which was
          dead is now alive and lives for evermore.
        </p>
        <p>
          And therefore there is a certain place, a particular part of the
          external creation, to which Christ is gone, and where he remains. And
          this place is that which we call the highest heaven, or the heaven of
          heavens, a place beyond all the visible heavens, Eph. 4:9, 10, “Now
          that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the
          lower parts of the earth? He that descended, is the same also that
          ascended up far above all heavens.” This is the same which the apostle
          calls the third heaven, 2 Cor. 12:2, reckoning the aerial heaven as
          the first, the starry heaven as the second, and the highest heaven as
          the third. This is the abode of the holy angels: they are called “the
          angels of heaven,” Mat. 24:36; “The angels which are in heaven,” Mark
          13:32; “The angels of God in heaven,” Mat. 22:30, and Mark 12:25. They
          are said “always to behold the face of the Father which is in heaven,”
          Mat. 18:10. And they are elsewhere often represented as before the
          throne of God, or surrounding his throne in heaven, and sent from
          thence, and descending from thence on messages to this world. And
          thither it is that the souls of departed saints are conducted when
          they die. They are not reserved in some abode distinct from the
          highest heaven: a place of rest, which they are kept in till the day
          of judgment, such as some imagine, which they call the hades of the
          happy. But they go directly to heaven itself. This is the saints’
          home, being their Father’s house: they are pilgrims and strangers on
          the earth, and this is the other and better country to which they are
          traveling, Heb. 11:13-26. This is the city they belong to; Phil. 3:20,
          “Our conversation (or as the word properly signifies, citizenship) is
          in heaven.” Therefore this undoubtedly is the place the apostle has
          respect to in my text, when he says, “We are willing to forsake our
          former house, the body, and to dwell in the same house, city or
          country, wherein Christ dwells;” which is the proper import of the
          original. What can this house, or city, or country be, but that house,
          which is elsewhere spoken of as their proper home, and their Father’s
          house, and the city and country to which they properly belong, and
          whither they are traveling all the while they continue in this world,
          and the house, city, and country where we know the human nature of
          Christ is? This is the saints’ rest: here their hearts are while they
          live, and here their treasure is: “The inheritance incorruptible, and
          undefiled, and that fadeth not away, that is designed for them, is
          reserved in heaven;” 1 Pet. 1:4, and therefore they never can have
          their proper and full rest till they come here. So that undoubtedly
          their souls, when absent from their bodies (when the Scriptures
          represent them as in a state of perfect rest), arrive hither. Those
          two saints, that left this world, to go to their rest in another
          world, without dying, viz. Enoch and Elijah, went to heaven. Elijah
          was seen ascending up to heaven, as Christ was. And to the same
          resting place, there is all reason to think that those saints go, who
          leave this world by death. Moses, when he died in the top of the
          mount, ascended to the same glorious abode with Elias, who ascended
          without dying. They are companions in another world, as they appeared
          together at Christ’s transfiguration. They were together at that time
          with Christ in the mount, when there was a specimen or sample of his
          glorification in heaven. And doubtless they were also together
          afterwards with him, when he was actually and fully glorified in
          heaven. And thither undoubtedly it was, that the soul of Stephen
          ascended, when he expired. The circumstances of his death demonstrate
          it, Acts 7:55, etc. “He being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up
          steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing
          on the right hand of God, and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened,
          and the Son of man (i.e. Jesus in his human nature) standing on the
          right hand of God. Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped
          their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, and cast him out of the
          city, and stoned him. — And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and
          saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” Before his death he had an
          extraordinary view of the glory that his Savior had received in
          heaven, not only for himself, but also for all his faithful followers,
          that he might be encouraged by the hopes of this glory, cheerfully to
          lay down his life for his sake. Accordingly he dies in the hope of
          this, saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” By which doubtless he
          meant, “receive my spirit to be with thee, in that glory, wherein I
          have now seen thee, in heaven, at the right-hand of God.” And thither
          it was that the soul of the penitent thief on the cross ascended.
          Christ said to him, “Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.”
          Paradise is the same with the third heaven, as appears by 2 Cor. 12:2,
          3, 4. There what is called the third heaven in the second verse, is in
          the fourth verse called paradise. The departed souls of the apostles
          and prophets are in heaven, as is manifest from Rev. 18:20, “Rejoice
          over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets.” The church
          of God is distinguished in Scripture, from time to time, into these
          two parts: that part of it that is in heaven, and that which is in
          earth, Eph. 3:14, 15, “Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in
          heaven and earth is named.” Col. 1:20, “And having made peace through
          the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself, by
          him, I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven.” Now
          what things in heaven are they for whom peace has been made by the
          blood of Christ’s cross, and who have by him been reconciled to God,
          but the saints in heaven? In like manner we read, Eph. 1:10, of God’s
          gathering together in one all things in Christ, both which are in
          heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.” The spirits of just men
          made perfect are in the same city of the living God, and heavenly
          Jerusalem, with the innumerable company of angels, and Jesus the
          Mediator of the new covenant, as is manifest by Heb. 12:22-24. The
          church of God is often in Scripture called Jerusalem, and the apostle
          speaks of the Jerusalem which is above, or which is in heaven, as the
          mother of us all. But if no part of the church be in heaven, or none
          but Enoch and Elias, it is not likely that the church would be called
          the Jerusalem which is in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The souls of true saints, when they leave their bodies at death,
          go to be with Christ, as they go to dwell in the immediate, full and
          constant sight or view of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we are absent from our dear friends, they are out of sight, but
          when we are with them, we have the opportunity and satisfaction of
          seeing them. So while the saints are in the body, and are absent from
          the Lord, he is in several respects out of sight, 1 Pet. 1:8, “Whom
          having not seen, ye love: in whom, though now ye see him not, yet
          believing,” etc. They have indeed, in this world, a spiritual sight of
          Christ, but they see through a glass darkly, and with great
          interruption, but in heaven they see him face to face, 1 Cor. 13:12.
          “The pure in heart are blessed; for they shall see God,” Mat. 5:8.
          Their beatific vision of God is in Christ, who is that brightness or
          effulgence of God’s glory, by which his glory shines forth in heaven,
          to the view of saints and angels there, as well as here on earth. This
          is the Sun of righteousness that is not only the light of this world,
          but is also the sun that enlightens the heavenly Jerusalem, by whose
          bright beams it is that the glory of God shines forth there, to the
          enlightening and making happy all the glorious inhabitants. “The Lamb
          is the light thereof; and so the glory of God doth lighten it,” Rev.
          21:23. None sees God the Father immediately, who is the King eternal,
          immortal, invisible. Christ is the image of that invisible God, by
          which he is seen by all elect creatures. The only-begotten Son that is
          in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him, and manifested him.
          None has ever immediately seen the Father, but the Son; and none else
          sees the Father any other way, than by the Son’s revealing him. And in
          heaven, the spirits of just men made perfect behold his glory. They
          see the glory of his divine nature, consisting in all the glory of the
          Godhead, the beauty of all his perfections: his great majesty,
          almighty power, his infinite wisdom, holiness, and grace. They see the
          beauty of his glorified human nature, and the glory which the Father
          has given him, as God-man and Mediator. For this end, Christ desired
          that his saints might “be with him, that they might behold his glory,”
          John 17:24. And when the souls of the saints leave their bodies, to go
          to be with Christ, they behold the marvelous glory of that great work
          of redemption, and of the glorious way of salvation by him, which the
          angels desire to look into. They have a most clear view of the
          unfathomable depths of the manifold wisdom and knowledge of God, and
          the most bright displays of the infinite purity and holiness of God
          which appear in that way and work, and see in another manner than the
          saints do here, what is the breadth and length, and depth and height,
          of the grace and love of Christ, appearing in his redemption. And as
          they see the unspeakable riches and glory of the attribute of God’s
          grace, so they most clearly behold and understand Christ’s eternal and
          unmeasurable dying love to them in particular. And in short, they see
          everything in Christ that tends to kindle, enflame, and gratify love,
          and everything that tends to satisfy them, and that in the most clear
          and glorious manner, without any darkness or delusion, without any
          impediment or interruption. Now the saints, while in the body, see
          something of Christ’s glory and love, as in the dawning of the
          morning, we see something of the reflected light of the sun mingled
          with darkness. But when separated from the body, they see their
          glorious and loving Redeemer, as we see the sun when risen, and
          showing his whole disk above the horizon, by his direct beams, in a
          clear hemisphere, and with perfect day.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The souls of true saints, when absent from the body, go to be
          with Jesus Christ, as they are brought into a most perfect conformity
          to and union with him. Their spiritual conformity is begun while they
          are in the body. Here beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
          they are changed into the same image. But when they come to see him as
          he is, in heaven, then they become like him in another manner. That
          perfect sight will abolish all remains of deformity, disagreement, and
          sinful unlikeness, as all darkness is abolished before the full blaze
          of the sun’s meridian light. As it is impossible that the least degree
          of obscurity should remain before such light, so it is impossible the
          least degree of sin and spiritual deformity should remain with such a
          view of the spiritual beauty and glory of Christ, as the saints enjoy
          in heaven, when they see that Sun of righteousness without a cloud.
          They themselves shall not only shine forth as the sun, but shall be as
          little suns, without a spot. For then is come the time when Christ
          presents his saints to himself, in glorious beauty; “not having spot,
          or wrinkle, or any such thing;” and having holiness without a blemish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the saints’ union with Christ is perfected. This also is begun in
          this world. The relative union is both begun and perfected at once,
          when the soul first being quickened by him closes with Christ by
          faith. The real union, consisting in the vital union and that of
          hearts and affections, is begun in this world and perfected in the
          next. The union of the heart of a believer to Christ is begun when it
          is drawn to him, by the first discovery of divine excellency, at
          conversion. Consequent on this drawing and closing of his heart with
          Christ, is established a mutual vital union with Christ, whereby the
          believer becomes a living branch of the true vine, living by a
          communication of the sap and vital juice of the stock and root, and a
          member of Christ’s mystical body, living by a communication of
          spiritual and vital influences from the head, and by a kind of
          participation of Christ’s own life. But while the saints are in the
          body, there is much remaining distance between Christ and them. There
          are remainders of alienation, and the vital union is very imperfect,
          and so consequently is the communications of spiritual life and vital
          influences. There is much between Christ and believers to keep them
          asunder, much indwelling sin, much temptation, a heavy-molded frail
          body, and a world of carnal objects, to keep off the soul from Christ,
          and hinder a perfect coalescence. But when the soul leaves the body,
          all these clogs and hindrances shall be removed, every separating wall
          shall be broken down, and every impediment taken out of the way, and
          all distance shall cease. The heart shall be wholly and forever
          attached and bound to him, by a perfect view of his glory. And the
          vital union shall then be brought to perfection. The soul shall live
          perfectly in and upon Christ, being perfectly filled with his spirit,
          and animated by his vital influences, living as it were only by
          Christ’s life, without any remainder of spiritual death, or carnal
          life.

          IV. Departed souls of saints are with Christ, as they enjoy a glorious
          and immediate intercourse and converse with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we are present with our friends, we have opportunity for that
          free and immediate conversation with them, which we cannot have in
          absence from them. And therefore, by reason of the vastly more free,
          perfect, and immediate intercourse with Christ, which the saints enjoy
          when absent from the body, they are fitly represented as present with
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most intimate intercourse becomes that relation which the saints
          stand in to Jesus Christ; and especially becomes that most perfect and
          glorious union they shall be brought into with him in heaven. They are
          not merely Christ’s servants, but his friends, John 15:15. His
          brethren and companions, Psa. 122:8; “yea, they are the spouse of
          Christ.” They are espoused or betrothed to Christ while in the body;
          but when they go to heaven, they enter into the King’s palace, their
          marriage with him is come, and the King brings them into his chambers
          indeed. They then go to dwell with Christ constantly, to enjoy the
          most perfect converse with him. Christ conversed in the most friendly
          manner with his disciples on earth. He admitted one of them to lean on
          his bosom, but they are admitted much more fully and freely to
          converse with him in heaven. Though Christ be there in a state of
          glorious exaltation, reigning in the majesty and glory of the
          sovereign Lord and God of heaven and earth, angels and men, yet this
          will not hinder intimacy and freedom of intercourse, but rather
          promote it. For he is thus exalted, not only for himself, but for
          them. He is instated in this glory of head over all things for their
          sakes, that they might be exalted and glorified. When they go to
          heaven where he is, they are exalted and glorified with him, and shall
          not be kept at a more awful distance from Christ, but shall be
          admitted nearer, and to a greater intimacy. For they shall be
          unspeakably more fit for it, and Christ in more fit circumstances to
          bestow on them this blessedness. Their seeing the great glory of their
          friend and Redeemer, will not awe them to a distance, and make them
          afraid of a near approach, but on the contrary, will most powerfully
          draw them near, and encourage and engage them to holy freedom. For
          they will know that it is he that is their own Redeemer, and beloved
          friend and bridegroom: the very same that loved them with a dying
          love, and redeemed them to God by his blood, Mat. 14:27, “It is I; be
          not afraid.” Rev. 1:17, 18, “Fear not: — I am he that liveth, and was
          dead.” And the nature of this glory of Christ which they shall behold,
          will be such as will draw and encourage them. For they will not only
          see infinite majesty and greatness, but infinite grace, condescension,
          and mildness, and gentleness and sweetness, equal to his majesty. For
          he appears in heaven, not only as “the Lion of the tribe of Judah, but
          as the Lamb in the midst of the throne,” Rev. 5:5, 6. He shall be
          their shepherd, to “feed them, and lead them to living fountains of
          water,” Rev. 7:17, so that the sight of Christ’s great kingly majesty
          will be no terror to them, but will only serve the more to heighten
          their pleasure and surprise. When Mary was about to embrace Christ,
          being full of joy at the sight of him again alive after his
          crucifixion, Christ forbids her to do it for the present, because he
          was not yet ascended. John 20:16, 17, “Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She
          turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master.
          Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my
          Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my
          Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.” As if he had
          said, “This is not the time and place for that freedom your love to me
          desires: this is appointed in heaven after my ascension. I am going
          thither: and you, my true disciples, shall, as my brethren and
          companions, soon be there with me in my glory. And then there shall be
          no restraint. That is the place appointed for the most perfect
          expressions of complacence and endearment, and full enjoyment of
          mutual love.” And accordingly the souls of departed saints with Christ
          in heaven, shall have Christ as it were unbosomed unto them,
          manifesting those infinite riches of love towards them, that have been
          there from eternity. They shall be enabled to express their love to
          him, in an incomparably better manner than ever they could while in
          the body. Thus they shall eat and drink abundantly, and swim in the
          ocean of love, and be eternally swallowed up in the infinitely bright,
          and infinitely mild and sweet beams of divine love: eternally
          receiving that light, eternally full of it, and eternally compassed
          round with it, and everlastingly reflecting it back again to its the
          fountain of.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The souls of the saints, when they leave their bodies at death, go
          to be with Christ, as they are received to a glorious fellowship with
          Christ in his blessedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the wife is received to a joint possession of her husband’s estate,
          and as the wife of a prince partakes with him in his princely
          possessions and honors, so the church, the spouse of Christ, when the
          marriage comes, and she is received to dwell with him in heaven, shall
          partake with him in his glory. When Christ rose from the dead, and
          took possession of eternal life, this was not as a private person, but
          as the public head of all his redeemed people. He took possession of
          it for them, as well as for himself, and they are “quickened together
          with him, and raised up together.” — And so when he ascended into
          heaven, and was exalted to great glory there, this also was as a
          public person. He took possession of heaven, not only for himself, but
          his people, as their forerunner and head, that they might ascend also,
          “and sit together in heavenly places with him,” Eph. 2:5, 6, “Christ
          writes upon them his new name,” Rev. 3:12; i.e., he makes them
          partakers of his own glory and exaltation in heaven. His new name is
          that new honor and glory that the Father invested him with, when he
          set him on his own right hand, as a prince, when he advances anyone to
          new dignity in his kingdom, gives him a new title. Christ and his
          saints shall be glorified together, Rom. 8:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          The saints in heaven have communion, or a joint participation with
          Christ in his glory and blessedness in heaven, in the following
          respects more especially.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, they partake with him in the ineffable delights he has in
          heaven, in the enjoyment of his Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Christ ascended into heaven, he was received to a glorious and
          peculiar joy and blessedness in the enjoyment of his Father, who in
          his passion hid his face from him — such an enjoyment as became the
          relation he stood in to the Father, and such as was a meet reward for
          the great and hard service he had performed on earth. Then “God showed
          him the path of life, and brought him into his presence, where is
          fullness of joy, and to sit on his right hand, where there are
          pleasures for evermore,” as Psa. 16:11. “Then the Father made him most
          blessed forever: he made him exceeding glad with his countenance;” as
          in Psa. 21:6. The saints, by virtue of their union with Christ, and
          being his members, do in some sort partake of his childlike relation
          to the Father, and so are heirs with him of his happiness in the
          enjoyment of his Father, as seems to be intimated by the apostle, in
          Gal. 4:4-7. The spouse of Christ, by virtue of her espousals to that
          only-begotten Son of God, is as it were, a partaker of his filial
          relation to God, and becomes the king’s daughter, Psa. 45:13, and so
          partakes with her divine husband in his enjoyment of “his Father and
          her Father, his God and her God.” A promise of this seems to be
          implied in those words of Christ to Mary, John 20:17. Thus Christ’s
          faithful servants “enter into the joy of their Lord,” Mat. 25:21-23,
          and “Christ’s joy remains in them;” agreeably to those words of
          Christ, John 15:11. Christ from eternity is, as it were, in the bosom
          of the Father, as the object of his infinite complacence. In him is
          the Father’s eternal happiness. Before the world was, he was with the
          Father, in the enjoyment of his infinite love, and had infinite
          delight and blessedness in that enjoyment; as he declares of himself
          in Pro. 8:30: “Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I
          was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him.” And when Christ
          ascended to the Father after his passion, he went to him, to the
          enjoyment of the same glory and blessedness in the enjoyment of his
          love, agreeable to his prayer the evening before his crucifixion, John
          17:5: “And now, O Father, glorify me with thine own self, with the
          glory I had with thee before the world was.” And in the same prayer,
          he manifests it to be his will that his true disciples should be with
          him in the enjoyment of that joy and glory, which he then asked for
          himself, John 17:13: “That my joy might be fulfilled in themselves:”
          verse 22, “And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them.”
          This glory and joy of Christ, which the saints are to enjoy with him,
          is that which he has in the enjoyment of the Father’s infinite love to
          him, as appears by the last words of that prayer of our Lord, John
          17:26, “That the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them,
          and I in them.” The love which the Father has to his Son is great
          indeed. The Deity does, as it were, wholly and entirely flow out in a
          stream of love to Christ, and the joy and pleasure of Christ is
          proportionably great. — This is the stream of Christ’s delights, the
          river of his infinite pleasure, which he will make his saints to drink
          of with him, agreeable to Psa. 36:8, 9: “They shall be abundantly
          satisfied with the fatness of thy house: thou shalt make them drink of
          the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life: in
          thy light shall we see light.” The saints shall have pleasure in
          partaking with Christ in his pleasure, and shall see light in his
          light. They shall partake with Christ of the same river of pleasure,
          shall drink of the same water of life, and of the same new wine in the
          Father’s kingdom, Mat. 26:29. That new wine is especially that joy and
          happiness that Christ and his true disciples shall partake of together
          in glory, which is the purchase of Christ’s blood, or the reward of
          his obedience unto death. Christ, at his ascension into heaven,
          received everlasting pleasures at his Father’s right hand, and in the
          enjoyment of his love, as the reward of his own death, or obedience
          unto death. But the same righteousness is reckoned to both head and
          members. Both shall have fellowship in the same reward, each according
          to their distinct capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the saints in heaven have such a communion with Christ in his
          joy, and do so partake with him in his own enjoyment of the Father,
          greatly manifests the transcendent excellency of their happiness, and
          their being admitted to a vastly higher privilege in glory than the
          angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the saints in heaven are received to a fellowship or
          participation with Christ in the glory of that dominion to which the
          Father has exalted him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The saints, when they ascend to heaven as Christ ascended, and are
          made to sit together with Christ in heavenly places, and are partakers
          of the glory of his exaltation, are exalted to reign with him. They
          are through him made kings and priests, and reign with him, and in
          him, over the same kingdom. As the Father has appointed unto him a
          kingdom, so he has appointed to them. The Father has appointed the Son
          to reign over his own kingdom, and the Son appoints his saints to
          reign in his. The Father has given to Christ to sit with him on his
          throne, and Christ gives to the saints to sit with him on his throne,
          agreeably to Christ’s promise, Rev. 3:21. Christ, as God’s Son, is the
          heir of his kingdom, and the saints are joint heirs with Christ, which
          implies that they are heirs of the same inheritance, to possess the
          same kingdom, in and with him, according to their capacity. Christ in
          his kingdom reigns over heaven and earth. He is appointed the heir of
          all things, and so all things are the saints’: “whether Paul, or
          Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things
          present, or things to come,” all are theirs; because they are
          Christ’s, and united to him, 1 Cor. 3:21-23. The angels are given to
          Christ as a part of his dominion. They are all given to wait upon him
          as ministering spirits to him. So also they are all, even the highest
          and most dignified of them, “ministering spirits, to minister to them
          who are the heirs of salvation.” They are Christ’s angels, and they
          are also their angels. Such is the saints’ union with Christ, and
          their interest in him, that what he possesses they possess, in a much
          more perfect and blessed manner than if all things were given to them
          separately, and by themselves, to be disposed of according to their
          discretion. They are now disposed of so as, in every respect, to be
          most for their blessedness, by an infinitely better discretion than
          their own, and in being disposed of by their head and husband, between
          whom and them there is the most perfect union of hearts, and the most
          perfect union of wills.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the glorified spouse of this great King reigns with and in him, in
          his dominion over the universe, so more especially does she partake
          with him in the joy and glory of his reign in his kingdom of grace,
          which is more peculiarly the kingdom that he possesses as head of the
          church, and is that kingdom wherein she is more especially interested.
          It was especially to reign in this kingdom that God the Father exalted
          him to his throne in heaven. He set his King on his holy hill of Zion,
          especially that he might reign over Zion, or over his church, in his
          kingdom of grace, and that he might be under the best advantages to
          carry on the designs of his love in this lower world. And therefore
          undoubtedly the saints in heaven are partakers with Christ in the joy
          and glory of the advancement and prosperity of his kingdom of grace on
          earth, and success of his gospel here, which he looks on as the
          peculiar glory of his reign. The good shepherd rejoices when he finds
          but one sheep that was lost, and his friends and neighbors in heaven
          rejoice with him on that occasion. That part of the family that is in
          heaven are surely not unacquainted with the affairs of that part of
          the same family that is on earth. They who are with the King, and the
          royal family that dwell in his palace, are not kept in ignorance of
          the affairs of his kingdom. The saints in heaven are with the angels,
          the King’s ministers, by which he manages the affairs of his kingdom,
          and who are continually ascending and descending from heaven to the
          earth, and one or other of them daily employed as ministering spirits
          to each individual member of the church below. To this we may add, the
          continual ascending of the souls of departed saints from all parts of
          the militant church. On these accounts the saints in heaven must needs
          be under a thousand times greater advantage than we here, for a full
          view of the state of the church on earth, and a speedy, direct, and
          certain acquaintance with all its affairs in every part. And that
          which gives them much greater advantage for such an acquaintance than
          the things already mentioned, is their being constantly in the
          immediate presence of Christ, and in the enjoyment of the most perfect
          intercourse with him, who is the King who manages all these affairs,
          and has an absolutely perfect knowledge of them. Christ is the head of
          the whole glorified assembly. They are mystically his glorified body,
          and what the head sees, it sees for the information of the whole body,
          according to its capacity. What the head enjoys is for the joy of the
          whole body. The saints, in leaving this world, and ascending to
          heaven, do not go out of sight of things appertaining to Christ’s
          kingdom on earth. But, on the contrary, they go out of a state of
          obscurity, and ascend above the mists and clouds into the clearest
          light, to a pinnacle in the very center of light, where everything
          appears in clear view. They have as much greater advantage to view the
          state of Christ’s kingdom, and the works of the new creation here,
          than while they were in this world, as a man that ascends to the top
          of a high mountain has a greater advantage to view the face of the
          earth, than he had while he was in a deep valley, or thick forest
          below, surrounded on every side with those things that impeded and
          limited his prospect. Nor do they view as indifferent or unconcerned
          spectators, any more than Christ himself is an unconcerned spectator.
          The happiness of the saints in heaven consists very much in beholding
          the glory of God appearing in the work of redemption. For it is by
          this chiefly that God manifests his glory, the glory of his wisdom,
          holiness, grace, and other perfections, to both saints and angels, as
          is apparent by many Scriptures. And therefore undoubtedly their
          happiness consists very much in beholding the progress of this work in
          its application and success, and the steps by which infinite power and
          wisdom bring it to its consummation. And the saints in heaven are
          under unspeakably greater advantage to take the pleasure of beholding
          the progress of this work on earth than we are, as they are under
          greater advantages to see and understand the marvelous steps that
          divine wisdom takes in all that is done, and the glorious ends he
          obtains, the opposition Satan makes, and how he is baffled and
          overthrown. They can better see the connection of one event with
          another, and the beautiful order of all things that come to pass in
          the church in different ages that to us appear like confusion. Nor do
          they only view these things, and rejoice in them, as a glorious and
          beautiful sight, but as persons interested, as Christ is interested,
          as possessing these things in Christ, and reigning with him in this
          kingdom. Christ’s success in his work of redemption, in bringing home
          souls to himself, applying his saving benefits by his Spirit, and the
          advancement of the kingdom of grace in the world, is the reward
          especially promised to him by his Father in the covenant of
          redemption, for the hard and difficult service he performed while in
          the form of a servant, as is manifest by Isa. 53:10-12. But the saints
          shall be rewarded with him. They shall partake with him in the joy of
          this reward, for this obedience that is thus rewarded is reckoned to
          them as they are his members. This was especially the joy that was set
          before Christ, for the sake of which he endured the cross and despised
          the shame. And his joy is the joy of all heaven. They that are with
          him in heaven are under much the greatest advantages to partake with
          him in this joy. For they have a perfect communion with him through
          whom, and in fellowship with whom, they enjoy and possess their whole
          inheritance, all their heavenly happiness: as much as the whole body
          has all its pleasure of music by the ear, and all the pleasure of its
          food by the mouth and stomach, and all the benefit and refreshment of
          the air by the lungs. The saints while on earth pray and labor for the
          same thing that Christ labored for, viz. the advancement of the
          kingdom of God among men, the prosperity of Zion, and flourishing of
          religion in this world. And most of them have been made partakers with
          their Head in his sufferings, and “filled up (as the apostle expresses
          it) that which is behind of the sufferings of Christ.” And therefore
          they shall partake with him of the glory and joy of the end obtained,
          Rom. 8:17, “We are joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer
          with him, that we may be also glorified together.” 2 Tim. 2:12, “If we
          suffer with him, we shall also reign with him.” Christ, when his
          sufferings were past, and he left the earth and ascended into heaven,
          was so far from having done with kingdom in this world, that it was as
          it were but then begun. He ascended for that very end, that he might
          more fully possess and enjoy this kingdom, that he might reign in it,
          and be under the best advantages for it. In like manner, no more have
          the saints done with Christ’s kingdom on earth, when they ascend into
          heaven. “Christ came (i. e., ascended) with clouds of heaven, and came
          to the Ancient of days, and was brought near before him, to the very
          end, that he might receive dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that
          all people, nations, and languages, should serve him,” Dan. 7:13, 14.
          This shall be eminently fulfilled after the ruin of Antichrist, which
          is especially the time of Christ’s kingdom. And the same is the time
          when “the kingdom, and dominion, and greatness of the kingdom under
          the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the
          most high God;” as verse 27. It is because they shall reign in and
          with Christ, the Most High, as seems intimated in the words that
          follow: “whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions
          shall serve and obey him.” This is true, not only of the saints on
          earth, but also the saints in heaven. Hence the saints in heaven,
          having respect to this time, do sing, Rev. 5:10, “We shall reign on
          the earth.” And agreeably hereto, it is afterwards represented that
          when the forementioned time comes, the souls of them that in former
          ages had suffered with Christ, do reign with him, having as it were
          given to them new life and joy in that spiritual blessed resurrection,
          which shall then be of the church of God on earth. Thus, Mat. 5:5,
          “The meek (those that meekly and patiently suffer with Christ, and for
          his sake) shall inherit the earth:” they shall inherit it, and reign
          on earth with Christ. Christ is the heir of the world, and when the
          appointed time of his kingdom comes, his inheritance shall be given
          him. Then the meek, who are joint heirs, shall inherit the earth. The
          place in the Old Testament whence the words are taken, leads to a true
          interpretation of them, Psa. 37:11, “The meek shall inherit the earth,
          and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.” That there is
          reference in these latter words, “the abundance of peace,” to the
          peace and blessedness of the latter days, we may be satisfied by
          comparing these words with Psa. 72:7, “In his days shall be abundance
          of peace so long as the moon endureth;” and Jer. 33:6, “I will reveal
          to them the abundance of peace and truth:” also Isa. 2:4; Mic. 4:3;
          Isa. 11:6-9, and many other parallel places. The saints in heaven will
          be as much with Christ in reigning over the nations, and in the glory
          of his dominion at that time, as they will he with him in the honor of
          judging the world at the last day. That promise of Christ to his
          disciples, Mat. 19:28, 29, seems to have a special respect to the
          former of these. In verse 28, Christ promises to the disciples, that
          hereafter, “when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory,
          they shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
          Israel.” The saints in heaven reigning on earth in the glorious latter
          day, is described in language accommodated to this promise of Christ,
          Rev. 20:4, “And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them; and judgment
          was given them. — And they reigned with Christ.” And the promise, Mat.
          19:29, seems to have its fulfillment at the same time: “And every one
          that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or fathers, or
          wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive a
          hundred-fold, and shall inherit everlasting life;” i.e., in the time
          when the saints shall inherit the earth, and reign on earth, the earth
          with all its blessings and good things, shall be given in great
          abundance to the church, to be possessed by the saints. This shall
          they receive in this present world, and in the future everlasting
          life. The saints in heaven shall partake with Christ in the triumph
          and glory of those victories that he shall obtain in that future
          glorious time, over the kings and nations of the world, represented by
          his ruling them with a rod of iron, and dashing them in pieces as a
          potter’s vessel. To which doubtless there is a respect in Rev. 2:26,
          27, “He that overcometh, and keepeth my words unto the end, to him
          will I give power over the nations; (and he shall rule them with a rod
          of iron: as the vessel of a potter shall they be broken to shivers);
          even as I received of my Father.” And Psa. 149:5, to the end (Psa.
          149:5-9): “Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon
          their beds;” (i.e. in their separate state after death; compare Isa.
          57:1, 2). “Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a
          two-edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the heathen,
          and punishments upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and
          their nobles with fetters of iron, to execute upon them the judgment
          written: this honor have all the saints.” Accordingly, when Christ
          appears riding forth to his victory over Antichrist, Rev. 19, the
          hosts of heaven appear going forth with him in robes of triumph, verse
          14. And when Antichrist is destroyed, the inhabitants of heaven, and
          the holy apostles and prophets, are called upon to rejoice, Rev.
          18:20. And the whole multitude of the inhabitants of heaven on that
          occasion, appear to exult and praise God with exceeding joy, Rev.
          19:1-8, and chap. 11:15. They are also represented as greatly
          rejoicing on occasion of the ruin of the heathen empire, in the days
          of Constantine, chap. 12:10. And it is observable, all along in the
          visions of that book, that the hosts of heaven appear as much
          concerned and interested in the events appertaining to the kingdom of
          Christ here below, as the saints on earth. The day of the commencement
          of the church’s latter-day glory is eminently “the day of Christ’s
          espousals; the day of the gladness of his heart, when as the
          bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so he will rejoice over his
          church.” And then will all heaven exceedingly rejoice with him. And
          therefore they say at that time, Rev. 19:7, “Let us be glad, and
          rejoice, and give glory to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus Abraham enjoys these things, when they come to pass, which were
          of old promised to him, and which he saw before hand, and rejoiced in.
          He will enjoy the fulfillment of the promise of all the families of
          the earth being blessed in his seed, when it shall be accomplished.
          And all the ancient patriarchs, who died in faith of promises of
          glorious things that should be accomplished in this world, “who had
          not received the promises, but saw them afar off, and were persuaded
          of them, and embraced them,” actually enjoy them when fulfilled. David
          actually saw and enjoyed the fulfillment of that promise, in its due
          time, which was made to him many hundred years before, and was all his
          salvation and all his desire. Thus Daniel shall stand in his lot at
          the end of the days pointed out by his own prophecy. Thus the saints
          of old that died in faith, not having received the promises, are made
          perfect, and have their faith crowned by the better things
          accomplished in these latter days of the gospel, Heb. 11:39, 40. which
          they see and enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, the departed souls of saints have fellowship with Christ, in
          his blessed and eternal employment of glorifying the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          The happiness of heaven consists not only in contemplation, and a mere
          passive enjoyment, but consists very much in action. And particularly
          in actively serving and glorifying God. This is expressly mentioned as
          a great part of the blessedness of the saints in their most perfect
          state, Rev. 22:3, “And there shall be no more curse; but the throne of
          God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him.”
          The angels are as a flame of fire in their ardor and activity in God’s
          service. The four animals, Rev. 4 (which are generally supposed to
          signify the angels), are represented as continually giving praise and
          glory to God, and are said not to rest day nor night, verse 8. The
          souls of departed saints are, doubtless, become as the angels of God
          in heaven in this respect. And Jesus Christ is the head of the whole
          glorious assembly, as in other things appertaining to their blessed
          state, so in this of their praising and glorifying the Father. When
          Christ, the night before he was crucified, prayed for his exaltation
          to glory, it was that he might glorify the Father, John 17:1, “These
          words spake Jesus, and lift up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father,
          the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify
          thee.” And this he doubtless does, now [that] he is in heaven, not
          only in fulfilling the Father’s will, in what he does as Head of the
          church and Ruler of the universe, but also in leading the heavenly
          assembly in their praises. When Christ instituted the Lord’s supper,
          and ate and drank with his disciples at his table (giving them therein
          a representation and pledge of their future feasting with him, and
          drinking new wine in his heavenly Father’s kingdom), he at that time
          led them in their praises to God, in a hymn they sang. And so
          doubtless he leads his glorified disciples in heaven. David was the
          sweet psalmist of Israel, and he led the great congregation of God’s
          people in their songs of praise. Herein, as well as in innumerable
          other things, he was a type of Christ, who is often spoken of in
          Scripture by the name of David. And many of the psalms that David
          penned, were songs of praise that he, by the spirit of prophecy,
          uttered in the name of Christ, as head of the church, and leading the
          saints in their praises. Christ in heaven leads the glorious assembly
          in their praises to God, as Moses did the congregation of Israel at
          the Red Sea, which is implied in its being said that “they sing the
          song of Moses and the Lamb,” Rev. 15:2, 3. In Rev. 19:5, John tells
          us, that “he heard a voice come out of the throne, saying, Praise our
          God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.”
          Who can it be that utters this voice out of the throne, but the Lamb
          that is in the midst of the throne, calling on the glorious assembly
          of saints to praise his Father and their Father, his God and their
          God? And what the consequence of this voice is, we have an account in
          the next words: “And I heard as it were the voice of a great
          multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty
          thunderings, saying Alleluia; for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.”
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          The use that I would make of what has been said on this subject is of
          exhortation. Let us all be exhorted hence earnestly to seek after that
          great privilege, that when “we are absent from the body, we may be
          present with the Lord.” We cannot continue always in these earthly
          tabernacles; — they are very frail, and will soon decay and fall, and
          are continually liable to be overthrown by innumerable means. Our
          souls must soon leave them, and go into the eternal world. — O, how
          infinitely great will the privilege and happiness of such be, who at
          that time shall go to be with Christ in his glory, in the manner that
          has been represented! The privilege of the twelve disciples was great,
          in being so constantly with Christ as his family, in his state of
          humiliation. The privilege of those three disciples was great, who
          were with him in the mount of his transfiguration, where was exhibited
          to them some little semblance of his future glory in heaven, such as
          they might behold in the present frail, feeble, and sinful state. They
          were greatly entertained and delighted with what they saw, and were
          for making tabernacles to dwell there, and return no more down the
          mount. And great was the privilege of Moses when he was with Christ in
          mount Sinai, and besought him to show him his glory, and he saw his
          back parts as he passed by, and proclaimed his name. — But how
          infinitely greater the privilege of being with Christ in heaven, where
          he sits on the right hand of God, as the glory of the King and God of
          angels, and of the whole universe, shining forth as the great light,
          the bright sun of that world of glory; there to dwell in the full,
          constant and everlasting view of his beauty and brightness; there most
          freely and intimately to converse with him, and fully to enjoy his
          love, as his friends and spouse; there to have fellowship with him in
          the infinite pleasure and joy he has in the enjoyment of his Father!
          How transcendent the privilege, there to sit with him on his throne,
          to reign with him in the possession of all things, and partake with
          him in the joy and glory of his victory over his enemies, and the
          advancement of his kingdom in the world, and to join with him in
          joyful songs of praise to his Father and their Father, to his God and
          their God, forever and ever! Is not such a privilege worth seeking
          after?
        </p>
        <p>
          But here, as a special enforcement of this exhortation, I would
          improve that dispensation of God’s holy providence, which is the
          sorrowful occasion of our coming together at this time, viz. the death
          of that eminent servant of Jesus Christ, in the work of the
          gospel-ministry, whose funeral is this day to be attended; together
          with what was observable in him, living and dying.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this dispensation of Providence, God puts us in mind of our
          mortality, and forewarns us that the time is approaching when we must
          be absent from the body, and “must all appear (as the apostle observes
          in the context) before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one of
          us may receive the things done in the body, according to what we have
          done, whether it be good or bad.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And in him, whose death we are now called to consider and improve, we
          have not only an instance of mortality, but an instance of one that,
          being absent from the body, is present with the Lord, as we have all
          imaginable reason to conclude. And that whether we consider the nature
          of the operations he was under, about the time whence he dates his
          conversion, or the nature and course of his inward exercises from that
          time forward, or his outward conversation and practices in life, or
          his frame and behavior during the whole of that long season wherein he
          looked death in the face.
        </p>
        <p>
          His convictions of sin, preceding his first consolations in Christ (as
          appears by a written account he has left of his inward exercises and
          experiences), were exceeding deep and thorough. His trouble and
          exercise of mind, through a sense of guilt and misery, very great and
          long-continued, but yet sound and solid, consisting in no unsteady,
          violent and unaccountable hurries and frights, and strange
          perturbations of mind, but arising from the most serious
          consideration, and proper illumination of the conscience to discern
          and consider the true state of things. And the light let into his mind
          at conversion, and the influences and exercises that his mind was
          subject to at that time, appear very agreeable to reason and the
          gospel of Jesus Christ. The change [was] very great and remarkable,
          without any appearance of strong impressions on the imagination,
          sudden flights and pangs of the affections, and vehement emotions in
          animal nature, but attended with proper intellectual views of the
          supreme glory of the Divine Being, consisting in the infinite dignity
          and beauty of the perfections of his nature, and of the transcendent
          excellency of the way of salvation by Christ. — This was about eight
          years ago, when he was about twenty-one years of age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus God sanctified and made meet for his use, that vessel which he
          intended to make of eminent honor in his house, and which he had made
          of large capacity, having endowed him with very uncommon abilities and
          gifts of nature. He was a singular instance of a ready invention,
          natural eloquence, easy flowing expression, sprightly apprehension,
          quick discerning, and a very strong memory, and yet of a very
          penetrating genius, close and clear thought, and piercing judgment. He
          had an exact taste. His understanding was quick, strong and
          distinguishing.
        </p>
        <p>
          His learning was very considerable, for which he had a great taste,
          and applied himself to his studies in so close a manner when he was at
          college, that he much injured his health, and was obliged on that
          account for a while to leave his studies and return home. He was
          esteemed one that excelled in learning in that society.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had an extraordinary knowledge of men, as well as things, had a
          great insight into human nature, and excelled most that ever I knew in
          a communicative faculty. He had a peculiar talent at accommodating
          himself to the capacities, tempers and circumstances of those whom he
          would instruct or counsel.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had extraordinary gifts for the pulpit. I never had opportunity to
          hear him preach, but have often heard him pray. I think his manner of
          addressing himself to God, and expressing himself before him, in that
          duty, almost inimitable, such (so far as I may judge) as I have very
          rarely known equaled. He expressed himself with that exact propriety
          and pertinency, in such significant, weighty, pungent expressions,
          with that decent appearance of sincerity, reverence, and solemnity,
          and great distance from all affectation, as forgetting the presence of
          men, and as being in the immediate presence of a great and holy God,
          that I have scarcely ever known paralleled. And his manner of
          preaching, by what I have often heard of it from good judges, was no
          less excellent: being clear and instructive, natural, nervous,
          forcible, and moving, and very searching and convincing. — He rejected
          with disgust an affected noisiness, and violent boisterousness in the
          pulpit, and yet much disrelished a flat, cold delivery, when the
          subject of discourse, and matter delivered, required affection and
          earnestness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only had he excellent talents for the study and the pulpit, but
          also for conversation. He was of a sociable disposition and was
          remarkably free, entertaining, and profitable in ordinary discourse,
          and had much of a faculty of disputing, defending truth and confuting
          error.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he excelled in his judgment and knowledge of things in general, so
          especially in divinity. He was truly, for one of his standing, an
          extraordinary divine. But above all, in matters relating to
          experimental religion. In this, I know I have the concurring opinion
          of some who have had a name for persons of the best judgment. And
          according to what ability I have to judge things of this nature, and
          according to my opportunities, which of late have been very great, I
          never knew his equal, of his age and standing, for clear, accurate
          notions of the nature and essence of true religion, and its
          distinctions from its various false appearances, which I suppose to be
          owing to these three things meeting together in him: the strength of
          his natural genius, the great opportunities he had of observing
          others, in various parts, both white people and Indians, and his own
          great experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          His experiences of the holy influences of God’s Spirit were not only
          great at his first conversion, but they were so in a continued course,
          from that time forward, as appears by a private journal which he kept
          of his daily inward exercises from the time of his conversion until he
          was disabled by the failing of his strength, a few days before his
          death. The change which he looked upon as his conversion, was not
          merely a great change of the present views, affections, and frame of
          his mind, but also the beginning of that work of God on his heart,
          which God carried on from that time to his dying day. He greatly
          abhorred the way of such as live on their first work, as though they
          had now got through their work, and are thenceforward, by degrees,
          settled in a cold, lifeless, negligent, worldly frame. He had an ill
          opinion of such persons’ religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          His experiences were very diverse from many things that have lately
          obtained the reputation, with multitudes, of the very height of
          Christian experience. About the time that the false religion, which
          arises chiefly from impressions on the imagination, began first to
          make a very great appearance in the land, he was for a little while
          deceived with it, so as to think highly of it. And though he knew he
          never had such experiences as others told of, he thought it was
          because others’ attainments were beyond his, and so coveted them and
          sought after them but could never obtain them. He told me that he
          never had what is called an impulse, or a strong impression of his
          imagination, in things of religion, in his life. But [he] owned that
          during the short time that he thought well of these things, he was
          tinged with that spirit of false zeal that is wont to attend them. But
          said that then he was not in his element, but as a fish out of water.
          And when, after a little while, he came clearly to see the vanity and
          perniciousness of such things. It cost him abundance of sorrow and
          distress of mind, and to my knowledge he afterwards freely and openly
          confessed the errors in conduct that he had run into, and laid himself
          low before them whom he had offended. And since his conviction of his
          error in those respects, he has ever had a peculiar abhorrence of that
          kind of bitter zeal, and those delusive experiences that have been the
          principal source of it. He detested enthusiasm in all its forms and
          operations, and abhorred whatever in opinion or experience seemed to
          verge towards antinomianism, as the experiences of those whose first
          faith consists in believing that Christ died for them in particular,
          and their first love, in loving God, because they supposed they were
          the objects of his love. Their assurance of their good estate [was]
          from some immediate testimony or suggestion, either with or without
          texts of Scripture, that their sins are forgiven, that God loves them,
          etc. and the joys of such as rejoiced more in their own supposed
          distinction from others, in honor, and privileges, and high
          experiences, than in God’s excellency and Christ’s beauty: the
          spiritual pride of such laymen, [who] are for setting up themselves as
          public teachers, and cry down human learning, and a learned ministry.
          He greatly disliked a disposition in persons to much noise and show in
          religion, and affecting to be abundant in publishing and proclaiming
          their own experience. Though he did not condemn, but approved of
          Christians speaking of their experiences, on some occasions, and to
          some persons, with modesty, discretion, and reserve. He abominated the
          spirit and practice of the generality of the Separatists in this land.
          I heard him say, once and again, that he had been much with this kind
          of people, and was acquainted with many of them, in various parts, and
          that by this acquaintance, he knew that what was chiefly and most
          generally in repute amongst them, as the power of godliness, was
          entirely a different thing from that vital piety recommended in the
          Scripture, and had nothing in it of that nature. He never was more
          full in condemning these things than in his last illness, and after he
          ceased to have any expectation of life. [This was] particularly when
          he had the greatest and nearest views of approaching eternity, and
          several times, when he thought himself actually dying, and expected in
          a few minutes to be in the eternal world, as he himself told me.
        </p>
        <p>
          As his inward experiences appear to have been of the right kind, and
          were very remarkable as to their degree, so was his outward behavior
          and practice agreeable. He in his whole course acted as one who had
          indeed sold all for Christ, and had entirely devoted himself to God,
          and made his glory his highest end, and was fully determined to spend
          his whole time and strength in his service. He was lively in religion,
          in the right way: lively, not only, nor chiefly, with his tongue, in
          professing and talking, but lively in the work and business of
          religion. He was not one of those who are for contriving ways to shun
          the cross, and get to heaven with ease and sloth, but was such an
          instance of one living a life of labor and self-denial, and spending
          his strength and substance in pursuing that great end, and the glory
          of his Redeemer, that perhaps is scarcely to be paralleled in this age
          in these parts of the world. Much of this may be perceived by anyone
          that reads his printed journal, but much more has been learned by long
          intimate acquaintance with him, and by looking into his diary since
          his death, which he purposely concealed in what he published.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as his desires and labors for the advancement of Christ’s kingdom
          were great, so was his success. God was pleased to make him the
          instrument of bringing to pass the most remarkable things among the
          poor savages — in enlightening, awakening, reforming, and changing
          their disposition and manners, and wonderfully transforming them —
          that perhaps can be produced in these latter ages of the world. An
          account of this has been given the public in his journals, drawn up by
          order of the Honorable Society in Scotland, that employed him, which I
          would recommend to the perusal of all such as take pleasure in the
          wonderful works of God’s grace, and would read that which will
          peculiarly tend both to entertain and profit a Christian mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          No less extraordinary than the things already mentioned of him in
          life, was his constant calmness, peace, assurance, and joy in God,
          during the long time he looked death in the face, without the least
          hope of recovery: continuing without interruption to the last, while
          his distemper very sensibly preyed upon his vitals, from day to day,
          and oft brought him to that state in which he looked upon himself, and
          was thought by others, to be dying. The thoughts of approaching death
          never seemed in the least to damp, but rather to encourage him, and
          exhilarate his mind. And the nearer death approached, the more
          desirous he seemed to be of it. He said, not long before his death,
          that “the consideration of the day of death, and the day of judgment,
          had a long time been peculiarly sweet to him.” And at another time,
          that “he could not but think of the meetness there was in throwing
          such a rotten carcass as his into the grave: it seemed to him to be
          the right way of disposing of it.” He often used the epithet glorious,
          when speaking of the day of his death, calling it that glorious day.
          On a sabbath day morning, September 27, feeling an unusual appetite to
          food, and looking on it as a sign of approaching death, he said, “he
          should look on it as a favor, if this might be his dying day, and he
          longed for the time.” He had before expressed himself desirous of
          seeing his brother again, whose return had been expected from the
          Jerseys, but then (speaking of him) he said, “I am willing to go, and
          never see him again: I care not what I part with, to be for ever with
          the Lord.” Being asked, that morning, how he did? He answered, “I am
          almost in eternity: God knows, I long to be there. My work is done; I
          have done with all my friends; all the world is nothing to me.” On the
          evening of the next day, when he thought himself dying, and was
          apprehended to be so by others, and he could utter himself only by
          broken whispers, he often repeated the word Eternity; and said, “I
          shall soon be with the holy angels. — He will come; he will not
          tarry.” He told me one night, as he went to bed, that “he expected to
          die that night.” And added, “I am not at all afraid, I am willing to
          go this night, if it be the will of God. Death is what I long for.” He
          sometimes expressed himself as “nothing to do but to die: and being
          willing to go that minute, if it was the will of God.” He sometimes
          used that expression, “O why is his chariot so long in coming.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He seemed to have remarkable exercises of resignation to the will of
          God. He once told me, that “he had longed for the outpouring of the
          Holy Spirit of God, and the glorious times of the church, and hoped
          they were coming; and should have been willing to have lived to
          promote religion at that time, if that had been the will of God. But
          (says he) I am willing it should be as it is: I would not have the
          choice to make myself for ten thousand worlds.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He several times spoke of the different kinds of willingness to die,
          and spoke of it as an ignoble mean kind, to be willing, only to get
          rid of pain, or to go to heaven only to get honor and advancement
          there. His own longings for death seemed to be quite of a different
          kind, and for nobler ends. When he was first taken with something like
          a diarrhea, which is looked upon as one of the last and most fatal
          symptoms in a consumption, he said, “O now the glorious time is
          coming? I have longed to serve God perfectly; and God will gratify
          these desires.” And at one time and another, in the latter part of his
          illness, he uttered these expressions. “My heaven is to please God,
          and glorify him, and give all to him, and to be wholly devoted to his
          glory. — That is the heaven I long for. That is my religion, and that
          is my happiness, and always was, ever since I supposed I had any true
          religion. All those that are of that religion, shall meet me in
          heaven. I do not go to heaven to be advanced, but to give honor to
          God. It is no matter where I shall be stationed in heaven, whether I
          have a high or low seat there, but to love, and please, and glorify
          God. If I had a thousand souls, if they were worth anything, I would
          give them all to God: but I have nothing to give, when all is done. It
          is impossible for any rational creature to be happy without acting all
          for God. God himself could not make me happy any other way. — I long
          to be in heaven, praising and glorifying God with the holy angels; all
          my desire is to glorify God. — My heart goes out to the burying place,
          it seems to me a desirable place: But O to glorify God! That is it!
          That is above all! — It is a great comfort to me to think that I have
          done a little for God in the world: It is but a very small matter; yet
          I have done a little; and I lament it, that I have not done more for
          him. — There is nothing in the world worth living for, but doing good,
          and finishing God’s work, doing the work that Christ did. I see
          nothing else in the world that can yield any satisfaction, besides
          living to God, pleasing him, and doing his whole will. My greatest joy
          and comfort has been to do something for promoting the interest of
          religion, and the souls of particular persons.”
        </p>
        <p>
          After he came to be in so low a state, that he ceased to have the
          least expectation of recovery, his mind was peculiarly carried forth
          with earnest concern for the prosperity of the church of God on earth,
          which seemed very manifestly to arise from a pure disinterested love
          to Christ, and desire of his glory. The prosperity of Zion, was a
          theme he dwelt much upon, and of which he spoke much, and more and
          more, the nearer death approached. He told me when near his end, that
          “he never, in all his life, had his mind so led forth in desires and
          earnest prayers for the flourishing of Christ’s kingdom on earth, as
          since he was brought so exceeding low at Boston.” He seemed much to
          wonder that there appeared no more disposition in ministers and people
          to pray for the flourishing of religion through the world. And
          particularly, he several times expressed his wonder, that there
          appeared no more forwardness to comply with the proposal lately made
          from Scotland, for united extraordinary prayer among God’s people, for
          the coming of Christ’s kingdom, and sent it as his dying advice to his
          own congregation, that they should practice agreeably to that
          proposal.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little before his death, he said to me, as I came into the room, “My
          thoughts have been employed on the old dear theme, the prosperity of
          God’s church on earth. As I waked out of sleep (said he) I was led to
          cry for the pouring out of God’s Spirit, and the advancement of
          Christ’s kingdom, which the dear Redeemer did and suffered so much
          for: it is that especially makes me long for it.” — But a few days
          before his death, he desired us to sing a psalm concerning the
          prosperity of Zion, which he signified his mind was engaged in above
          all things. At his desire we sang a part of the 102nd Psalm. And when
          we had done, though he was then so low that he could scarcely speak,
          he so exerted himself, that he made a prayer, very audibly, wherein,
          besides praying for those present, and for his own congregation, he
          earnestly prayed for the reviving and flourishing of religion in the
          world. His own congregation especially lay much on his heart. He often
          spoke of them, and commonly when he did so, it was with extraordinary
          tenderness, so that his speech was interrupted and drowned with
          weeping.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have endeavored to represent something of the character and
          behavior of that excellent servant of Christ, whose funeral is now to
          be attended. Though I have done it very imperfectly; yet I have
          endeavored to do it faithfully, and as in the presence and fear of
          God, without flattery; which surely is to be abhorred in ministers of
          the gospel, when speaking as messengers of the Lord of Hosts. Such
          reason have we to be satisfied that the person spoken of, now he is
          absent from the body, is present with the Lord, and now wearing a
          crown of glory, of distinguished brightness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And how much is there in the consideration of such an example, and so
          blessed an end, to excite us, who are yet alive, with the greatest
          diligence and earnestness, to improve the time of life, that we also
          may go to be with Christ, when we forsake the body! The time is
          coming, and will soon come, we know not how soon, when we must take
          leave of all things here below, to enter on a fixed unalterable state
          in the eternal world. O, how well is it worth the while to labor and
          suffer, and deny ourselves, to lay up in store a good foundation of
          support and supply, against that time! How much is such a peace as we
          have heard of, worth at such a time. And how dismal would it be, to be
          in such circumstances, under the outward distresses of a consuming,
          dissolving frame, and looking death in the face from day to day, with
          hearts uncleansed, and sin unpardoned, under a dreadful load of guilt
          and divine wrath, having much sorrow and wrath in our sickness, and
          nothing to comfort and support our minds: nothing before us but a
          speedy appearance before the judgment seat of an almighty, infinitely
          holy, and angry God, and an endless eternity in suffering his wrath
          without mercy! The person we have been speaking of, had a great sense
          of this. He said, not long before his death, “It is sweet to me to
          think of eternity: the endlessness of it makes it sweet. But, oh, what
          shall I say to the eternity of the wicked! I cannot mention it, nor
          think of it! — The thought is too dreadful!” At another time, speaking
          of a heart devoted to God and his glory, he said, “O of what
          importance is it to have such a frame of mind, such a heart as this,
          when we come to die! It is this now that gives me peace.”
        </p>
        <p>
          How much is there, in particular, in the things that have been
          observed of this eminent minister of Christ, to excite us, who are
          called to the same great work of the gospel ministry, to earnest care
          and endeavors, that we may be in like manner faithful in our work,
          that we may be filled with the same spirit, animated with the like
          pure and fervent flame of love to God, and the like earnest concern to
          advance the kingdom and glory of our Lord and Master and the
          prosperity of Zion! How amiable did these principles render this
          servant of Christ in his life, and how blessed in his end! The time
          will soon come, when we also must leave our earthly tabernacles, and
          go to our Lord that sent us to labor in his harvest, to render an
          account of ourselves to him. O how does it concern us so to run as not
          uncertainly, so to fight, not as those that beat the air! And should
          not what we have heard excite us to depend on God for his help and
          assistance in our great work, and to be much in seeking the influences
          of his Spirit, and success in our labors, by fasting and prayer, in
          which the person spoken of was abundant? This practice he earnestly
          recommended on his deathbed, from his own experience of its great
          benefits, to some candidates for the ministry that stood by his
          bedside. He was often speaking of the great need ministers have of
          much of the Spirit of Christ in their work, and how little good they
          are like to do without it, and how, “when ministers were under the
          special influences of the Spirit of God, it assisted them to come at
          the consciences of men, and (as he expressed it) as it were to handle
          them with hands: whereas, without the Spirit of God, said he, whatever
          reason and oratory we make use of, we do but make use of stumps,
          instead of hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh that the things that were seen and heard in this extraordinary
          person, his holiness, heavenliness, labor and self-denial in life, his
          so remarkably devoting himself and his all, in heart and practice, to
          the glory of God, and the wonderful frame of mind manifested in so
          steadfast a manner under the expectation of death, and the pains and
          agonies that brought it on, may excite in us all, both ministers and
          people, a due sense of the greatness of the work we have to do in the
          world, the excellency and amiability of thorough religion in
          experience and practice, and the blessedness of the end of such a
          life, and the infinite value of their eternal reward, when absent from
          the body and present with the Lord; and effectually stir us up to
          endeavors, that in the way of such a holy life, we may at least come
          to so blessed an end. — Amen.
