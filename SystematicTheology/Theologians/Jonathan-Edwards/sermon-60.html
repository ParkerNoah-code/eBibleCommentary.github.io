          Psalm 73:25, “Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon
          earth that I desire besides thee.”
        </p>
        <p>
          IN this psalm, the psalmist (Asaph) relates the great difficulty which
          existed in his own mind, from the consideration of the wicked. He
          observes, verses 2 and 3, “As for me, my feet were almost gone; my
          steps had well nigh slipped. For I was envious at the foolish, when I
          saw the prosperity of the wicked.” In the 4th and following verses, he
          informs us, what in the wicked was his temptation. In the first place,
          he observed, that they were prosperous, and all things went well with
          them. He then observed their behavior in their prosperity, and the use
          which they made of it; and that God, notwithstanding such abuse,
          continued their prosperity. Then he tells us by what means he was
          helped out of this difficulty, viz. by going into the sanctuary,
          verses 16, 17. And [he] proceeds to inform us what considerations they
          were which helped him, viz. — (1.) The consideration of the miserable
          end of wicked men. However they prosper for the present, yet they come
          to a woeful end at last, verses 18-20. — (2). The consideration of the
          blessed end of the saints. Although the saints, while they live, may
          be afflicted, yet they come to a happy end at last, verses 21-24. —
          (3.) The consideration, that the godly have much better portion than
          the wicked, even though they have no other portion but God; as in the
          text and following verse. Though the wicked are in prosperity, [they]
          are not in trouble as other men. Yet the godly, though in affliction,
          are in a state infinitely better, because they have God for their
          portion. They need desire nothing else. He that hath God, hath all.
          Thus the psalmist professes the sense and apprehension which he had of
          things: Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
          that I desire besides thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the verse immediately preceding, the psalmist takes notice how the
          saints are happy in God, both when they are in this world, and also
          when they are taken to another. They are blessed in God in this world,
          in that he guides them by his counsel. And when he takes them out of
          it, they are still happy, in that then he receives them to glory. This
          probably led him, in the text, to declare that he desired no other
          portion, either in this world or in that to come, either in heaven or
          upon earth. — Whence we learn, That it is the spirit of a truly godly
          man, to prefer God before all other things, either in heaven or on
          earth.
        </p>
        <p>I. A godly man prefers God before anything else in heaven.</p>
        <p>
          First, he prefers God before anything else that actually is in heaven.
          Every godly man hath his heart in heaven; his affections are mainly
          set on what is to be had there. Heaven is his chosen country and
          inheritance. He hath respect to heaven, as a traveler, who is in a
          distant land, hath to his own country. The traveler can content
          himself to be in a strange land for a while, but his own native land
          is preferred by him to all others: Heb. 11:13, etc. “These all died in
          faith, not having received the promises, but were persuaded of them,
          and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims
          on the earth. For they that say such things, declare plainly that they
          seek a country. And truly if they had been mindful of that country
          from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have
          returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly.”
          — The respect which a godly person hath to heaven may be compared to
          the respect which a child, when he is abroad, hath to his father’s
          house. He can be contented abroad for a little while; but the place to
          which he desires to return, and in which to dwell, is his own home.
          Heaven is the true saint’s Father’s house: John 14:2, “In my Father’s
          house are many mansions.” John 20:17, “I ascend to my Father and your
          Father.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the main reason why the godly man hath his heart thus to heaven
          is because God is there; that is the palace of the Most High. It is
          the place where God is gloriously present, where his love is
          gloriously manifested, where the godly may be with him, see him as he
          is, and love, serve, praise, and enjoy him perfectly. If God and
          Christ were not in heaven, he would not be so earnest in seeking it,
          nor would he take so much pains in a laborious travel through this
          wilderness, nor would the consideration that he is going to heaven
          when he dies, be such a comfort to him under toils and afflictions.
          The martyrs would not undergo cruel sufferings, from their
          persecutors, with a cheerful prospect of going to heaven, did they not
          expect to be with Christ, and to enjoy God there. They would not with
          that cheerfulness forsake all their earthly possessions, and all their
          earthly friends, as many thousands of them have done, and wander about
          in poverty and banishment, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, in
          hopes of exchanging their earthly for a heavenly inheritance, were it
          not that they hope to be with their glorious Redeemer and heavenly
          Father. — The believer’s heart is in heaven, because his treasure is
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, a godly man prefers God before anything else that might be in
          heaven. Not only is there nothing actually in heaven, which is in his
          esteem equal with God; but neither is there any of which he can
          conceive as possible to be there, which by him is esteemed and desired
          equally with God. Some suppose quite different enjoyments to be in
          heaven, from those which the Scriptures teach us. The Mahometans, for
          instance, suppose that in heaven are to be enjoyed all manner of
          sensual delights and pleasures. Many things which Mahomet has feigned
          are to the lusts and carnal appetites of men the most agreeable that
          he could devise, and with them he flattered his followers. — But the
          true saint could not contrive one more agreeable to his inclination
          and desires, than such as is revealed in the Word of God; a heaven of
          enjoying the glorious God, and the Lord Jesus Christ. There he shall
          have all sin taken away, and shall be perfectly conformed to God, and
          shall spend an eternity in exalted exercises of love to him, and in
          the enjoyment of his love. If God were not to be enjoyed in heaven,
          but only vast wealth, immense treasures of silver, and gold, great
          honor of such kind as men obtain in this world, and a fullness of the
          greatest sensual delights and pleasures; all these things would not
          make up for the want of God and Christ, and the enjoyment of them
          there. If it were empty of God, it would indeed be an empty melancholy
          place. — The godly have been made sensible, as to all
          creature-enjoyments, that they cannot satisfy the soul; and therefore
          nothing will content them but God. Offer a saint what you will, [but]
          if you deny him God, he will esteem himself miserable. God is the
          center of his desires; and as long as you keep his soul from its
          proper center, it will not be at rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. It is the temper of a godly man to prefer God before all other
          things on the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the saint prefers that enjoyment of God, for which he hopes
          hereafter, to anything in this world. He looketh not so much at the
          things which are seen and temporal, as at those which are unseen and
          eternal, 2 Cor. 4:18. It is but a little of God that the saint enjoys
          in this world. He hath but a little acquaintance with God, and enjoys
          but a little of the manifestations of the divine glory and love. But
          God hath promised to give him Himself hereafter in a full enjoyment.
          And these promises are more precious to the saint, than the most
          precious earthly jewels. The gospel contains greater treasures, in his
          esteem, than the cabinets of princes, or the mines of the Indies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the saints prefer what of God may be obtained in this life
          before all things in the world. There is a great difference in the
          present spiritual attainments of the saints. Some attain to much
          greater acquaintance and communion with God, and conformity to him,
          than others. But the highest attainments are very small in comparison
          with what is future. The saints are capable of making progress in
          spiritual attainments, and they earnestly desire such further
          attainments. Not contented with those degrees to which they have
          already attained, they hunger and thirst after righteousness, and, as
          newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that they may grow
          thereby. It is their desire, to know more of God, to have more of his
          image, and to be enabled more to imitate God and Christ in their walk
          and conversation. Psa. 27:4, “One thing have I desired of the Lord,
          that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
          the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire
          in his temple.” Psa. 42:1, 2, “As the hart panteth after the
          water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth
          for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?”
          Psa. 63:1, 2, “O God, thou art my God, early will I seek thee: my soul
          thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty
          land, where no water is; to see thy power and thy glory, so as I have
          seen thee in the sanctuary.” See also Psa. 84:1, 2, 3 and Psa. 130:6,
          “My soul waiteth for the Lord, more than they that watch for the
          morning; I say, more than they that watch for the morning.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Though every saint has not this longing desire after God to the same
          degree that the psalmist had, yet they are all of the same spirit.
          They earnestly desire to have more of his presence in their hearts.
          That this is the temper of the godly in general, and not of some
          particular saints only, appears from Isa. 26:8, 9, where not any
          particular saint, but the church in general speaks thus: “Yea, in the
          way of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee; the desire of
          our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. With my soul
          have I desired thee in the night, and with my spirit within me will I
          seek thee early.” See also Song 3:1, 2, 6, 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          The saints are not always in the lively exercise of grace, but such a
          spirit they have, and sometimes they have the sensible exercise of it.
          They desire God and divine attainments, more than all earthly things;
          and seek to be rich in grace, more than they do to get earthly riches.
          They desire the honor which is of God, more than that which is of men,
          John 5:44, and communion with him, more than any earthly pleasures.
          They are of the same spirit which the apostle expresses, Phil. 3:8,
          “Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but loss, for the excellency
          of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, and do count them but dung
          that I may win Christ.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, the saint prefers what he hath already of God before anything
          in this world. That which was infused into his heart at his
          conversion, it more precious to him than anything which the world can
          afford. The views which are sometimes given him of the beauty and
          excellency of God, are more precious to him than all the treasures of
          the wicked. The relation of a child in which he stands to God, the
          union which there is between his soul and Jesus Christ, he values more
          than the greatest earthly dignity. That image of God which is
          enstamped on his soul, he values more than any earthly ornaments. It
          is, in his esteem, better to be adorned with the graces of God’s Holy
          Spirit, than to be made to shine in jewels of gold, and the most
          costly pearls, or to be admired for the greatest external beauty. He
          values the robe of Christ’s righteousness, which he hath on his soul,
          more than the robes of princes. The spiritual pleasures and delights
          which he sometimes has in God, he prefers far before all the pleasures
          of sin. Psa. 84:10, “A day in thy courts is better than a thousand: I
          had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God, than to dwell in the
          tents of wickedness.”
        </p>
        <p>
          A saint thus prefers God before all other things in this world — 1. As
          he prefers God before anything else that he possesses in the world.
          Whatever temporal enjoyments he has, he prefers God to them all. Psa.
          16:5, 6, “The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup:
          thou maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen to me in pleasant
          places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.” If he be rich, he chiefly sets
          his heart on his heavenly riches. He prefers God before any earthly
          friend, and the divine favor before any respect shown him by his
          fellow-creatures. Although inadvertently, these have room in his
          heart, and too much room; yet he reserves the throne for God; Luke
          14:26, “If man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and
          wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life
          also, he cannot be my disciple.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He prefers God before any earthly enjoyment of which he hath a
          prospect. The children of men commonly set their hearts more on some
          earthly happiness for which they hope, and after which they are
          seeking, than on what they have in present possession. But a godly man
          prefers God to anything which he has in prospect in this world. He
          may, indeed, through the prevalence of corruption, be for a season
          carried away with some enjoyment. However, he will again come to
          himself. This is not the temper of the man; he is of another spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is the spirit of a godly man to prefer God to any earthly
          enjoyments of which he can conceive. He not only prefers him to
          anything which he now possesses, but he sees nothing possessed by any
          of his fellow-creatures, so estimable. Could he have as much worldly
          prosperity as he would, could he have earthly things just to his mind,
          and agreeable to his inclination; he values the portion which he has
          in God, incomparably more. He prefers Christ to earthly kingdoms.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          First, hence we may learn, that whatever changes a godly man passes
          through, he is happy; because God, who is unchangeable, is his chosen
          portion. Though he meet with temporal losses, and be deprived of many,
          yea, of all his temporal enjoyments; yet God, whom he prefers before
          all, still remains, and cannot be lost. While he stays in this
          changeable, troublesome world, he is happy; because his chosen
          portion, on which he builds as his main foundation for happiness, is
          above the world, and above all changes. And when he goes into another
          world, still he is happy, because that portion yet remains. Whatever
          he be deprived of, he cannot be deprived of his chief portion; his
          inheritance remains sure to him. — Could worldly-minded men find out a
          way to secure to themselves those earthly enjoyments on which they
          mainly set their hearts, so that they could not be lost nor impaired
          while they live, how great would they account the privilege, though
          other things which they esteem in a less degree, were liable to the
          same uncertainty as they now are! Whereas now, those earthly
          enjoyments, on which men chiefly set their hearts, are often most
          fading. But how great is the happiness of those who have chosen the
          Fountain of all good, who prefer him before all things in heaven or on
          earth, and who can never be deprived of him to all eternity!
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, let all by these things examine and try themselves, whether
          they be saints or not. As this which hath been exhibited is the spirit
          of the saints, so it is peculiar to them. None can use the language of
          the text, and say, Whom have I in heaven but thee? there is none upon
          earth that I desire besides thee, but the saints. A man’s choice is
          that which determines his state. He that chooses God for his portion,
          and prefers him to all other things, is a godly man, for he chooses
          and worships him as God. To respect him as God, is to respect him
          above all other things. And if any man respect Him as his God, his God
          he is. There is an union and covenant relation between that man and
          the true God. — Every man is as his God is. If you would know what a
          man is, whether he be a godly man or not, you must inquire what his
          God is. If the true God be he to whom he hath a supreme respect, whom
          he regards above all; he is doubtless a servant of the true God. But
          if the man have something else to which he pays a greater respect than
          to Jehovah, he is not a godly man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inquire, therefore, how it is with you, — whether you prefer God
          before all other things. It may sometimes be a difficulty for persons
          to determine this to their satisfaction. The ungodly may be deluded
          with false affections; the godly in dull frames may be at a loss about
          it. Therefore you may try yourselves, as to this matter, several ways;
          if you cannot speak fully to one thing, yet you may perhaps to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. What is it which chiefly makes you desire to go to heaven when you
          die? Indeed some have no great desire to go to heaven. They do not
          care to go to hell; but if they could be safe from that, they would
          not much concern themselves about heaven. If it be not so with you,
          but you find that you have a desire after heaven, then inquire what it
          is for. Is the main reason, that you may be with God, have communion
          with him, and be conformed to him? that you may see God, and enjoy him
          there? Is this the consideration which keeps your hearts, and your
          desires, and your expectations towards heaven?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If you could avoid death, and might have your free choice, would
          you choose to live always in this world, without God, rather than in
          his time to leave the world, in order to be with him? If you might
          live here in earthly prosperity to all eternity, but destitute of the
          presence of God and communion with him — having no spiritual
          intercourse between him and your souls, God and you being strangers to
          each other for ever — would you choose this rather than to leave the
          world, in order to dwell in heaven, as the children of God, there to
          enjoy the glorious privileges of children, in holy and perfect love to
          God, and enjoyment of him to all eternity?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Do you prefer Christ to all others as the way to heaven? He who
          truly chooses God, prefers him in each person of the Trinity, Father,
          Son, and Holy Ghost: the Father, as his Father; the Son as his Savior;
          the Holy Ghost, as his Sanctifier. Inquire, therefore, not only
          whether you choose the enjoyment of God in heaven as your highest
          portion and happiness, but also whether you choose Jesus Christ before
          all others, as your way to heaven. And that in a sense of the
          excellency of Christ, and of the way of salvation by him, as being
          that which is to the glory of Christ, and of sovereign grace. Is the
          way of free grace, by the blood and righteousness of the blessed and
          glorious Redeemer, the most excellent way to life in your esteem? Doth
          it add a value to the heavenly inheritance, that it is conferred in
          this way? Is this far better to you than to be saved by your own
          righteousness, by any of your own performances, or by any other
          mediator?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If you might go to heaven in what course you please, would you
          prefer to all others the way of a strict walk with God? They who
          prefer God as hath been represented, choose him, not only in the end,
          but in the way. They had rather be with God than with any other, not
          only when they come to the end of their journey, but also while they
          are in their pilgrimage. They choose the way of walking with God,
          though it be a way of labor, and care, and self-denial, rather than a
          way of sin, though it be a way of sloth, and of gratifying their
          lusts.

          5. Were you to spend your eternity in this world, would you choose
          rather to live in mean and low circumstances with the gracious
          presence of God, than to live for ever in earthly prosperity without
          him? Would you rather spend it in holy living, and serving and walking
          with God, and in the enjoyment of the privileges of his children? God
          often manifesting himself to you as your Father, discovering to you
          his glory, and manifesting his love, lifting the light of his
          countenance upon you! Would you rather choose these things, though in
          poverty, than to abound in worldly things, and to live in ease and
          prosperity, at the same time being an alien from the common wealth of
          Israel? Could you be content to stand in no child-like relation to
          God, enjoying no gracious intercourse with him, having no right to be
          acknowledged by him as his children? Or would such a life as this,
          though in ever so great earthly prosperity, be esteemed by you a
          miserable life?
        </p>
        <p>
          If, after all, there remain with you doubts, and a difficulty to
          determine concerning yourselves whether you do truly and sincerely
          prefer God to all other things, I would mention two things which are
          the surest ways to be determined in this matter, and which seem to be
          the best grounds of satisfaction in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The feeling of some particular, strong, and lively exercise of
          such a spirit. A person may have such a spirit as is spoken of in the
          doctrine, and may have the exercise of it in a low degree, and yet
          remain in doubt whether he have it or not, and be unable to come to a
          satisfying determination. But God is pleased sometimes to give such
          discoveries of his glory, and of the excellency of Christ, as do so
          draw forth the heart, that they know beyond all doubt, that they feel
          such a spirit as Paul spoke of, when he said, “he counted all things
          but loss for the excellency of Christ Jesus his Lord;” and they can
          boldly say, as in the text, “Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there
          is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.” At such times the
          people of God do not need any help of ministers to satisfy them
          whether they have the true love of God. They plainly see and feel it;
          and the Spirit of God then witnesseth with their spirits, that they
          are the children of God. — Therefore, if you would be satisfied upon
          this point, earnestly seek such attainments; seek that you may have
          such clear and lively exercises of this spirit. To this end, you must
          labor to grow in grace. Though you have had such experiences in times
          past, and they satisfied you then, yet you may again doubt. You should
          therefore seek that you may have them more frequently; and the way to
          that is, earnestly to press forward, that you may have more
          acquaintance with God, and have the principles of grace strengthened.
          This is the way to have the exercises of grace stronger, more lively,
          and more frequent, and so to be satisfied that you have a spirit of
          supreme love to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The other way is to inquire whether you prefer God to all other
          things in practice, i.e. when you have occasion to manifest by your
          practice which you prefer — when you must either cleave to one or the
          other, and must either forsake other things, or forsake God — whether
          then it be your manner practically to prefer God to all other things
          whatever, even to those earthly things to which your hearts are most
          wedded. Are your lives those of adherence to God, and of serving him
          in this manner?
        </p>
        <p>
          He who sincerely prefers God to all other things in his heart, will do
          it in his practice. For when God and all other things come to stand in
          competition, that is the proper trial what a man chooses; and the
          manner of acting in such cases must certainly determine what the
          choice is in all free agents, or those who act on choice. Therefore
          there is no sign of sincerity so much insisted on in the Bible as
          this, that we deny ourselves, sell all, forsake the world, take up the
          cross, and follow Christ whithersoever he goeth. — Therefore, so run,
          not as uncertainly; so fight, not as those that beat the air; but keep
          under your bodies, and bring them into subjection. Act not as though
          you counted yourselves to have apprehended; but this one thing do,
          “forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto
          those things which are before, press toward the mark, for the prize of
          the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.” 2 Pet. 1:5, etc. “And
          besides this, giving diligence, add to your faith, virtue; and to
          virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance,
          patience; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly
          kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity. For if these things be
          in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor
          unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
