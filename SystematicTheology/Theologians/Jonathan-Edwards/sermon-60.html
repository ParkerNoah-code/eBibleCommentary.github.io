        <h2>
          Hope And Comfort Usually Follow Genuine Humiliation And Repentance –
          Hosea 2:15
        </h2>
        <p class="title">Dated September, 1737</p>
        <p>
          Hosea 2:15, “And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the
          valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in
          the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the
          land of Egypt.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context, the church of Israel is first threatened with the
          awful desolation which God was about to bring upon her for her dealing
          so falsely and treacherously with God; because though, in the bold
          language of the prophet, she had been married to God, she had yet gone
          after other lovers, and had committed adultery with them. “For she
          said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread, and my water,
          my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.” Therefore God threatened
          that he would strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was
          born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and
          slay her with thirst, and that he would discover her lewdness in the
          sight of her lovers, and destroy her vines and fig trees, and make
          them a forest. So the prophet goes on terribly threatening her to the
          end of the thirteenth verse. And those things were fulfilled in the
          captivity of Israel in the land of Assyria. But in the verse preceding
          the text, and in the remainder of the chapter, there follows a
          gracious promise of mercy, which God would show her in the days of the
          gospel. “Therefore, behold I will allure her, and bring her into the
          wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. And I will give her her
          vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and
          she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day
          when she came up out of the land of Egypt.” “I will allure her,” that
          is, I will court or woo her again, as a young man woos a virgin, whom
          he desires to make his wife. God, for her committing adultery with
          other lovers, had threatened that he would give her a bill of divorce,
          as verse second, “Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not my
          wife, neither am I her husband.” But here in the latter part of the
          chapter, God promises that in gospel times he would make her his wife
          again, as in the sixteenth verse, “And it shall be at that day that
          thou shalt call me Ishi;” that is “my husband.” And so in verse 19,
          20, “And I will betroth thee unto me for ever, yea, I will betroth
          thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, in loving-kindness,
          and in mercies; I will even betroth the unto me in faithfulness.” Here
          in the fourteenth verse, God promises that he will woo her, and in the
          latter part of the verse, he shows in what manner he will deal with
          her when he is about to woo or allure her. He would first bring her
          into the wilderness; that is, he would bring her into trouble and
          distress, and so humble her, and then allure her by speaking
          comfortably or pleasantly to her, as a young man does to a maid whom
          he woos. Then follow the words of the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We may observe what God would give to the children of Israel; viz.
          Hope and comfort. He promises to give her vineyards; which being
          spiritually interpreted as most of the prophecies of gospel times are
          to be interpreted, signifies spiritual comforts. Vineyards afford
          wine, which is comfort to those who are of heavy hearts. Pro. 31:6,
          “Give wine to those that are of heavy hearts.” Wine is to make glad
          the heart of man. Psa. 104:15. Gospel rest and peace are sometimes
          prophesied of, under the metaphor of every man’s sitting under his
          vine and under his own fig tree. God promises to give her hope, to
          open a door of hope for her, and to give her songs; that is, to give
          her spiritual joy, and both cause and disposition joyfully to sing
          praises to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We may observe after what manner God would bestow those benefits.
          First, they should be given after great trouble and abasement. Before
          she had this hope and comfort given, she should be brought into great
          trouble and distress to humble her. He promises to give her her
          vineyards from thence; that is, from the wilderness spoken of in the
          foregoing verse, into which it is said that God would bring her,
          before he spoke comfortably to her. God would bring her into the
          wilderness, and then give her vineyards. God’s bringing her into the
          wilderness was to humble her, and fit her to receive vineyards, and to
          make her see her dependence on God for them, that she might not
          attribute her enjoyment of them to her idols, as she had done before,
          for which reason God took them away, as in the twelfth verse, “And I
          will destroy her vines and her fig-trees, whereof she hath said, These
          are my rewards that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a
          forest.” There it is threatened that God will turn her vineyards into
          a forest, or wilderness. Here it is promises that he would turn the
          wilderness into vineyards, as Isa. 32:15, “Until the Spirit be poured
          on us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the
          fruitful field be counted for a forest.” She should first be in a
          wilderness, where she shall see that she cannot help herself, nor any
          of her idols help, or give her any vineyards. And then God will help
          her, that she shall see that it is God, and not any of her idols or
          lovers. God would first bring her into a wilderness, and thence give
          her vineyards, as God first brought the children of Israel into a
          dreadful wilderness. So God opened a door of hope to them in the
          valley of Achor, which is a word that signifies trouble, and was so
          called from the trouble which the children of Israel suffered by the
          sin of Achor. So God is wont first to make their sin a great trouble
          to them, an occasion of a great deal of distress, before he opens a
          door of hope. God promises to make her sing there as in the days of
          her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of
          Egypt. This plainly refers to the joyful song which Moses and the
          children of Israel sang when they came up out of the Red sea. The
          children of Israel there had great joy and comfort; but just before
          they had great trouble. They had been in extreme distress by the
          oppression of their taskmasters; and just before this triumphant song,
          they were brought to extremity and almost to despair, when Pharaoh and
          the Egyptians appeared ready to swallow them up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, this hope and comfort should be bestowed on the slaying and
          forsaking of sin. That is the troubler of the soul. It should be given
          in the valley of Achor, which was the valley where the troubler of
          Israel was slain as you may see in Jos. 7:26; and the place where the
          children of Israel sang, when they came up out of the land of Egypt.
          The eastern shore of the Red sea was the place where they saw their
          enemies and old taskmaster, the types of men’s lusts, which are
          sinners’ taskmasters, lie dead on the sea-shore, and of whom they took
          their final leave. And God had told them, that their enemies whom they
          had seen that day, they should see no more forever.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          God is wont to cause hope and comfort to arise in the soul after
          trouble and humbling for sin, and according as the troubler is slain
          and forsaken. I would show,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That it is thus with respect to the first true hope and comfort
          which is given to the soul at conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That God is wont to bestow hope and comfort on Christians from
          time to time in this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. God is wont to cause hope and comfort to arise to the soul in
          conversion after trouble and humbling for sin, and upon the slaying of
          the troubler.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it is God’s manner to bestow hope and comfort on a soul in
          conversion after trouble and humbling for sin. Under this head are
          three things to be observed. 1. The trouble itself. 2. The cause, viz.
          sin. 3.The humbling.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Souls are wont to be brought into trouble before God bestows true
          hope and comfort. The corrupt hearts of men naturally incline to
          stupidity and senselessness before God comes with the awakening
          influences of his Spirit. They are quiet and secure. They have no true
          comfort and hope, and yet they are quiet; they are at ease. They are
          in miserable slavery, and yet seek not a remedy. They say, as the
          children of Israel did in Egypt to Moses, “Let us alone, that we may
          serve the Egyptians.” But if God has a design of mercy to them, it is
          his manner before he bestows true hope and comfort on them, to bring
          them into trouble, to distress them, and spoil their ease and false
          quietness, and to rouse them out of their old resting and sleeping
          places, and to bring them into a wilderness. They are brought into
          great trouble and distress, so that they can take no comfort in those
          things in which they used to take comfort. Their hearts are pinched
          and stung, and they can find no ease in anything. They have, as it
          were, an arrow sticking fast in them, which causes grievous and
          continual pain, an arrow which they cannot shake off, or pull out. The
          pain and anguish of it drinks up their spirit. Their worldly
          enjoyments were a sufficient good before; but they are not now. They
          wander about with wounded hearts, seeking rest, and finding none; like
          one wandering in a dry and parched wilderness under the burning,
          scorching heat of the sun, seeking for some shadow where he may sit
          down and rest, but finding none. Wherever he goes the beams of the sun
          scorch him. Or he seeks some fountain of, cool water to quench his
          thirst, but finds not a drop. He is like David in his trouble, who
          wandered about in the wilderness, Saul pursuing him wherever he went,
          driving and hunting him from one wilderness to another, from one
          mountain to another, and from one cave to another, giving him no rest.
          To such sinners, all things look dark, and they know not what to do,
          nor whither to turn. If they look forward or backward, to the right
          hand or the left, all is gloom and perplexity. If they look to heaven,
          behold darkness. If they look to the earth, behold trouble, and
          darkness, and dimness of anguish. Sometimes they hope for relief, but
          they are disappointed, and so again and again they travail in pain,
          and a dreadful sound is in their ears. They are terrified and
          affrighted, and they seek refuge, as a poor creature pursued by an
          enemy. He flies to one refuge and there is beset, and that fails; then
          he flies to another, and then is driven out of that. And his enemies
          grow thicker and thicker about, encompassing him on every side. They
          are like those of whom we read in Isa. 24:17, 18. Fear, and the pit,
          and the snare are upon them, and when they flee from the noise of the
          fear they are taken in the pit; and if they come up out of the pit,
          they are taken in the snare. So that they know not what to do. They
          are like the children of Israel, while Achor troubled them. They go
          forth against their enemies, and they are smitten down and flee before
          them. They call on God, but he does not answer, nor seem to regard
          them. Sometimes they find something in which they take pleasure for a
          little time, but it soon vanishes away, and leaves them in greater
          distress than before. And sometimes they are brought to the very
          borders of despair. Thus they are brought into the wilderness, and
          into the valley of Achor, or of trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Sin is the trouble or the cause of this trouble. Sin is the disease
          of the soul, and such a disease as will, if the soul is not benumbed,
          cause exceeding pain. Sin brings guilt, and that brings condemnation
          and wrath. All this trouble arises from conviction of sin. Awakened
          sinners are convinced that they are sinful. Before the sinner thought
          well of himself, or was not convinced that he was very sinful. But now
          he is led to reflect first on what he has done, how wickedly he has
          spent his time, what wicked acts or practices he has been guilty of.
          And afterwards in the progress of his awakenings, he is made sensible
          of something of the sin and plague of his heart. They are made
          sensible of the guilt and wrath which sin brings. The threatening of
          God’s law, are set home, and they are made sensible that God is angry,
          and that his wrath is dreadful. They are led to consider the
          dreadfulness of that punishment, which God has threatened. The
          affection or principle, which is wrought upon to cause this trouble,
          is fear. They are afraid of the punishment of sin, and God’s wrath for
          it. They are commonly afraid of many things here in this world as the
          fruit of sin. They are afraid that God will not hear their prayers,
          that he is so angry with them, that he will never give them converting
          grace. They are afraid oftentimes that they have committed the
          unpardonable sin, or at least that they have been guilty of such sin
          as God will never pardon; that their day is past, and that God has
          given them up to judicial hardness of heart and blindness of mind. Or
          if they are not already, they are afraid they shall be. They are
          afraid oftentimes, that the Spirit of God is not striving with them
          now, that their fears are from some other cause. Sometimes they are
          afraid that it is only the devil, who terrifies and afflicts them; and
          that if the Spirit of God is striving with them, he will be taken from
          then, and they shall be left in a Christless state. They are afraid
          that if they seek salvation, it will be to no purpose, and that they
          shall only make their case worse and worse; that they are farther and
          farther from anything which is good, and that there is less
          probability now of their being converted, than when they began to
          seek. Sometimes they fear, that they have but a short time to live,
          and that God will soon cast them to hell; that none ever were as they
          were, who ever found mercy; that their case is peculiar, and that all
          wherein they differ from others is for the worse. They have fears on
          every side. Oftentimes they are afraid of everything. Everything looks
          dark, and they are afraid that everything will prove ruinous to them.
          But in the issue of all they are afraid they shall perish forever.
          They are afraid that when they die they shall go down to hell, and
          there have their portion appointed them in everlasting burnings. This
          is the sum of all their fears. And the cause of this fear is a
          consciousness of the guilt of sin. It is sin, which is the cruel
          taskmaster, which oppresses them, and chastises them; and sin is the
          cruel Pharaoh, which pursues them. As the children of Israel, before
          they came to sing with joy after they came out of the land of Egypt,
          were under great trouble from their taskmasters, and sighed by reason
          of the hard bondage, and then were pursued, and put into dreadful fear
          at the Red sea. It was their taskmasters who made them all this
          trouble. So it is sin which makes all the trouble which a sinner
          suffers under awakenings. Their trouble for sin is no gracious, godly
          sorrow for sin; for that does not arise merely from fear, but from
          love. It is not an evangelical, but legal, repentance of which we are
          speaking, which is not from love to God, but only self love.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The end of this trouble in those to whom God designs mercy is to
          humble them. God leads them into the wilderness before he speaks
          comfortably to them, for the same cause that he led the children of
          Israel into the wilderness before he brought them into Canaan, which
          we are told was to humble them. Deu. 8:2, “And thou shalt remember all
          the way, which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the
          wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, and to know what was in
          thine heart.” Man naturally trusts in himself and magnifies himself.
          And for man to enjoy only ease and prosperity and quietness tends to
          nourish and establish such a disposition. Deu. 32:15, “Jeshurun waxed
          fat, and kicked.” But by trouble and distress, and by a sense of a
          heavy load of guilt, God brings men down into the dust. God brings
          souls thus into the wilderness to show them their own helplessness, to
          let them see that they have nothing to which they can turn for help,
          to make them sensible that they are not rich and increased with goods,
          but wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked; to show them that
          they are utterly undone and ruined, to make them sensible of their
          exceeding wickedness, and to bring them to be sensible how justly God
          might cast them off forever. Those legal troubles tend to show them
          their utter inability to help themselves, as their fears put them on
          using their utmost endeavors, and trying their utmost strength; and by
          continuing in that way their experience teaches them their weakness,
          and they find they can do nothing. It puts them upon repeated trials,
          and they have as repeated disappointments. But repeated
          disappointments tend to bring a man to give up the case, and to
          despair of help in that way in which he has tried for it. It tends to
          make men sensible of the utter insufficiency of their wisdom, and
          bring them to see their own exceeding blindness and ignorance. For
          fear, and concern, and distress, necessarily put a person on intensely
          thinking, and studying, and contriving for relief. But when men have
          been thus trying their own wisdom and invention to their utmost, and
          find it fails, and signifies nothing, and is altogether to no purpose,
          it makes them more and more sensible of their weakness and blindness,
          and brings them to confess themselves fools, and blind, as to those
          things which concern their relief. They are like one who is placed in
          the midst of a vast hideous wilderness. At first it may be he may not
          be sensible but that he knows the way home, and can directly go in the
          way which leads out of the wilderness. But after he has tried and has
          traveled awhile, and finds that he cannot find the way, and that he
          spends himself in vain, and only goes round and round, and comes to
          the same place again at last, he is brought to confess that he knows
          not where to go, nor what to do, and that he is sensible that he, like
          one who is perfectly lost, and altogether in darkness, and is brought
          at last to yield the case and stand still, and do nothing but call for
          help, that if possible any one may hear, and lead him in the
          wilderness. For this end God leads men into the wilderness before he
          speaks comfortably to them. The troubles which they have for sin tend
          to bring them to be sensible how justly God may cast them off forever.
          And this brings them to reflect on their sins; for these are the
          things of which they are afraid. When a man is terribly afraid of
          things with which he is surrounded, this engages his eyes to behold;
          he looks intensely on them, and sees more and more how frightful and
          terrible they are. When they are in fear, they take much more notice
          of their sins than at other times. They think more how wickedly they
          have lived, and observe more the corrupt and wicked working of their
          own hearts, and so are more and more sensible what vile creatures they
          are. This makes them more and more sensible how angry God is, and how
          terrible his anger is. They try to appease and to reconcile God by
          their own righteousness, but it fails. God still appears as an angry
          God, refusing to hear their prayers, or appear for their help, till
          they despair in their own righteousness, and yield the case. And by
          more and more of a sight of themselves are brought to confess that
          they lie justly exposed to damnation, and have nothing by which to
          defend themselves. God appears more and more as a terrible being to
          them, till they have done with any imaginations, that they have
          anything sufficient to recommend them, or reconcile them to such a
          God. Thus God is wont first to bring the soul into trouble by reason
          of sin, and so to humble the soul, before he gives true hope and
          comfort in conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, this hope and comfort are given upon the slaying of the
          troubler. Whatever troubles there are for sin, yet if the sin is not
          slain, it cannot be expected but that there will be trouble still.
          Before there will be no true comfort. The soul may return to stupidity
          and carelessness, and may receive a false peace and hope, and sin be
          kept alive; but no true hope. Persons may be exceedingly troubled for
          sin, and yet sin be saved alive. Persons may seem to lament they have
          done thus and thus, and weep many tears, and cry out of their
          sinfulness and wickedness, and yet the life of sin be whole in them.
          But if so, they never shall receive true comfort. They may refrain
          from sin; there may be a great reformation, and exact life for a time.
          Or there may be a total reformation of some particular ways of sin,
          and yet not true hope; because sin is only restrained; it is not
          slain. Many men are brought to restrain sin, and to give it slight
          wounds, who cannot be brought to kill it. Wicked men are loth to kill
          sin. They have been very good friends to it ever since they have been
          in the world, and have always treated it as one of their most familiar
          and best friends. They have allowed it the best room in their hearts,
          and have given it the best entertainment they could, and they are very
          loth to destroy it. But until this be done, God never will give them
          true comfort. If ever men come to have a true hope, they must do as
          the children of Israel did by Achan. Jos. 7:24, 25, 26, “And Joshua
          and all Israel with him took Achan, the son of Zerah, and the silver
          and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons and his
          daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent,
          and all that he had; and they brought them into the valley of Achor.
          And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? The Lord shall trouble
          thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them
          with fire after they had stoned them with stones. And they raised over
          him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the Lord turned from the
          fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called
          the valley of Achor unto this day.” So if ever men come to have any
          true hope, they must take sin which is the troubler, and all which
          belongs to it, even that which seems most dear and precious, though it
          be as choice as Achan’s silver and wedge of gold, and utterly destroy
          them, and burn them with fire, to be sure to make a thorough end of
          them, as it were, bury them and raise over them a great heap of
          stones, to lay a great weight upon them, to make sure of it that they
          shall never rise more. Yea, and thus they must serve all his sons and
          daughters. They must not save some of the accursed brood alive. All
          the fruits of sin must be forsaken. There must not be some particular
          lust, some dear sinful enjoyment, some pleasant child of sin, spared.
          But all must be stoned and burned. If we do thus, we may expect to
          have trouble cease, and light to arise, as it was in the camp of
          Israel after slaying the troubler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inquiry. Here it may be inquired, what is implied in slaying sin at
          conversion? And it implies these several things:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, there must be a conviction of the evil of it as against God.
          All is carried on by conviction. Those legal troubles, which are
          before conversion, arise from some conviction of the being of sin, and
          the guilt and danger of it. And the slaying of sin is by conviction of
          its evil and hateful nature. To slay the troubler, we must find him
          out, as the children of Israel did before they slew Achan. They rose
          early in the morning, and searched, and brought all Israel by their
          tribes. And then searched the tribe, which was taken by families, and
          the family by particular persons, and so found him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, it is to have the heart turned from, and turned against, it in
          hatred. The troubler is never slain, but by a thorough and saving
          change of heart and renovation of nature, so that that which before
          loved sin and chose it, may now hate and abhor it, and may disrelish
          it, and all its ways, and especially hate their former ways of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, forsaking and renouncing it. Let men pretend what they may,
          their hearts are not turned from sin, if they do not forsake it. He is
          not converted, who is not really come to a disposition utterly to
          forsake all ways of sin. If ever sinners have true hope and comfort,
          they must take a final leave of sin, as the children of Israel did of
          the Egyptians at the Red sea. Persons may have a great deal of trouble
          from sin, and many conflicts and struggles with it, and seem to
          forsake it for a time, and yet not forsake it finally; as the children
          of Israel had with the Egyptians. They had a long struggle with them
          before they were freed from them. How many judgments did God bring
          upon the Egyptians, before they would let them go? And sometimes
          Pharaoh seemed as if he would let them go; but yet when it came to the
          proof he refused. And when they departed from Rameses doubtless they
          thought then they had got rid of them. They did not expect to see them
          any more. But when they arrived at the Red sea, and looked behind
          them, they saw them pursuing them. They found it a difficult thing
          wholly to get rid of them. But when they were drowned in the Red sea,
          then they took an everlasting leave of them. The king and all the
          chiefs of them were dead. And therefore God said to them [in] Exo.
          14:13, “The Egyptians, whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them
          again no more forever.” So sinners must not only part with sin for a
          little time, but they must forsake it forever, and be willing never to
          see or have anything to do with their old sinful ways and enjoyments.
          They must forsake that which is their iniquity, the sin which most
          easily besets them, and to which by their constitution or custom they
          have been most addicted, which has been, as it were, the dearest of
          all, and most respected, as a king among the army of sins; though that
          must be slain too, as Pharaoh, the king of the Egyptians, was in the
          Red sea. And we must not do as Saul did, when God sent him to kill the
          Amalekites; but he saved the king of the Amalekites alive, which cost
          him his kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, it implies embracing Christ, and trusting in him as the Savior
          from sin. We must look to him not only as a Savior from the punishment
          of sin, but we must receive and embrace him as a Savior from sin
          itself. We cannot deliver ourselves from sin. We cannot slay this
          enemy of ourselves. He is too strong an enemy for us. We can no more
          slay sin ourselves, that the children of Israel, who were themselves a
          poor feeble company, a mixed multitude, unprepared to resist such a
          force, could themselves slay Pharaoh, and all his mighty army with
          chariots and horsemen. It was Christ in the pillar of cloud and fire,
          who fought for them. They had nothing to do but trust in him.
          Exo.14:14, “The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your
          peace.” They could never have drowned the Egyptians in the sea. It was
          Christ who did it; for the pillar of cloud stood between them and the
          Israelites, and when they were up out of the sea, then Christ brought
          on them the waters of the sea. Our enemies must be drowned in the
          all-sufficient fountain, and as it were, sea of Christ’s blood, as the
          Egyptians were in the Red sea, and then we may sing, as the children
          of Israel did in the day when they came up out of the land of Egypt.
          When sin is thus slain, then God is wont to open a door of hope, a
          door through which there flashes a sweet light out of heaven upon the
          soul. Then comfort arises, and then is there a new song in the mouth,
          even praise unto God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. God is wont to bestow hope and comfort from time to time in the
          same manner on Christians. In the consideration of this matter I would
          show,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that Christians are frequently in darkness, and their hope is
          often greatly obscured.
        </p>
        <p>Second, that it is sin which is the occasion of this darkness.</p>
        <p>
          Third, their trouble is commonly much increased a little before the
          renewal of light and hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, their darkness is not perpetual, but God is wont to cause hope
          and comfort to rise again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, that hope and comfort are renewed to them on the slaying of the
          troubler.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it is often the case that Christians are under darkness, and
          their hope is greatly clouded. God is wont to give his saints hope and
          comfort at their first conversion, which sometimes remains without any
          great interruption for a considerable time. And some Christians live
          abundantly more in the light than others. Some for many years together
          have but little darkness. God is pleased to distinguish them from
          their neighbors. He mercifully keeps them from those occasions of
          darkness, into which he suffers others to fall, and gives them of the
          light of his countenance. God exercises his sovereignty in this
          matter, as he does in giving converting grace. As he bestows that on
          whom he pleases, so he bestows on some of those who are converted more
          light, on others less, according as it pleases him. But many
          Christians meet with a great deal of darkness, and see times in which
          their hopes are much clouded. Sometimes the sweet and comfortable
          influences of God’s Spirit are withdrawn. They were wont to have
          spiritual discoveries made of God and Christ to their souls, but now
          they have none. Their minds seem to be darkened, and they cannot see
          spiritual things, as they have done in times past. Formerly, when they
          read the Scriptures, they used often to have light come in, and they
          seemed to have an understanding and relish for what they read, and
          were filled with comfort. But now when they read, it is all a dead
          letter and they have no taste for it, and are obliged to force
          themselves to read. They seem to have no pleasure in it, but it is a
          mere task and burden. Formerly they used to have passages of Scripture
          come to their minds, when they were not reading, which brought much
          light and sweetness with them. But now they have none. Formerly they
          used to feel the sweet exercises of grace. They could trust in God,
          and could find a spirit of resignation to his will, and had love drawn
          forth, and sweet longings after God and Christ, and a sweet
          complacence in God; but now they are dull and dead. Formerly they used
          to meet with God in the ordinances of his house. It was sweet to sit
          and hear the word preached, and it seemed to bring light and life.
          They used to feel life and sweetness in public prayers, and their
          hearts were elevated in singing God’s praises. But now it is
          otherwise. Formerly they used to delight in the duty of prayer. The
          time which they spent in their closet between God and their own souls
          was sweet to them. But now when they go thither, they do not meet God;
          and they take no delight in drawing near to God in their closets. When
          they do pray, it seems to be a mere lifeless, heartless performance.
          They utter such and such words, but they seem to be nothing but words;
          their hearts are not engaged. Their minds are continually wandering
          and going to and fro, after one vanity and another. With this decay of
          the exercise of grace, their hope greatly decays; and the evidences of
          their piety are exceedingly clouded. When they look into their hearts,
          it seems to them that they can see nothing there, from which they
          should hope. And when they consider after what manner they live, it
          seems to them to argue, that they have no grace. They have but little
          of anything which is new, to furnish comfortable evidence to them of
          their good estate; and as to their old evidences, they are greatly
          darkened. Their former experience, in which they took great comfort,
          looks dim, and a great way off, and out of sight to them. They have
          almost forgotten it, and have no pleasure in thinking or speaking of
          it. And sometimes true Christians are brought into terrible distress.
          They are not only deprived of their former comforts, and have their
          former hopes obscured, but they have inward distressing darkness. God
          does not only hide his face, but they have a sense of his anger. He
          seems to frown upon them. So it appears to have been with David. Psa.
          42:7, “Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts; all thy
          waves and thy billows are gone over me.” So with Heman. Psa. 88:6, 7,
          “Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps. Thy
          wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy
          waves.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, it is sin which is the occasion of this trouble and darkness.
          Whenever the godly meet with such darkness, there is some Achan in
          their souls which is the occasion of all this; and this is sin. This
          is the occasion of the darkness of the godly, as well as the troubles
          which natural men have under awakenings. It is not for want of love in
          God towards his saints, or readiness to grant comfort to them. Neither
          is God’s hand shortened, that it cannot save, nor his ear heavy, that
          he cannot hear. It is their sin which hides God’s face from them. Isa.
          59:1, 2. Sin is the occasion of this darkness of the saints, in these
          three ways:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Sometimes it is owing to the weakness and small degree of grace
          infused in conversion, and the strength of remaining corruption. The
          work of God is the same in all who are converted, so far that their
          sin is mortified, and that which reigned before does not reign now.
          The heart is changed from darkness to light, and from death to life,
          and turned from sin to God. And yet the work is very different with
          respect to the degree of mortification of sin, and the degree of grace
          which is infused. Some have more spiritual light given in their first
          conversion than others; have greater discoveries, and are brought at
          once to a much greater acquaintance with God, and have their hearts
          more humbled, and more weaned from sin and the world, and more filled
          with the love of God and Christ, and are brought nearer to heaven than
          others. Some at first conversion have a much more eminent work of
          grace in their hearts than others. Some have emphatically but little
          grace infused, and consequently their corruptions are left in much
          greater strength. When it is so, it is no wonder that such have a
          weaker hope, and less light and comfort, than others. The natural
          tendency of indwelling sin in the saints, is to cloud and darken the
          mind; and therefore, the more of it remains, the more will it have
          this effect. Persons can know their own good estate in no other way
          than by seeking, or perceiving grace in their hearts. But certainly
          the less of it there is, with the more difficulty will it be seen or
          felt. As indwelling sin prevails, so does it the more obscure and
          cloud grace, as a great smoke clouds and hides a spark. And therefore
          the more there is of this indwelling sin, the more will grace be hid.
          The greater the strength in which corruption is left, the more rare
          will be the good frames which the godly have, and the more frequent
          and of longer continuance will be their times of darkness. It may be,
          the darkness with which the saints meet is from some particular
          corruption, which has always hitherto been in too great prevalence and
          strength, and has never yet been mortified to such a degree, but that
          it continues a great troubler in the soul. Grace being weak, the sin
          of the constitution takes advantage, whether that be a proud and
          haughty temper, or a covetous spirit, or an addictedness to some
          sensuality, or a peevish, fretful, discontented spirit, or ill temper,
          or a quarrelsome spirit, or disposition to high resentment. Or whether
          it be any other corrupt disposition, which is the sin to which they
          are chiefly exposed by natural temper, or by their education and
          former custom. If the grace which is infused at conversion, be
          comparatively weak, this constitutional sin will take the advantage,
          and will dreadfully cloud the mind, and hinder spiritual comfort, and
          bring trouble and darkness. There is a great variety in the work of
          grace upon men’s hearts, as to the particular discoveries which are
          then given, and the particular graces which are in chief exercise;
          whereby it comes to pass, that some in their conversion are more
          assisted against that particular corruption which is its opposite.
          Hence some particular corruptions may be left in much greater
          prevalence than others, and so be a greater occasion of darkness. Thus
          some, in the particular experiences which they have, may not be so
          especially assisted against pride as others, whereby their pride may
          take occasion to work. And when they have had spiritual discoveries
          and comfort, they may be lifted up with them. And this may be an
          occasion of displeasing and grieving his Holy Spirit, and so of their
          having a great deal of darkness. They may not have seen so much of
          their own emptiness as some others, and so their corruption may work
          much more by self-confidence than others; and no wonder that
          self-confident persons meet with darkness. No wonder that when men
          trust in themselves for light and grace, that their confidence fails,
          and they go without that for which they trusted in themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Sometimes the saints are in great darkness on occasion of some
          gross transgression into which they have fallen. So it was with David,
          when he fell into gross sin in the matter of Uriah. He exceedingly
          quenched the influences of the Spirit of God by it, and God withdrew
          those influences from him, and the comforts which they had imparted;
          as appears by his earnestly praying for their restoration. Psa. 51:12,
          “Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free
          Spirit.” When Christians fall into gross transgression, it is commonly
          the fact that an exceedingly deep darkness follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. When they do not fall into any particular gross and scandalous
          transgression, yet they sometimes exceedingly darken their minds by
          corrupt frames and evil habits, into which they fall. There is much
          remaining corruption in the hearts of Christians, and oftentimes they
          get into very ill frames. Some particular corruptions grow very
          prevalent. Sometimes they grow proud and conceited of themselves,
          either on account of their own godliness, and the good opinion others
          have of them, or on some other account. Sometimes they fall into a
          worldly frame, and spiritual things grow more tasteless to them, and
          their hearts are desperately bent on the acquisition of worldly good.
          Sometimes their minds grow light and vain, and their affections are
          wholly fixed on the vanities of youth, on dress, and gaiety, and
          fashion. Some, because their minds are not occupied as once they were,
          with spiritual enjoyments and delights, sweetly meditating on heavenly
          things, breathing and longing after them, and earnestly seeking them,
          become the slaves of their sensual appetites. Others grow contentious
          and quarrelsome, are often angry with those around them, and cherish
          habitual rancor against them in their hearts. They become willful and
          obstinate, and stir up strife, and oppose others with vehemence;
          determining at all hazards to carry their own measures, and delighting
          to have those who oppose them defeated and humbled. It hurts them to
          have others prosper. Their minds and hearts are full of turmoil, and
          heat, and vehemence against one and another. Others fall into a
          discontented, fretful, and impatient frame at the disposals of
          Providence. And oftentimes many of these things go together. And as
          these persons sink into such unhappy frames in their hearts, so they
          pursue very sinful courses of conduct. They behave themselves
          unsuitably, so as to dishonor God, and greatly to wound religion. They
          do not appear to others to savor of a good spirit. They fall into the
          practice of allowing themselves too great liberties in indulging their
          sensual appetites, in the gratification of covetousness and pride, in
          strife, backbiting, and a violent pursuit after the world. They slide
          into those corrupt frames and evil ways commonly by means of their
          first giving way to a slothful spirit. They are not so diligent and
          earnest in religion as they once were; but indulge their slothful
          disposition, and discontinue their watch, and so lie open to
          temptation. Thus ill frames imperceptibly creep upon them, and they
          insensibly more and more fall into sinful practices. So it was with
          David. Their sin, into which they fall in consequence of this
          degenerate and sinful state of the affections and the life, is the
          occasion of a great deal of darkness. God withdraws his Spirit from
          them, their light goes out, and the evidences of their piety grow dim
          and obscure. They seem to be in a great measure as they were before
          they were converted, and they have no sensible communion with God.
          Thus sin is the occasion of trouble and darkness to the Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, when it is thus with Christians, their trouble is commonly
          greatly increased a little before the renewal of hope and comfort.
          When sin prevails, as has been said, in the hearts of Christians, they
          are not wont to be easy and quiet like secure sinners. There is
          commonly more or less of an inward struggling and uneasiness. Grace in
          the heart, though it be dreadfully oppressed, and, as it were,
          overwhelmed, yet will be resisting its enemy and struggling for
          liberty. So that it is not with Christians in their ill frames, and
          under the prevalence of corruption, altogether as it is with carnal,
          wicked men who are secure. And there is this good reason for it, that
          the former have a principle of spiritual life in their souls, which
          the latter have not. Yet Christians in their ill frames may fall into
          a great deal of security and senselessness; for sin is of a stupefying
          nature, and wherever it prevails, will have more or less of that
          effect. When they fall into a sinful, worldly, proud, or contentious
          frame, they are wont to have a great degree of senselessness and
          stupidity with it. And especially when they fall into gross sins, has
          it a tendency greatly to stupefy the soul. It obviously had this
          effect on David. He seems to have been strangely stupefied, when
          Nathan came to him with the parable of the rich man, who injuriously
          took the poor man’s ewe lamb from him. He was enraged with the man in
          the parable, but did not seem to reflect on himself, or think how
          parallel his case was with his. And while they are thus senseless,
          their trouble is not so great; and if they feel the weight of sin it
          is not so burdensome to them. But God is wont, before he renews
          comfort and hope to them, to bring them into greater trouble. As a
          sinner before his first comfort in his conversion is brought into
          trouble, so it is wont to be with the saints after their backslidings
          and decays, before renewed hope and comfort is granted. There is a
          work of awakening wrought upon them. While they remain in their
          corrupt frames, they are, as it were, asleep. They are like the ten
          foolish virgins who slumbered and slept; and as persons who are
          asleep, they are unconscious, not sensible where they are, nor what
          are their circumstances. Therefore when God is coming and returning to
          them by his Spirit, commonly his first work upon them is a work of
          awakening, to wake them out of sleep, and rouse them to some
          sensibility, to make them sensible of the great folly of their ways,
          and how they have displeased and offended God, and what mischief they
          have done. Thus God leads them into the wilderness, and brings them
          into the valley of Achor or trouble. Then they are in greater trouble
          than they were before, and have more sensible darkness, and more
          distress abundantly. But yet it is really much better with them now,
          than before they began to come to themselves. Their circumstances are
          much more eligible and more hopeful, though sometimes they are in
          distress and almost insupportable. And a little before God renews
          light and comfort, they have a very great sense of God’s anger, and
          his wrath lies heavy upon them. So it seems to have been with David a
          little before the restoration of spiritual comfort to him, which made
          him speak of the bones which God had broken, when he was praying for
          the renewal of comfort. Psa. 51:8, “Make me to hear joy and gladness,
          that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.” And probably he
          has respect to the same thing in Psa. 38 which he calls his psalm to
          bring to remembrance. Verses 2, 3, 4, “Thine arrows stick fast in me,
          and thy hand presseth me sore. There is no soundness in my flesh,
          because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones, because
          of my sin. For mine iniquities are gone over mine head; as an heavy
          burden they are too heavy for me.” And often when God is about to
          bring them to themselves, and to restore comfort to them, he first
          brings them into some very great and sore temporal calamity and
          trouble, and awakens them by that, and in this first brings them into
          the wilderness before he speaks comfortably to them. Job 33:16, etc.
          “Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, that
          he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man. He
          keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the
          sword. He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude
          of his bones with strong pain; so that his life abhorreth bread, and
          his soul dainty meat. His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be
          seen; and his bones, that were not seen, stick out. Yea, his soul
          draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. If there
          be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show
          unto man his uprightness, then he is gracious unto him, and saith,
          Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom. His
          flesh shall be fresher than a child’s; he shall return to the days of
          his youth. He shall pray unto God, and he shall be favourable unto
          him, and he shall see his face with joy; for he will render unto man
          his righteousness. He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned,
          and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not, he will
          deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the
          light. Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, to bring
          back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the
          living.” Thus those who are very weak in grace sometimes meet with
          great and sore trouble, both of body and mind, which is an occasion of
          a new work, as it were, of grace upon their hearts; so that they are
          more eminent saints afterwards, and have much more comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, when the saints are in darkness, their darkness is not
          perpetual, but God will restore hope and comfort to them again. When
          one of Christ’s sheep wanders away, and gets into the wilderness,
          Christ the good Shepherd will not leave him in the wilderness, but
          will seek him, and will lay him on his shoulders, and bring him home
          again. We cannot tell how long God may leave his saints in the dark,
          but yet surely their darkness shall not last forever; for light is
          sown to the righteous, and gladness to the upright in heart. Psa.
          97:11. God, in the covenant of grace in which they have an interest,
          has promised them joy and comfort. He has promised them everlasting
          joy. Isa. 61:7. Satan may be suffered for a time to bring them into
          darkness, but they shall be brought out again. God may be provoked to
          hide his face from them for a time; and if it seems long, yet it is
          indeed but a little time. Isa. 54:7, 8, “For a small moment I have
          forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little
          wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting
          kindness will I have mercy on thee.” Psa. 30:5, “Weeping may endure
          for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, hope and comfort are renewed to them on the slaving of the
          troubler. All sin is truly mortified in conversion, or has its death
          wounds then. And all the exercises of it afterwards are, in some
          respects, as the efforts and strugglings of a dying enemy. But yet all
          life is not actually extinct, and therefore it needs to be further
          mortified, to receive more deadly wounds. Sin is slain in the godly
          after trouble and darkness, and before the renewing of comfort, in
          these three ways:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is slain as to former degrees of it. All remains of corruption
          are not extirpated. Sin does not cease to be in the heart; but it
          ceases to be any more in such strength as it has been. It ceases to
          have that prevalence.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is slain as to former ways of exercise. The former ways of sin
          are forsaken. They are further afterwards from such ways of sin than
          ever before. The heart is fortified against them. Thus if a godly man
          has been in a way of contention and strife, when he comes to himself
          again, he slays his contention. He kills sin as to that way of
          exercising it. Or if it be some way of sensuality, when he comes to
          himself, he will slay his sensuality, and cast it out from him.
        </p>
        <p>3. It is totally and perfectly slain in his will and inclination.</p>
        <p>
          There is that renewed opposition made against it, which implies a
          mortal inclination and design against it. What the saint seeks when he
          comes to himself after a time of great declension, is to be the death
          of sin, which has been so prevalent in him, and perfectly to extirpate
          it. He acts in what he does as a mortal enemy. And if he does not
          perfectly destroy it at one blow, it is not for want of inclination,
          but for want of strength. The godly man does not deal mercifully and
          tenderly with sin, but as far as in him lies, he deals with it as the
          children of Israel dealt with Achan, as it were, stones it with
          stones, and burns it with fire with all which belongs to it. They do
          not at all spare it, as wicked men do; they aim at the very life, and
          nothing short of it. The saints’ slaying the troubler after great
          backslidings and ill frames, implies the following things.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1). There is a conviction of the evil of their sin. They are brought
          to consideration. They think on their ways before they turn their
          feet. Psa. 119:59. They consider how they have behaved themselves, how
          unworthily, how unfaithful they have been to their profession, how
          ungratefully, and disagreeably to the mercies they have received. They
          consider how they have provoked God, and have deserved his wrath. They
          find the troubler led them to see a great deal more of the sinfulness
          and corruption of their hearts commonly than before. In this respect
          the work of God with saints after great declinings is agreeable to his
          work in the heart of a natural man in order to his conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2). There is a gracious humiliation of soul before God for it. The
          gracious soul, when convinced of sin after great declensions, and
          recovered out of them, is deeply humbled; for it is brought to the
          dust before God. There is an evangelical repentance. The heart is
          broken for sin. That sacrifice is offered to God, which David offered
          rather than burnt offerings after his great fall. Psa. 51:16, 17, “For
          thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it; thou delightest not
          in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken
          and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.” They are brought
          as Job was, after he had sinned, in complaining of God’s dealings with
          him, to abhor themselves. Job 42:6. And they are in a meeker frame, as
          the Christian Corinthians were, after they had greatly gone out of the
          way, and had been reproved by the apostle Paul. 2 Cor. 7:11, “For
          behold the self-same thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what
          carefulness it wrought in you, yea what clearing of yourselves, yea
          what indignation, yea what fear, yea what vehement desire, yea what
          zeal, yea what revenge.” They were filled with sorrow, and with a kind
          of indignation, zeal, and spirit of revenge against themselves for
          their folly, and so ungratefully treating God. When Christians are
          convinced of their sin after remarkable miscarriages and ill frames,
          they are commonly convinced of many of the same things of which they
          were convinced under their first humiliation, but to a greater degree
          than ever before. They are brought to a new conviction, and a greater
          conviction than ever before, of their own emptiness, and to be
          sensible what poor, feeble, helpless creatures, and what sinful, vile,
          utterly unworthy creatures, they are; how undeserving they are of any
          mercy, and how much they deserve God’s wrath. And this conviction
          works by a gracious humbling of the soul. The grace of humility is
          greatly increased by it, and very commonly they are more poor in
          spirit and lowly of heart during all their future life. They see more
          what cause there is for them to lay their hands on their mouths, and
          to walk humbly with God, and lie low before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3). There is a renewed application to Christ as a Savior from sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a renewed act of reliance on him for justification, of faith
          in his blood to cleanse them, and of trust in his righteousness to
          cover their nakedness and filthiness. And Christ as a Savior becomes
          more precious to them. As they have a greater sense of their own
          emptiness and vileness, so they have a more entire dependence on
          Christ’s fullness.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4). The heart is farther separated from those ways of sin, and more
          confirmed against them, than ever. After it they commonly have a
          greater dread of it, and greater abhorrence, look upon it more as an
          enemy, and remember what they have suffered from it; and their hearts
          are more confirmed against it than ever. They have stronger
          resolutions to all which savors of the like, and all which might lead
          to it. Therefore this is mentioned among the effects of the repentance
          of the Corinthians after their going astray. “What carefulness it
          wrought in you, yea what clearing of yourselves, yea what fear, yea
          what earnest desire.” There was a more than ordinary fear and dread of
          the like sin for the future, and more carefulness to shun it, and a
          more earnest desire of the contrary. The work of God in the heart of a
          saint after declension oftentimes, in many respects, resembles the
          work of God in a sinner at his conversion; though it is not in all
          respects like it, because of the great difference in the subject. When
          the troubler comes to be thus slain after times of trouble and
          darkness in the godly, then God is wont to open a door of hope. The
          darkness which has covered them, which was greatest a little before,
          is now scattered, and light arises. It may be before there had been a
          long night of clouds and darkness. But now the clouds begin to
          scatter, and the sweet refreshing beams begin to break forth, and come
          down into the heart. The soul, which has been wounded, is now healed.
          God pours in the oil of comfort. The renewed sense, which is given, of
          Christ’s fullness and sufficiency, gives new life and hope and joy.
          The troubler being slain, God now grants renewed discoveries of his
          glory, and renewed manifestations of his grace. And the soul, which
          was before in darkness, is now entertained with sweet views. And now
          that hope, which was so weakened, and was almost ready to fail, is
          revived, and greatly confirmed. Now the soul is enabled to take
          comfort in the promises. Now the saint sees evidences of his own good
          estate by the renewed manifestations which God makes of himself, and
          renewed exercises of grace. Before the soul was greatly exercised with
          doubts and fears and dark clouds; and much time was spent in reviewing
          past experiences, and looking over and examining those things which
          were formerly regarded as evidences of piety; and all in vain. They
          pored on past experiences, but to no satisfaction. And the reason was,
          the troubler was not slain, but still remained alive. But now God
          gives them new light, and new experiences, which in a few moments do
          more towards scattering their clouds, and removing their fears, than
          all their poring on past experiences could do for months, and probably
          for years. Before their hearts seemed in a great measure dead as to
          spiritual exercises. But now there is, as it were, new life. Now when
          they read the Scripture, and when they hear the Word preached, it is
          with a savor and relish of it. Now they can find God in his word and
          ordinances. Now Christ comes to them, and manifests himself to them,
          and they are admitted again to communion with God. When Christians
          have comfort and hope thus renewed, their comforts are commonly purer
          than ever. Their joys are more humble joys, freer from any mixture and
          taint of self-righteousness, than before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus shown that God is wont to cause hope and comfort to arise
          to the soul after trouble and humbling for sin, and upon slaving the
          troubler, both at first conversion and afterwards, after sad
          declinings, I would now give the reasons of the doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I would show why God is wont to give comfort after trouble and
          humbling for sin; or why he is wont to bring the soul into the
          wilderness before he speaks comfortably to it, and leads it into the
          valley of Achor, before he opens a door of hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it is that the soul may be prepared for a confiding application
          of itself to Christ for comfort. It is the will of God that men should
          have true hope and comfort conferred upon them in no other way, than
          by Jesus Christ. It is only by him that sinners have comfort at their
          conversion. And it is by him only that the saints have renewed hope
          and comfort after their declensions. And therefore the way to obtain
          this comfort is to look to him, to fly for refuge to him. And in order
          to this, persons have need to be brought to a sense of their necessity
          of him. And that they may be so, it is needful that they should be
          sensible of their calamity and misery, that they should be in trouble,
          and be brought to see their utter helplessness in themselves. And not
          only natural men, but Christians also, who are fallen into sin, and
          are in a dead and senseless frame, need something to make them more
          sensible of their necessity of Christ. Indeed the best are not so
          sensible of their need of Christ but that they need to be made more
          sensible. But especially those who are in ill and dead frames, and a
          declining state, need trouble and humbling to make them sensible of
          their need of Christ, and to prepare their minds for a renewed
          confiding application to Christ as their only remedy. The godly in
          such a case are sick with a sore disease, and Christ is the only
          Physician who can heal them; and they need to be sensible of their
          disease, that they may see their need of a physician. They, as well as
          natural men, need to be in a storm and tempest to make them sensible
          of their need to fly to him who is a hiding place from the wind, and a
          covert from the tempest. A Christian, who wanders away from God, is
          like Noah’s dove, which flew from the ark. She flew about till weary
          and spent, seeking rest somewhere else, but found no rest for the sole
          of her foot, and then she returned to the ark. So it is needful that
          the soul of a godly man, who wanders from Christ, should become weary,
          and find no rest for the sole of his foot, that so he may see his need
          of returning to Christ. Therefore it is said concerning the children
          of Israel in Hos. 2:6, “Therefore, behold, I will hedge up they way
          with thorns, and make a wall that she shall not find her paths.” And
          in our context, “She shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not
          overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them. Then
          shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then was
          it better with me than now.” When gracious souls wander from Christ,
          their husband, following after other lovers, God is wont to bring them
          into trouble and distress, and make them see, that their other lovers
          cannot help them, that so they may see, that it is best for them to
          return to their first husband.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, another end of God in it is, that comfort and hope may be the
          more prized when obtained. We see in temporal things, that the worth
          and value of any enjoyment is learned by the want of it. He who is
          sick, knows the worth of health. He who is in pain, knows how to prize
          ease. He who is in a storm at sea, knows how to prize safety on shore.
          And people who are subject to the grievances of war, know how to value
          peace. He who endures the hardships of captivity and slavery, is
          thereby taught how to value liberty. And so it is in spiritual things.
          He who is brought to see his misery in being without hope, is prepared
          to prize hope when obtained. He who is brought into distress through
          fear of hell and God’s wrath, is the more prepared to prize the
          comfort which arises from the manifestation of the favor of God, and a
          sense of safety from hell. He who is brought to see his utter
          emptiness and extreme poverty and necessity, and his perishing
          condition on that account, is thoroughly prepared to prize and rejoice
          in the manifestation of a fullness in Christ. And those godly persons
          who are fallen into corrupt and senseless frames, greatly stand in
          need of something to make them more sensible of their want of
          spiritual comfort and hope. Their living as they do shows that they
          have too little sense of the worth and value of that comfort, and
          those inestimable spiritual and saving blessings, which God has
          bestowed upon them. Otherwise they never would deal so ungratefully
          with God, who has bestowed them. If they did not greatly err in
          slighting spiritual comfort, as the children of Israel did manna,
          their hearts would never, to such a degree, have gone out after
          vanity, and earthly enjoyments, and carnal delights. They need to be
          brought into trouble and darkness to make them sensible of the worth
          of hope and comfort, and to teach them to prize it. They need to be
          brought into the wilderness, and left for a time to wander and suffer
          hunger and thirst in a barren desert, to teach them how to prize their
          vineyards. A sense of the pardon of sin, and the favor of God, and a
          hope of eternal life, do not afford comfort and joy to the soul any
          farther than they are valued and prized. So that the trouble and
          darkness which go before comfort, serve to render the joy and comfort
          the greater when obtained, and so are in mercy to those for whom God
          intends comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, it is so ordered that divine power and grace may be
          acknowledged in giving hope and comfort. There is naturally in men an
          exceeding insensibility of their dependence on God, and a great
          disposition to ascribe those things which they enjoy to themselves, or
          to second causes. This disposition reigns in natural men. They are
          wholly under the power of it. Therefore they need to be taught their
          own helplessness, and utter insufficiency, and utter unworthiness.
          Otherwise, if hope and comfort should be bestowed upon them, they
          would surely ascribe all to themselves, or the creature, and so would
          be lifted up by it, and would not give God the glory. Therefore it is
          God’s manner first to humble sinners before he comforts them. And all
          this self-confident disposition is not extirpated out of the hearts of
          the godly, and especially when they get into ill frames does it
          prevail. And it is very requisite, that before any remarkable comfort
          is bestowed upon them, they should be the subjects of renewed
          humbling. They need renewedly to see what helpless creatures they are,
          that so , when light is bestowed, they may be sensible how it is owing
          to God, and not to themselves, or any other. And that they may, by
          their troubles and humblings, be prepared the more to admire God’s
          power and mercy, and free and rich grace to them. While men are
          continued in fullness in a fruitful land, they will not learn their
          own helplessness; and therefore God will cast them out of this
          fullness into a wilderness. This is plainly intimated to be the reason
          of God’s so dealing with the children of Israel, as is said in the
          text. The church of Israel, before God thus led her into the
          wilderness, did not ascribe her comforts to God, as in the eighth
          verse, “For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil,
          and multiplied her silver and gold.” But they ascribed them to her
          idols. Verse fifth, “For she said, I will go after my lovers, that
          give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my
          drink.” And verse twelfth, “These are my rewards, that my lovers have
          given me.” For this reason it is that God takes away those things, as
          in verse ninth, “Therefore will I return and take away my corn in the
          time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my
          wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.” And verses 11, 12, “I
          will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons,
          and her Sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts. And I will destroy her
          vines and her fig-trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards
          that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the
          beasts of the field shall eat them.” God took them away, and turned
          her vineyards into a forest, and made her sensible that they were from
          him; and then he restored them again. For these reasons God is wont to
          bring souls into trouble, and to humble them for sin before he
          comforts them. I proceed.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. To give the reasons why hope and comfort are not obtained till
          sin, which is the troubler, is slain.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, while sin is harbored and preserved alive, it tends to provoke
          God to frown and express his anger. Sin is God’s mortal enemy. It is
          that which his soul infinitely hates, and to which he is an
          irreconcilable enemy. And therefore if we harbor this and suffer it to
          live in our hearts, and to govern our practice, we can expect no other
          than that it will provoke God’s frowns. Spiritual comfort consists in
          the manifestation of God’s favor, and in friendly communion with God.
          But how can we expect this at the same time that we harbor his mortal
          enemy? We see what God said to Joshua, while Achan was alive. Jos.
          7:12, “Neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the
          accursed thing from among you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the natural tendency of sin is to darken the mind, and trouble
          the conscience. There is nothing which wounds a well-informed
          conscience but sin. Sin is the enemy of grace, and therefore the
          natural tendency of it is to oppose and keep down the exercises of
          grace, and so to extinguish spiritual comfort; for spiritual comfort
          comes in no other way than by the exercise of grace. That which
          prevents the exercises of grace darkens the evidences of a man’s good
          estate. For there are no evidences of this but the exercises of grace.
          Sin does as much tend to keep out spiritual comfort, as clouds tend to
          hide the light of the sun. And therefore it is necessary that this
          should be removed in order to our receiving light and comfort. It is
          impossible in its own nature that any should have spiritual light and
          comfort before sin is mortified. If sinners had comfort while sin is
          in reigning power, it could be spiritual comfort; for spiritual
          comfort is the same with gracious comfort. But how can there be
          gracious comfort where grace has no place? But if there be grace, sin
          will not be in reigning power; for the nature of grace is to mortify
          sin. And as there can be no spiritual comfort without a degree of
          mortification of sin in those in whom sin is mortified, spiritual
          comfort cannot be any more than in proportion as sin is mortified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, a hope of eternal life, if given before the slaying of sin,
          would be misimproved and abused. If it were possible that a sinner
          could obtain a title to eternal life before sin was mortified, and so
          could have his own safety and God’s favor manifested to him, he would
          only improve it to encourage and embolden himself in sin. Hope, if
          they had it then, would have a pernicious influence and tendency. Till
          sin is slain, they stand in need of fear to restrain sin. If fear were
          once gone before sin is slain, they would soon run into all manner of
          wickedness, and without restraint. And so Christians themselves, while
          they are in corrupt frames, stand in need of fear to restrain sin; for
          at such times love is in a great degree dormant. It is of necessity
          that persons should have some principle or other to restrain them from
          sin. But there is no principle which can be effectual to restrain men
          from sin any farther than it is in exercise. If love is not in
          exercise it will not restrain men. So that at such times the saints
          need fear. And therefore God has wisely ordered it, that at such times
          their evidences should be darkened and their hopes clouded, that they
          may have fear, when love is not awake, to restrain them. The godly
          themselves, if their hope were all alive at those times when they are
          in carnal and thoughtless frames, and grace is asleep, would be in
          great danger to abuse their hope, and taken encouragement from it to
          indulge their lusts, or at least, to be the less careful to restrain
          and resist them. For we see that in such frames, though their hopes
          are clouded, and they have a considerable degree of fear, yet they are
          careless and negligent. But how much more so would they be, if they
          had no fear to restrain them!
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>I. Use of instruction.</p>
        <p>
          First, hence we may observe the wonderful wisdom of God in his
          dealings with the souls of men. When we consider what has been said,
          with the reasons of it, we may see just cause to admire the divine
          wisdom in his ordinary dealings with respect to those for whom he
          intends comfort. His wisdom is admirable in his dealing with natural
          men in fitting and preparing them for comfort, in bringing them into
          such troubles and distress, and hedging up their way with thorns, as
          it is expressed in the context, and leaving them in their distress to
          follow after their lovers, their idols, without being able to overtake
          them; in taking away their vineyards, and all those things in which
          they trusted, and making them a forest; and so showing them what poor,
          destitute, helpless creatures they are, before he gives them comfort.
          And so we may well admire the divine wisdom in his method of dealing
          with his saints, who decline and fall into sin, or get into corrupt
          frames and ill ways. God knows how to order things concerning them;
          and there is a marvelous wisdom observable in his manner of dealing
          with them in such cases. We may well admire how wisely God orders
          things in what has been said, for his own glory, to secure the glory
          due to his power and free grace, and to bring men to a sense of their
          dependence on him, and to ascribe all to him. And how he orders things
          for the glory of his Son, that he may have all the glory of the
          salvation of men, who is worthy of it, in that he laid down his life
          for their salvation. And also how wisely God orders things for the
          good of his own elect people, how he brings good out of evil, and
          light out of darkness. How wisely he consults their good and comfort
          in those things, which appear to them to be most against them. How he
          wisely prepares them for good, and makes way for their receiving
          comfort, and for its being the more sweet, the more prized and
          delighted in, when it is obtained. And oftentimes in bringing about
          this in those things, which they think at the time to be signs of
          God’s hatred. And how wisely God orders things for preventing men’s
          abusing a sense of their own safety, to giving the reins to their
          lusts. It is ordered so, that at those times when sin prevails, and
          there would be danger of this, the evidences of their safety are hid
          from their eyes, and the fear of hell comes on to keep them in awe;
          and that hope and comfort should be given only at such times and in
          such manner that they should have influence to draw men off from sin,
          and to prompt them to diligence in duty and the service of God; and
          that when it would have most of this tendency, then they should have
          most of it. When we consider these things, we may well cry out with
          the apostle, “O, the depth both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
          How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, hence we may learn, that souls, who are in darkness, and as it
          were, in a wilderness, have no cause to be discouraged. For by the
          doctrine we learn that this is the way often, in order to hope and
          comfort. Persons are very often ready to be discouraged by this. God
          seems to frown. They have a sense of his anger. They cry to him, and
          he does not seem to hear their prayers. They have been striving for
          relief, but it seems to be to no purpose. They are in such
          circumstances, that everything looks dark; everything seems to be
          against them. They are lost in a wilderness. They cannot find the way
          out. They have gone round and round, and returned again to the same
          place. They know not which way to turn themselves, or what to do.
          Their hearts are ready to sink. But you may gather encouragement from
          this doctrine; for by it you may learn that you have no cause to
          despair. For it is frequently God’s manner to bring persons into such
          circumstances, in order to prepare them for hope and comfort. The
          children of Israel were ready to be discouraged at the Red sea, when
          they saw Pharaoh and his hosts pursuing them. But it was only to
          prepare them for the greater joy after their deliverance. Joshua and
          the hosts of Israel were ready to be discouraged when they were
          smitten at Ai, as you may see in Jos. 7:5, etc. So that you, who are
          in the wilderness, may take encouragement from hence, still earnestly
          to seek God, and hope for light and comfort in his time.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Use of self-examination. By this persons may try their hopes and
          comforts, whether they are of the right kind. If they are such as have
          arisen after the manner, as is spoken of in the doctrine; if it is a
          hope which you found in the valley of Achor, in the sense which has
          been explained; it is a sign that it is a hope which God has given
          you, and so a hope which you are not to cast away; but which you are
          to retain, and rejoice in, and bless God for it. Therefore
          particularly inquire concerning your hopes and comforts, whether they
          have arisen in your souls when humbled for sin, and in the slaying of
          sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, inquire whether your hopes and comforts have been given you
          upon your soul’s being humbled for sin. You may try this by three
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Whether you have seen what a miserable, helpless creature you were.
          When your hopes and comforts have arisen in your heart, has it been
          upon your soul’s receiving such a sight of yourself. Or has your hope
          been accompanied with such a sense of soul? When hope was given at
          first, was it implanted in a heart thus prepared? And when you have
          had remarkable comfort and joy from time to time, has your joy been
          accompanied with such a sense and frame of mind? At the same time that
          you have had a strong hope of God’s favor, and that Christ was yours,
          have you been nothing in your own eyes. Have you at such times
          appeared to yourself to be a poor, little, helpless, unworthy
          creature, deserving nothing at the hands of God? And do not only
          inquire whether in your own apprehension you had some such sight of
          yourself at first, before your first comfort. If you ever had a right
          understanding of yourself, of your own heart, and your own state, you
          will never wholly lose it. It will revive from time to time. If you
          had it when you received your first comfort, the same sense will come
          again. When your comforts are revived, this will revive with them. If
          the first joy was granted to a heart thus prepared, there will from
          time to time be a sense of your own emptiness and worthlessness,
          arising with your joys and comforts. It will be with a deep sense of
          what a poor, miserable, and exceedingly sinful creature you are. True
          comfort is wont to come in such a manner. There is usually a
          self-emptying, a soul-abasing, sense of heart accompanying it. So that
          at the same time that God lifts up the soul with comfort, and joy, and
          inward sweetness, he casts it down with abasement. Evangelical and
          gracious humiliation and spiritual comfort are companions, which go
          one with the other, and keep company together. When one comes, the
          other is wont to come with it. It is not wont to be so with false
          comforts and joys. But pride and self-fullness are wont to be the
          companions of false comfort. Indeed, there may be a counterfeit
          abasement going with it. But if you examine it, you will find, that
          that very seeming abasement or humiliation lifts the man up, and fills
          him full of himself. The hypocrite, in the times of his greatest joy,
          and most confident hopes, looks large in himself. His thoughts are
          very busily employed about his own excellencies, how holy he is, how
          eminent a saint he is, how much better he is than most of his
          neighbors, how there are few equal to him; and therefore how it must
          be that God loves him better than most others; how much God
          distinguishes him, how much he experiences, and how good he is, and
          what delight he takes in them on that account.
        </p>
        <p>
          But true spiritual comfort works in another way. Gracious joy and
          poverty of spirit go hand in hand, and rejoice, as it were, in each
          other’s company. The godly may at some times have comforts and joys,
          which do not accompany such abasement. They may be lifted up with joy
          and conceit of, and confidence in, themselves at the same time. But
          those joys are not spiritual, they are hypocritical, joys. Such
          comforts are not from the Spirit of God. A godly man may have false
          joys. He is liable to this exercise of corruption, as well as others.
          And there may be a mixture of one with the other, or false joy and
          pride may take occasion from true ones, afterwards to appear. But a
          gracious joy is linked together with poverty of spirit, and never
          forsakes it. And hence,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. You may try this by examining what your hopes and comforts are
          built upon; whether on Christ only, or on your own righteousness. If
          you would know of what kind your comforts are, follow them up to the
          fountain, and see what is their source and spring. If you would know
          of what kind your hope is, examine the bottom of it, and see upon what
          foundation it stands. If your hope is that which has been given in the
          valley of Achor, your own righteousness is not the foundation of it.
          Inquire therefore what it is, which gives you ease with respect to
          your past sins, what it is which quiets your conscience about them. Is
          it any sense you have of the free, and sovereign, and infinite grace
          and mercy of God in Christ? Is it what you have seen in Christ, or the
          gospel of his grace, which has lightened your burden with respect to
          your sins? Or is that now you think with yourself that you have done
          such and such things, or have met with such things, have such workings
          of affection towards God, that you are become lovely in his sight, so
          that he, seeing what holy affections and experiences your heart has
          been filled with, and what discoveries you have had, he is on that
          account reconciled to you, and you are become lovely in his eyes? What
          makes you hope that you are in favor with God? Is it because you
          conceive of God as looking down from heaven upon your heart, on your
          gracious experiences, and so being, as it were, taken with, and
          receiving you into his favor on account of that? Or is your hope of
          God’s favor built on a sense which you have of Christ’s worthiness,
          and the saving mercy of God in him, and his faithfulness to the
          promises, which he has made through him?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Inquire concerning the effect of your comforts, whether they cause
          an ardent disposition and desire to exalt God, and to lie low before
          him. True comforts and joys, which are from the Spirit of God, and are
          well founded, are wont to work after this manner. They excite an
          inward intense desire that God may be exalted, and to lie in the dust.
          Such a one as the psalmist seems to have had, when he says, Psa.
          115:1, “Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory.” The
          repeating of the expression seems to show how ardent his heart was.
          When God is pleased to lift up the light of his countenance upon the
          soul, and to impart inward sweetness from a manifestation of his
          glory, there is wont to be an inward longing to be in the dust. At
          such times the Christian sees how it becomes him to be humble, and how
          worthy God and Christ are of all the glory, more than he does at other
          times. He perceives and laments that he cannot bow enough; that he is
          not abased as low before God as becomes such a sinner as himself.
          Hence arises an intense desire after self-abasement; and the soul
          breathes and pants after humiliation before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, inquire whether your hope and comfort are such as have arisen
          on the slaying of sin. If your hope is that which you obtained before
          this, you obtained it too soon, and had better be without it than with
          it. It is not sufficient evidence of your hope, that it was given
          after much trouble and great terrors, or great relentings of heart for
          sin, and bewailing that you had done so wickedly, or that it was after
          reformations, and abstaining from former ways of sin, and a total
          reformation of some particular evil practices. But if it be a true
          hope, it was given after the slaying of sin. And in order the better
          to determine this point, let the following inquiries be made.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Whether your hope has been accompanied with a heart and a life
          turned from sin? Or is there no remarkable difference in this respect
          now from what there was before? We all own conversion to be a great
          change. And we have all been sufficiently taught, that the change
          consists in this; in turning from sin to God. Therefore there must be
          a great change in this respect. Is there a great change in this
          respect in you? I do not inquire whether there be a great change in
          you in respect to hope and comfort; that whereas formerly you did not
          suppose yourself to be in Christ, and had no hope of it, now you have
          hope, and a confident hope, which oftentimes is an occasion of new and
          peculiar joy and elevation of spirit. There may be a great change in
          you in this respect, and yet you may remain in a Christless state. But
          is there a great change with respect to the turning of your heart from
          sin, and against sin? You may reply to this, I see abundance of
          corruption and wickedness in my heart; and so far is it from being
          delivered from corruption, that I seem at times to discover more than
          ever. But whether you see more or less corruption in your heart, is
          your heart turned against the corruption which you see? Is there a
          great difference in you in this respect from what there used to be
          with respect to your being turned against your own sin, and finding
          within yourself a nature opposite to it, a nature to resist it, to
          carry it as an uneasy burden? And is your heart turned against
          yourself for it, in abhorrence of yourself, and in indignation against
          yourself? And is your will turned from sin, that though you find a
          great deal of corruption in your heart, yet you do not allow it, you
          keep a strict watch upon it, and will not let it walk at liberty to
          appear in your life and conversation? Is there no lust harbored, which
          is prevalent in you, and which is neglected, and suffered to range and
          to walk on every side? Is there no sin wittingly tolerated? Do you aim
          strictly to keep all God’s commandments; and is that your actual care
          and watch, that you may avoid every evil, and every false way; and
          that you may in all things, so far as in you lies, please and honor
          God? And do you find that this is the tendency of your hope; that your
          hope has a sanctifying influence upon you, that it turns you against
          sin, and stirs you up to seek after purity from sin? With respect to
          most who are here present, who entertain hope, there has been much
          opportunity for experience in this matter, since you have had your
          hope, so that one would think by an impartial and strict examination
          you might be able to answer these inquiries.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Those of you, who have obtained your hope again after special and
          remarkable departings from God, should inquire in what manner hope has
          been restored. Indeed hypocrites are not so apt to have their hope
          abated by such things, as those who have a true hope. A hypocrite’s
          hopes and false comforts will subsist, and it may be continue as
          lively as ever, under such great sins, and such a course of ill
          practices, as, if a godly man should fall into them, would bring him
          into exceeding darkness. Some hypocrites will live in very immoral
          ways, and yet keep up their confidence, seem not to have their hope
          much shaken, and boast of as much comfort and joy at such times as at
          any other. But this is not the manner of a true comfort. A true
          comfort, which flows from the exercise and the breathings of the
          Spirit of God in the heart, must, of necessity, at such times be
          exceedingly suppressed; and commonly great trouble and darkness is the
          effect. But if it has not been altogether thus with you, but you have
          found that at times, when you have greatly sinned and gone on in ill
          practices, your hope has decayed, and in the time of it your
          conscience told you that the way in which you lived was contrary to
          known rules, and so was in doubt about your hope, but since that you
          have grown strong again in your hope, inquire in what manner you have
          obtained your hope again. Unsound professors in such cases are not
          wont to obtain hope again in the same manner as the truly godly do, in
          a deep humbling for sin, and in slaying the troubler, as has been
          described. But it may be only this, that now they do better than they
          did, and so hope comes again. If they lived in a way of some vile
          sensuality for a time, and afterwards cease to do so, they look on
          their reformation as an atonement; and so their hope is renewed
          without any humbling or abasement, without any special convictions of
          the evil of their ways, any special repentance, or renewed sense of
          their own vileness, or any renewed flying to the mercy of God in
          Christ for refuge, or any further alienation of their hearts from
          those evil ways in which they have walked. If your comforts and
          confidence have been renewed after remarkable aberrations from the way
          of duty without something of this nature, it is to be feared that you
          make your own righteousness the ground of your hope and comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Inquire whether at those times, when you have most hope and
          comfort, above all others, you are most disposed to be careful to
          avoid sin, and to strive to live holy. Sometimes the hope of
          hypocrites if very confident; and therefore the degree of confidence
          which attends a hope is not certain evidence of its truth and
          genuineness. But we should examine what effect this strong confidence
          has upon us. Do we find, when our hope is strongest and our comfort
          greatest, that then our hearts are most set against sin, and that then
          we feel the greatest desires to live holy, and have most of a
          disposition to keep a strict watch, and maintain an earnest warfare
          against sin, and are most desirous in everything to do our duty? Or do
          we find, on the contrary, when our hope is strong, and we are most
          satisfied that our condition is safe, that then we are least careful
          to avoid sin, and are least disposed to take pains to curb our lusts,
          and resist temptation, or lay ourselves in the way of duty? If it be
          thus, it is a very bad sign and black mark on our hopes and comforts.
          A true hope has a tendency to prompt him who has it to purify himself,
          and watch and strive more earnestly against all impurity. 1 John 3:3,
          “He that hath this hope in him purifieth himself.” They are condemned
          who, because they think they are righteous, and so that they shall
          certainly have eternal life, will trust in that hope to give
          themselves the greater liberty in sin. Eze. 33:13, “When I shall say
          to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own
          righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousness shall not be
          remember; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die.”
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Use of direction. If it be so, that God is wont to cause hope and
          comfort to arise after trouble and humbling for sin, and upon slaying
          the troubler, this may be of direction to souls under spiritual
          trouble and darkness, what course to pursue for hope and comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, thoroughly to renounce and forsake all ways of sinful behavior.
          For you have heard that hope and comfort are never to be expected,
          till sin is slain or forsaken. He who is not thorough in his
          reformation, cannot reasonably hope for comfort, how much soever he
          may abound in some particular duties. Persons who are under
          awakenings, and would seek a true hope of salvation, should in the
          first place see, that they thoroughly renounce every wicked practice.
          They should search their ways, and consider what is wrong in them:
          what duties they have omitted, which ought to have been done; and what
          practices they have allowed, which ought to be forsaken. And [they]
          should immediately reform, retaining no one way of sin, denying all
          ungodliness, omitting nothing which is required; and should see that
          they persevere in it, that it be not merely a temporary, short-lived
          restraint, but an everlasting renunciation. This is the way to have
          the troubler slain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, earnestly to seek humiliation. To that end they should labor
          to be convinced of sin. They should be much engaged in searching their
          own hearts, and keeping a watchful eye upon them. They should not rest
          in their own efforts, but earnestly seek to God to give them a right
          sight of themselves, and a right conviction of sin, and show them that
          they have deserved God’s everlasting wrath. And in order to this they
          should carefully watch against backsliding; for backsliding prevents
          humiliation. If there has been any progress made by the conviction of
          God’s Spirit towards it, it is all lost by backsliding. This again
          blinds and stupefies the heart, and sets the man further than ever
          from a right knowledge of himself, and sight of his own heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, to search and endeavor to find out the troubler. You have heard
          that when the godly are in darkness, it is not for want of love in God
          to them, or a readiness in him to give them comfort; but that sin is
          doubtless the cause of their darkness in one way or another. Their
          troubler lies at their own door. There is doubtless some troubler in
          the camp, which causes God to withdraw. And therefore if you have
          light revive, and have the comfortable presence of God again, the
          first thing which you do must be to search, and find out the troubler.
          Many, when they are in darkness, proceed in a wrong way. They go to
          examining past experience. And that they should do; but what is wrong
          in it is, that they do that only. They spend their time in seeking for
          something in themselves which is good. Whereas they ought to spend
          more of it in seeking out that which is bad. Whatever good there is,
          they are never likely to find it out, till they find out the sin which
          obscures and hides it. And whatever they reflect upon, which they
          formerly thought was good, is not likely to afford any satisfaction to
          them, till that bad thing be removed out of the way which troubled
          them. They wonder what the cause is, that they are so in the dark.
          They verily thought in time past, that they were right, and that they
          had experienced a right work of God’s Spirit on their hearts, and
          thought that they were the children of God. But now God hides his face
          from them, and they wonder what is the matter; as Joshua seemed to be
          astonished when Israel was smitten down at Ai. Sometimes they almost
          conclude, that it is because they are not the children of God. They
          pray to God to renew his comforts to them, and spend much time. And
          they ought to pray. But they have more need to do something else.
          Joshua spent a great deal of time in prayer when Israel was troubled.
          He fell upon his face till eventide, complaining to God about his
          withdrawing from them. But God says to him. Jos. 7:10, 11, “Get thee
          up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?” As much as to say, you
          had more need to be doing something else, than lie there. “Israel hath
          sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant, which I commanded
          them; for they have even taken of the accursed thing.” And verse 13,
          “Up, sanctify yourselves.” This teaches you, who are under darkness,
          and have your hopes darkened, and comforts deadened, what you should
          do. You must arise and search, and find out the troubler. If you do
          not do this, it will signify nothing to you to lie crying and
          complaining to God about your darkness. You have other business which
          you have more need to do, though prayer should not be left undone. Let
          me beseech you, therefore, to be thorough in this. You have need to be
          thorough, for it is an exceedingly difficult thing to find out the
          accursed thing in such cases. Men’s hearts do like Achan, who hid the
          accursed thing in the earth in the midst of his tent. Jos. 7:21. He
          hid it very closely. He did not content himself with hiding it in the
          most secret place in his tent, but he dug in the ground and buried it
          in the earth under his feet, that there might be no sign of it above
          ground. So are men’s deceitful hearts wont to hide the accursed thing
          which troubles them. When they are put upon searching for the cause of
          their trouble and darkness, they think of one thing and another, but
          commonly overlook the chief cause of all their trouble. It does not so
          much as enter their minds. They search the tent, but that is not
          enough. They must search the very ground, or they will not find it
          out. When they tell of their darkness, and are put upon searching to
          see whether some sinful way is not the cause, they readily own that it
          is their fault. But yet they mistake the true Achan, not withstanding
          all they confess of the corruption of their hearts. It is not merely
          corruption in their hearts, working in their thought, which is the
          cause; but it is some way of outward sin and wickedness, in which they
          have of late in a great measure allowed themselves. That is the
          principal cause of their trouble; some way of pride, or covetousness,
          or some way of envy, or evil-speaking, or ill will to their neighbors,
          or self-will, or some other way of unsuitable carriage, which is the
          chief cause of their darkness. In some respects, it is a great deal
          easier to find out little sins than greater sins, which causes many to
          strain at a gnat who swallows a camel. Sins which are common to all,
          and of which all complain, such as corrupt workings of heart, they are
          willing to feel that it is no disgrace to have them. And the godly
          commonly tell of such things, and it does not affright them to see
          them. But such things as malice, a proud behavior, and many other
          things which might be mentioned, are disagreeable. They are not
          willing to see such things in themselves. They therefore call them by
          good names, and put good constructions on them, and hide them, as
          Achan did his accursed thing underground. The sin which troubles them
          most, has greatest possession of their hearts, and does most blind and
          prejudice their minds, is passed over. They can soon enough discover
          and see such things in others, in one of an opposite party, or the
          like, but they cannot see them in themselves; and so they continue
          still under darkness. It is an exceedingly difficult thing to find out
          the troubler. You have need, therefore, to be exceedingly thorough in
          searching for this matter, and not to spare yourself, or bribe your
          conscience at all, but labor to be impartial in the search. And to
          induce you to this, consider what God said to Joshua. Jos. 7:12,
          “Neither will I be with you any more, unless you destroy the accursed
          thing from among you.” And, therefore,
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, when you have found out the troubler, be sure thoroughly to
          destroy it. Renounce it with detestation, as a vile serpent that has
          secretly lain under your head for a long time, and infected you with
          his poisons time after time, and bit you, when you were asleep, made
          you sick and filled you with pain, and you knew it not. Would not a
          man, when he has found out the serpent in such a case, destroy it with
          indignation, and be forever afterwards thoroughly watchful that he is
          not caught with such a calamity again? You cannot be too thorough in
          destroying such an enemy, and laboring to root it out, and extirpate
          all its race. Whoever of you are under darkness and trouble, I am bold
          to say, if God help you to follow these directions, your darkness will
          soon be scattered, and hope and comfort will arise. And this is the
          surest, and readiest, and most direct course which any of you can take
          in order to the renewing of comfort in your soul. And without this, do
          not promise yourself any considerable degree of light or comfort while
          you live, however many examinations of past experiences and prayers to
          God for light you may make.
