          Philippians 3:17, “Brethren, be followers of me, and mark them which
          walk so as ye have us for an example.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THE apostle in the foregoing part of the chapter, had been telling how
          he counted all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of
          Christ Jesus, and in the text he urges that his example should be
          followed.
        </p>
        <p>He does this in two ways.</p>
        <p>
          I. He exhorts the Philippian Christians to follow his example.
          “Brethren be followers together of me.” He exhorts them to be
          followers of him together; that is, that they should all follow his
          example with one heart and soul, agreeing in it, and that all, as much
          as in them lay, should help and assist each other in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That they should take particular notice of others that did so, and
          put peculiar honor on them, which is implied in the expression in the
          latter part of the verse, “mark them which walk so as ye have us for
          an ensample.”
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          We ought to follow the good examples of the apostle Paul. We are to
          consider that the apostle did not say this of himself from an
          ambitious spirit, from a desire of being set up as a pattern, and eyed
          and imitated as an example to other Christians. His writings are not
          of any private interpretation, but he spoke as he was moved by the
          Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost directed that the good examples of the
          apostle Paul should be noticed by other Christians and imitated. And
          we are also to consider that this is not a command to the Philippians
          only, to whom the epistle was more immediately directed, but to all
          those for whose use this epistle was written, for all Christians to
          the end of the world. For though God so ordered it, that the epistles
          of the apostles were mostly written on particular occasions and
          directed to particular churches, yet they were written to be of
          universal use. And those occasions were so ordered in the wisdom of
          Divine Providence that they are a part of that infallible rule of
          faith and manners which God has given to the Christian church to be
          their rule in all ages. And the precepts that we find in those
          epistles are no more to be regarded as precepts intended only for
          those to whom the epistle was sent than the ten commandments that were
          spoken from mount Sinai to the children of Israel are to be regarded
          as commands intended only for that people. And when we are directed to
          follow the good examples of the apostle Paul by the Holy Ghost, it is
          not merely as we are to imitate whatever we see that is good in
          anyone, let him be how he may. But there are spiritual obligations
          that lie on Christians to follow the good examples of this great
          apostle. And it has pleased the Holy Ghost in an especial manner to
          set up the apostle Paul, not only as a teacher of the Christian
          church, but as a patter to other Christians. The greatest example of
          all, that is set before us in Scripture to imitate, is the example of
          Jesus Christ, which he set us in his human nature, and when in his
          state of humiliation. This is presented to us not only as a great
          pattern, but as a perfect rule. And the example of no man is set
          forth, as our rule, but the example of Christ. We are commanded to
          follow the examples which God himself set us, or the acts of the
          divine nature. Eph. 5:1, “Be ye therefore followers of God , as dear
          children.” And Mat. 5:48, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your
          Father which is in heaven is perfect.” But the example of Christ
          Jesus, when on earth, is more especially our pattern. For though the
          acts of the divine nature have the highest possible perfection, and
          though is inimitable perfection is our best example, yet God is so
          much above us, his nature is infinitely different from ours, that it
          is not possible that his acts should be so accommodated to our nature
          and circumstances, as to be an example of so great and general use, as
          the perfect example in our nature which Christ has set us. Christ,
          though a divine person, was man, as we are men. And not only so, but
          he was, in many respects, a partaker of our circumstances. He dwelt
          among men. He depended on food and raiment, and such outward supports
          of life, as we do. He was subject to the changes of time, and the
          afflictions and calamities of this evil world, and to abuse from men’s
          corruptions, and to temptations from Satan, as we are; was subject to
          the same law and rule that we are, sued the same ordinances, and had
          many of our trials, and greater trials than we. So that Christ’s
          example is the example that is chiefly offered in Scripture for our
          imitation. But yet the example of some that are fallen creatures, as
          we are, may in some respects be more accommodated to our
          circumstances, and more fitted for our instructions, than the example
          of Jesus Christ. For though he became man as we are, and was like us,
          and was in our circumstances in so many respects, yet in other things
          there was a vast difference. He was the head of the church, and we are
          the members. He is Lord of all, we are his subjects and disciples. And
          we need an example, that shall teach and direct us how to behave
          towards Christ our Lord and head. And this we may have better in some,
          that have Christ for their Lord as well as we, than in Christ himself.
          But the greatest difference lies in this, that Christ had no sin, and
          we all are sinful creatures, all carry about with us a body of sin and
          death. It is said that Christ was made like to us in all things, sin
          only excepted. But this was excepted, and therefore there were many
          things required of us, of which Christ could to give us an example.
          Such as repentance for sin, brokenness of spirit of sin, mortification
          of lust, warring against sin. And the excellent example of some, that
          are naturally as sinful as we has this advantage, that we may regard
          it as the example of those, who were naturally every way in our
          circumstances, and labored under the same natural difficulties, and
          the same opposition of heart to that which is good, as ourselves;
          which tends to engage us to give more heed to their example, and the
          more to encourage and animate us to strive to follow it. And therefore
          we find that the Scripture does not only recommend the example of
          Christ, but does also exhibit some mere men, that are of like passions
          with ourselves, as patterns for us to follow. So it exhibits the
          eminent saints of the Old Testament, of whom we read in the Scripture,
          that they inherit the promises. Heb. 6:12, “That ye be not slothful,
          but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the
          promises.” In the eleventh chapter of Hebrews (Heb. 11), a great
          number of eminent saints are mentioned as patterns for us to follow.
          Abraham is, in a particular manner, set forth as an example of his
          faith, and as the pattern of believers. Rom. 4:12, “And the father of
          circumcision to them, that are not of the circumcision only, but who
          also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he
          had, being yet uncircumcised.” And so the prophets of the Old
          Testament are also recommended as patterns. Jam. 5:10, “Take, my
          brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for
          an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.” And so eminently
          holy men under the New Testament, apostles and others, that God sent
          forth to preach the gospel, are also examples for Christians to
          follow. Heb. 13:7, “Remember them that have the rule over you, who
          have spoken to you the Word of God; whose faith follow, considering
          the end of their conversation.” But of all mere men, no one is so
          often particularly set forth in the Scripture, as a pattern for
          Christians to follow, as the apostle Paul. Our observing his holy
          conversation as our example, is not only insisted on in the text, but
          also 1 Cor. 4:16, “Wherefore I beseech you, be followers of me.” And
          chap. 11:1, “Be ye followers of me as I also am of Christ.” And 1
          Thes. 1:6. Where the apostle commends the Christian Thessalonians for
          imitating his example; “and ye became followers of us.” And 2 Thes.
          3:7, he insists on this as their duty, “For yourselves know how ye
          ought to follow us.”
        </p>
        <p>For the more full treatment of this subject I shall,</p>
        <p>
          I. Particularly mention many of the good examples of the apostle Paul
          that we ought to imitate. Which I shall treat of not merely as a
          doctrine, but also in the way of application.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I shall show under what strict obligation we are to follow the
          good examples of this apostle
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I shall particularly mention many of those good examples of the
          apostle Paul that we ought to imitate. And that I may be more
          distinct, I shall,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, mention those things that respect his watchfulness for the good
          of his own soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, those virtues in him that more immediately respected God and
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>Third, those that more immediately respect men.</p>
        <p>
          Fourth, those that were exercised in his behavior, both towards God
          and men.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we ought to follow the good example that the apostle Paul has
          set us in his seeking the good of his own soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. We should follow him in his earnestness in seeking his own
          salvation. He was not careless and indifferent in this matter; but the
          kingdom of heaven suffered violence from him. He did not halt between
          two opinions, or seek with a wavering, unsteady mind, but with the
          most full determination and strong resolution. He resolved, if it
          could by any means be possible, that he would attain to the
          resurrection of the dead. He does not say that he was determined to
          attain it, if he could, by means that were not very costly or
          difficult, or by laboring for it a little time, or only now and them,
          or without any great degree of suffering, or without great loss in his
          temporal interest. But if by any means he could do it, he would, let
          the means be easy or difficult. Let it be a short labor and trial, or
          a long one; let the cross be light or heavy; it was all one to his
          resolution. Let the requisite means be what they would, if it were
          possible, he would obtain it. He did not hesitate at worldly losses,
          for he tells us that he readily suffered the loss of all things, that
          he might win Christ, and be found in him, and in his righteousness.
          Phil. 3:8, 9. It was not with him as it was with the young man, that
          came kneeling to Christ to inquire of him what he should do to inherit
          eternal life, and when Christ said, Go and sell all that thou hast and
          give to the poor, he went away sorrowful. He was not willing to part
          with all. If Christ had bid him sell half, it may be he would have
          complied with it. He had a great desire to secure salvation. But the
          apostle Paul did not content himself with wishing. He was resolved, if
          it were possible, that he would obtain it. And when it was needful
          that he should lose worldly good, or when any great suffering was in
          his way, it was no cause of hesitation to him. He had been in very
          comfortable and honorable circumstances among the Jews. He had
          received the best education that was to be had among them, being
          brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, and was regarded as a very learned
          young man. His own nation, the Jews, had a high esteem of him, and he
          was esteemed for his moral and religious qualifications among them.
          But when he could not hold the outward benefit of these things and win
          Christ, he despised them totally, he parted with all his credit and
          honor. He made nothing of them, that he might win Christ. And instead
          of being honored and loved, and living in credit, as before among his
          own nation, he made himself the object of their universal hatred. He
          lost all, and the Jews hated him, and persecuted him everywhere. And
          when great sufferings were in the way, he willingly made himself
          conformable to Christ’s death, that he might have a part in his
          resurrection. He parted with his honor, his ease, his former friends
          and former acquaintance, his worldly goods and everything else, and
          plunged himself into a state of extreme labor, contempt, and
          suffering. And in this way he sought the kingdom of heaven. He acted
          in this matter very much as one that is running a race for some great
          prize, who makes running his great and only business, till he has
          reached the end of the race, and strains every nerve and sinew, and
          suffers nothing to divert him, and will not stand to listen to what
          anyone says to him, but presses forward. Or as a man that is engaged
          in battle, sword in hand, with strong and violent enemies, that seek
          his life, who exerts himself to his utmost, as for his life. 1 Cor.
          9:26, “I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one
          that beateth the air.” When fleshly appetites stood in the way,
          however importunate they were, he utterly denied them and renounced
          them. They were no impediment in the way of his thorough pursuit of
          salvation. He would not be subject to the appetites of his body, but
          made them subject to his soul. 1 Cor. 9:27, “I keep under my body, and
          bring it into subjection.” Probably there never was a soldier, when he
          bore his part in storming a city, that acted with greater resolution
          and violence, as it were forcing his way through all that opposed him,
          than the apostle Paul in seeking the kingdom of heaven. We have not
          only his own word for it; the history we have of his life, written by
          St. Luke, shows the same. Now those who seek their salvation ought to
          follow this example. Persons who are concerned for their salvation,
          sometimes inquire what they shall do. Let them do as did the apostle
          Paul, seek salvation in the way he did, with the like violence and
          resolution. Those that make this inquiry, who are somewhat anxious
          year after year, and complain that they have not obtained any comfort,
          would do well to ask themselves whether they seek salvation in any
          measure in this way, with that resolution and violence of which he set
          them an example. Alas, are they not very far indeed from it? Can it in
          any proper sense be said, that the kingdom of heaven suffers violence
          at their hands?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The apostle did not only thus earnestly seek salvation before his
          conversion and hope, but afterwards also. What he says in the 3rd
          chapter of Philippians (Phil. 3) of his suffering the loss of all
          things, that he might be found in Christ, and its being the one thing
          that he did to seek salvation. And also what he says of his so running
          as not in vain, but as resolving to win the prize of salvation, and
          keeping under his body that he might not be a castaway were long after
          his conviction, and after he had renounced all hope of his own good
          estate by nature. If being a convinced sinner excuses a man from
          seeking salvation any more, or makes it reasonable that he should
          cease his earnest care and labor for it, certainly the apostle might
          have been excused, when he had not only already attained true grace,
          but such eminent degrees of it. To see one of the most eminent saints
          that ever lived, if not the most eminent of all, so exceedingly
          engaged in seeking his own salvation, ought forever to put to shame
          those who are a thousand degrees below him, and are but mere infants
          to him, if they have any grace at all, who yet excuse themselves from
          using any violence after the kingdom of heaven now because they have
          attained already, who free themselves from the burden of going on
          earnestly to seek salvation with this, that they have finished the
          work, they have obtained a hope. The apostle, as eminent as he was,
          did not say within himself, “I am converted, and so am sure of
          salvation. Christ has promised it me. Why need I labor any more to
          secure it? Yea, I am not only converted, but I have obtained great
          degrees of grace.” But still he is violent after salvation. He did not
          keep looking back on the extraordinary discoveries he enjoyed at his
          first conversion, and the past great experience he had had from time
          to time. He did not content himself with the thought that he possessed
          the most wonderful testimonies of God’s favor, and of the love of
          Christ, already, that ever any enjoyed, even to his being caught up to
          the third heavens. But he forgot the things that were behind. He acted
          as though he did not consider that he had yet attained an interest in
          Christ. Phil. 3:11, 12, 13, 14, “If by any means I might attain unto
          the resurrection of the dead; not as though I had already attained,
          either were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may
          apprehend that for which I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I
          count not myself to have apprehended; but this one thing I do,
          forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those
          things which are before. I press toward the mark for the prize of the
          high calling of God in Christ Jesus.” The apostle still sought that he
          might win Christ and his righteousness, and attain to his
          resurrection, not as though he had attained it already, or had already
          obtained a title to the crown. And this is especially the thing in
          which he calls on us to imitate his example in the text. It was not
          because Paul was at a loss whether he was truly converted or not, that
          he was still so earnest in seeking salvation. He not only thought that
          he was converted, and should go to heaven when he died, but he knew
          and spoke particularly about it in this very epistle, in the
          twenty-first verse of the first chapter (Phil. 1:21), “For me to live
          is Christ, but to die is gain.” And in the foregoing verse he says,
          “According to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I
          shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also
          Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by
          death.” The apostle knew that though he was converted, yet there
          remained a great work that he must do in order to his salvation. There
          was a narrow way to eternal glory, through which he must pass, and
          never could come to heaven in any other way. He knew it was absolutely
          necessary for him earnestly to seek salvation still. He knew there was
          no going to heaven in a slothful way. And therefore he did not seek
          salvation the less earnestly, for his having hope and assurance, but a
          great deal more. We nowhere read so much of his earnestness and
          violence for the kingdom of heaven before he was converted, as
          afterwards. The apostle’s hope was not of a nature to make him
          slothful. It had a contrary effect. The assurance he had of victory,
          together with the necessity there was of fighting, engaged him to
          fight not as one that beat the air, but as one that wrestled with
          principalities and powers. Now this example the apostle does
          especially insist in the text that we ought to follow. And this should
          induce all present who think themselves converted, to inquire whether
          they seek salvation never the less earnestly, because they think it is
          well with them, and that they are now sure of heaven. Most certainly
          if the apostle was in the right way of acting, we in this place are
          generally in the wrong. For nothing is more apparent than that it is
          not thus with the generality of professors here, but that it is a
          common thing after they think they are safe, to be far less diligent
          and earnest in religion than before.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The apostle did not only diligently seek heaven after he knew he
          was converted, but was earnestly cautious lest he should be damned, as
          appears by the passage already cited. “But I keep under my body and
          bring it into subjection, lest by any means, when I have preached to
          others, I myself should be a castaway.” Here you see the apostle is
          very careful lest he should be a castaway, and denies his carnal
          appetites, and mortifies his flesh, for that reason. He did not say,
          “I am safe, I am sure I shall never be lost; why need I take any
          further care respecting it?” Many think because they suppose
          themselves converted, and so safe, that they have nothing to do with
          the awful threatenings of God’s Word, and those terrible denunciations
          of damnation that are contained in it. When they hear them, they hear
          them as things which belong only to others, and not at all to
          themselves, as though there were no application of what is revealed in
          the Scripture respecting hell, to the godly. And therefore, when they
          hear awakening sermons about the awful things that God has threatened
          to the wicked, they do not hear them for themselves, but only for
          others. But it was not thus with this holy apostle, who certainly was
          as safe from hell, and as far from a damnable state, as any of us. He
          looked upon himself as still nearly concerned in God’s threatenings of
          eternal damnation, notwithstanding all his hope, and all his eminent
          holiness, and therefore gave great diligence, that he might avoid
          eternal damnation. For he considered that eternal misery was as
          certainly connected with a wicked life as ever it was, and that it was
          absolutely necessary that he should still keep under his body, and
          bring it into subjection, in order that he might not be damned,
          because indulging the lusts of the body and being damned were more
          surely connected together. The apostle knew that this conditional
          proposition was true concerning him, as ever it was. “If I live
          wickedly, or do not live in a way of universal obedience to God’s
          commands, I shall certainly be a castaway.” This is evident because
          the apostle mentions a proposition of this nature concerning himself
          in that very chapter where he says, he kept under his body lest he
          should be a castaway. 1 Cor. 9:16, “For though I preach the gospel, I
          have nothing to glory of, for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is
          unto me if I preach not the gospel.” What necessity was there upon the
          apostle to preach the gospel, though God had commanded him, for he was
          already converted, and was safe. And if he had neglected to preach the
          gospel, how could he have perished after he was converted? But yet
          this conditional proposition was still true. If he did not live a life
          of obedience to God, woe would be to him; woe to him, if he did not
          preach the gospel. The connection still held. It is impossible a man
          should go anywhere else than to hell in a way of disobedience to God.
          And therefore he deemed it necessary for him to preach the gospel on
          that account, and on the same account he deemed it necessary to keep
          under his body, lest he should be a castaway. The connection between a
          wicked life and damnation is so certain, that if a man lives a wicked
          life, it proves that all his supposed experiences are nothing. If a
          man at the last day be found a worker of iniquity, nothing else will
          be inquired of about him. Let him pretend what he will, Christ will
          say to him and all others like him, “Depart from me, I know you not,
          ye that work iniquity.” And God has revealed these threatenings and
          this connection, not only to deter wicked men, but also godly men,
          from sin. And though God will keep men that are converted from
          damnation, yet this is the means by which he will keep them from it;
          viz. he will keep them from a wicked life. And though he will keep
          them from a wicked life, yet this is one means by which he will keep
          them from it, viz. by their own caution to avoid damnation, and by his
          threatenings of damnation if they should live a wicked life. We have
          another remarkable instance in Job, who was an eminently holy man, yet
          avoided sin with the utmost care, because he would avoid destruction
          from God. Job 31. Surely we have as much cause to be cautious, that we
          do not expose ourselves to destruction from God, as holy Job had. We
          have not a greater stock of goodness than he. The apostle directs
          Christians to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling.
          Phil. 2:12. And it is spoken of as the character of a true saint, that
          he trembles at God’s Word; Isa. 66:2, which is to tremble especially
          at the awful threatenings of it, as Job did. Whereas the manner of
          many now is, whenever they think they are converted, to throw by those
          threatenings of God’s Word, as if they had no more to do with them,
          because the suppose they are converted, and out of danger. Christ gave
          his disciples, even those of them that were converted, as well as
          others, directions to strive for salvation because broad was the way
          that leads to destruction, and men are so apt to walk in that way and
          be damned. Mat. 7:13, 14, “Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is
          the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many
          there be which go in thereat; because strait is the gate, and narrow
          is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.”

        <p>
          4. The apostle did not seek salvation by his own righteousness. Though
          his sufferings were so very great, his labors so exceedingly abundant,
          yet he never accounted them as righteousness. He trod it under his
          feet, as utterly insufficient to recommend him to God. He gave
          diligence that he might be found in Christ, not having on his own
          righteousness, which is of God, through faith, as in the foregoing
          part of the chapter from which the text is taken, beginning with the
          fourth verse (Phil. 3:4), “Though I might also have confidence in the
          flesh. If any other man thinketh he hath whereof he might trust in the
          flesh, I more; circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of
          the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law,
          a Pharisee; concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the
          righteousness which is in the law, blameless. But what things were
          gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea, doubtless, and I
          count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of
          Christ Jesus, my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of all
          things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be
          found in him, not having on mine own righteousness, which is of the
          law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness
          which is of God by faith; that I may know him, and the power of his
          resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made
          conformable unto his death; if by any means I might attain unto the
          resurrection of the dead. Not as though I had already attained, either
          were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that
          for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.”
        </p>
        <p>
          5.. In those earnest labors which he performed, he had respect to the
          recompense of the reward. He did it for an incorruptible crown. 1 Cor
          9:25. He sought a high degree of glory, for he knew the more he
          labored the more he should be rewarded, as appears from what he tells
          the Corinthians. “He that soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly;
          and he that soweth bountifully, shall reap also bountifully.” And 1
          Cor. 3:8, “Every man shall receive his own reward, according to his
          own labour.” That he had respect to that crown of glory, which is
          Master had promised, in those great labors and sufferings, is evident
          from what he says to Timothy, a little before his death. 2 Tim. 4:7,
          8, “ I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
          kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
          righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at
          that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his
          appearing.” All Christians should follow his example in this also.
          They should not content themselves with the thought that they have
          goodness enough to carry them to heaven, but should earnestly seek
          high degrees of glory. For the higher degrees of glory are promised to
          extraordinary labors for God, for no other reason, but that we should
          seek them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, I proceed to mention some of the virtues of Paul, that more
          immediately respect God and Christ, in which we ought to follow his
          example.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He was strong in faith. It may be truly said of him that he lived
          by faith. His faith seemed to be even without the least appearance of
          diffidence or doubt in his words or actions, but all seemed to
          proclaim, that he had God and Christ and the invisible world
          continually in view. Such a faith, that was in continual exercise in
          him, he professes in 2 Cor. 5:6, 7, 8, “Therefore we are always
          confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are
          absent from the Lord. For we walk by faith, not by sight. We are
          confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and
          to be present with the Lord.” He always speaks of God and Christ and
          things invisible and future, as if he certainly knew them, and then
          saw them as fully and certainly as we see anything that is immediately
          before our bodily eyes. He spoke as though he certainly knew that
          God’s promise of eternal life should be accomplished, and gives this
          as the reason why he labored so abundantly, and endured all manner of
          temporal sufferings and death, and was always delivered unto death for
          Christ’s sake. 2 Cor. 4:11, etc. “For we which live are always
          delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus
          might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.” He speaks of his earnest
          expectation and hope of the fulfillment of God’s promises. And a
          little before his death, when he was a prisoner, and when he knew that
          he was like to bear the trial of martyrdom, which is the greatest
          trial of faith, he expresses his faith in Christ in the strongest
          terms. 2 Tim. 1:12, “For the which cause I also suffer these things;
          nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and am
          persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him
          against that day.” Such an example may well make us ashamed; for how
          weak and unsteady is the faith of most Christians! If now and then
          there seems to be a lively exercise of faith, giving the person at
          that time a firm persuasion and confidence; yet how short are such
          exercises, how soon do they vanish! How often is faith shaken with one
          temptation. How often are the exercises of it interrupted with
          doubting, and how much is exhibited of a diffident, vibrating spirit!
          How little does our faith accomplish in times of trial. How often and
          how easily is our confidence in God shaken and interrupted, and how
          frequently does unbelief prevail! This is much to the dishonor of our
          Savior Jesus Christ, as well as very painful to us. What a happy and
          glorious lot it is to live such a life of faith, as Paul lived! How
          far did he soar on the wings of his strong faith above those little
          difficulties, that continually molest us, and are ready to overcome
          us! Seeing we have such a blessed example set before us in the
          Scriptures, let it prompt us earnestly to seek, that we may soar
          higher also.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Another virtue in which we should follow his example is his great
          love to Christ. The Corinthians, who saw how the apostle acted, how he
          labored, and how he suffered, and could see no worldly motive, were
          astonished. They wondered what it was that so wonderfully influenced
          and actuated the man. The apostle says that he was a spectacle to the
          world. But this was the immediate principle that moved him: His
          strong, his intense love to his glorious Lord and Master. This love
          constrained him, that he could do nothing else than strive and labor
          and seek for his salvation. This account he gives of it himself. 2
          Cor. 5:14, “The love of Christ constraineth us.” He had such a delight
          in the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the knowledge and contemplation of
          him, that he tells us, he “counted all things but loss for the
          excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus.” He speaks in very
          positive terms. He does not say merely that he hopes he loves Christ,
          so as to despise other things in comparison of the knowledge of him.
          But “yea, doubtless, I count all things but loss for the excellency of
          the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord.” And he assigns this reason
          why he even gloried in his sufferings for Christ’s sake, because the
          love of God was shed abroad in his heart, by the Holy Ghost. Rom. 5:5.
          This expression seems to imply that he sensibly felt that holy
          affection, sweetly and powerfully diffused in his soul, like some
          precious, fragrant ointment. And how does he triumph in his love to
          Christ in the midst of his sufferings! Rom. 8:35, 36, 37, “Who shall
          separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress,
          or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is
          written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted
          as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than
          conquerors, through him that hath loved us.” May not this make us
          ashamed of our cold, dead hearts that we hear so often of Christ, and
          of his glorious excellencies and his wonderful love, with so little
          emotion, our hearts, being very commonly frozen up like a clod of
          earth by worldly affections. And it may be that now and then with much
          difficulty we persuade ourselves to do a little or expend a little for
          the advancement of Christ’s kingdom. And then are ready to boast of
          it, that we have done so nobly. Such superior examples as we have are
          enough to make us forever blush for our own attainments in the love of
          Christ, and rouse us earnestly to follow after those who have gone so
          far beyond us.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The apostle lived in a day when Christianity was greatly despised.
          Yet he was not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Christians were
          everywhere despised by the great men of the world. Almost all those
          that made any figure in the world, men in honorable stations, men of
          learning, and men of wealth, despised Christianity, and accounted it a
          mean, contemptible thing to be a Christian, a follower and worshipper
          of a poor, crucified man. To be a Christian was regarded as what
          ruined a man’s reputation. Christians were everywhere looked upon as
          fools, and were derided and mocked. They were the meanest of mankind,
          the offscouring of the world. This was a great temptation to
          Christians to be ashamed of the gospel. And the apostle Paul was more
          especially in such circumstances, as exposed him to this temptation.
          For before he was a Christian, he was in great reputation among his
          own countrymen. He was esteemed a young man of more than ordinary
          proficiency in learning, and was a man of high distinction among the
          Pharisees, a class of men of the first standing among the Jews. In
          times when religion is much despised, great men are more ready to be
          ashamed of it than others. Many of the great seem to think that to
          appear religious men would make them look little. They do not know how
          to comply with showing a devout spirit, a spirit of supreme love to
          God, and a strict regard to God’s commands. But yet the apostle was
          not ashamed of the gospel of Christ anywhere, or before any person. He
          was not ashamed of it among his own countrymen, the Jews, before their
          rulers, and scribes, and great men, but ever boldly professed it, and
          confronted them in their opposition. When he was at Athens, the chief
          seat of learning and of learned men in the world, though the learned
          men and philosophers there despised his doctrine, and called him a
          babbler for preaching the gospel. Yet he felt no shame, but boldly
          disputed with and confounded those great philosophers, and converted
          some of them. And when he came to Rome, the metropolis and mistress of
          the world, where resided the emperor, and senators, and the chief
          rulers of the world, he was not ashamed of the gospel there. He tells
          the Romans; “I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome
          also. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the
          power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.” The apostle
          was greatly derided and despised for preaching a crucified Jesus. 1
          Cor. 4:13, “We are made as the filth of the world, and are the
          offscouring of all things unto this day.” And in the tenth verse he
          says, “We are fools for Christ’s sake.” They were where every
          accounted and called fools. Yet the apostle was so far from being
          ashamed of the crucified Jesus, that he gloried in him above all
          things. Gal. 6:14, “God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross
          of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Here is an example for us to follow, if at
          any time we fall in among those who hold religion in contempt, and
          will despise us for our pretensions to religion, and will be ready to
          deride us for being so precise, and look upon us as fools; that we may
          not be ashamed of religion, and yield to sinful compliances with vain
          and loose persons, lest we should appear singular, and be looked upon
          as ridiculous. Such a meanness of spirit possesses many persons who
          are not worthy to be called Christians; and are such as Christ will be
          ashamed of when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy
          angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Another virtue in which we ought to follow the apostle was his
          contempt of the world, and his heavenly-mindedness. He contemned all
          the vain enjoyments of the world. He despised it riches. Acts. 20:33,
          “I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.” He despised the
          pleasures of the world. “I keep under my body.” The apostle’s
          pleasures were in the sufferings of his body, instead of the
          gratification of its carnal appetites. 2 Cor. 12:10, “Therefore I take
          pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in
          persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake.” He despised the
          honors of the world. 1 Thes. 2:6, “Nor of men sought we glory; neither
          of you, nor yet of others.” He declares that the world was crucified
          unto him, and he unto the world. These were not the things that the
          apostle sought, but the things that were above, that were out of sight
          to other men. 2 Cor. 4:18, “While we look not at the things which are
          seen, but at the things which are not seen.” He longed greatly after
          heaven. 2 Cor. 5:4, “For we that are in this tabernacle do groan,
          being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon,
          that mortality might be swallowed up in life.” And he tells us that he
          knew no man after the flesh. That is, he did not look upon the men or
          things of this world, or regard them as related to the world, or as
          they respected the present life. But he considered all men and all
          things as they had relation to a spiritual nature, and to another
          world. In this the apostle acted as becomes a Christian. For
          Christians, those that are indeed so, are people that belong not to
          this world, and therefore, it is very unbecoming in them to have their
          minds taken up about these things. The example of Paul may make all
          such persons ashamed, who have their minds chiefly occupied about the
          things of the world, about gaining estates, or acquiring honors. And
          yet would be accounted fellow-disciples with the apostle, partakers of
          the same labors, and fellow-heirs of the same heavenly inheritance.
          And it should prompt us to strive for more indifference to the world,
          and for more heavenly-mindedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. We ought also to follow the example of the apostle in his abounding
          in prayer and praise. He was very earnest, and greatly engaged in
          those duties, and continued in them, as appears from many passages.
          Rom. 1:8, “First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all,
          that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. For God is my
          witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that
          without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.” Eph.
          1:15, 16, “Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord
          Jesus and love unto all the saints, cease not to give thanks for you,
          making mention of you in my prayers.” Col. 1:3, “We give thanks to
          God, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you.”
          1 Thes. 1:2, 3, “We give thanks to God always for you all, making
          mention of you in our prayers; remembering without ceasing your work
          of faith and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus
          Christ, in the sight of God and our Father.” And 1 Thes. 3:9, 10, “For
          what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy
          wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; night and day praying
          exceedingly, that we might see your face, and might perfect that which
          is lacking in your faith?” 2 Tim. 1:3, “I thank God, whom I serve from
          my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have
          remembrance of thee in my prayers, night and day.”
        </p>
        <p>
          6. We ought to follow him in his contentment under the allotments of
          Divine Providence. He was the subject of a vast variety of
          dispensations of Providence. He went through a great many changes, and
          was almost continually in suffering circumstances, sometimes in one
          respect, sometimes in another, and sometimes the subject of a great
          many kinds of suffering together. But yet he had attained to such a
          degree of submission to the will of God, as to be contented in every
          condition, and under all dispensations towards him. Phil. 4:11, 12,
          13, “Not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned in
          whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be
          abased, and I know how to abound. Every where, and in all things, I am
          instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to
          suffer need. I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth
          me.” What a blessed temper and disposition of mind was this to which
          Paul had arrived. And how happy is that man of whom it can now be said
          with truth! He is, as it were, out the reach of every evil. Nothing
          can touch him so as to disturb his rest, for he rests in everything
          that God orders.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. We should follow the apostle in his great caution in giving an
          account of his experience, not to represent more of himself in his
          words, than men should see in his deeds. In 2 Corinthians he gives
          somewhat of an account how he had been favored with visions and
          revelations, and had been caught up to the third heavens. And in the
          sixth verse (2 Cor. 12:6), intimating that he could relate more, he
          breaks off, and forbears to say anything further respecting his
          experience. And he gives this reason for it; viz. that he would avoid,
          in what he relates of himself, giving occasion for anyone to be
          disappointed in him, in expecting more from him, by his own account of
          his experience and revelations, than he should see or hear of him in
          his conversation. His words are, “for though I would desire to glory,
          I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth; but now I forbear,
          lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be; or
          that he heareth of me.” Some may wonder at this in such a man as the
          apostle, and may say, Why should a man so eminent in his conversation,
          be so cautious in this matter? Why need he be afraid to declare all
          the extraordinary things that he had witnessed, since his life was so
          agreeable, so eminently answerable to his experience? But yet you see
          the apostle forbore upon this very account. He knew there was great
          need of caution in this matter. He knew that if in giving an account
          of his extraordinary revelations, he should give rise to an
          expectation of too great things in his conversation, and should not
          live answerably to that expectation, it would greatly wound religion.
          He knew that its enemies would be ready to say presently, “Who is
          this? The man that gives so extraordinary an account of his visions
          and revelations, and peculiar tokens of God’s favor to him, does he
          live no more conformably to it?” But if such a man as the apostle, so
          eminent in his life, was so cautious in this respect; surely we have
          need to be cautious, who fail so much more in our example than he did,
          and in whose conversation the enemy may find so much more occasion to
          speak reproachfully of religion. This teaches us that it would be
          better to refrain wholly from boasting of our experience than to
          represent ourselves as better than our deeds and conversation
          represent us. For men will compare one with the other. And if they do
          not see a correspondence between them, this will be much more to the
          dishonor of God than our account will be to his honor. Let Christians,
          therefore, be warned to be ever cautious in this respect, after the
          great example of the apostle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, I shall mention some of those virtues of the apostle that more
          immediately respected men, in which we ought to follow his example.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. His meekness under abuses and his love to his enemies. There were
          multitudes that hated him, but there is no appearance of his hating
          any. The greater part of the world where he went were his enemies. But
          he was the friend of everyone and labored and prayed earnestly for the
          good of all. And when he was reproached and derided and buffeted,
          still it was with meekness and gentleness of spirit that he bore all,
          and wished well to them none the less, and sought their good. 1 Cor.
          4:12, 13, “Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;
          being defamed, we entreat.” In that period of his great sufferings
          when he went up to Jerusalem, and there was such an uproar about him,
          and the people were in so furious a rage against him, eagerly
          thirsting for his blood; he discovered no anger or ill will towards
          his persecutors. At that time when he was a prisoner through their
          malice, and stood before king Agrippa, and Agrippa said, “Almost thou
          persuadest me to be a Christian;” and his blood-thirsty enemies were
          standing by; he replied, “I would to God, that not only thou, but also
          all that hear me this day, were both almost and altogether such as I
          am, except these bonds.” He wished that his accusers, and those who
          had bound themselves with an oath that they would neither eat nor
          drink till they had killed him, had all of them as great privileges
          and as much of the favor of heaven as himself. And that they were
          altogether as he was, except his bonds and imprisonment, and those
          afflictions which they had brought upon him. He did not desire that
          they should be like him in that affliction, though it was the fruit of
          their own cruelty. And when some of the Corinthians, whom he had
          instructed and converted from heathenism, had dealt ill by him, had
          hearkened to some false teachers, that had been among them, who hated
          and reproached the apostle, he tells them, in 2 Cor. 12:15,
          notwithstanding these abuses, that still he would very gladly spend
          and be spent for them, though the more abundantly he loved them, the
          less he should be loved by them. If they returned him no thanks for
          his love, but only ill will and ill treatment, still he stood ready to
          spend and be spent for them. And though the apostle was so hated, and
          had suffered so many abuses from the unbelieving Jews, yet how does he
          express his love to them? He prayed earnestly for them. Rom. 10:1,
          “Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they
          might be saved.” And he went mourning for them. He went about with a
          heavy heart, and with continual grief and sorrow, from compassion for
          them, under the calamities of which they were the subjects. And he
          declares in the most solemn manner, that he had so great desire for
          their salvation, that he could find it in his heart to wish himself
          accursed from Christ for them, and to be offered up a sacrifice, if
          that might be a means of their salvation. Rom. 9:1, 2, 3. We are to
          understand it of a temporal curse. He could be willing to die an
          accursed death, and so be made a curse for a time, as Christ was, if
          that might be a means of salvation to them. How are those reproved by
          this, who, when they are abused and suffer reproach or injury, have
          thereby indulged a spirit of hatred against their neighbor, a
          prejudice whereby they are always apt to entertain a distrust, and to
          seek and embrace opportunities against them, and to be sorry for their
          prosperity, and glad at their disappointments.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He delighted in peace. When any contention happened among
          Christians, he was exceedingly grieved by it. As when he heard of the
          contentions that broke out in the Corinthian church. He intimates to
          the Philippians, how he should rejoice at their living in love and
          peace, and therefore earnestly entreats them that they should so live.
          Phil. 2:1, 2, “If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any
          comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and
          mercies, fulfil ye my joy, the ye be like-minded, having the same
          love, being of one accord, of one mind.” And he studied those things
          that should make for peace. To that end he yielded to everyone as much
          as possible in those things that were lawful, and complied with the
          weakness and humors of others oftentimes, for the sake of peace. He
          declares that though he was free from all men, yet he had made himself
          servant of all. To the Jews he became as a Jew; to them that were
          under the law, as under the law; to them that were without law, as
          without law; to the weak he became as weak. He rather chose to please
          others than himself, for the sake of peace, and the good of their
          souls. 1 Cor. 10:33, “Even as I please all men in all things, not
          seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be
          saved.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. He was of a most tender compassionate spirit towards any that were
          in affliction. He showed such a spirit especially in the case of the
          incestuous Corinthian. The crime was very great, and the fault of the
          church was great in suffering such wickedness among them, and this
          occasioned the apostle to write with some sharpness to them respecting
          it. But when the apostle perceived that his reproof was laid to heart
          by the Corinthian Christians, and that they repented and their hearts
          were filled with sorrow, though he rejoiced at it, yet he was so
          affected with their sorrow, that his heart yearned towards them, and
          he was almost ready to repent that he had written so severely to them.
          He was full of concern about it, lest his former letter should have
          filled them with overmuch sorrow. “For though I made you sorry with a
          letter, I do not repent, though I did repent; for I perceive that the
          same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.” So
          he had compassion for the incestuous man, though he had been guilty of
          so file a crime, and was greatly concerned that he should be
          comforted. Whenever any Christian suffered or was hurt, the apostle
          says he felt it and suffered himself. 2 Cor. 11:29, “Who is weak, and
          I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. He rejoiced at others’ prosperity and joy. When he saw the soul of
          anyone comforted, the apostle was a sharer with him. His soul was
          comforted also. When he saw any Christian refreshed in his spirit, his
          own spirit was refreshed. 2 Cor. 7:6, 7, “Nevertheless, God that
          comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of
          Titus; and not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he
          was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your
          mourning, your fervent mind toward me, so that I rejoiced the more.”
          “Therefore we were comforted in your comfort; yea, and exceedingly the
          more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed
          by you all.”
        </p>
        <p>
          5. He delighted in the fellowship of God’s people. He longed after
          them when absent. Phil. 1:8, “For God is my record how greatly I long
          after you in the bowels of Christ.” And also, “Therefore, my brethren,
          dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown.” So Rom. 1:11, 12,
          “For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
          gift, to the end ye may be established; that is, that I may be
          comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.”
        </p>
        <p>
          6. He was truly courteous in his behavior towards others. Though he
          was so great a man, and had so much honor put upon him of God, yet he
          was full of courtesy towards all men, rendering to all suitable
          respect. Thus when he was called before Jewish or heathen magistrates,
          he treated them with the honor and respect due to their places. When
          the Jews took him in the temple, though they behaved themselves more
          like devils than men, yet he addressed them in terms of high respect,
          “Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence:” calling the common
          Jews his brethren, and saluting the elders and scribes with the title
          of fathers, though they were a body of infidels. So when he pleads his
          cause before Festus, a heathen governor, he gives him the title that
          belonged to him in his station; calling him, “Most noble Festus.” His
          courtesy also appears in his salutations in his epistles. He is
          particularly careful to mention many persons, directing that his
          salutations should be given to them. Such a degree of courtesy, in so
          great a person as this apostle, reproves all those professing
          Christians, who, though far below him, are not courteous and
          respectful in their behavior to their neighbors, and especially to
          their superiors. Incivility is here reproved, and the too common
          neglect of Christians is reproved, who do not take strict care, that
          their children are taught good manners, and politeness, and brought up
          in a respectful and courteous behavior towards others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, I shall mention those virtues of the apostle that respected
          both God and men, in which we should imitate his example.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He was a man of a most public spirit. He was greatly concerned for
          the prosperity of Christ’s kingdom, and the good of his church. We see
          a great many men wholly engaged in pursuit of their worldly interests.
          Many who are earnest in the pursuit of the carnal pleasures, many who
          are eager in the pursuit of honors, and many who are violent in the
          pursuit of gain. But we probably never saw any man more engaged to
          advance his estate, nor more taken up with his pleasures, nor more
          greedy of honor, than the apostle Paul was about the flourishing of
          Christ’s kingdom, and the good of the souls of men. The things that
          grieve other men are outward crosses: losses in estates, or falling
          under contempt, or bodily sufferings. But these things grieved not
          him. He made little account of them. The things that grieved him were
          those that hurt the interests of religion. And about those his tears
          were shed. Thus he was exceedingly grieved, and wept greatly, for the
          corruptions that had crept into the church of Corinth, which was the
          occasion of his writing his first epistle to them. 2 Cor. 2:4, “For
          out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote unto you, with
          many tears.” The things about which other men are jealous, are their
          worldly advantages and pleasures. If these are threatened, their
          jealously is excited, since they are above all things, dear to them.
          But the things that kindled the apostle’s jealousy, were those that
          seemed to threaten the interests of religion, and the good of the
          church: 2 Cor. 11:2, 3, “For I am jealous over you with a godly
          jealousy; for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present
          you as a chaste virgin to Christ. But I fear, lest by any means, as
          the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be
          corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.” The things at which
          other men rejoice are their amassing earthly treasures, their being
          advanced to honors, their being possessed of outward pleasures and
          delights. But these excited not the apostle’s joy; but when he saw or
          heard of anything by which the interests of religion were promoted,
          and the church of Christ prospered, then he rejoiced: 1 Thes. 1:3,
          “Remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love,
          and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and
          our Father.” And chapter 2:20, “Ye are our glory and joy.” He rejoiced
          at those things, however dear they cost him, how much soever he lost
          by them in his temporal interest, if the welfare of religion and the
          good of souls were promoted. Phil. 2:16, 17, “Holding forth the word
          of life, that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run
          in vain, neither laboured in vain. Yea, and if I be offered upon the
          sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all.”
          He rejoiced at the steadfastness of saints: Col. 2:5, “For though I be
          absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and
          beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.”
          And he rejoiced at the conviction of sinners, and in whatever tended
          to it. He rejoiced at any good which was done, though by others, and
          though it was done accidentally by his enemies. Phil. 1:15, 16, 17,
          18, “Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also
          of good will. The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely,
          supposing to add affliction to my bonds. But the other of love,
          knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. What then?
          notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is
          preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.” When the
          apostle heard anything of this nature, it was good news to him: 1
          Thes. 3:6, 7, “But now, when Timotheus came from you unto us, and
          brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have
          good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also
          you; therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our
          affliction and distress by your faith.” When he heard such tidings,
          his heart was wont to be enlarged in the praises of God: Col. 1:3, 4,
          “We give thanks to God and the Father or our Lord Jesus Christ,
          praying always for you, since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,
          and of the love which ye have to all the saints.” He was not only wont
          to praise God when he first heard such tidings, but as often as he
          thought of such things, they were so joyful to him, that he readily
          praised God. Phil. 1:3, 4, 5, “I thank my God upon every remembrance
          of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with
          joy, for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now.”
          Let us compare ourselves with such an example, and examine how far we
          are of such spirit. Let those on this occasion reflect upon
          themselves, whose hearts are chiefly engaged in their own private
          temporal concerns, and are not much concerned respecting the interests
          of religion and the church of Christ, if they can obtain their private
          aims; who are greatly grieved when things go contrary to their worldly
          prosperity, who see religion, as it were, weltering in its blood,
          without much sorrow of heart. It may be, that they will say; It is
          greatly to be lamented that there is such declension, and it is a
          sorrowful thing that sin so much prevails. But if we would look into
          their hearts, how cold and careless should we see them. Those words
          are words of course. They express themselves thus chiefly, because
          they think it creditable to lament the decay of religion. But they are
          ten times as much concerned about other things as these, about their
          own private interest, or some secular affairs of the town. If anything
          seems to threaten their being disappointed in these things, how
          readily are they excited and alarmed. But how quiet and easy in their
          spirit, notwithstanding all the dark clouds that appear over the cause
          and kingdom of Christ, and the salvation of those around them! How
          quick and how high is their zeal against those, who, they think,
          unjustly oppose them in their temporal interests. But how low is their
          zeal, comparatively, against those things that are exceedingly
          pernicious of the interests of religion! If their own credit is
          touched, how are they awakened! But they can see the credit of
          religion wounded, and bleeding, and dying, with little hearty concern.
          Most men are of a private, narrow spirit. They are not of the spirit
          of the apostle Paul, nor of the psalmist, who preferred Jerusalem
          before his chief joy. Psa. 137:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We ought to follow the apostle in his diligent and laborious
          endeavors to do good. We see multitudes incessantly laboring and
          striving after the world. But not more than the apostle labored to
          advance the kingdom of his dear Master and the good of his
          fellow-creatures. His work was very great, and attended with great
          difficulties and opposition. And his labor was answerably great. He
          labored abundantly more than any of the apostles: 1 Cor. 15:10, “I
          laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of
          God which was with me.” How great were the pains he took in preaching
          and in traveling from place to place over so great part of the world,
          by sea and land, and probably for the most part on foot, when he
          traveled by land: instructing and converting the heathen, disputing
          with gainsayers, and heathen Jews, and heretics, strenuously opposing
          and fighting against the enemies of the church of Christ, wrestling
          not with flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers,
          against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
          wickedness in high placed; acting the part of a good soldier, as one
          that goes a warfare, putting on Christ and using the whole armor of
          God, laboring to establish and confirm and build up the saints,
          reclaiming those that were wandering, delivering those that were
          ensnared, enlightening the dark, comforting the disconsolate, and
          succoring the tempted, rectifying disorders that had happened in
          churches, exercising ecclesiastical discipline towards offenders, and
          admonishing the saints of the covenant of grace, opening and applying
          the Scriptures, ordaining persons and giving them directions, and
          assisting those that were ordained, and writing epistles, and sending
          messengers to one and another part of the church of Christ! He had the
          care of the churches lying continually upon him. 2 Cor. 11:28,
          “Besides those things that are without, that which cometh upon me
          daily, the care of all the churches.” These things occasioned him to
          be continually engaged in earnest labor. He continued in it night and
          day, sometimes almost the whole night, preaching and admonishing, as
          appears by Acts 20:7,11, “And upon the first day of the week, when the
          disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready
          to depart on the morrow, and continued his speech until midnight. When
          he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and
          talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.” And he
          did all freely, without any view to any temporal gain. He tells the
          Corinthians that he would gladly spend and be spent for them. Besides
          his laboring in the work of the gospel, he labored very much, yea,
          sometimes night and day, in a handicraft trade to procure subsistence,
          that he might not be chargeable to others, and so hinder the gospel of
          Christ: 1 Thes. 2:9, “For ye remember, brethren, our labour and
          travail, for labouring night and day, because we would not be
          chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.”
          And he continued this course of labor as long as he lived. He never
          was weary in well-doing; and though he met with continual opposition,
          and thousands of difficulties, yet nothing discouraged him. But he
          kept on, pressing forward in this course of hard, constant labor to
          the end of his life, as appears by what he says just before his death,
          2 Tim. 4:6, 7, “I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my
          departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my
          course, I have kept the faith.” And the effects and fruits of the
          apostle’s labors witnessed for him. The world was blessed by the good
          he did; not one nation only, but multitudes of nations. The effects of
          his labors were so great in so many nations before he had labored
          twenty years that the heathens called it his turning the world upside
          down. Acts 27:6. This very man was the chief instrument in that great
          work of God, the calling of the Gentiles, and the conversion of the
          Roman world. And he seems to have done more good, far more good, than
          any other man ever did from the beginning of the world to this day. He
          lived after his conversion not much more than thirty years. And in
          those thirty years he did more than a thousand men commonly do in an
          age. This example may well make us reflect upon ourselves, and
          consider how little we do for Christ, and for our fellow-creatures. We
          profess to be Christians as well as the apostle Paul, and Christ is
          worthy that we should serve him as Paul did. But how small are our
          labors for God and Christ and our fellow creatures! Though many of us
          keep ourselves busy, how are our labor and strength spent, and with
          what is our time filled up? Let us consider ourselves a little, and
          the manner of spending our time. We labor to provide for ourselves and
          families, to maintain ourselves in credit, and to make our part good
          among men. But is that all for which we are sent into the world? Did
          he who made us and gave us our powers of mind and strength of body,
          and who gives us our time and our talents, give them to us chiefly to
          be spent in this manner; or in serving him? Many years have rolled
          over the heads of some of us, and what have we lived for? What have we
          been doing all this time? How much is the world the better for us?
          Were we here only to eat and to drink, and to devour the good which
          the earth produces? Many of the blessings of Providence have been
          conferred upon us. And where is the good that we have done in return?
          If we had never been born, or if we had died in infancy, of how much
          good would the world have been deprived of? Such reflections should be
          made with concern, by those who pretend to be Christians. For
          certainly God does not plant vines in his vineyard, except for the
          fruit which he expects they should bring forth. He does not hire
          laborers into his vineyard, but to do service. They who live only for
          themselves, live in vain, and shall at last be cut down as cumberers
          of the earth. Let the example of Paul make us more diligent to do good
          for the time to come. Men that do but little good are very ready to
          excuse themselves, and to say that God has not succeeded their
          endeavors. But is it any wonder that we have not been succeeded, when
          we have been no more engaged? When God sees any person thoroughly and
          earnestly engaged, continuing in it, and really faithful, he is wont
          to succeed them in some good measure. You see how wonderfully he
          succeeded the great labors of the apostle.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. He did not only encounter great labors, but he exercised also his
          utmost skill and contrivance for the glory of God, and the good of his
          fellow-creatures. 2 Cor. 12:16, “Being crafty, I caught you with
          guile.” How do the men of the world not only willingly labor to obtain
          worldly good, but how much craft and subtlety do they use? And let us
          consider how it is here among ourselves. How many are our contrivances
          to secure and advance our own worldly concerns! Who can reckon up the
          number of all the schemes that have been formed among us, to gain
          money, and honors, and accomplish particular worldly designs? How
          subtle are we to avoid those things that might hurt us in our worldly
          interest, and to baffle the designs of those who may be endeavoring to
          hurt us! But how little is contrived for the advancement of religion,
          and the good of our neighbors! How many schemes are laid by men to
          promote their worldly designs, where one is laid for the advancement
          of the kingdom of Christ, and the good of men! How frequent are the
          meetings of neighbors to determine how they may best advance such and
          such worldly affairs! But how seldom are there such meetings to revive
          sinking religion, to maintain and advance the credit of the gospel,
          and to accomplish charitable designs for the advancement of Christ’s
          kingdom, and the comfort and well-being of mankind! May not these
          considerations justly be a source of lamentation? How many men are
          wise in promoting their worldly interests. But what a shame is it that
          so few show themselves wise as serpents and harmless as doves for
          Christ! And how commonly is it the reverse of what the apostle advises
          the Christian Romans, “I would have you wise unto that which is good,
          and simple concerning evil.” Is it not often on the contrary with
          professing Christians, as it was with the people of Judah and
          Jerusalem. “They are wise to do evil, but to do good, they have no
          knowledge?”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The apostle Paul did willingly forego those thing that were in
          themselves lawful, for the furtherance of the interests of religion
          and the good of men. Thus marriage was a thing lawful for the apostle
          Paul as well as for other men, as he himself asserts. But he did not
          use the liberty he had in this matter because he thought he might be
          under greater advantages to spread the gospel in a single than a
          married state. So it was lawful for the apostle to take the other
          course of life, as in eating and drinking, and freely using all kinds
          of wholesome food. And it was in itself a lawful thing for the apostle
          to demand a maintenance of those to whom he preached. But he forbore
          those things because he supposed that in his circumstances, and in the
          circumstances of the church of Christ in that day, he could more
          advance the interests of religion and the good of men without them.
          For the gospel’s sake, and for the good of men, he was willing to
          forego all the outward advantages he could derive from them. 1 Cor.
          8:13, “Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no meat
          while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.” He would
          not only avoid those things that were useless in themselves, but those
          also that gave any occasion to sin, or which led or exposed either
          himself or others to sin. Then it follows in the next chapter, “Am I
          not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?
          Are not ye my work in the Lord? If I be not an apostle unto others,
          yet doubtless I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in
          the Lord. Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, Have we not
          power to eat and to drink? Have we not power to lead about a sister, a
          wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and
          Cephas? Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?”
          The apostle did not only forbear some little things, but he put
          himself to great difficulties by forbearing those thing that were in
          themselves lawful. It cost him a great deal of labor of body to
          maintain himself. But yet he willingly labored, working with his own
          hands. And as he says, though he was free from all men, yet he made
          himself the servant of all, that he might gain the more. Let this
          induce such persons to consider themselves, whether they act
          altogether as become Christians, who look upon it as a sufficient
          excuse for all the liberties they take, that the things in which they
          allow themselves, are in themselves lawful, that they are nowhere
          forbidden, though they cannot deny but that considered in their
          circumstances, they are not of ill tendency, and expose them to
          temptation, and really tend to wound the credit and interest of
          religion, and to be a stumbling-block to others, or as the apostle
          expresses it, tend to cause others to offend. But they uphold
          themselves with this, that the things which they practice are not
          absolutely unlawful in themselves, and therefore they will not hearken
          to any counsels to avoid them. They think with themselves that it is
          unreasonable they should be tied up so strictly, that they may not
          take one and another liberty, and must be so stiff and precise above
          others. But why did not the apostle talk after their manner? Why did
          not he say within himself, It is unreasonable that I should deny
          myself lawful meat and drink merely to comply with the consciences of
          a few weak persons, that are unreasonable in their scruples? Why
          should I deny myself the comforts of marriage? Why should I deny
          myself that maintenance which Christ himself has ordained for
          ministers, only to avoid the objection of unreasonable men? But the
          apostle was of another spirit. What he aimed at was by any means to
          promote the interest of religion and the good of the church. And he
          had rather forego all the common comforts and enjoyments of life than
          that religion should suffer.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The apostle willingly endured innumerable and extreme sufferings
          for the honor of Christ and the good of men. His sufferings were very
          great; and that not only once or twice, but he went through a long
          series of sufferings, that continued from the time of his conversion
          as long as his life lasted. So that his life was not only a life of
          extraordinary labor, but a life of extreme sufferings also. Labors and
          sufferings were mixed together, and attended each other to the end of
          the race which he ran. He endured sufferings of all kinds, even those
          that cannot consist in the loss of temporal things. He tells us that
          he had suffered the loss of all things, Phil. 3:8, all his former
          enjoyments, which he had before his conversion. And he endured many
          kinds of positive afflictions. 1 Cor. 4:11, 12, “Even unto this
          present hour, we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are
          buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place; and labour, working with
          our hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it.” 2
          Cor. 6:4-11, “But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers
          of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in
          distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in
          watchings, in fastings; by pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering,
          by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of
          truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the
          right hand and on the left, by honour and dishonour, by evil report
          and good report: as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well
          known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and not killed; as
          sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as
          having nothing, and yet possessing all things.” None of the apostles
          went through so great and such various afflictions as he. 2 Cor.
          11:23-28, “Are they ministers of Christ? I am more; in labours more
          abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in
          deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.
          Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered
          shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; in journeyings
          often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine
          own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in
          perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false
          brethren; in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger
          and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.” His sufferings
          were so extreme that he did not go through a series of sufferings
          merely, but might be said, as it were, to go through a series of
          deaths. He did in effect endure the pains of death over and over again
          almost continually, and therefore he expresses himself as he does. 2
          Cor. 4:9-11, “Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not
          destroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord
          Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
          For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that
          the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.”
          Rom. 8:36, “As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day
          long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.” 1 Cor. 15:31, “I
          protest by your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I
          die daily.” He was so pursued and pressed by troubles, sometimes
          outward and inward troubles together, that he had no rest. 2 Cor. 7:5,
          “For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we
          were troubled on every side: without were fightings, within were
          fears.” Sometimes his sufferings were so extreme that his nature
          seemed just ready to faint under them: 2 Cor. 1:8, “for we would not,
          brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble, which came to us in Asia,
          that we were pressed out of measure above strength, insomuch that we
          despaired even of life.” And at last the apostle was deprived of his
          life. He suffered a violent death at Rome under the hand of that cruel
          tyrant, Nero, soon after he wrote the second epistle of Timothy. These
          things he endured for Christ’s sake, for the advancement of his
          kingdom, as he says, he was always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake.
          And those he endured also from love to men, and from an earnest desire
          of their good. 2 Tim. 2:10, “Therefore I endure all things for the
          elect’s sake, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in
          Christ Jesus with eternal glory.” He knew that afflictions awaited him
          beforehand. But he would not avoid his duty because of such
          afflictions. He was so resolute in seeking Christ’s glory, and the
          good of men, that he would pursue these objects, notwithstanding what
          might befall him. Acts 20:22-24, “And now, behold, I go bound in the
          spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me
          there; save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that
          bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these things move me,
          neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my
          course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord
          Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.” Yet he went through
          them cheerfully and willingly, and delighted to do God’s will, and to
          promote others’ good, though it was at this great cost. Col. 1:24,
          “Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is
          behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake,
          which is the church.” And he was never weary. He did not, after he had
          suffered a long time, excuse himself, and say he thought he had done
          his part. Now here appears Christianity in its proper colors. To be of
          such a spirit as this, is to be of such a spirit as Christ so often
          requires of us, if we would be his disciples. This is to sell all and
          give to the poor. This is to take up the cross daily and follow
          Christ. To have such a spirit as this, is to have good evidence of
          being a Christian indeed, a thorough Christian, one that has given
          himself to Christ without reserve, one that hates father and mother,
          and wife, and children, and sisters, yea and his own life also, one
          that loses his life for Christ’s sake, and so shall find it. And
          though it is not required of all that they should endure so great
          sufferings as Paul did, yet it is required and absolutely necessary,
          that many Christians should be in a measure of this spirit, should be
          of a spirit to lose all things and suffer all things for Christ,
          rather than not obey his commands and seek his glory. How well may our
          having such an example as this set before our eyes make us ashamed,
          who are so backward now and then to lose little things, to put
          ourselves a little out of our way, to deny ourselves some convenience,
          to deny our sinful appetites, or to incur the displeasure of a
          neighbor. Alas! what thought have we of Christianity, to make much of
          such things as these, to make so many objections, to keep back, and
          contrive ways to excuse ourselves, when a little difficulty arises!
          What kind of thoughts had we of being Christians, when we first
          undertook to be such, or first pretended a willingness to be
          Christians? Did we never sit down and count the cost, or did we cast
          it up at this rate, that we thought the whole sum would not amount to
          such little sufferings as lie in our way?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I now proceed to show under what special obligations we are to
          follow the good example of this apostle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beside the obligation that rests upon us to follow the good example of
          all, and beside the eminence of his example, there are some special
          reasons why we are under greater obligations to be influenced by the
          good example of this great apostle than by the very same example in
          others. This appears if we consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, in general, that those whom God has especially appointed to be
          teachers in the Christian church, he has also set to be examples in
          his church. It is part of the charge that belongs to teachers, to be
          examples to others. It is one thing that belongs to their work and
          office. So this is part of the charge that the apostle gives to
          Timothy, “Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in
          conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.” The same
          charge is given to Titus, “In all things showing thyself a pattern of
          good works.” And this is part of the charge the apostle Peter gives to
          the elders and teachers of the Christian church. “The elders which are
          among you, I exhort; feed the flock of God. Neither being lords over
          God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.” Thus Christ, the
          chief Shepherd of the sheep, whom God ordained to be the greatest
          teacher, he also ordained to be the greatest example to his church.
          And so those shepherds and teachers that are under him, according as
          they are appointed to be teachers, are also to be examples. They are
          to be guides of the flock in two ways, viz. by teaching and by
          example, as shepherds lead their flocks in two ways: partly by their
          voice by calling them, and partly by going before them, and by leading
          the way. And indeed guiding by word and guiding by example, are but
          two different ways of teaching; and therefore both alike belong to the
          office of teachers in the Christian church. But if this be so, if God
          has especially set those to be examples in the Christian church whom
          he has made its teachers, then it will follow, that wherever they have
          left us good examples, those examples are especially to be regarded.
          For God has doubtless made the duty of teachers towards the church,
          and the duty of the church towards her teachers, to answer one
          another. And therefore the charge is mutual. The charge is not only to
          teachers to set good examples, but the charge is to the church to
          regard and follow their good examples. Heb. 13:7, “Remember them which
          have the rule over you, which have spoken unto you the Word of God,
          whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.” It is
          with respect to the good examples of the teachers of the Christian
          church, as it is with their words, their instructions and
          exhortations. We ought to hear good instructions and good counsels of
          anyone, let him be whom he may. But yet we are under special
          obligations to hearken to the good instructions and examples of those
          whom God has made our teachers. For that is the very office to which
          God has appointed them to teach and to counsel us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, there are two things that are to be observed in particular of
          the apostle Paul which, from the foregoing general observation, will
          show that we are under very special obligations to regard and follow
          his good example.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God has appointed the apostle Paul not only to be a greater teacher
          of the Christian church in that age in which he lived, but the
          principal teacher of his church of any mere man in all succeeding
          ages. He was set of God not only to teach the church then, when he
          lived, but God has made him our teacher by his inspired writings. The
          Christian church is taught by the apostle still, and has been in every
          age since he lived. It is not with the penmen of the Scriptures, as it
          is with other teachers of the Christian church. Other teachers are
          made the teachers of a particular flock in the age in which they live.
          But the penmen of the Scriptures has God made to be the teachers of
          the church universal in all ages. And therefore, as particular
          congregations ought to follow the good examples of their pastors, so
          the church universal in all ages ought to observe and follow the good
          examples of the prophets and apostles, that are the penmen of the
          Scriptures, in all ages. So the apostle James commands us to take the
          ancient prophets for our example, because they have been appointed of
          God to be our teachers, and have spoken to us in the name of the Lord.
          Jam. 5:10, “Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the
          name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction and
          patience.” The prophets and apostles, in that God has made them penmen
          of the Scriptures, are, next to Christ, the foundation of the church
          of God. Eph. 2:20, “Built on the foundation of the prophets and
          apostles, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone.” And
          Paul, above all the penmen of the Scriptures, is distinguished of God
          as being made by him the principal teacher of the Christian church of
          any mere man. Moses taught gospel truths under types and shadows,
          whereby he did, as it were, put a veil over his face. But Paul used
          great plainness of speech. 2 Cor. 3:12, 13. Moses was a minister of
          the Old Testament and of the letter that kills. But the apostle Paul
          is the principal minister of the New Testament, of the spirit, and not
          of the letter. 2 Cor. 3:6, 7. Christ has empowered this apostle to be
          the penmen of more of the New Testament than any other man, and it is
          by him chiefly that we have the great doctrines of it explained. And
          God has actually made this apostle the principal founder of the
          Christian church under Christ, which is a great obligation on the
          flock to regard and follow his good example.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We, who are Gentiles, are especially under obligations to regard
          his teaching and example because it has been mainly by means of this
          apostle that we have been brought into the Christian church. He was
          the great apostle of the Gentiles, the main instrument of that great
          work of God, the calling of the Gentiles. It was chiefly by his means
          that all the countries of Europe came by the gospel. And so it was
          through his hands that our nation came by the gospel. They either had
          the gospel from him immediately, or from those who had it from him.
          Had it not been for the labors of this apostle, our nation might have
          remained to this day in gross heathenism. This consideration should
          especially engage us to regard him as our guide, and should endear his
          good example to us. The apostle often exhorts those churches, as the
          church of Corinth, Philippi, and others which he had converted from
          heathenism, and to which he had been a spiritual father, we are some
          of them. We have been the more remarkably converted from heathenism by
          this apostle, and we ought to acknowledge him as our spiritual father.
          And we are obliged to follow his good example as children should
          follow the good example of their parents.
        </p>
        <p>I now proceed to a general</p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          Of the whole that has been said on this subject, which may be by way
          of exhortation to all earnestly to endeavor to follow the good example
          of this great apostle. We have heard what a spirit the apostle
          manifested, and after what manner he lived in the world, how earnestly
          he sought his own salvation, and that not only before, but also after
          his conversion, and how earnestly cautious he was to avoid eternal
          damnation, long after he had obtained a saving interest in Christ. We
          have heard how strong he was in faith, how great was his love to his
          Lord and Savior, and how he was not ashamed of the gospel, but gloried
          in the cross of Christ, how he abounded in prayer and praise, how he
          contemned the wealth and pleasures and glory of the world, how
          contented he was with the allotments of Providence, how prudent and
          cautious he was in giving an account of his achievements, lest he
          should represent more of himself in words than men should see of him
          in deeds. We have heard how much he suffered under abuses, how he
          loved his enemies, how he delighted in peace, and rejoiced with those
          that rejoiced, and wept with those that wept, and delighted in the
          fellowship of God’s people, and how courteous he was in his behavior
          towards others. We have heard of what a public spirit he was, how
          greatly concerned for the prosperity of Christ’s kingdom and the good
          of his church, how diligent, laborious, and indefatigable in his
          endeavors to do good, how he studied for ways and means to promote
          this end, how he exercised his skill and contrivance, willingly
          foregoing those things that were in themselves lawful, and willingly
          enduring innumerable and extraordinary sufferings. My exhortation now
          is to imitate thus example; and to enforce this, I desire that several
          things may be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Let it be considered, why it is that we have so much written of the
          good example of this apostle, unless that we might follow it. We often
          read those things in the Holy Scriptures which have now been set
          before us on this subject; and to what purpose, unless we apply them
          to ourselves? We had as good never have been informed how well the
          apostle behaved himself, if we do not endeavor to follow him. We all
          profess to be Christians, and we ought to form our notions of
          Christianity from what is written in the Scriptures by the prophets,
          and from the precepts and excellent examples that are there set before
          us. One great reason why many professors live no better, walk no more
          amiably, and are in so many things so unlovely is that they have not
          good notions of Christianity. They do not seem to have a right idea of
          that religion that is taught us in the New Testament. They have not
          well learned Christ. The notions that some persons entertain of
          Christianity are very distorted, and ill conformed to the gospel. The
          notions of others are very erroneous. They lay the chief stress wrong
          upon things on which it ought not to be laid. They place religion
          almost altogether in some particular duties, leaving out others of
          great weight, and, it may be, the weightier matters of the law. And
          the reason why they have no better notions of Christianity is because
          they take their notions of it chiefly from those sources whence they
          ought not to take them. Some take them from the general cry or voice
          of the people, among whom they live. They see that others place
          religion merely, if not almost wholly, in such and such things. And
          hence their notions of Christianity are formed. Or they take their
          notions from the example of particular individuals now living, who are
          in great reputation for godliness. And their notion of Christianity
          is, that it consists in being like such persons. Hence they never have
          just notions of religion. 2 Cor. 10:12, “They, measuring themselves by
          themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.”
          If we would have right notions of Christianity, we should observe
          those in whom it shone, of whom we have an account in the Scriptures.
          For they are the examples that God himself has selected to set before
          us to that end, that from thence we might form our notions of
          religion, and especially the example of this apostle. God knows how to
          select examples. If therefore we would have right notions of
          Christianity, we ought to follow the good example of the apostle Paul.
          He was certainly a Christian indeed, and an eminent Christian. We have
          God’s abundant testimony. But Christianity is in itself an amiable
          thing, and so it appeared in the example of this apostle. And if the
          professors of it would form their notions of it from such examples as
          those, rather than from any particular customs and examples that we
          have now, it would doubtless appear much more amiable in their
          practice than it now does. It would win others. They would not be a
          stumbling-block. Their light would shine. They would command reverence
          and esteem, and be of powerful influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. If we follow the good example which this apostle has set us, it
          will secure to us the like comfortable and sweet influence of God,
          that he enjoyed through the course of his life. Let us consider what a
          happy life the apostle lived, what peace of conscience, and joy in the
          Holy Ghost, he possessed. 2 Cor. 1:12, “for our rejoicing is this, the
          testimony of our conscience.” How did he abound with comfort and joy,
          even in the midst of the greatest afflictions. 2 Cor. 1:3–5, “Blessed
          by God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
          mercies, and the God of all comfort. Who comforteth us in all our
          tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any
          trouble, by the comforts wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
          For was the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also
          aboundeth in Christ.” In all his tribulation his joy was exceedingly
          great. He seems to want words to express the greatness of the joy
          which he possessed continually. He says he was filled with comfort,
          and was exceedingly joyful. 2 Cor. 7:4, “I am filled with comfort, I
          am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.” How does the apostle’s
          love seem to overflow with joy! 2 Cor. 6:10, 11, “As sorrowful, yet
          always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing,
          yet possessing all things. O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto
          you, our heart is enlarged.” How happy is such a life! How well is
          such happiness worth pursuing! We are ourselves the occasion of our
          wounds and troubles. We bring darkness on our own souls. Professing
          Christians, by indulging their sloth, seek their own easy and comfort.
          But they defeat their own aim. The most laborious and the most
          self-denying Christians are the most happy. There are many who are
          complaining of their darkness, and inquiring what they shall do for
          light, and the comfortable presence of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This would be the way to be helped against temptation, and to
          triumph over our spiritual enemies as the apostle did. Satan assaulted
          him violently, and men continually persecuted him. The powers of hell
          combined against him. But God was with him, and made him more than a
          conqueror. He lived a life of triumph. 2 Cor. 2:14, “Now thanks be
          unto God, who always causeth us to triumph in Christ.” Let us consider
          what an excellent privilege it would be thus to be helped against
          temptation. What a grief of mind is it to so often overcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. This would secure us honor from God, and an extraordinary intimacy
          with him. Moses enjoyed a great intimacy with God, but the apostle
          Paul in some respects a greater. Moses conversed with God in mount
          Sinai. Paul was caught up to the third heavens. He had abundant
          visions and revelations more than he has told us, lest any should
          think him to boast. He was favored with more of the miraculous gifts
          of the Holy Spirit than any other person. And though we cannot expect
          to be honored with intimacy with heaven in just the same way, yet if
          we in good earnest apply ourselves, we may have greater and greater
          intimacy, so that we may come with boldness, and converse with God as
          a friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          This would be the way to make us great blessings in the world. The
          apostle, by means of such a spirit and such a behavior as you have
          heard, was made the greatest blessing to the world of any who ever
          lived on earth, except the man Christ Jesus himself. Wherever he went,
          there went a blessing with him. To have him enter a city was commonly
          made a greater mercy to it than if the greatest monarch on earth had
          come there, scattering his treasures around him among the inhabitants.
          Wherever he went, there did, as it were, a light shine about him,
          seemingly to enlighten the benighted children of men. Silver and gold
          he had none. But what he imparted to many thousands was worth more to
          them than if he had bestowed upon them the richest jewels of which the
          Roman emperor was possessed. And he was not only a blessing to that
          generation, but has been so since his death, by the fruits of what he
          did in his lifetime, the foundations he then laid, and by the writings
          which he has left for the good of mankind, to the end of the world. He
          then was, and ever since has been, a light to the church next in
          brightness to the Sun of righteousness. And it was by means of his
          excellent spirit and excellent behavior that he became such a
          blessing. Those were the things that God made useful in him for doing
          so much good. And if we should imitate the apostle in such a spirit
          and behavior, the undoubted consequence would be that we also should
          be made great blessings in the world. We should not live in vain, but
          should carry a blessing with us wherever we went. Instead of being
          cumberers of the ground, multitudes would be fed with our fruit, and
          would have reason to praise and bless God that he ever gave us a
          being. Now, how melancholy a consideration may it be to any persons
          that they have lived to no purpose, that the world would have been
          deprived of nothing, if they had never been born, and it may be, have
          been better without them than with them! How desirable is it to be a
          blessing! How great was the promise made to Abraham, “In thee shall
          all the families of the earth be blessed!”
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. For us to follow the good example of the apostle Paul, would be
          the way for us to die as he did. 2 Tim. 4:6-8, “For I am now ready to
          be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a
          good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith;
          henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the
          Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day.”
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. This would secure us a distinguished crown of glory hereafter. It
          is thought by some, and not without great probability, that the
          apostle Paul is the very next in glory to the man Jesus Christ
          himself. This is probable from his having done more good than any, and
          from his having done it though so great labours and sufferings. The
          apostle tells us, “Every man shall receive his own reward according to
          his own labour.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall conclude with mentioning some things as encouragements for us
          to endeavor to follow the excellent example of this great apostle.
          Many may be ready to say that it is in vain for them to try. The
          apostle was a person so greatly distinguished. It is in vain for them
          to endeavor to be like him. But for your encouragement, consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that the apostle was a man of like passions with us. He had
          naturally the same heart, the same corruptions, was under the same
          circumstances, the same guilt, and the same condemnation. There is
          this circumstance that attends the apostle’s example to encourage us
          to endeavor to imitate him, which did not attend the example of
          Christ. And yet we are called upon to imitate the example of Christ.
          This is probably one main reason why not only the example of Christ,
          but also those of mere men, are set before us in the Scriptures.
          Though you may think you have no great reason to hope to come up to
          the apostle’s degree, yet that is no reason why you should not make
          his good example your pattern, and labor, as far as in you lies, to
          copy after him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, this apostle, before he was converted, was a very wicked man,
          and a vile persecutor. He often speaks of it himself. He sinned
          against great light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, he had much greater hindrances and impediments to eminent
          holiness from without than any of us have. His circumstances made it
          more difficult for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, the same God, the same Savior, and the same head of divine
          influence are ready to help our sincere endeavors, that helped him.
          Let us therefore not excuse ourselves, but in good earnest endeavor to
          follow so excellent an example. And then, however weak we are in
          ourselves, we may hope to experience Christ’s support, and be able to
          say from our own experience, as the apostle did before him, “when I am
          weak, then am I strong.”
