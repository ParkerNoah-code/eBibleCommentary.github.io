          Romans 4:5, “But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
          justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.”
        </p>
        <p>THE following things may be noted in this verse:</p>
        <p>
          1. That justification respects a man as ungodly. This is evident by
          these words — that justifieth the ungodly, which cannot imply less
          than that God, in the act of justification, has no regard to anything
          in the person justified, as godliness or any goodness in him, but that
          immediately before this act, God beholds him only as an ungodly
          creature, so that godliness in the person to be justified is not so
          antecedent to his justification as to be the ground of it. When it is
          said that God justifies the ungodly, it is as absurd to suppose that
          our godliness, taken as some goodness in us, is the ground of our
          justification, as when it is said that Christ gave sight to the blind
          to suppose that sight was prior to, and the ground of, that act of
          mercy in Christ. Or as, if it should be said that such an one by his
          bounty has made a poor man rich, to suppose that it was the wealth of
          this poor man that was the ground of this bounty towards him, and was
          the price by which it was procured.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It appears, that by him that worketh not, in this verse, is not
          meant one who merely does not conform to the ceremonial law, because
          he that worketh not, and the ungodly, are evidently synonymous
          expressions, or what signify the same, as appears by the manner of
          their connection. If not, to what purpose is the latter expression,
          the ungodly, brought in? The context gives no other occasion for it,
          but to show that by the grace of the gospel, God in justification has
          no regard to any godliness of ours. The foregoing verse is, “Now to
          him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.”
          In that verse, it is evident that gospel grace consists in the reward
          being given without works, and in this verse, which immediately
          follows it, and in sense is connected with it, gospel grace consists
          in a man’s being justified as ungodly. By which it is most plain, that
          by him that worketh not, and him that is ungodly, are meant the same
          thing, and that therefore not only works of the ceremonial law are
          excluded in this business of justification, but works of morality and
          godliness.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident in the words, that by the faith here spoken of, by which
          we are justified, is not meant the same thing as a course of obedience
          or righteousness, since the expression by which this faith is here
          denoted, is believing on him that justifies the ungodly. — They that
          oppose the Solifidians, as they call them, greatly insist on it, that
          we should take the words of Scripture concerning this doctrine in
          their most natural and obvious meaning, and how do they cry out, of
          our clouding this doctrine with obscure metaphors, and unintelligible
          figures of speech? But is this to interpret Scripture according to its
          most obvious meaning, when the Scripture speaks of our believing on
          him that justifies the ungodly, or the breakers of his law, to say
          that the meaning of it is performing a course of obedience to his law,
          and avoiding the breaches of it? Believing on God as a justifier,
          certainly is a different thing from submitting to God as a lawgiver,
          especially believing on him as a justifier of the ungodly, or rebels
          against the lawgiver.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is evident that the subject of justification is looked upon as
          destitute of any righteousness in himself, by that expression, it is
          counted, or imputed to him for righteousness. — The phrase, as the
          apostle uses it here and in the context, manifestly imports that God
          of his sovereign grace is pleased in his dealings with the sinner, so
          to regard one that has no righteousness, that the consequence shall be
          the same as if he had. This however may be from the respect it bears
          to something that is indeed righteous. It is plain that this is the
          force of the expression in the preceding verses. In the last verse but
          one, it is manifest, the apostle lays the stress of his argument for
          the free grace of God — from that text of the Old Testament about
          Abraham — on the word counted or imputed. This is the thing that he
          supposed God to show his grace in, viz. in his counting something for
          righteousness, in his consequential dealings with Abraham, that was no
          righteousness in itself. And in the next verse, which immediately
          precedes the text, “Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned
          of grace, but of debt,” the word there translated reckoned, is the
          same that in the other verses is rendered imputed and counted, and it
          is as much as if the apostle had said, “As to him that works, there is
          no need of any gracious reckoning or counting it for righteousness,
          and causing the reward to follow as if it were a righteousness. For if
          he has works, he has that which is a righteousness in itself, to which
          the reward properly belongs.” This is further evident by the words
          that follow, Rom. 4:6, “Even as David also described the blessedness
          of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works.” What
          can here be meant by imputing righteousness without works, but
          imputing righteousness to him that has none of his own? Verse 7, 8,
          “Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose
          sins are covered: blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute
          sin.” How are these words of David to the apostle’s purpose? Or how do
          they prove any such thing, as that righteousness is imputed without
          works, unless it be because the word imputed is used, and the subject
          of the imputation is mentioned as a sinner, and consequently destitute
          of a moral righteousness? For David says no such thing, as that he is
          forgiven without the works of the ceremonial law. There is no hint of
          the ceremonial law, or reference to it, in the words. I will therefore
          venture to infer this doctrine from the words, for the subject of my
          present discourse, viz.
        </p>
        <p>
          That we are justified only by faith in Christ, and not by any manner
          of virtue or goodness of our own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such an assertion as this, I am sensible, many would be ready to call
          absurd, as betraying a great deal of ignorance, and containing much
          inconsistency, but I desire everyone’s patience till I have done.
        </p>
        <p>In handling this doctrine, I would:</p>
        <p>
          I. Explain the meaning of it, and show how I would be understood by
          such an assertion.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Proceed to the consideration of the evidence of the truth of it.
        </p>
        <p>III. Show how evangelical obedience is concerned in this affair.</p>
        <p>IV. Answer objections.</p>
        <p>V. Consider the importance of the doctrine.</p>
        <p>
          I. I would explain the meaning of the doctrine, or show in what sense
          I assert it, and would endeavor to evince the truth of it, which may
          be done in answer to these two inquiries, viz. 1.What is meant by
          being justified? 2. What is meant when it is said, that this is “by
          faith alone, without any manner of virtue or goodness of our own?”
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I would show what justification is, or what I suppose is meant
          in Scripture by being justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          A person is to be justified, when he is approved of God as free from
          the guilt of sin and its deserved punishment, and as having that
          righteousness belonging to him that entitles to the reward of life.
          That we should take the word in such a sense, and understand it as the
          judge’s accepting a person as having both a negative and positive
          righteousness belonging to him, and looking on him therefore as not
          only free from any obligation to punishment, but also as just and
          righteous and so entitled to a positive reward, is not only most
          agreeable to the etymology and natural import of the word, which
          signifies to pass one for righteous in judgment, but also manifestly
          agreeable to the force of the word as used in Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some suppose that nothing more is intended in Scripture by
          justification, than barely the remission of sins. If so, it is very
          strange, if we consider the nature of the case. For it is most
          evident, and none will deny, that it is with respect to the rule or
          law of God we are under, that we are said in Scripture to be either
          justified or condemned. Now what is it to justify a person as the
          subject of a law or rule, but to judge him as standing right with
          respect to that rule? To justify a person in a particular case, is to
          approve of him as standing right, as subject to the law in that case,
          and to justify in general is to pass him in judgment, as standing
          right in a state correspondent to the law or rule in general. But
          certainly, in order to a person’s being looked on as standing right
          with respect to the rule in general, or in a state corresponding with
          the law of God, more is needful than not having the guilt of sin. For
          whatever that law is, whether a new or an old one, doubtless something
          positive is needed in order to its being answered. We are no more
          justified by the voice of the law, or of him that judges according to
          it, by a mere pardon of sin, than Adam, our first surety, was
          justified by the law, at the first point of his existence, before he
          had fulfilled the obedience of the law, or had so much as any trial
          whether he would fulfill it or no. If Adam had finished his course of
          perfect obedience, he would have been justified, and certainly his
          justification would have implied something more than what is merely
          negative. He would have been approved of, as having fulfilled the
          righteousness of the law, and accordingly would have been adjudged to
          the reward of it. So Christ, our second surety (in whose justification
          all whose surety he is, are virtually justified), was not justified
          till he had done the work the Father had appointed him, and kept the
          Father’s commandments through all trials, and then in his resurrection
          he was justified. When he had been put to death in the flesh, but
          quickened by the Spirit, 1 Pet. 3:18, then he that was manifest in the
          flesh was justified in the Spirit, 1 Tim. 3:16. But God, when he
          justified him in raising him from the dead, did not only release him
          from his humiliation for sin, and acquit him from any further
          suffering or abasement for it, but admitted him to that eternal and
          immortal life, and to the beginning of that exaltation that was the
          reward of what he had done. And indeed the justification of a believer
          is no other than his being admitted to communion in the justification
          of this head and surety of all believers: for as Christ suffered the
          punishment of sin, not as a private person, but as our surety. So when
          after this suffering he was raised from the dead, he was therein
          justified, not as a private person, but as the surety and
          representative of all that should believe in him. So that he was
          raised again not only for his own, but also for our justification,
          according to the apostle, Rom. 4:25, “Who was delivered for our
          offenses, and raised again for our justification.” And therefore it is
          that the apostle says, as he does in Rom. 8:34, “Who is he that
          condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But that a believer’s justification implies not only remission of
          sins, or acquittal from the wrath due to it, but also an admittance to
          a title to that glory which is the reward of righteousness, is more
          directly taught in the Scriptures, particularly in Rom. 5:1, 2, where
          the apostle mentions both these as joint benefits implied in
          justification: “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with
          God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access into
          this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.”
          So remission of sin, and inheritance among them that are sanctified,
          are mentioned together as what are jointly obtained by faith in
          Christ, Acts 26:18, “That they may receive forgiveness of sins, and
          inheritance among them that are sanctified through faith that is in
          me.” Both these are without doubt implied in that passing from death
          to life, which Christ speaks of as the fruit of faith, and which he
          opposes to condemnation, John 5:24, “Verily I say unto you, he that
          heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting
          life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death
          unto life.”
        </p>
        <p>I proceed now,</p>
        <p>
          Secondly, to show what is meant when it is said, that this
          justification is by faith only, and not by any virtue or goodness of
          our own.
        </p>
        <p>This inquiry may be subdivided into two, viz.</p>
        <p>
          1. How it is by faith. 2. How it is by faith alone, without any manner
          of goodness of ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How justification is by faith. — Here the great difficulty has been
          about the import and force of the particle by, or what is that
          influence that faith has in the affair of justification that is
          expressed in Scripture by being justified by faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, if I may humbly express what seems evident to me, though faith
          be indeed the condition of justification so as nothing else is, yet
          this matter is not clearly and sufficiently explained by saying that
          faith is the condition of justification, and that because the word
          seems ambiguous, both in common use, and also as used in divinity. In
          one sense, Christ alone performs the condition of our justification
          and salvation. In another sense, faith is the condition of
          justification, and in another sense, other qualifications and acts are
          conditions of salvation and justification too. There seems to be a
          great deal of ambiguity in such expressions as are commonly used
          (which yet we are forced to use), such as condition of salvation, what
          is required in order to salvation or justification, the terms of the
          covenant, and the like, and I believe they are understood in very
          different senses by different persons. And besides, as the word
          condition is very often understood in the common use of language,
          faith is not the only thing in us that is the condition of
          justification. For by the word condition, as it is very often (and
          perhaps most commonly) used, we mean anything that may have the place
          of a condition in a conditional proposition, and as such is truly
          connected with the consequent, especially if the proposition holds
          both in the affirmative and negative, as the condition is either
          affirmed or denied. If it be that with which, or which being supposed,
          a thing shall be, and without which, or it being denied, a thing shall
          not be, we in such a case call it a condition of that thing. But in
          this sense faith is not the only condition of salvation and
          justification. For there are many things that accompany and flow from
          faith, with which justification shall be, and without which, it will
          not be, and therefore are found to be put in Scripture in conditional
          propositions with justification and salvation, in multitudes of
          places. Such are love to God, and love to our brethren, forgiving men
          their trespasses, and many other good qualifications and acts. And
          there are many other things besides faith, which are directly proposed
          to us, to be pursued or performed by us, in order to eternal life,
          which if they are done, or obtained, we shall have eternal life, and
          if not done, or not obtained, we shall surely perish. And if faith was
          the only condition of justification in this sense, I do not apprehend
          that to say faith was the condition of justification, would express
          the sense of that phrase of Scripture, of being justified by faith.
          There is a difference between being justified by a thing, and that
          thing universally, necessarily, and inseparably attending
          justification: for so do a great many things that we are not said to
          be justified by. It is not the inseparable connection with
          justification that the Holy Ghost would signify (or that is naturally
          signified) by such a phrase, but some particular influence that faith
          has in the affair, or some certain dependence that effect has on its
          influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some, aware of this, have supposed that the influence or dependence
          might well be expressed by faith’s being the instrument of our
          justification, which has been misunderstood, and injuriously
          represented, and ridiculed by those that have denied the doctrine of
          justification by faith alone, as though they had supposed faith was
          used as an instrument in the hand of God, whereby he performed and
          brought to pass that act of his, viz. approving and justifying the
          believer. Whereas it was not intended that faith was the instrument
          wherewith God justifies, but the instrument wherewith we receive
          justification: not the instrument wherewith the justifier acts in
          justifying, but wherewith the receiver of justification acts in
          accepting justification. But yet, it must be owned, this is an obscure
          way of speaking, and there must certainly be some impropriety in
          calling it an instrument wherewith we receive or accept justification.
          For the very persons who thus explain the matter, speak of faith as
          being the reception or acceptance itself, and if so, how can it be the
          instrument of reception or acceptance? Certainly there is a difference
          between the act and the instrument. Besides, by their own descriptions
          of faith, Christ, the mediator, by whom and his righteousness by which
          we are justified, is more directly the object of this acceptance and
          justification, which is the benefit arising therefrom more indirectly.
          Therefore, if faith be an instrument, it is more properly the
          instrument by which we receive Christ, than the instrument by which we
          receive justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I humbly conceive we have been ready to look too far to find out
          what that influence of faith in our justification is, or what is that
          dependence of this effect on faith, signified by the expression of
          being justified by faith, overlooking that which is most obviously
          pointed forth in the expression, viz. that (there being a mediator
          that has purchased justification) faith in this mediator is that which
          renders it a meet and suitable thing, in the sight of God, that the
          believer, rather than others, should have this purchased benefit
          assigned to him. There is this benefit purchased, which God sees it to
          be a more meet and suitable thing that it should be assigned to some
          rather than others, because he sees them differently qualified: that
          qualification wherein the meetness to this benefit, as the case
          stands, consists, is that in us by which we are justified. If Christ
          had not come into the world and died, etc. to purchase justification,
          no qualification whatever in us could render it a meet or fit thing
          that we should be justified. But the case being as it now stands, viz.
          that Christ has actually purchased justification by his own blood for
          infinitely unworthy creatures, there may be certain qualifications
          found in some persons, which, either from the relation it bears to the
          mediator and his merits, or on some other account, is the thing that
          in the sight of God renders it a meet and condecent thing, that they
          should have an interest in this purchased benefit, and of which if any
          are destitute, it renders it an unfit and unsuitable thing that they
          should have it. The wisdom of God in his constitutions doubtless
          appears much in the fitness and beauty of them, so that those things
          are established to be done that are fit to be done, and that these
          things are connected in his constitution that are agreeable one to
          another. — So God justifies a believer according to his revealed
          constitution, without doubt, because he sees something in this
          qualification that, as the case stands, renders it a fit thing that
          such should be justified: whether it be because faith is the
          instrument, or as it were the hand, by which he that has purchased
          justification is apprehended and accepted, or because it is the
          acceptance itself, or whatever else. To be justified, is to be
          approved of God as a proper subject of pardon, with a right to eternal
          life. Therefore, when it is said that we are justified by faith, what
          else can be understood by it, than that faith is that by which we are
          rendered approvable, fitly so, and indeed, as the case stands, proper
          subjects of this benefit?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is something different from faith being the condition of
          justification, though inseparably connected with justification. So are
          many other things besides faith, and yet nothing in us but faith
          renders it meet that we should have justification assigned to us: as I
          shall presently show in answer to the next inquiry, viz.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How this is said to be by faith alone, without any manner of virtue
          or goodness of our own. This may seem to some to be attended with two
          difficulties, viz. how this can be said to be by faith alone, without
          any virtue or goodness of ours, when faith itself is a virtue, and one
          part of our goodness, and is not only some manner of goodness of ours,
          but is a very excellent qualification, and one chief part of the
          inherent holiness of a Christian? And if it be a part of our inherent
          goodness or excellency (whether it be this part or any other) that
          renders it a condecent or congruous thing that we should have this
          benefit of Christ assigned to us, what is this less than what they
          mean who talk of a merit of congruity? And moreover, if this part of
          our Christian holiness qualifies us, in the sight of God, for this
          benefit of Christ, and renders it a fit or meet thing, in his sight,
          that we should have it, why not other parts of holiness, and
          conformity to God, which are also very excellent, and have as much of
          the image of Christ in them, and are no less lovely in God’s eyes,
          qualify us as much, and have as much influence to render us meet, in
          God’s sight, for such a benefit as this? Therefore I answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          When it is said, that we are not justified by any righteousness or
          goodness of our own, what is meant is that it is not out of respect to
          the excellency or goodness of any qualifications or acts in us
          whatsoever, that God judges it meet that this benefit of Christ should
          be ours. It is not, in any wise, on account of any excellency or value
          that there is in faith, that it appears in the sight of God a meet
          thing, that he who believes should have this benefit of Christ
          assigned to him, but purely from the relation faith has to the person
          in whom this benefit is to be had, or as it unites to that mediator,
          in and by whom we are justified. Here, for the greater clearness, I
          would particularly explain myself under several propositions,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It is certain that there is some union or relation that the
          people of Christ stand in to him, that is expressed in Scripture, from
          time to time, by being in Christ, and is represented frequently by
          those metaphors of being members of Christ, or being united to him as
          members to the head, and branches to the stock, and is compared to a
          marriage union between husband and wife. I do not now pretend to
          determine of what sort this union is. Nor is it necessary to my
          present purpose to enter into any manner of disputes about it. If any
          are disgusted at the word union, as obscure and unintelligible, the
          word relation equally serves my purpose. I do not now desire to
          determine any more about it, than all, of all sorts, will readily
          allow, viz. that there is a peculiar relation between true Christians
          and Christ, which there is not between him and others, and which is
          signified by those metaphorical expressions in Scripture, of being in
          Christ, being members of Christ, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) This relation or union to Christ, whereby Christians are said to
          be in Christ (whatever it be), is the ground of their right to his
          benefits. This needs no proof: the reason of the thing, at first
          blush, demonstrates it. It is exceeding evident also by Scripture, 1
          John 5:12, “He that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the
          Son, hath not life.” 1 Cor. 1:30, “Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who
          of God is made unto us — righteousness.” First we must be in him, and
          then he will be made righteousness or justification to us. Eph. 1:6,
          “Who hath made us accepted in the beloved.” Our being in him is the
          ground of our being accepted. So it is in those unions to which the
          Holy Ghost has thought fit to compare this. The union of the members
          of the body with the head, is the ground of their partaking of the
          life of the head. It is the union of the branches to the stock, which
          is the ground of their partaking of the sap and life of the stock. It
          is the relation of the wife to the husband, that is the ground of her
          joint interest in his estate: they are looked upon, in several
          respects, as one in law. So there is a legal union between Christ and
          true Christians, so that (as all except Socinians allow) one, in some
          respects, is accepted for the other by the supreme Judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) And thus it is that faith is the qualification in any person that
          renders it meet in the sight of God that he should be looked upon as
          having Christ’s satisfaction and righteousness belonging to him, viz.
          because it is that in him which, on his part, makes up this union
          between him and Christ. By what has been just now observed, it is a
          person’s being, according to scripture phrase, in Christ, that is the
          ground of having his satisfaction and merits belonging to him, and a
          right to the benefits procured thereby. The reason of it is plain: it
          is easy to see how our having Christ’s merits and benefits belonging
          to us, follows from our having (if I may so speak) Christ himself
          belonging to us, or our being united to him. And if so, it must also
          be easy to see how, or in what manner, that in a person, which on his
          part makes up the union between his soul and Christ, should be the
          things on the account of which God looks on it as meet that he should
          have Christ’s merits belonging to him. It is a very different thing
          for God to assign to a particular person a right to Christ’s merits
          and benefits from regard to a qualification in him in this respect,
          from his doing it for him out of respect to the value or loveliness of
          that qualification, or as a reward of its excellency.
        </p>
        <p>
          As there is nobody but what will allow that there is a peculiar
          relation between Christ and his true disciples, by which they are in
          some sense in Scripture said to be one. So I suppose there is nobody
          but what will allow, that there may be something that the true
          Christian does on his part, whereby he is active in coming into this
          relation or union: some uniting act, or that which is done towards
          this union or relation (or whatever any please to call it) on the
          Christian’s part. Now faith I suppose to be this act.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not now pretend to define justifying faith, or to determine
          precisely how much is contained in it, but only to determine thus much
          concerning it, viz. That it is that by which the soul, which before
          was separate and alienated from Christ, unites itself to him, or
          ceases to be any longer in that state of alienation, and comes into
          that forementioned union or relation to him, or, to use the scripture
          phrase, it is that by which the soul comes to Christ, and receives
          him. This is evident by the Scriptures using these very expressions to
          signify faith. John 6:35-39, “He that cometh to me, shall never
          hunger; and he that believeth on me, shall never thirst. But I said
          unto you, that ye also have seen me and believe not. All that the
          Father giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will
          in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own
          will, but the will of him that sent me.” Verse 40, “And this is the
          will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and
          believeth on him, may have everlasting life; and I will raise him up
          the last day.” — John 5:38-40, “Whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.
          Search the Scriptures, for — they are they which testify of me. And ye
          will not come unto me, that ye might have life.” Verse 43, 44, “I am
          come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come
          in his own name, him ye will receive. How can ye believe, which
          receive honor one of another?” — John 1:12, “But as many as received
          him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them
          that believe on his name.” If it be said that these are obscure
          figures of speech, which however they might be well understood of old
          among those who commonly used such metaphors, are with difficulty
          understood now. I allow, that the expressions of receiving Christ and
          coming to Christ, are metaphorical expressions. If I should allow them
          to be obscure metaphors, yet this much at least is certainly plain in
          them, viz. that faith is that by which those who before were
          separated, and at a distance from Christ (that is to say, were not so
          related and united to him as his people are), cease to be any longer
          at such a distance, and come into that relation and nearness, unless
          they are so unintelligible, that nothing at all can be understood by
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          God does not give those that believe a union with or an interest in
          the Savior as a reward for faith, but only because faith is the soul’s
          active uniting with Christ, or is itself the very act of unition, on
          their part. God sees it fit, that in order to a union being
          established between two intelligent active beings or persons, so as
          that they should be looked upon as one, there should be the mutual act
          of both, that each should receive the other, as actively joining
          themselves one to another. God, in requiring this in order to an union
          with Christ as one of his people, treats men as reasonable creatures,
          capable of act and choice, and hence sees it fit that they only who
          are one with Christ by their own act, should be looked upon as one in
          law. What is real in the union between Christ and his people, is the
          foundation of what is legal: that is, it is something really in them,
          and between them, uniting them, that is the ground of the suitableness
          of their being accounted as one by the judge. And if there be any act
          or qualification in believers of that uniting nature, that it is meet
          on that account the judge should look upon them and accept them as
          one, no wonder that upon the account of the same act or qualification,
          he should accept the satisfaction and merits of the one for the other,
          as if these were their own satisfaction and merits. This necessarily
          follows, or rather is implied.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus it is that faith justifies, or gives an interest in Christ’s
          satisfaction and merits, and a right to the benefits procured thereby,
          viz. as it thus makes Christ and the believer one in the acceptance of
          the supreme Judge. It is by faith that we have a title to eternal
          life, because it is by faith that we have the Son of God, by whom life
          is. The apostle John in these words, 1 John 5:12, “He that hath the
          Son hath life,” seems evidently to have respect to those words of
          Christ, of which he gives an account in his gospel, chap. 3:36, “He
          that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth
          not the Son, shall not see life.” And where the Scripture speaks of
          faith as the soul’s receiving or coming to Christ, it also speaks of
          this receiving, coming to, or joining with Christ, as the ground of an
          interest in his benefits. To as many as received him, “to them gave he
          power” to become the sons of God. Ye will not come unto me, “that ye
          might have life.” And there is a wide difference between its being
          suitable that Christ’s satisfaction and merits should be theirs who
          believe, because an interest in that satisfaction and merit is a fit
          reward of faith — or a suitable testimony of God’s respect to the
          amiableness and excellency of that grace — and its being suitable that
          Christ’s satisfaction and merits should be theirs, because Christ and
          they are so united, that in the eyes of the Judge they may be looked
          upon and taken as one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although, on account of faith in the believer, it is in the sight of
          God fit and congruous, both that he who believes should be looked upon
          as in Christ, and also as having an interest in his merits, in the way
          that has been now explained. Yet it appears that this is very wide
          from a merit of congruity, or indeed any moral congruity at all to
          either. There is a twofold fitness to a state. I know not how to give
          them distinguishing names, otherwise than by calling the one a moral,
          and the other a natural fitness. A person has a moral fitness for a
          state, when his moral excellency commends him to it, or when his being
          put into such a good state is but a suitable testimony of regard to
          the moral excellency, or value, or amiableness of any of his
          qualifications or acts. A person has a natural fitness for a state,
          when it appears meet and condecent that he should be in such a state
          or circumstances, only from the natural concord or agreeableness there
          is between such qualifications and such circumstances: not because the
          qualifications are lovely or unlovely, but only because the
          qualifications and the circumstances are like one another, or do in
          their nature suit and agree or unite one to another. And it is on this
          latter account only that God looks on it fit by a natural fitness,
          that he whose heart sincerely unites itself to Christ as his Savior,
          should be looked upon as united to that Savior, and so having an
          interest in him, and not from any moral fitness there is between the
          excellency of such a qualification as faith, and such a glorious
          blessedness as the having an interest in Christ. God’s bestowing
          Christ and his benefits on a soul in consequence of faith, out of
          regard only to the natural concord there is between such a
          qualification of a soul, and such a union with Christ, and interest in
          him, makes the case very widely different from what it would be, if he
          bestowed this from regard to any moral suitableness. For, in the
          former case, it is only from God’s love of order that he bestows these
          things on the account of faith: in the latter, God does it out of love
          to the grace of faith itself. — God will neither look on Christ’s
          merits as ours, nor adjudge his benefits to us, till we be in Christ.
          Nor will he look upon us as being in him, without an active unition of
          our hearts and souls to him, because he is a wise being, and delights
          in order and not in confusion, and that things should be together or
          asunder according to their nature. His making such a constitution is a
          testimony of his love of order. Whereas if it were out of regard to
          any moral fitness or suitableness between faith and such blessedness,
          it would be a testimony of his love to the act or qualification
          itself. The one supposes this divine constitution to be a
          manifestation of God’s regard to the beauty of the act of faith. The
          other only supposes it to be a manifestation of his regard to the
          beauty of that order that there is in uniting those things that have a
          natural agreement and congruity, and unition of the one with the
          other. Indeed a moral suitableness or fitness to a state includes a
          natural. For, if there be a moral suitableness that a person should be
          in such a state, there is also a natural suitableness, but such a
          natural suitableness, as I have described, by no means necessarily
          includes a moral.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is plainly what our divines intend when they say, that faith does
          not justify as a work, or a righteousness, viz. that it does not
          justify as a part of our moral goodness or excellency, or that it does
          not justify as man was to have been justified by the covenant of
          works, which was, to have a title to eternal life given him of God, in
          testimony of his pleasedness with his works, or his regard to the
          inherent excellency and beauty of his obedience. And this is certainly
          what the apostle Paul means, when he so much insists upon it, that we
          are not justified by works, viz. that we are not justified by them as
          good works, or by any goodness, value, or excellency of our works. For
          the proof of this I shall at present mention but one thing, and that
          is, the apostle from time to time speaking of our not being justified
          by works, as the thing that excludes all boasting, Eph. 2:9, Rom.
          3:27, and chap. 4:2. Now which way do works give occasion for
          boasting, but as good? What do men use to boast of, but of something
          they suppose good or excellent? And on what account do they boast of
          anything, but for the supposed excellency that is in it?
        </p>
        <p>
          From these things we may learn in what manner faith is the only
          condition of justification and salvation. For though it be not the
          only condition, so as alone truly to have the place of a condition in
          a hypothetical proposition, in which justification and salvation are
          the consequent. Yet it is the condition of justification in a manner
          peculiar to it, and so that nothing else has a parallel influence with
          it, because faith includes the whole act of unition to Christ as a
          Savior. The entire active uniting of the soul, or the whole of what is
          called coming to Christ, and receiving of him, is called faith in
          Scripture. However other things may be no less excellent than faith,
          yet it is not the nature of any other graces or virtues directly to
          close with Christ as a mediator, any further than they enter into the
          constitution of justifying faith, and do belong to its nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have explained my meaning, in asserting it as a doctrine of the
          gospel, that we are justified by faith only, without any manner of
          goodness of our own.
        </p>
        <p>I now proceed,</p>
        <p>
          II. To the proof of it, which I shall endeavor to produce in the
          following arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, such is our case, and the state of things, that neither faith,
          nor any other qualifications, or act or course of acts, does or can
          render it suitable that a person should have an interest in the
          Savior, and so a title to his benefits, on account of an excellency
          therein, or any other way, than as something in him may unite him to
          the Savior. It is not suitable that God should give fallen man an
          interest in Christ and his merits, as a testimony of his respect to
          anything whatsoever as a loveliness in him, and that because it is not
          meet, till a sinner is actually justified, than anything in him should
          be accepted of God, as any excellency or amiableness of his person. Or
          that God, by any act, should in any manner or degree testify any
          pleasedness with him, or favor towards him, on the account of anything
          inherent in him, and that for two reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The nature of things will not admit of it. And this appears from
          the infinite guilt that the sinner till justified is under, which
          arises from the infinite evil or heinousness of sin. But because this
          is what some deny, I would therefore first establish that point, and
          show that sin is a thing that is indeed properly of infinite
          heinousness, and then show the consequence that it cannot be suitable,
          till the sinner is actually justified, that God should by any act
          testify pleasedness with or acceptance of any excellency or
          amiableness of his person.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the evil and demerit of sin is infinitely great, is most
          demonstrably evident, because what the evil or iniquity of sin
          consists in, is the violating of an obligation, or doing what we
          should not do. Therefore by how much the greater the obligation is
          that is violated, by so much the greater is the iniquity of the
          violation. But certainly our obligation to love or honor any being is
          great in proportion to the greatness or excellency of that being, or
          his worthiness to be loved and honored. We are under greater
          obligations to love a more lovely being than a less lovely. If a being
          be infinitely excellent and lovely, our obligations to love him are
          therein infinitely great. The matter is so plain, it seems needless to
          say much about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some have argued exceeding strangely against the infinite evil of sin,
          from its being committed against an infinite object, that then it may
          as well be argued, that there is also an infinite value or worthiness
          in holiness and love to God, because that also has an infinite object.
          Whereas the argument, from parity of reason, will carry it in the
          reverse. The sin of the creature against God is ill-deserving in
          proportion to the distance there is between God and the creature. The
          greatness of the object, and the meanness of the subject, aggravates
          it. But it is the reverse with regard to the worthiness of the respect
          of the creature of God. It is worthless (and not worthy) in proportion
          to the meanness of the subject. So much the greater the distance
          between God and the creature, so much the less is the creature’s
          respect worthy of God’s notice or regard. The unworthiness of sin or
          opposition to God rises and is great in proportion to the dignity of
          the object and inferiority of the subject. But on the contrary, the
          value of respect rises in proportion to the value of the subject, and
          that for this plain reason, viz. that the evil of disrespect is in
          proportion to the obligation that lies upon the subject to the object,
          which obligation is most evidently increased by the excellency and
          superiority of the object. But on the contrary, the worthiness of
          respect to a being is in proportion to the obligation that lies on him
          who is the object (or rather the reason he has), to regard the
          subject, which certainly is in proportion to the subject’s value or
          excellency. Sin or disrespect is evil or heinous in proportion to the
          degree of what it denies in the object, and as it were takes from it,
          viz. its excellency and worthiness of respect. On the contrary,
          respect is valuable in proportion to the value of what is given to the
          object in that respect, which undoubtedly (other things being equal)
          is great in proportion to the subject’s value, or worthiness of
          regard, because the subject in giving his respect, can give no more
          than himself. So far as he gives his respect, he gives himself to the
          object, and therefore his gift is of greater or lesser value in
          proportion to the value of himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence (by the way) the love, honor, and obedience of Christ towards
          God, has infinite value, from the excellency and dignity of the person
          in whom these qualifications were inherent. The reason why we needed a
          person of infinite dignity to obey for us, was because of our infinite
          comparative meanness, who had disobeyed, whereby our disobedience was
          infinitely aggravated. We needed one, the worthiness of whose
          obedience might be answerable to the unworthiness of our disobedience,
          and therefore needed one who was as great and worthy as we were
          unworthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another objection (that perhaps may be thought hardly worth
          mentioning) is, that to suppose sin to be infinitely heinous, is to
          make all sins equally heinous: for how can any sin be more than
          infinitely heinous? But all that can be argued hence is, that no sin
          can be greater with respect to that aggravation, the worthiness of the
          object against whom it is committed. One sin cannot be more aggravated
          than another in that respect, because the aggravation of every sin is
          infinite, but that does not hinder that some sins may be more heinous
          than others in other respects: as if we should suppose a cylinder
          infinitely long, cannot be greater in that respect, viz. with respect
          to the length of it. But yet it may be doubled and trebled, and make a
          thousand-fold more, by the increase of other dimensions. Of sins that
          are all infinitely heinous, some may be more heinous than others, as
          well as of divers punishments that are all infinitely dreadful
          calamities, or all of them infinitely exceeding all finite calamities,
          so that there is no finite calamity, however great, but what is
          infinitely less dreadful, or more eligible than any of them. Yet some
          of them may be a thousand times more dreadful than others. A
          punishment may be infinitely dreadful by reason of the infinite
          duration of it, and therefore cannot be greater with respect to that
          aggravation of it, viz. its length of continuance, but yet may be
          vastly more terrible on other accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus, as I imagine, made it clear that all sin is infinitely
          heinous, and consequently that the sinner, before he is justified, is
          under infinite guilt in God’s sight, it now remains that I show the
          consequence, or how it follows from hence, that it is not suitable
          that God should give the sinner an interest in Christ’s merits, and so
          a title to his benefits, from regard to any qualification, or act, or
          course of acts in him, on the account of any excellency or goodness
          whatsoever therein, but only as uniting to Christ; or (which fully
          implies it) that it is not suitable that God, by any act, should, in
          any manner or degree, testify any acceptance of, or pleasedness with
          anything, as any virtue, or excellency, or any part of loveliness, or
          valuableness in his person, until he is actually already interested in
          Christ’s merits. From the premises it follows, that before the sinner
          is already interested in Christ, and justified, it is impossible God
          should have any acceptance of, or pleasedness with the person of the
          sinner, as in any degree lovely in his sight, or indeed less the
          object of his displeasure and wrath. For, by the supposition, the
          sinner still remains infinitely guilty in the sight of God, for guilt
          is not removed but by pardon. But to suppose the sinner already
          pardoned, is to suppose him already justified, which is contrary to
          the supposition. But if the sinner still remains infinitely guilty in
          God’s sight, that is the same thing as still to be beheld of God as
          infinitely the object of his displeasure and wrath, or infinitely
          hateful in his eyes. If so, where is any room for anything in him, to
          be accepted as some valuableness or acceptability of him in God’s
          sight, or for any act of favor of any kind towards him, or any gift
          whatsoever to him, in testimony of God’s respect to and acceptance of
          something of him lovely and pleasing? If we should suppose that a
          sinner could have faith, or some other grace in his heart, and yet
          remain separate from Christ, and that he is not looked upon as being
          in Christ, or having any relation to him, it would not be meet that
          such true grace should be accepted of God as any loveliness of his
          person in the sight of God. If it should be accepted as the loveliness
          of the person, that would be to accept the person as in some degree
          lovely to God. But this cannot be consistent with his still remaining
          under infinite guilt, or infinite unworthiness in God’s sight, which
          that goodness has no worthiness to balance. — While God beholds the
          man as separate from Christ, he must behold him as he is in himself,
          and so his goodness cannot be beheld by God, but as taken with his
          guilt and hatefulness, and as put in the scales with it. So his
          goodness is nothing, because there is a finite on the balance against
          an infinite whose proportion to it is nothing. In such a case, if the
          man be looked on as he is in himself, the excess of the weight in one
          scale above another, must be looked upon as the quality of the man.
          These contraries being beheld together, one takes from another, as one
          number is subtracted from another, and the man must be looked upon in
          God’s sight according to the remainder. For here, by the supposition,
          all acts of grace or favor, in not imputing the guilt as it is, are
          excluded, because that supposes a degree of pardon, and that supposes
          justification, which is contrary to what is supposed, viz. that the
          sinner is not already justified. Therefore things must be taken
          strictly as they are, and so the man is still infinitely unworthy and
          hateful in God’s sight, as he was before, without diminution, because
          his goodness bears no proportion to his unworthiness, and therefore
          when taken together is nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence may be more clearly seen the force of that expression in the
          text, of believing on him that justifieth the ungodly. For though
          there is indeed something in man that is really and spiritually good,
          prior to justification, yet there is nothing that is accepted as any
          godliness or excellency of the person, till after justification.
          Goodness or loveliness of the person in the acceptance of God, in any
          degree, is not to be considered as prior but posterior in the order
          and method of God’s proceeding in this affair. Though a respect to the
          natural suitableness between such a qualification, and such a state,
          does go before justification, yet the acceptance even of faith as any
          goodness or loveliness of the believer, follows justification. The
          goodness is on the forementioned account justly looked upon as
          nothing, until the man is justified: And therefore the man is
          respected in justification, as in himself altogether hateful. Thus the
          nature of things will not admit of a man having an interest given him
          in the merits or benefits of a Savior, on the account of anything as a
          righteousness, or a virtue, or excellency in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. A divine constitution antecedent to that which establishes
          justification by a Savior (and indeed to any need of a Savior), stands
          in the way of it, viz. that original constitution or law which man was
          put under, by which constitution or law the sinner is condemned,
          because he is a violator of that law, and stands condemned, till he
          has actually an interest in the Savior, through whom he is set at
          liberty from that condemnation. But to suppose that God gives a man an
          interest in Christ in reward for his righteousness or virtue, is
          inconsistent with his still remaining under condemnation till he has
          an interest in Christ, because it supposes, that the sinner’s virtue
          is accepted, and he accepted for it, before he has an interest in
          Christ, inasmuch as an interest in Christ is given as a reward of his
          virtue. But the virtue must first be accepted, before it is rewarded,
          and the man must first be accepted for his virtue before he is
          rewarded for it with so great and glorious a reward. For the very
          notion of a reward, is some good bestowed in testimony of respect to
          and acceptance of virtue in the person rewarded. It does not consist
          with the honor of the majesty of the King of heaven and earth, to
          accept of anything from a condemned malefactor, condemned by the
          justice of his own holy law, till that condemnation be removed. And
          then, such acceptance is inconsistent with, and contradictory to such
          remaining condemnation, for the law condemns him that violates it, to
          be totally rejected and cast off by God. But how can a man continue
          under this condemnation, i. e. continue utterly rejected and cast off
          by God, and yet his righteousness or virtue be accepted, and he
          himself accepted on the account of it, so as to have so glorious a
          reward as an interest in Christ bestowed as a testimony of that
          acceptance?
        </p>
        <p>
          I know that the answer will be that we now are not subject to that
          constitution which mankind were at first put under, but that God, in
          mercy to mankind, has abolished that rigorous constitution, and put us
          under a new law, and introduced a more mild constitution, and that the
          constitution or law itself not remaining, there is no need of
          supposing that the condemnation of it remains, to stand in the way of
          the acceptance of our virtue. And indeed there is no other way of
          avoiding this difficulty. The condemnation of the law must stand in
          force against a man, till he is actually interested in the Savior who
          has satisfied and answered the law, so as effectually to prevent any
          acceptance of his virtue, either before, or in order to such an
          interest, unless the law or constitution itself be abolished. But the
          scheme of those modern divines by whom this is maintained, seems to
          contain a great deal of absurdity and self-contradiction. They hold
          that the old law given to Adam, which requires perfect obedience, is
          entirely repealed, and that instead of it we are put under a new law,
          which requires no more than imperfect sincere obedience, in compliance
          with our poor, infirm, impotent circumstances since the fall, whereby
          we are unable to perform that perfect obedience that was required by
          the first law. For they strenuously maintain, that it would be unjust
          in God to require anything of us that is beyond our present power and
          ability to perform, and yet they hold, that Christ died to satisfy for
          the imperfections of our obedience, that so our imperfect obedience
          might be accepted instead of perfect. Now, how can these things hang
          together? I would ask what law these imperfections of our obedience
          are a breach of? If they are a breach of no law, then they are not
          sins, and if they be not sins, what need of Christ’s dying to satisfy
          for them? But if they are sins, and so the breach of some law, what
          law is it? They cannot be a breach of their new law, for that requires
          no other than imperfect obedience, or obedience with imperfections.
          They cannot be a breach of the old law, for that they say is entirely
          abolished, and we never were under it, and we cannot break a law that
          we never were under. They say it would not be just in God to exact of
          us perfect obedience, because it would not be just in God to require
          more of us than we can perform in our present state, and to punish us
          for failing of it. Therefore by their own scheme, the imperfections of
          our obedience do not deserve to be punished. What need therefore of
          Christ’s dying to satisfy for them? What need of Christ’s suffering to
          satisfy for that which is no fault, and in its own nature deserves no
          suffering? What need of Christ’s dying to purchase that our imperfect
          obedience should be accepted, when according to their scheme it would
          be unjust in itself that any other obedience than imperfect should be
          required? What need of Christ’s dying to make way for God’s accepting
          such an obedience, as it would in itself be unjust in him not to
          accept? Is there any need of Christ’s dying to persuade God not to do
          unjustly? If it be said that Christ died to satisfy that law for us,
          that so we might not be under that law, but might be delivered from
          it, that so there might be room for us to be under a more mild law,
          still I would inquire, What need of Christ’s dying that we might not
          be under a law that (according to their scheme) it would in itself be
          unjust that we should be under, because in our present state we are
          not able to keep it? What need of Christ’s dying that we might not be
          under a law that it would be unjust that we should be under, whether
          Christ died or no?
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus far I have argued principally from reason, and the nature of
          things: — I proceed now to the
        </p>
        <p>
          Second argument, which is that this is a doctrine which the Holy
          Scriptures, the revelation that God has given us of his mind and will
          — by which alone we can never come to know how those who have offended
          God can come to be accepted of him, and justified in his sight — is
          exceeding full. The apostle Paul is abundant in teaching, that “we are
          justified by faith alone, without the works of the law.” (Rom. 3:28;
          4:5; 5:1; Gal. 2:16; 3:8; 3:11; 3:24) There is no one doctrine that he
          insists so much upon, and that he handles with so much distinctness,
          explaining, giving reasons and answering objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here it is not denied by any, that the apostle does assert that we are
          justified by faith, without the works of the law, because the words
          are express. But only it is said that we take his words wrong, and
          understand that by them that never entered into his heart, in that
          when he excludes the works of the law, we understand him of the whole
          law of God, or the rule which he has given to mankind to walk by:
          whereas all that he intends is the ceremonial law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some that oppose this doctrine indeed say that the apostle sometimes
          means that it is by faith, i.e. a hearty embracing the gospel in its
          first act only, or without any preceding holy life, that persons are
          admitted into a justified state. But say they, it is by a persevering
          obedience that they are continued in a justified state, and it is by
          this that they are finally justified. But this is the same thing as to
          say, that a man on his first embracing the gospel is conditionally
          justified and pardoned. To pardon sin is to free the sinner from the
          punishment of it, or from that eternal misery that is due it.
          Therefore if a person is pardoned, or freed from this misery, on his
          first embracing the gospel, and yet not finally freed, but his actual
          freedom still depends on some condition yet to be performed, it is
          inconceivable how he can be pardoned otherwise than conditionally:
          that is, he is not properly actually pardoned, and freed from
          punishment, but only he has God’s promise that he shall be pardoned on
          future conditions. God promises him, that now, if he perseveres in
          obedience, he shall be finally pardoned or actually freed from hell,
          which is to make just nothing at all of the apostle’s great doctrine
          of justification by faith alone. Such a conditional pardon is no
          pardon or justification at all any more than all mankind have, whether
          they embrace the gospel or no. For they all have a promise of final
          justification on conditions of future sincere obedience, as much as he
          that embraces the gospel. But not to dispute about this, we will
          suppose that there may be something or other at the sinner’s first
          embracing the gospel, that may properly be called justification or
          pardon, and yet that final justification, or real freedom from the
          punishment of sin, is still suspended on conditions hitherto
          unfulfilled. Yet they who hold that sinners are thus justified on
          embracing the gospel, suppose that they are justified by this, no
          otherwise than as it is a leading act of obedience, or at least as
          virtue and moral goodness in them, and therefore would be excluded by
          the apostle as much as any other virtue or obedience, if it be allowed
          that he means the moral law, when he excludes works of the law. And
          therefore, if that point be yielded, that the apostle means the moral,
          and not only the ceremonial, law, their whole scheme falls to the
          ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          And because the issue of the whole argument from those texts in St.
          Paul’s epistles depends on the determination of this point, I would be
          particular in the discussion of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of our opponents in this doctrine of justification, when they
          deny that by the law the apostle means the moral law or the whole rule
          of life which God has given to mankind, seem to choose to express
          themselves thus: that the apostle only intends the Mosaic
          dispensation. But this comes to just the same thing as if they said
          that the apostle only means to exclude the works of the ceremonial
          law. For when they say that it is intended only that we are not
          justified by the works of the Mosaic dispensation, if they mean
          anything by it, it must be, that we are not justified by attending and
          observing what is Mosaic in that dispensation, or by what was peculiar
          to it, and wherein it differed from the Christian dispensation, which
          is the same as that which is ceremonial and positive, and not moral,
          in that administration. So that this is what I have to disprove, viz.
          that the apostle, when he speaks of works of the law in this affair,
          means only works of the ceremonial law, or those observances that were
          peculiar to the Mosaic administration.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here it must be noted, that nobody controverts it with them,
          whether the works of the ceremonial law be not included, or whether
          the apostle does not particularly argue against justification by
          circumcision, and other ceremonial observances. But all in question is
          whether when he denies justification by works of the law, he is to be
          understood only of the ceremonial law, or whether the moral law be not
          also implied and intended. And therefore those arguments which are
          brought to prove that the apostle meant the ceremonial law, are
          nothing to the purpose, unless they prove that the apostle meant those
          only.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is much insisted on is that it was the judaizing Christians being
          so fond of circumcision and other ceremonies of the law, and depending
          so much on them, which was the very occasion of the apostle’s writing
          as he does against justification by the works of the law. But
          supposing it were so, that their trusting in works of the ceremonial
          law were the sole occasion of the apostle’s writing (which yet there
          is no reason to allow, as may appear afterwards), if their trusting in
          a particular work, as a work of righteousness, was all that gave
          occasion to the apostle to write, how does it follow, that therefore
          the apostle did not upon that occasion write against trusting in all
          works of righteousness whatsoever? Where is the absurdity of supposing
          that the apostle might take occasion, from his observing some to trust
          in a certain work as trusting in any works of righteousness at all,
          and that it was a very proper occasion too? Yea, it would have been
          unavoidable for the apostle to have argued against trusting in a
          particular work, in the quality of a work of righteousness, which
          quality was general, but he must therein argue against trusting in
          works of righteousness in general. Supposing it had been some other
          particular sort of works that was the occasion of the apostle’s
          writing, as for instance, works of charity, and the apostle should
          hence take occasion to write to them not to trust in their works,
          could the apostle by that be understood of no other works besides
          works of charity? Would it have been absurd to understand him as
          writing against trusting in any work at all, because it was their
          trusting to a particular work that gave occasion to his writing?
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing alleged, as an evidence that the apostle means the
          ceremonial law — when he says, we cannot be justified by the works of
          the law — is that he uses this argument to prove it, viz. that the law
          he speaks of was given so long after the covenant with Abraham, in
          Gal. 3:17, “And this I say, that the covenant that was confirmed
          before of God in Christ, the law which was four hundred and thirty
          years after, cannot disannul.” But, say they, it was only the Mosaic
          administration, and not the covenant of works, that was given so long
          after. But the apostle’s argument seems manifestly to be mistaken by
          them. The apostle does not speak of a law that began to exist four
          hundred and thirty years after. If he did, there would be some force
          in their objection, but he has respect to a certain solemn
          transaction, well known among the Jews by the phrase “the giving of
          the law,” which was at Mount Sinai (Exo. 19, 20) consisting especially
          in God’s giving the ten commandments (which is the moral law) with a
          terrible voice, which law he afterwards gave in tables of stone. This
          transaction the Jews in the apostle’s time misinterpreted. They looked
          upon it as God’s establishing that law as a rule of justification.
          Against this conceit of theirs the apostle brings this invincible
          argument, viz. that God would never go about to disannul his covenant
          with Abraham, which was plainly a covenant of grace, by a transaction
          with his posterity, that was so long after it, and was plainly built
          upon it. He would not overthrow a covenant of grace that he had long
          before established with Abraham, for him and his seed (which is often
          mentioned as the ground of God’s making them his people), by now
          establishing a covenant of works with them at Mount Sinai, as the Jews
          and judaizing Christians supposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that the apostle does not mean only works of the ceremonial law,
          when he excludes works of the law in justification, but also of the
          moral law, and all works of obedience, virtue, and righteousness
          whatsoever, may appear by the following things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The apostle does not only say that we are not justified by the
          works of the law, but that we are not justified by works, using a
          general term, as in our text, “to him that worketh not, but believeth
          on him that justifieth,” etc.; and in the 6th verse, “God imputeth
          righteousness without works;” and Rom. 11:6, “And if by grace, then is
          it no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace: but if it be of
          works, then it is no more grace; otherwise work is no more work.” So,
          Eph. 2:8, 9, “For by grace are ye saved, through faith, — not of
          works;” by which, there is no reason in the world to understand the
          apostle of any other than works in general, as correlates of a reward,
          or good works, or works of virtue and righteousness. When the apostle
          says, we are justified or saved not by works, without any such term
          annexed, as the law, or any other addition to limit the expression,
          what warrant have any to confine it to works of a particular law or
          institution, excluding others? Are not observances of other divine
          laws works, as well as of that? It seems to be allowed by the divines
          in the Arminian scheme, in their interpretation of several of those
          texts where the apostle only mentions works, without any addition,
          that he means our own good works in general. But then, they say, he
          only means to exclude any proper merit in those works. But to say the
          apostle means one thing when he says, we are not justified by works,
          and another when he says, we are not justified by the works of the
          law, when we find the expressions mixed and used in the same
          discourse, and when the apostle is evidently upon the same argument,
          is very unreasonable. It is to dodge and fly from Scripture, rather
          than open and yield ourselves to its teachings.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the third chapter of Romans, our having been guilty of breaches
          of the moral law, is an argument that the apostle uses, why we cannot
          be justified by the works of the Old Testament, that all are under
          sin: “There is none righteous, no not one: their throat is as an open
          sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit: their mouth is
          full of cursing and bitterness; and their feet swift to shed blood.”
          And so he goes on, mentioning only those things that are breaches of
          the moral law. And then when he has done, his conclusion is, in the
          19th and 20th verses, “Now we know that whatsoever things the law
          saith, it saith to them that are under the law, that every mouth may
          be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore,
          by the deeds of the law, shall no flesh be justified in his sight.”
          This is most evidently his argument, because all had sinned (as it was
          said in the 9th verse), and been guilty of those breaches of the moral
          law that he had mentioned (and it is repeated over again, verse 23),
          “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;” therefore
          none at all can be justified by the deeds of the law. Now if the
          apostle meant only, that we are not justified by the deeds of the
          ceremonial law, what kind of arguing would that be, “Their mouth is
          full of cursing and bitterness, their feet are swift to shed blood?”
          therefore they cannot be justified by the deeds of the Mosaic
          administration. They are guilty of the breaches of the moral law, and
          therefore they cannot be justified by the deeds of the ceremonial law!
          Doubtless, the apostle’s argument is that the very same law they have
          broken, can never justify them as observers of it, because every law
          necessarily condemns it violators. And therefore our breaches of the
          moral law argue no more, than that we cannot be justified by that law
          we have broken.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it may be noted, that the apostle’s argument here is the same that
          I have already used, viz. that as we are in ourselves, and out of
          Christ, we are under the condemnation of that original law or
          constitution that God established with mankind. And therefore it is no
          way fit that anything we do, any virtue or obedience of ours, should
          be accepted, or we accepted on the account of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The apostle, in all the preceding part of this epistle, wherever he
          has the phrase, the law, evidently intends the moral law principally.
          As in the 12th verse of the foregoing chapter: “For as many as have
          sinned without law, shall also perish without law.” It is evidently
          the written moral law the apostle means, by the next verse but one,
          “For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
          things contained in the law;” that is, the moral law that the Gentiles
          have by nature. And so the next verse, “Which show the work of the law
          written in their hearts.” It is the moral law, and not the ceremonial,
          that is written in the hearts of those who are destitute of divine
          revelation. And so in the 18th verse, “Thou approvest the things that
          are more excellent, being instructed out of the law.” It is the moral
          law that shows us the nature of things, and teaches us what is
          excellent, 20th verse, “Thou hast a form of knowledge and truth in the
          law.” It is the moral law, as is evident by what follows, verse 22,
          23, “Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou
          commit adultery? Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit
          sacrilege? Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the
          law, dishonourest thou God?” Adultery, idolatry, and sacrilege, surely
          are the breaking of the moral, and not the ceremonial law. So in the
          27th verse, “And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it
          fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost
          transgress the law?” i.e. the Gentiles, that you despise because
          uncircumcised, if they live moral and holy lives, in obedience to the
          moral law, shall condemn you though circumcised. And so there is not
          one place in all the preceding part of the epistle, where the apostle
          speaks of the law, but that he most apparently intends principally the
          moral law. And yet when the apostle, in continuance of the same
          discourse, comes to tell us, that we cannot be justified by the works
          of the law, then they will needs have it, that he means only the
          ceremonial law. Yea, though all this discourse about the moral law,
          showing how the Jews as well as Gentiles have violated it, is
          evidently preparatory and introductory to that doctrine, Rom. 3:20,
          “That no flesh,” that is, none of mankind, neither Jews nor Gentiles,
          “can be justified by the works of the law.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is evident that when the apostle says, we cannot be justified by
          the works of the law, he means the moral as well as ceremonial law, by
          his giving this reason for it, that “by the law is the knowledge of
          sin,” as Rom. 3:20, “By the deeds of the law shall no flesh be
          justified in his sight; for by the law is the knowledge of sin.” Now
          that law by which we come to the knowledge of sin, is the moral law
          chiefly and primarily. If this argument of the apostle be good, “that
          we cannot be justified by the deeds of the law, because it is by the
          law that we come to the knowledge of sin;” then it proves that we
          cannot be justified by the deeds of the moral law, nor by the precepts
          of Christianity; for by them is the knowledge of sin. If the reason be
          good, then where the reason holds, the truth holds. It is a miserable
          shift, and a violent force put upon the words, to say that the meaning
          is, that by the law of circumcision is the knowledge of sin, because
          circumcision signifying the taking away of sin, puts men in mind of
          sin. The plain meaning of the apostle is that as the law most strictly
          forbids sin, it tends to convince us of sin, and bring our own
          consciences to condemn us, instead of justifying of us: that the use
          of it is to declare to us our own guilt and unworthiness, which is the
          reverse of justifying and approving of us as virtuous or worthy. This
          is the apostle’s meaning, if we will allow him to be his own
          expositor. For he himself, in this very epistle, explains to us how it
          is that by the law we have the knowledge of sin, and that it is by the
          law’s forbidding sin, Rom. 7:7, “I had not known sin, but by the law;
          for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not
          covet.” There the apostle determines two things: first, that the way
          in which “by the law is the knowledge of sin,” is by the law’s
          forbidding sin, and secondly, which is more directly still to the
          purpose, he determines that it is the moral law by which we come to
          the knowledge of sin. “For,” says he, “I had not known lust, except
          the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.” Now it is the moral, and not
          the ceremonial law, that says, “Thou shalt not covet.” Therefore, when
          the apostle argues that by the deeds of the law no flesh living shall
          be justified, because by the law is the knowledge of sin, his argument
          proves (unless he was mistaken as to the force of his argument), that
          we cannot be justified by the deeds of the moral law.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It is evident that the apostle does not mean only the ceremonial
          law, because he gives this reason why we have righteousness, and a
          title to the privilege of God’s children, not by the law, but by
          faith, “that the law worketh wrath.” Rom. 4:13-16, “For the promise
          that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his
          seed through the law, but through righteousness of faith. For if they
          which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise
          made of none effect. Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law
          is, there is no transgression. Therefore it is of faith, that it might
          be by grace.” Now the way in which the law works wrath, by the
          apostle’s own account, in the reason he himself annexes, is by
          forbidding sin, and aggravating the guilt of the transgression. “For,”
          says he, “where no law is, there is no transgression:” And so, Rom.
          7:13, “That sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.” If,
          therefore, this reason of the apostle be good, it is much stronger
          against justification by the moral law than the ceremonial law. For it
          is by transgressions of the moral law chiefly that there comes wrath:
          for they are most strictly forbidden, and most terribly threatened.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. It is evident that when the apostle says, we are not justified by
          the works of the law, that he excludes all our own virtue, goodness,
          or excellency, by that reason he gives for it, viz. “That boasting
          might be excluded.” Rom. 3:26, 27, 28, “To declare, I say, at this
          time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of
          him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded.
          By what law? of works? Nay; but by the law of faith. Therefore we
          conclude, that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the
          law.” Eph. 2:8, 9, “For by grace are ye saved, through faith; and that
          not of yourselves; it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man
          should boast.” Now what are men wont to boast of, but what they esteem
          their own goodness or excellency? If we are not justified by works of
          the ceremonial law, yet how does that exclude boasting, as long as we
          are justified by our own excellency, or virtue and goodness of our
          own, or works of righteousness which we have done?
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is said, that boasting is excluded, as circumcision was
          excluded, which was what the Jews especially used to glory in, and
          value themselves upon, above other nations.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this I answer, that the Jews were not only used to boast of
          circumcision, but were notorious for boasting of their moral
          righteousness. The Jews of those days were generally admirers and
          followers of the Pharisees, who were full of their boasts of their
          moral righteousness; as we may see by the example of the Pharisee
          mentioned in the 18th of Luke, which Christ mentions as describing the
          general temper of that sect: “Lord,” says he, “I thank thee, that I am
          not as other men, an extortioner, nor unjust, nor an adulterer.” The
          works that he boasts of were chiefly moral works: he depended on the
          works of the law for justification. And therefore Christ tells us,
          that the publican, that renounced all his own righteousness, “went
          down to his house justified rather than he.” And elsewhere, we read of
          the Pharisees praying in the corners of the streets, and sounding a
          trumpet before them when they did alms. But those works which they so
          vainly boasted of were moral works. And not only so, but what the
          apostle in this very epistle condemns the Jews for, is their boasting
          of the moral law. Rom. 2:22, 23, “Thou that sayest a man should not
          commit adultery, do thou commit adultery? Thou that abhorrest idols,
          dost thou commit sacrilege? Thou that makest thy boast of the law,
          through breaking the law, dishonourest thou God?” The law here
          mentioned that they made their boast of, was that of which adultery,
          idolatry, and sacrilege, were the breaches, which is the moral law. So
          that this is the boasting which the apostle condemns them for. And
          therefore, if they were justified by the works of this law, then how
          comes he to say that their boasting is excluded? And besides, when
          they boasted of the rites of the ceremonial law, it was under a notion
          of its being a part of their own goodness or excellency, or what made
          them holier and more lovely in the sight of God than other people. If
          they were not justified by this part of their own supposed goodness or
          holiness, yet if they were by another, how did that exclude boasting?
          How was their boasting excluded, unless all goodness or excellency of
          their own was excluded
        </p>
        <p>
          7. The reason given by the apostle why we can be justified only by
          faith, and not by the works of the law, in the 3d chapter of Galations
          viz. “That they that are under the law, are under the curse,” makes it
          evident that he does not mean only the ceremonial law. In that chapter
          the apostle had particularly insisted upon it, that Abraham was
          justified by faith, and that it is by faith only, and not by the works
          of the law, that we can be justified, and become the children of
          Abraham, and be made partakers of the blessing of Abraham: and he
          gives this reason for it in the 10th verse: “For as many as are of the
          works of the law, are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is
          every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the
          book of the law to do them.” It is manifest that these words, cited
          from Deuteronomy, are spoken not only with regard to the ceremonial
          law, but the whole law of God to mankind and chiefly the moral law,
          and that all mankind are therefore as they are in themselves under the
          curse, not only while the ceremonial law lasted, but now since that
          has ceased. And therefore all who are justified, are redeemed from
          that curse, by Christ’s bearing it for them; as in verse 13, “Christ
          hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us:
          for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.” Now
          therefore, either its being said that he is cursed who continueth not
          in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them, is
          a good reason why we cannot be justified by the works of that law of
          which it is so said, or it is not: if it be, then it is a good reason
          why we cannot be justified by the works of the moral law, and of the
          whole rule which God has given to mankind to walk by. For the words
          are spoken of the moral as well as the ceremonial law, and reach every
          command or precept which God has given to mankind, and chiefly the
          moral precepts, which are most strictly enjoined, and the violations
          of which in both the New Testament and the Old, and in the books of
          Moses themselves, are threatened with the most dreadful curse.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. The apostle in like manner argues against our being justified by
          our own righteousness, as he does against being justified by the works
          of the law; and evidently uses the expressions, of our own
          righteousness, and works of the law, promiscuously, and as signifying
          the same thing. It is particularly evident by Rom. 10:3, “For they
          being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish
          their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the
          righteousness of God.” Here it is plain that the same thing is
          asserted as in the two last verses but one of the foregoing chapter,
          “But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not
          attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? because they sought
          it, not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law.” And it is
          very unreasonable, upon several accounts, to suppose that the apostle,
          by their own righteousness, intends only their ceremonial
          righteousness. For when the apostle warns us against trusting in our
          own righteousness of justification, doubtless it is fair to interpret
          the expression in an agreement with other scriptures. Here we are
          warned, not to think that it is for the sake of our own righteousness
          that we obtain God’s favor and blessing: as particularly in Deu.
          9:4-6, “Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the Lord thy God
          hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the
          Lord hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness
          of these nations the Lord doth drive them out from before thee. Not
          for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost
          thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these
          nations, the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and
          that he may perform the word which he sware unto thy fathers, Abraham,
          Isaac, and Jacob. Understand therefore, that the Lord thy God giveth
          thee not this good land to possess it, for thy righteousness; for thou
          art a stiff-necked people.” None will pretend that here the expression
          thy righteousness, signifies only a ceremonial righteousness, but all
          virtue or goodness of their own — yea, and the inward goodness of the
          heart, as well as the outward goodness of life; which appears by the
          beginning of the 5th verse, “Not for thy righteousness, or for the
          uprightness of thy heart;” and also by the antithesis in the 6th
          verse, “Not for thy righteousness, for thou art a stiff-necked
          people.” Their stiff-neckedness was their moral wickedness, obstinacy,
          and perverseness of heart. By righteousness, therefore, on the
          contrary, is meant their moral virtue, and rectitude of heart and
          life. This is what I would argue from hence, that the expression of
          our own righteousness, when used in Scripture with relation to the
          favor of God — and when we are warned against looking upon it as that
          by which that favor, or the fruits of it, are obtained — does not
          signify only a ceremonial righteousness, but all manner of goodness of
          our own.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jews also, in the New Testament, are condemned for trusting in
          their own righteousness in this sense, Luke 18:9, etc. “And he spake
          this parable unto certain that trusted in themselves that they were
          righteous.” This intends chiefly a moral righteousness, as appears by
          the parable itself, in which we have an account of the prayer of the
          Pharisee, wherein the things that he mentions as what he trusts in,
          are chiefly moral qualifications and performances, viz. that he was
          not an extortioner, unjust, nor an adulterer, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we need not go to the writings of other penmen of the Scripture.
          If we will allow the apostle Paul to be his own interpreter, he — when
          he speaks of our own righteousness as that by which we are not
          justified or saved — does not mean only a ceremonial righteousness,
          nor does he only intend a way of religion and serving God, of our own
          choosing, without divine warrant or prescription. But by our own
          righteousness he means the same as a righteousness of our own doing,
          whether it be a service or righteousness of God’s prescribing, or our
          own unwarranted performing. Let it be an obedience to the ceremonial
          law, or a gospel obedience, or what it will: if it be a righteousness
          of our own doing, it is excluded by the apostle in this affair, as is
          evident by Tit. 3:5, “Not by works of righteousness which we have
          done.” — But I would more particularly insist on this text; and
          therefore this may be the
        </p>
        <p>
          9th argument: that the apostle, when he denies justification by works,
          works of the law, and our own righteousness, does not mean works of
          the ceremonial law only. Tit. 3:3-7, “For we ourselves also were
          sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and
          pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
          But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward men
          appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
          according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration,
          and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly,
          through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that being justified by his grace we
          should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.” Works of
          righteousness that we have done are here excluded, as what we are
          neither saved nor justified by. The apostle expressly says, we are not
          saved by them, and it is evident that when he says this, he has
          respect to the affair of justification. And that he means, we are not
          saved by them in not being justified by them, as by the next verse but
          one, which is part of the same sentence, “That being justified by his
          grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is several ways manifest, that the apostle in this text, by “works
          of righteousness which we have done,” does not mean only works of the
          ceremonial law. It appears by the 3d verse, “For we ourselves also
          were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts
          and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one
          another.” These are breaches of the moral law, that the apostle
          observes they lived in before they were justified: and it is most
          plain that it is this which gives occasion to the apostle to observe,
          as he does in the 5th verse, that is was not by works of righteousness
          which they had done, that they were saved or justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we need not go to the context, it is most apparent from the words
          themselves, that the apostle does not mean only works of the
          ceremonial law. If he had only said, it is not by our own works of
          righteousness. What could we understand by works of righteousness, but
          only righteous works, or, which is the same thing, good works? And not
          say, that it is by our own righteous works that we are justified,
          though not by one particular kind of righteous works, would certainly
          be a contradiction to such an assertion. But, the works are rendered
          yet more strong, plain, and determined in their sense, by those
          additional words, which we have done, which shows that the apostle
          intends to exclude all our own righteous or virtuous works
          universally. If it should be asserted concerning any commodity,
          treasure, or precious jewel, that it could not be procured by money,
          and not only so, but to make the assertion the more strong, it should
          be asserted with additional words, that it could not be procured by
          money that men possess, how unreasonable would it be, after all, to
          say that all that was meant was, that it could not be procured with
          brass money.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what renders the interpreting of this text, as intending works of
          the ceremonial law, yet more unreasonable, is that these works were
          indeed no works of righteousness at all, but were only falsely
          supposed to be so by the Jews. And this our opponents in this doctrine
          also suppose is the very reason why we are not justified by them,
          because they are not works of righteousness, or because (the
          ceremonial law being now abrogated) there is no obedience in them. But
          how absurd is it to say, that the apostle, when he says we are not
          justified by works of righteousness that we have done, meant only
          works of the ceremonial law, and that for that very reason, because
          they are not works of righteousness? To illustrate this by the
          forementioned comparison: If it should be asserted, that such a thing
          could not be procured by money that men possess, how ridiculous would
          it be to say, that the meaning only was, that it could not be procured
          by counterfeit money, and that for that reason, because it was not
          money. What Scripture will stand before men, if they will take liberty
          to manage Scripture thus? Or what one text is there in the Bible that
          may not at this rate be explained all away, and perverted to any sense
          men please?
        </p>
        <p>
          But further, if we should allow that the apostle intends only to
          oppose justification by works of the ceremonial law in this text, yet
          it is evident by the expression he uses, that he means to oppose it
          under that notion, or in that quality, of their being works of
          righteousness of our own doing. But if the apostle argues against our
          being justified by works of the ceremonial law, under the notion of
          their being of that nature and kind, viz. works of our own doing, then
          it will follow that the apostle’s argument is strong against, not only
          those, but all of that nature and kind, even all that are of our own
          doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there were not other text in the Bible about justification but
          this, this would clearly and invincibly prove that we are not
          justified by any of our own goodness, virtue, or righteousness, or for
          the excellency or righteousness of anything that we have done in
          religion, because it is here so fully and strongly asserted. But this
          text abundantly confirms other texts of the apostle, where he denies
          justification by works of the law. No doubt can be rationally made,
          but that the apostle, when he shows, that God does not save us by
          “works of righteousness that we have done,” verse 5, and that so we
          are “justified by grace,” verse 7, herein opposing salvation by works,
          and salvation by grace — means the same works as he does in other
          places, where he in like manner opposes works and grace, as in Rom.
          11:6, “And if by grace, then it is no more of works: otherwise grace
          is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace:
          otherwise work is no more work.” And the same works as in Rom. 4:4,
          “Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of
          debt.” And the same works that are spoken of in the context of the
          24th verse of the foregoing chapter, which the apostle there calls
          “works of the law, being justified freely by his grace.” And of the
          4th chapter, 16th verse, “Therefore it is of faith, that it might be
          by grace.” Where in the context the righteousness of faith is opposed
          to the righteousness of the law: for here God’s saving us according to
          his mercy, and justifying us by grace, is opposed to saving us by
          works of righteousness that we have done. In the same manner as in
          those places, justifying us by his grace, is opposed to justifying us
          by works of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. The apostle could not mean only works of the ceremonial law, when
          he says, we are not justified by the works of the law, because it is
          asserted of the saints under the Old Testament as well as New. If men
          are justified by their sincere obedience, it will then follow that
          formerly, before the ceremonial law was abrogated, men were justified
          by the works of the ceremonial law, as well as the moral. For if we
          are justified by our sincere obedience, then it alters not the case,
          whether the commands be moral or positive, provided they be God’s
          commands, and our obedience be obedience to God. And so the case must
          be just the same under the Old Testament, with the works of the moral
          law and ceremonial, according to the measure of the virtue of
          obedience there was in either. It is true, their obedience to the
          ceremonial law would have nothing to do in the affair of
          justification, unless it was sincere, and so neither would the works
          of the moral law. If obedience was the thing, then obedience to the
          ceremonial law, while that stood in force, and obedience to the moral
          law, had just the same sort of concern, according to the proportion of
          obedience that consists in each. As now under the New Testament, if
          obedience is what we are justified by, that obedience must doubtless
          comprehend obedience to all God’s commands now in force, to the
          positive precepts of attendance on baptism and the Lord’s supper, as
          well as moral precepts. If obedience be the thing, it is not because
          it is obedience to such a kind of commands, but because it is
          obedience. So that by this supposition, the saints under the Old
          Testament were justified, at least in part, by their obedience to the
          ceremonial law.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is evident that the saints under the Old Testament were not
          justified, in any measure, by the works of the ceremonial law. This
          may be proved, proceeding on the foot of our adversaries’ own
          interpretation of the apostle’s phrase, “the works of the law,” and
          supposing them to mean by it only the works of the ceremonial law. To
          instance in David, it is evident that he was not justified in any wise
          by the works of the ceremonial law, by Rom. 4:6-8, “Even as David also
          describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth
          righteousness without works, saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities
          are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom
          the Lord will not impute sin.” It is plain that the apostle is here
          speaking of justification, from the preceding verse, and all the
          context; and the thing spoken of, viz. forgiving iniquities and
          covering sins, is what our adversaries themselves suppose to be
          justification, and even the whole of justification. This David,
          speaking of himself, says (by the apostle’s interpretation) that he
          had without works. For it is manifest that David, in the words here
          cited, from the beginning of the 32d Psalm, has a special respect to
          himself: he speaks of his own sins being forgiven and not imputed to
          him: as appears by the words that immediately follow, “When I kept
          silence, my bones waxed old; through my roaring all the day long. For
          day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into
          the drought of summer. I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine
          iniquity have I not hid; I said, I will confess my transgressions unto
          the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.” Let us therefore
          understand the apostle which way we will respecting works, when he
          says, “David describes the blessedness of the man to whom the Lord
          imputes righteousness without works,” whether of all manner of works,
          or only works of the ceremonial law, yet it is evident at least, that
          David was not justified by works of the ceremonial law. Therefore here
          is the argument: if our own obedience be that by which men are
          justified, then under the Old Testament, men were justified partly by
          obedience to the ceremonial law (as has been proved). But the saints
          under the Old Testament were not justified partly by the works of the
          ceremonial law. Therefore men’s own obedience is not that by which
          they are justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Another argument that the apostle, when he speaks of the two
          opposite ways of justification, one by the works of the law, and the
          other by faith, does not mean only the works of the ceremonial law,
          may be taken from Rom. 10:5, 6. “For Moses describeth the
          righteousness which is of the law, that the man which doth those
          things, shall live by them. But the righteousness which is of faith,
          speaketh on this wise,” etc. — Here two things are evident.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) That the apostle here speaks of the same two opposite ways of
          justification, one by the righteousness which is of the law, the other
          by faith, that he had treated of in the former part of the epistle.
          And therefore it must be the same law that is here spoken of. The same
          law is here meant as in the last verses of the foregoing chapter,
          where he says, the Jews had “not attained to the law of righteousness.
          Wherefore? Because they sought it, not by faith, but as it were by the
          works of the law;” as is plain, because the apostle is still speaking
          of the same thing. The words are a continuation of the same discourse,
          as may be seen at first glance, by anyone that looks on the context.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) It is manifest that Moses, when he describes the righteousness
          which is of the law, or the way of justification by the law, in the
          words here cited, “He that doth those things, shall live in them,”
          does not speak only, nor chiefly, of the works of the ceremonial law;
          for none will pretend that God ever made such a covenant with man,
          that he who kept the ceremonial law should live in it, or that there
          ever was a time, that it was chiefly by the works of the ceremonial
          law that men lived and were justified. Yea, it is manifest by the
          forementioned instance of David, mentioned in the 4th of Romans, that
          there never was a time wherein men were justified in any measure by
          the works of the ceremonial law, as has been just now shown. Moses
          therefore, in those words which, the apostle says, are a description
          of the righteousness which is of the law, cannot mean only the
          ceremonial law. And therefor it follows, that when the apostle speaks
          of justification by the works of the law, as opposite to justification
          by faith, he does not mean only the ceremonial law, but also the works
          of the moral law, which are the things spoken of by Moses, when he
          says, “He that doth those things, shall live in them.” And these are
          the things which the apostle in this very place is arguing that we
          cannot be justified by, as is evident by the last verses of the
          preceding chapter; “But Israel, which followed after the law of
          righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
          Wherefore? Because they sought it, not by faith, but as it were by the
          works of the law,” etc. And in the 3d verse of this chapter, “For they
          being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish
          their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the
          righteousness of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And further, how can the apostle’s description that he here gives from
          Moses, of this exploded way of justification by the works of the law,
          consist with the Arminian scheme, of a way of justification by the
          virtue of a sincere obedience, that still remains as the true and only
          way of justification under the gospel? It is most apparent that it is
          the design of the apostle to give a description of both the legal
          rejected and the evangelical valid ways of justification, in that
          wherein they are distinguished the one from the other. But how is it,
          that “he who doth those things, shall live in them,” that wherein the
          way of justification by the works of the law is distinguished from
          that in which Christians under the gospel are justified, according to
          their scheme. For still, according to them, it may be said, in the
          same manner, of the precepts of the gospel, he that does these things,
          shall live in them. The difference lies only in the things to be done,
          but not at all in that the doing of them is not the condition of
          living in them, just in the one case, as in the other. The words, “He
          that does them, shall live in them,” will serve just as well for a
          description of the latter as the former. By the apostle’s saying, the
          righteousness of the law is described thus, he that doth these things,
          shall live in them. But the righteousness of faith saith thus, plainly
          intimates that the righteousness of faith saith otherwise, and in an
          opposite manner. Besides, if these words cited from Moses are actually
          said by him of the moral law as well as ceremonial, as it is most
          evident they are, it renders it still more absurd to suppose them
          mentioned by the apostle, as the very note of distinction between
          justification by a ceremonial obedience, and a moral sincere
          obedience, as the Arminians must suppose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have spoken to a second argument, to prove that we are not
          justified by any manner of virtue or goodness of our own, viz. that to
          suppose otherwise, is contrary to the doctrine directly urged, and
          abundantly insisted on, by the apostle Paul in his epistles.
        </p>
        <p>I now proceed to a</p>
        <p>
          Third argument, viz. that to suppose that we are justified by our own
          sincere obedience, or any of our own virtue or goodness, derogates
          from gospel grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          That scheme of justification that manifestly takes from, or diminishes
          the grace of God, is undoubtedly to be rejected; for it is the
          declared design of God in the gospel to exalt the freedom and riches
          of his grace, in that method of justification of sinners, and way of
          admitting them to his favor, and the blessed fruits of it, which it
          declares. The Scripture teaches, that the way of justification
          appointed in the gospel covenant is appointed for that end, that free
          grace might be expressed, and glorified, Rom. 4:16, “Therefore it is
          of faith, that it might be by grace.” The exercising and magnifying of
          free grace in the gospel contrivance for the justification and
          salvation of sinners, is evidently the chief design of it. And this
          freedom and riches of grace in the gospel is everywhere spoken of in
          Scripture as the chief glory of it. Therefore that doctrine which
          derogates from the free grace of God in justifying sinners, as it is
          most opposite to God’s design, so it must be exceedingly offensive to
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who maintain, that we are justified by our own sincere
          obedience, pretend that their scheme does not diminish the grace of
          the gospel; for they say, that the grace of God is wonderfully
          manifested in appointing such a way and method of salvation by sincere
          obedience, in assisting us to perform such an obedience, and in
          accepting our imperfect obedience, instead of perfect.

          Let us therefore examine that matter, whether their scheme of a man’s
          being justified by his own virtue and sincere obedience, does derogate
          from the grace of God or no, or whether free grace is not more exalted
          in supposing, as we do, that we are justified without any manner of
          goodness of our own. In order to this, I will lay down the
          self-evident
        </p>
        <p>
          Proposition, that whatsoever that be by which the abundant benevolence
          of the giver is expressed, and gratitude in the receiver is obliged,
          that magnifies free grace. This I suppose none will ever controvert or
          dispute. And it is not much less evident, that it does both show a
          more abundant benevolence in the giver when he shows kindness without
          goodness or excellency in the object, to move him to it, and that it
          enhances the obligation to gratitude in the receiver.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It shows a more abundant goodness in the giver, when he shows
          kindness without any excellency in our persons or actions that should
          move the giver to love and beneficence. For it certainly shows the
          more abundant and overflowing goodness, or disposition to communicate
          good, by how much the less loveliness or excellency there is to entice
          beneficence. The less there is in the receiver to draw goodwill and
          kindness, it argues the more of the principle of goodwill and kindness
          in the giver. One that has but a little of a principle of love and
          benevolence, may be drawn to do good, and to show kindness, when there
          is a great deal to draw him, or when there is much excellency and
          loveliness in the object to move goodwill. When he whose goodness and
          benevolence is more abundant, [he] will show kindness where there is
          less to draw it forth. For he does not so much need to have it drawn
          from without, he has enough of the principle within to move him of
          itself. Where there is most of the principle, there it is most
          sufficient for itself, and stands in least need of something without
          to excite it. For certainly a more abundant goodness more easily flows
          forth with less to impel or draw it, than where there is less, or,
          which is the same thing, the more anyone is disposed of himself, the
          less he needs from without himself, to put him upon it, or stir him up
          to it. And therefore his kindness and goodness appears the more
          exceeding great, when it is bestowed without any excellency or
          loveliness at all in the receiver, or when the receiver is respected
          in the gift, as wholly without excellency. And much more still when
          the benevolence of the giver not only finds nothing in the receiver to
          draw it, but a great deal of hatefulness to repel it. The abundance of
          goodness is then manifested, not only in flowing forth without
          anything extrinsic to put it forward, but in overcoming great
          repulsion in the object. And then does kindness and love appear most
          triumphant, and wonderfully great, when the receiver is not only
          wholly without all excellency or beauty to attract it, but altogether,
          yea, infinitely vile and hateful.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is apparent also that it enhances the obligation to gratitude in
          the receiver. This is agreeable to the common sense of mankind, that
          the less worthy or excellent the object of benevolence, or the
          receiver of kindness is, the more he is obliged, and the greater
          gratitude is due. He therefore is most of all obliged, that receives
          kindness without any goodness or excellency in himself, but with a
          total and universal hatefulness. And as it is agreeable to the common
          sense of mankind, so it is agreeable to the Word of God. How often
          does God in the Scripture insist on this argument with men, to move
          them to love him, and to acknowledge his kindness? How much does he
          insist on this as an obligation to gratitude, that they are so sinful,
          and undeserving, and ill-deserving?
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore it certainly follows, that the doctrine which teaches that
          God, when he justifies a man, and shows him such great kindness as to
          give him a right to eternal life, does not do it for any obedience, or
          any manner of goodness of his, but that justification respects a man
          as ungodly, and wholly without any manner of virtue, beauty, or
          excellency. I say, this doctrine does certainly more exalt the free
          grace of God in justification, and man’s obligation to gratitude for
          such a favor, than the contrary doctrine, viz. that God, in showing
          this kindness to man, respects him as sincerely obedient and virtuous,
          and as having something in him that is truly excellent and lovely, and
          acceptable in his sight, and that this goodness or excellency of man
          is the very fundamental condition of the bestowment of that kindness
          on him, or of distinguishing him from others by that benefit.
        </p>
        <p>But I hasten to a</p>
        <p>
          Fourth argument for the truth of the doctrine: that to suppose a man
          is justified by his own virtue or obedience, derogates from the honor
          of the Mediator, and ascribes that to man’s virtue which belongs only
          to the righteousness of Christ: It puts man in Christ’s stead, and
          makes him his own savior, in a respect in which Christ only is his
          Savior. And so it is a doctrine contrary to the nature and design of
          the gospel, which is to abase man, and to ascribe all the glory of our
          salvation to Christ the Redeemer. It is inconsistent with the doctrine
          of the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, which is a gospel
          doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I would explain what we mean by the imputation of Christ’s
          righteousness. Prove the thing intended by it to be true. Show that
          this doctrine is utterly inconsistent with the doctrine of our being
          justified by our own virtue or sincere obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. I would explain what we mean by the imputation of Christ’s
          righteousness. Sometimes the expression is taken by our divines in a
          larger sense, for the imputation of all that Christ did and suffered
          for our redemption, whereby we are free from guilt, and stand
          righteous in the sight of God, and so implies the imputation both of
          Christ’s satisfaction and obedience. But here I intend it in a
          stricter sense, for the imputation of that righteousness or moral
          goodness that consists in the obedience of Christ. — And by that
          righteousness being imputed to us, is meant no other than this, that
          the righteousness of Christ is accepted for us, and admitted instead
          of that perfect inherent righteousness which ought to be in ourselves.
          Christ’s perfect obedience shall be reckoned to our account, so that
          we shall have the benefit of it, as though we had performed it
          ourselves. And so we suppose that a title to eternal life is given us
          as the reward of this righteousness. The Scripture uses the word
          impute in this sense, viz. for reckoning anything belonging to any
          person, to another person’s account: As Phm. 18, “If he hath wronged
          thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The opposers of this doctrine suppose that there is an absurdity in
          supposing that God imputes Christ’s obedience to us. It is to suppose
          that God is mistaken, and thinks that we performed that obedience
          which Christ performed. But why cannot that righteousness be reckoned
          to our account, and be accepted for us, without any such absurdity?
          Why is there any more absurdity in it, than in a merchant’s
          transferring debt or credit from one man’s account to another, when
          one man pays a price for another, so that it shall be accepted as if
          that other had paid it? Why is there any more absurdity in supposing
          that Christ’s obedience is imputed to us, than that his satisfaction
          is imputed? If Christ has suffered the penalty of the law in our
          stead, then it will follow, that his suffering that penalty is imputed
          to us, that is, accepted for us, and in our stead, and is reckoned to
          our account, as though we had suffered it. But why may not his obeying
          the law of God be as rationally reckoned to our account, as his
          suffering the penalty of the law? Why may not a price to bring into
          debt, be as rationally transferred from one person’s account to
          another, as a price to pay a debt? Having thus explained what we mean
          by the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, I proceed,
        </p>
        <p>2. To prove that the righteousness of Christ is thus imputed.</p>
        <p>
          (1.) There is the very same need of Christ’s obeying the law in our
          stead, in order to the reward, as of his suffering the penalty of the
          law in our stead, in order to our escaping the penalty, and the same
          reason why one should be accepted on our account, as the other. There
          is the same need of one as the other, that the law of God might be
          answered: one was as requisite to answer the law as the other. It is
          certain, that was the reason why there was need that Christ should
          suffer the penalty for us, even that the law might be answered. For
          this the Scripture plainly teaches. This is given as the reason why
          Christ was made a curse for us, that the law threatened a curse to us,
          Gal. 3:10, 13. But the same law that fixes the curse of God as the
          consequence of not continuing in all things written in the law to do
          them (verse 10) has as much fixed doing those things as an antecedent
          of living in them (as verse 12). There is as much connection
          established in one case as in the other. There is therefore exactly
          the same need, from the law, of perfect obedience being fulfilled in
          order to our obtaining the reward, as there is of death being suffered
          in order to our escaping the punishment, or the same necessity by the
          law, of perfect obedience preceding life, as there is of disobedience
          being succeeded by death. The law is, without doubt, as much of an
          established rule in one case as in the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ by suffering the penalty, and so making atonement for us, only
          removes the guilt of our sins, and so sets us in the same state that
          Adam was in the first moment of his creation, and it is no more fit
          that we should obtain eternal life only on that account, than that
          Adam should have the reward of eternal life, or of a confirmed and
          unalterable state of happiness, the first moments of his existence,
          without any obedience at all. Adam was not to have the reward merely
          on account of his being innocent. If [that were] so, he would have had
          it fixed upon him at once, as soon as ever he was created, for he was
          as innocent then as he could be. But he was to have the reward on
          account of his active obedience: not on account merely of his not
          having done ill, but on account of his doing well.
        </p>
        <p>
          So on the same account we have not eternal life merely as void of
          guilt, which we have by the atonement of Christ, but on the account of
          Christ’s active obedience, and doing well. — Christ is our second
          federal head, and is called the second Adam (1 Cor. 15:22), because he
          acted that part for us, which the first Adam should have done. When he
          had undertaken to stand in our stead, he was looked upon and treated
          as though he were guilty with our guilt. By his bearing the penalty,
          he did as it were free himself from this guilt. But by this the second
          Adam did only bring himself into the state in which the first Adam was
          on the first moment of his existence, viz. a state of mere freedom
          from guilt, and hereby indeed was free from any obligation to suffer
          punishment. But this being supposed, there was need of something
          further, even a positive obedience, in order to his obtaining, as our
          second Adam, the reward of eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          God saw meet to place man first in a state of trial, and not to give
          him a title to eternal life as soon as he had made him, because it was
          his will that he should first give honor to his authority, by fully
          submitting to it, in will and act, and perfectly obeying his law. God
          insisted upon it, that his holy majesty and law should have their due
          acknowledgment and honor from man, such as became the relation he
          stood in to that Being who created him, before he would bestow the
          reward of confirmed and everlasting happiness upon him. Therefore God
          gave him a law that he might have opportunity, by giving due honor to
          his authority in obeying it, to obtain this happiness. It therefore
          became Christ — seeing that, in assuming man to himself, he sought a
          title to this eternal happiness for him after he had broken the law —
          that he himself should become subject to God’s authority, and be in
          the form of a servant, that he might do that honor to God’s authority
          for him, by his obedience, which God at first required of man as the
          condition of his having a title to that reward. Christ came into the
          world to render the honor of God’s authority and law consistent with
          the salvation and eternal life of sinners. He came to save them, and
          yet withal to assert and vindicate the honor of the lawgiver, and his
          holy law. Now, if the sinner, after his sin was satisfied for, had
          eternal life bestowed upon him without active righteousness, the honor
          of his law would not be sufficiently vindicated. Supposing this were
          possible, that the sinner could himself, by suffering, pay the debt,
          and afterwards be in the same state that he was in before his
          probation, that is to say, negatively righteous, or merely without
          guilt. If he now at last should have eternal life bestowed upon him,
          without performing that condition of obedience, then God would recede
          from his law, and would give the promised reward, and his law never
          have respect and honor shown to it, in that way of being obeyed. But
          now Christ, by subjecting himself to the law, and obeying it, has done
          great honor to the law, and to the authority of God who gave it. That
          so glorious a person should become subject to the law, and fulfill it,
          has done much more to honor it, than if mere man had obeyed it. It was
          a thing infinitely honorable to God, that a person of infinite dignity
          was not ashamed to call him his God, and to adore and obey him as
          such. This was more to God’s honor than if any mere creature, of any
          possible degree of excellence and dignity, had so done.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is absolutely necessary, that in order to a sinner’s being
          justified, the righteousness of some other should be reckoned to his
          account. For it is declared that the person justified is looked upon
          as (in himself) ungodly, but God neither will nor can justify a person
          without a righteousness. For justification is manifestly a forensic
          term, as the word is used in Scripture, and a judicial thing, or the
          act of a judge. So that if a person should be justified without a
          righteousness, the judgment would not be according to truth. The
          sentence of justification would be a false sentence, unless there be a
          righteousness performed, that is, by the judge, properly looked upon
          as his. To say that God does not justify the sinner without sincere,
          though an imperfect obedience, does not help the case, for an
          imperfect righteousness before a judge is no righteousness. To accept
          of something that falls short of the rule, instead of something else
          that answers the rule, is no judicial act, or act of a judge, but a
          pure act of sovereignty. An imperfect righteousness is no
          righteousness before a judge: For “righteousness (as one observes) is
          a relative thing, and has always relation to a law. The formal nature
          of righteousness, properly understood, lies in a conformity of actions
          to that which is the rule and measure of them.” Therefore that only is
          righteousness in the sight of a judge that answers the law. The law is
          the judge’s rule. If he pardons and hides what really is, and so does
          not pass sentence according to what things are in themselves, he
          either does not act the part of a judge, or else judges falsely. The
          very notion of judging is to determine what is, and what is not in
          anyone’s case. The judge’s work is twofold: it is to determine first
          what is fact, and then whether what is in fact be according to rule,
          or according to the law. If a judge has no rule or law established
          beforehand, by which he should proceed in judging, he has no
          foundation to go upon in judging, he has no opportunity to be a judge,
          nor is it possible that he should do the part of a judge. To judge
          without a law, or rule by which to judge, is impossible. For the very
          notion of judging is to determine whether the object of judgment be
          according to rule. Therefore God has declared that when he acts as a
          judge, he will not justify the wicked, and cannot clear the guilty,
          and, by parity of reason, cannot justify without righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the scheme of the old law’s being abrogated, and a new law
          introduced, will not help at all in this difficulty. For an imperfect
          righteousness cannot answer the law of God we are under, whether that
          be an old or a new one, for every law requires perfect obedience to
          itself. Every rule whatsoever requires perfect conformity to itself,
          [and] it is a contradiction to suppose otherwise. For to say, that
          there is a law that does not require perfect obedience to itself, is
          to say that there is a law that does not require all that it requires.
          That law that now forbids sin, is certainly the law that we are now
          under (let that be an old or a new one), or else it is not sin. That
          which is not forbidden, and is the breach of no law, is no sin. But if
          we are now forbidden to commit sin, then it is by a law that we are
          now under. For surely we are neither under the forbiddings nor
          commanding of a law that we are not under. Therefore, if all sin is
          now forbidden, then we are now under a law that requires perfect
          obedience, and therefore nothing can be accepted as a righteousness in
          the sight of our Judge, but perfect righteousness. So that our Judge
          cannot justify us, unless he sees a perfect righteousness in some way
          belonging to us, either performed by ourselves, or by another, and
          justly and duly reckoned to our account.
        </p>
        <p>
          God does, in the sentence of justification, pronounce a man perfectly
          righteous, or else he would need a further justification after he is
          justified. His sins being removed by Christ’s atonement, is not
          sufficient for his justification. For justifying a man, as has been
          already shown, is not merely pronouncing him innocent, or without
          guilt, but standing right with regard to the rule that he is under,
          and righteous unto life. But this, according to the established rule
          of nature, reason, and divine appointment, is a positive, perfect
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          As there is the same need that Christ’s obedience should be reckoned
          to our account, as that his atonement should, so there is the same
          reason why it should. As if Adam had persevered, and finished his
          course of obedience, we should have received the benefit of his
          obedience, as much as now we have the mischief of his disobedience. So
          in like manner, there is reason that we should receive the benefit of
          the second Adam’s obedience, as of his atonement of our disobedience.
          Believers are represented in Scripture as being so in Christ, as that
          they are legally one, or accepted as one, by the Supreme Judge. Christ
          has assumed our nature, and has so assumed all, in that nature that
          belongs to him, into such an union with himself, that he is become
          their Head, and has taken them to be his members. And therefore, what
          Christ has done in our nature, whereby he did honor to the law and
          authority of God by his acts, as well as the reparation to the honor
          of the law by his sufferings, is reckoned to the believer’s account:
          so as that the believer should be made happy, because it was so well
          and worthily done by his Head, as well as freed from being miserable,
          because he has suffered for our ill and unworthy doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Christ had once undertaken with God to stand for us, and put
          himself under our law, by that law he was obliged to suffer, and by
          the same law he was obliged to obey. By the same law, after he had
          taken man’s guilt upon him, he himself being our surety, could not be
          acquitted till he had suffered, nor rewarded till he had obeyed. But
          he was not acquitted as a private person, but as our Head, and
          believers are acquitted in his acquittal. Nor was he accepted to a
          reward for his obedience, as a private person, but as our Head, and we
          are accepted to a reward in his acceptance. The Scripture teaches us,
          that when Christ was raised from the dead, he was justified, which
          justification, as I have already shown, implies both his acquittal
          from our guilt, and his acceptance to the exaltation and glory that
          was the reward of his obedience. But believers, as soon as they
          believe, are admitted to partake with Christ in this his
          justification. Hence we are told, that he was “raised again for our
          justification,” (Rom. 4:25) which is true, not only of that part of
          his justification that consists in his acquittal, but also his
          acceptance to his reward. The Scripture teaches us, that he is
          exalted, and gone to heaven to take possession of glory in our name,
          as our forerunner, Heb. 6:20. We are as it were, both raised up
          together with Christ, and also made to sit together with Christ in
          heavenly places, and in him, Eph. 2:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be objected here, that there is this reason, why what Christ
          suffered should be accepted on our account, rather than the obedience
          he performed, that he was obliged to obedience for himself, but was
          not obliged to suffer but only on our account. To this I answer that
          Christ was not obliged, on his own account, to undertake to obey.
          Christ in his original circumstances, was in no subjection to the
          Father, being altogether equal with him. He was under no obligation to
          put himself in man’s stead, and under man’s law, or to put himself
          into any state of subjection to God whatsoever. There was a
          transaction between the Father and the Son, that was antecedent to
          Christ’s becoming man, and being made under the law, wherein he
          undertook to put himself under the law, and both to obey and to
          suffer. In [this] transaction these things were already virtually done
          in the sight of God, as is evident by this: that God acted on the
          ground of that transaction, justifying and saving sinners, as if the
          things undertaken had been actually performed long before they were
          performed indeed. And therefore, without doubt, in order to estimate
          the value and validity of what Christ did and suffered, we must look
          back to that transaction, wherein these things were first undertaken,
          and virtually done in the sight of God, and see what capacity and
          circumstances Christ acted in them. We shall find that Christ was
          under no manner of obligation, either to obey the law, or to suffer
          its penalty. After this he was equally under obligation to both, for
          henceforward he stood as our surety or representative. And therefore
          this consequent obligation may be as much of an objection against the
          validity of his suffering the penalty, as against his obedience. But
          if we look to that original transaction between the Father and the
          Son, wherein both these were undertaken and accepted as virtually done
          in the sight of the Father, we shall find Christ acting with regard to
          both as one perfectly in his own right, and under no manner of
          previous obligation to hinder the validity of either.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) To suppose that all Christ does is only to make atonement for us
          by suffering, is to make him our Savior but in part. It is to rob him
          of half his glory as a Savior. For if so, all that he does is to
          deliver us from hell: he does not purchase heaven for us. The adverse
          scheme supposes that he purchases heaven for us, in that he satisfies
          for the imperfections of our obedience and so purchases that our
          sincere imperfect obedience might be accepted as the condition of
          eternal life, and so purchases an opportunity for us to obtain heaven
          by our own obedience. But to purchase heaven for us only in this
          sense, is to purchase it in no sense at all. For all of it comes to no
          more than a satisfaction for our sins, or removing the penalty by
          suffering in our stead. For all the purchasing they speak of, that our
          imperfect obedience should be accepted, is only his satisfying for the
          sinful imperfection of our obedience, or (which is the same thing)
          making atonement for the sin that our obedience is attended with. But
          that is not purchasing heaven, merely to set us at liberty again, that
          we may go and get heaven by what we do ourselves. All that Christ does
          is only to pay a debt for us. There is no positive purchase of any
          good. We are taught in Scripture that heaven is purchased for us. It
          is called the purchased possession, Eph. 1:14. The gospel proposes the
          eternal inheritance, not to be acquired, as the first covenant did,
          but as already acquired and purchased. But he that pays a man’s debt
          for him, and so delivers him from slavery, cannot be said to purchase
          an estate for him, merely because he sets him at liberty, so that
          henceforward he has an opportunity to get an estate by his own hand
          labor. So that according to this scheme, the saints in heaven have no
          reason to thank Christ for purchasing heaven for them, or redeeming
          them to God, and making them kings and priests, as we have an account
          that they do, in Rev. 5:9, 10.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Justification by the righteousness and obedience of Christ, is a
          doctrine that the Scripture teaches in very full terms, Rom. 5:18, 19,
          “By the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men unto
          justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made
          sinners, so, by the obedience of one, shall all be made righteous.”
          Here in one verse we are told that we have justification by Christ’s
          righteousness, and that there might be no room to understand the
          righteousness spoken of, merely of Christ’s atonement by his suffering
          the penalty. In the next verse it is put in other terms, and asserted
          that it is by Christ’s obedience we are made righteous. It is scarcely
          possible anything should be more full and determined. The terms, taken
          singly, are such as fix their own meaning, and taken together, they
          fix the meaning of each other. The words show that we are justified by
          that righteousness of Christ which consists in his obedience, and that
          we are made righteous or justified by that obedience of his, that is,
          his righteousness, or moral goodness before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here possibly it may be objected, that this text means only, that we
          are justified by Christ’s passive obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this I answer, whether we call it active or passive, it alters not
          the case as to the present argument, as long as it is evident by the
          words that it is not merely under the notion of an atonement for
          disobedience, or a satisfaction for unrighteousness, but under the
          notion of a positive obedience, and a righteousness, or moral
          goodness, that it justifies us, or makes us righteous. Because both
          the words righteousness and obedience are used, and used too as the
          opposites to sin and disobedience, and an offense. “Therefore as by
          the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even
          so, by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men to
          justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made
          sinners; so, by the obedience of one, shall many be made
          righteousness.” Now, what can be meant by righteousness, when spoken
          of as the opposite to sin, or moral evil, but moral goodness? What is
          the righteousness that is the opposite of an offense, but the behavior
          that is well pleasing? And what can be meant by obedience, when spoken
          of as the opposite of disobedience, or going contrary to a command,
          but a positive obeying and an actual complying with the command? So
          that there is no room for any invented distinction of active and
          passive, to hurt the argument from this scripture. For it is evident
          by it, as anything can be, that believers are justified by the
          righteousness and obedience of Christ, under the notion of his moral
          goodness; — his positive obeying, and actual complying with the
          commands of God, and that behavior which, because of its conformity to
          his commands, was well-pleasing in his sight. This is all that ever
          any need to desire to have granted in this dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
          By this it appears, that if Christ’s dying be here included in the
          words righteousness and obedience, it is not merely as a propitiation,
          or bearing a penalty of a broken law in our stead, but as his
          voluntary submitting and yielding himself to those sufferings, was an
          act of obedience to the Father’s commands, and so was a part of his
          positive righteousness, or moral goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed all obedience considered under the notion of righteousness, is
          something active, something done in voluntary compliance with a
          command; whether it may be done without suffering, or whether it be
          hard and difficult. Yet as it is obedience, righteousness, or moral
          goodness, it must be considered as something voluntary and active. If
          anyone is commanded to go through difficulties and sufferings, and he,
          in compliance with this command, voluntarily does it, he properly
          obeys in so doing; and as he voluntarily does it in compliance with a
          command, his obedience is as active as any whatsoever. It is the same
          sort of obedience, a thing of the very same nature, as when a man, in
          compliance with a command, does a piece of hard service, or goes
          through hard labor; and there is no room to distinguish between such
          obedience of it, as if it were a thing of quite a different nature, by
          such opposite terms as active and passive: all the disobeying an easy
          command and a difficult one. But is there from hence any foundation to
          make two species of obedience, one active and the other passive? There
          is no appearance of any such distinction ever entering into the hearts
          of any of the penmen of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true, that of late, when a man refuses to obey the precept of a
          human law, but patiently yields himself up to suffer the penalty of
          the law, it is called passive obedience. But this I suppose is only a
          modern use of the word obedience. Surely it is a sense of the word
          that the Scripture is a perfect stranger to. It is improperly called
          obedience, unless there be such a precept in the law, that he shall
          yield himself patiently to suffer, to which his so doing shall be an
          active voluntary conformity. There may in some sense be said to be a
          conformity of the law in a person’s suffering the penalty of the law.
          But no other conformity to the law is properly called obedience to it,
          but an active voluntary conformity to the precepts of it. The word
          obey is often found in Scripture with respect to the law of God to
          man, but never in any other sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true that Christ’s willingly undergoing those sufferings which
          he endured, is a great part of that obedience or righteousness by
          which we are justified. The sufferings of Christ are respected in
          Scripture under a twofold consideration, either merely as his being
          substituted for us, or put into our stead, in suffering the penalty of
          the law. And so his sufferings are considered as a satisfaction and
          propitiation for sin, or as he, in obedience to a law or a command of
          the Father, voluntarily submitted himself to those sufferings, and
          actively yielded himself up to hear them. So they are considered as
          his righteousness, and a part of his active obedience. Christ
          underwent death in obedience to the command of the Father, Psa.
          40:6-8, “Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire, mine ears hast
          thou opened: burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required.
          Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of
          me, I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my
          heart.” John 10:17-18, “I lay down my life, that I might take it
          again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself: I have
          power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This
          commandment have I received of my Father.” John 18:11, “The cup which
          my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?” And this is part, and
          indeed the principal part, of that active obedience by which we are
          justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          It can be no just objection against this, that the command of the
          Father to Christ that he should lay down his life was no part of the
          law that we had broken, and therefore, that his obeying this command
          could be no part of that obedience that he performed for us, because
          we needed that he should obey no other law for us, but only that which
          we had broken or failed of obeying. For although it must be the same
          legislative authority, whose honor is repaired by Christ’s obedience,
          that we have injured by our disobedience, yet there is no need that
          the law which Christ obeys should be precisely the same that Adam was
          to have obeyed, in that sense, that there should be no positive
          precepts wanting, nor any added. There was wanting the precept about
          the forbidden fruit, and there was added the ceremonial law. The thing
          required was perfect obedience. It is no matter whether the positive
          precepts that Christ was to obey, were much more than equivalent to
          what was wanting, because infinitely more difficult, particularly the
          command that he had received to lay down his life, which was his
          principal act of obedience, and which, above all other, is concerned
          in our justification. As that act of disobedience by which we fell,
          was disobedience to a positive precept that Christ never was under,
          viz. That of abstaining from the tree of knowledge of good and evil,
          so that act of obedience by which principally we are redeemed is
          obedience to a positive precept, that should try both Adam’s and
          Christ’s obedience. Such precepts are the greatest and most proper
          trial of obedience, because in them, the mere authority and will of
          the legislator is the sole ground of the obligation (and nothing in
          the nature of the things themselves), and therefore they are the
          greatest trial of any persons’ respect to that authority and will.
        </p>
        <p>
          The law that Christ was subject to, and obeyed, was in some sense the
          same that was given to Adam. There are innumerable particular duties
          required by the law only conditionally, and in such circumstances, are
          comprehended in some great and general rule of that law. Thus, for
          instance, there are innumerable acts of respect and obedience to men,
          which are required by the law of nature (which was a law given to
          Adam), which yet are not required absolutely, but upon many
          prerequisite conditions: as that there be men standing in such
          relations to us, and that they give forth such commands, and the like.
          So many acts of respect and obedience to God are included, in like
          manner, in the moral law conditionally, or such and such things being
          supposed: as Abraham’s going about to sacrifice his son, the Jews’
          circumcising their children when eight days old, and Adam’s not eating
          the forbidden fruit. They are virtually comprehended in the great
          general rule of the moral law, that we should obey God, and be subject
          to him in whatsoever he pleases to command us. Certainly the moral law
          does as much require us to obey God’s positive commands, as it
          requires us to obey the positive commands of our parents. And thus all
          that Adam, and all that Christ was commanded, even his observing the
          rites and ceremonies of the Jewish worship, and his laying down his
          life, was virtually included in this same great law.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is no objection against the last-mentioned thing, even in Christ’s
          laying down his life, it being included in the moral law given to
          Adam, because that law itself allowed of no occasion for any such
          thing. For the moral law virtually includes all right acts, on all
          possible occasions, even occasions that the law itself allows not.
          Thus we are obliged by the moral law to mortify our lusts, and repent
          of our sins, though that law allows of no lust to mortify, or sin to
          repent of.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is indeed but one great law of God, and that is the same law
          that says, “if thou sinnest, thou shalt die;” and “curses is every one
          that continues not in all things contained in this law to do them.”
          All duties of positive institution are virtually comprehended in this
          law: and therefore, if the Jews broke the ceremonial law, it exposed
          them to the penalty of the law, or covenant of works, which
          threatened, “thou shalt surely die.” The law is the eternal and
          unalterable rule of righteousness between God and man, and therefore
          is the rule of judgment, but which all that a man does shall be either
          justified or condemned; and no sin exposes to damnation, but by the
          law. So now he that refuses to obey the precepts that require an
          attendance on the sacraments of the New Testament, is exposed to
          damnation, by virtue of the law or covenant of works. It may moreover
          be argued that all sins whatsoever are breaches of the law or covenant
          of works, because all sins, even breaches of the positive precepts, as
          well as others, have atonement by the death of Christ. But what Christ
          died for, was to satisfy the law, or to bear the curse of the law; as
          appears by Gal. 3:10-13 and Rom. 7:3, 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that Christ’s laying down his life might be part of that obedience
          by which we are justified, though it was a positive precept not given
          to Adam. It was doubtless Christ’s main act of obedience, because it
          was obedience to a command that was attended with immensely the
          greatest difficulty, and so to a command that was the greatest trial
          of his obedience. His respect shown to God in it, and his honor to
          God’s authority, was proportionably great. It is spoken of in
          Scripture as Christ’s principal act of obedience. Phil. 2:7, 8, “But
          made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
          servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in
          fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death,
          even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted
          him, and given him a name which is above every name.” And it therefore
          follows from what has been already said, that it is mainly by this act
          of obedience that believers in Christ also have the reward of glory,
          or come to partake with Christ in his glory. We are as much saved by
          the death of Christ, as his yielding himself to die was an act of
          obedience, as we are as it was a propitiation for our sins. For as it
          was not only the only act of obedience that merited, he having
          performed meritorious acts of obedience through the whole course of
          his life, so neither was it the only suffering that was propitiatory;
          all his sufferings through the whole course of his life being
          propitiatory, as well as every act of obedience meritorious. Indeed
          this was his principal suffering, and it was as much his principal act
          of obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence we may see how that the death of Christ did not only make
          atonement, but also merited eternal life, and hence we may see how by
          the blood of Christ, we are not only redeemed from sin, but redeemed
          unto God. Therefore the Scripture seems everywhere to attribute the
          whole of salvation to the blood of Christ. This precious blood is as
          much the main price by which heaven is purchased, as it is the main
          price by which we are redeemed from hell. The positive righteousness
          of Christ, or that price by which he merited, was of equal value with
          that by which he satisfied, for indeed it was the same price. He
          spilled his blood to satisfy, and by reason of the infinite dignity of
          his person, his sufferings were looked upon as of infinite value, and
          equivalent to the eternal sufferings of a finite creature. And he
          spilled his blood out of respect to the honor of God’s majesty, and in
          submission to his authority, who had commanded him so to do. His
          obedience therein was of infinite value, both because of the dignity
          of the person that performed it, and because he put himself to
          infinite expense to perform it, whereby the infinite degree of his
          regard to God’s authority appeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          One would wonder what Arminians mean by Christ’s merits. They talk of
          Christ’s merits as much as anybody, and yet deny the imputation of
          Christ’s positive righteousness. What should there be than anyone
          should merit or deserve anything by, besides righteousness or
          goodness? If anything that Christ did or suffered, merited or deserved
          anything, it was by virtue of the goodness, or righteousness, or
          holiness of it. If Christ’s sufferings and death merited heaven, it
          must be because there was an excellent righteousness and transcendent
          moral goodness in that act of laying down his life. And if by that
          excellent righteousness he merited heaven for us, then surely that
          righteousness is reckoned to our account, that we have the benefit of
          it, or, which is the same thing, it is imputed to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, I hope, I have made it evident, that the righteousness of Christ
          is indeed imputed to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. I proceed now to the third and last thing under this argument: That
          this doctrine, of the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, is utterly
          inconsistent with the doctrine of our being justified by our own
          virtue or sincere obedience. If acceptance to God’s favor, and a title
          to life, be given to believers as the reward of Christ’s obedience,
          then it is not given as the reward of our own obedience. In what
          respect soever Christ is our Savior, that doubtless excludes our being
          our own saviors in that same respect. If we can be our own saviors in
          the same respect that Christ is, it will thence follow, that the
          salvation of Christ is needless in that respect, according to the
          apostle’s reasoning, Gal. 5:4, “Christ is rendered of no effect unto
          you, whosoever of you are justified by the law.” Doubtless, it is
          Christ’s prerogative to be our Savior in that sense wherein he is our
          Savior. And therefore, if it be by his obedience that we are
          justified, then it is not by our own obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here perhaps it may be said, that a title to salvation is not directly
          given as the reward of our obedience. For that is not by anything of
          ours, but only by Christ’s satisfaction and righteousness, but yet an
          interest in that satisfaction and righteousness is given as a reward
          of our obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this does not at all help the case. For this is to ascribe as much
          to our obedience as if we ascribed salvation to it directly, without
          the intervention of Christ’s righteousness. For it would be as great a
          thing for God to give us Christ, and his satisfaction and
          righteousness, in reward for our obedience, as to give us heaven
          immediately. It would be as great a reward, and as great a testimony
          of respect to our obedience. And if God gives as great a thing as
          salvation for our obedience, why could he not as well give salvation
          itself directly? Then there would have been no need of Christ’s
          righteousness. And indeed if God gives us Christ, or an interest in
          him, properly in reward for our obedience, he does really give us
          salvation in reward for our obedience: for the former implies the
          latter. Yea, it implies it, as the greater implies the less. So that
          indeed it exalts our virtue and obedience more, to suppose that God
          gives us Christ in reward of that virtue and obedience, than if he
          should give salvation without Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing that the Scripture guards and militates against, is our
          imagining that it is our own goodness, virtue, or excellency, that
          instates us in God’s acceptance and favor. But to suppose that God
          gives us an interest in Christ in reward for our virtue, is as great
          an argument that it instates us in God’s favor, as if he bestowed a
          title to eternal life as its direct reward. If God gives us an
          interest in Christ as a reward of our obedience, it will then follow,
          that we are instated in God’s acceptance and favor by our own
          obedience, antecedent to our having an interest in Christ. For a
          rewarding anyone’s excellency, evermore supposes favor and acceptance
          on the account of that excellency. It is the very notion of a reward,
          that it is a good thing, bestowed in testimony of respect and favor
          for the virtue or excellency rewarded. So that it is not by virtue of
          our interest in Christ and his merits, that we first come into favor
          with God, according to this scheme. For we are in God’s favor before
          we have any interest in those merits, in that we have an interest in
          those merits given as a fruit of God’s favor for our own virtue. If
          our interest in Christ be the fruit of God’s favor, then it cannot be
          the ground of it. If God did not accept us, and had no favor for us
          for our own excellency, he never would bestow so great a reward upon
          us, as a right in Christ’s satisfaction, and righteousness. So that
          such a scheme destroys itself. For it supposes that Christ’s
          satisfaction and righteousness are necessary for us to recommend us to
          the favor of God, and yet supposes that we have God’s favor and
          acceptance before we have Christ’s satisfaction and righteousness, and
          have these given as a fruit of God’s favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, neither salvation itself, nor Christ the Savior, are given as
          a reward of anything in man: They are not given as a reward of faith,
          nor anything else of ours: We are not united to Christ as a reward of
          our faith, but have union with him by faith, only as faith is the very
          act of uniting or closing on our part. As when a man offers himself to
          a woman in marriage, he does not give himself to her as a reward of
          her receiving him in marriage. Her receiving him is not considered as
          a worthy deed in her, for which he rewards her by giving himself to
          her. But it is by her receiving him that the union is made, by which
          she has him for her husband. It is on her part the unition itself. By
          these things it appears how contrary to the gospel of Christ their
          scheme is, who say that faith justifies as a principle of obedience,
          or as a leading act of obedience, or (as others) the sum and
          comprehension of all evangelical obedience. For by this, the obedience
          or virtue that is in faith gives it its justifying influence, and that
          is the same thing as to say, that we are justified by our own
          obedience, virtue, or goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus considered the evidence of the truth of the doctrine, I
          proceed now to the
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thing proposed, viz. “To show in what sense the acts of a
          Christian life, or of evangelical obedience, may be looked upon to be
          concerned in this affair.”
        </p>
        <p>
          From what has been said already, it is manifest that they cannot have
          any concern in this affair as good works, or by virtue of any moral
          goodness in them: not as works of the law, or as that moral
          excellency, or any part of it, which is the fulfillment of that great,
          universal, and everlasting law or covenant of works which the great
          lawgiver has established, as the highest and unalterable rule of
          judgment, which Christ alone answers, or does anything towards it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It having been shown out of the Scripture, that it is only by faith,
          or the soul’s receiving and uniting to the Savior who has wrought our
          righteousness, that we are justified. It therefore remains, that the
          acts of a Christian life cannot be concerned in this affair any
          otherwise than as they imply, and are the expressions of faith, and
          may be looked upon as so many acts of reception of Christ the Savior.
          But the determining what concerns acts of Christian obedience can have
          in justification in this respect, will depend on the resolving of
          another point, viz. whether any other act of faith besides the first
          act, has any concern in our justification, or how far perseverance in
          faith, or the continued and renewed acts of faith, have influence in
          this affair. And it seems manifest that justification is by the first
          act of faith, in some respects, in a peculiar manner, because a sinner
          is actually and finally justified as soon as he has performed one act
          of faith, and faith in its first act does, virtually at least, depend
          on God for perseverance, and entities to this among other benefits.
          But yet the perseverance of faith is not excluded in this affair. It
          is not only certainly connected with justification, but it is not to
          be excluded from that on which the justification of a sinner has a
          dependence, or that by which he is justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have shown that the way in which justification has a dependence on
          faith is, that it is the qualification on which the congruity of an
          interest in the righteousness of Christ depends, or wherein such a
          fitness consists. But the consideration of the perseverance of faith
          cannot be excluded out of this congruity or fitness. For it is
          congruous that he that believes in Christ should have an interest in
          Christ’s righteousness, and so in the eternal benefits purchased by
          it, because faith is that by which the soul has union or oneness with
          Christ. There is a natural congruity in it, that they who are one with
          Christ should have a joint interest with him in his eternal benefits.
          But yet this congruity depends on its being an abiding union. As it is
          needful that the branch should abide in the vine, in order to its
          receiving the lasting benefits of the root, so it is necessary that
          the soul should abide in Christ, in order to its receiving those
          lasting benefits of God’s final acceptance and favor. John 15:6, 7,
          “If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth, as a branch. If ye abide
          in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it
          shall be done unto you.” John 15:9, 10, “Continue ye in my love. If ye
          keep (or abide in) my commandments, ye shall abide in my love: even as
          I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.” There is
          the same reason why it is necessary that the union with Christ should
          remain, as why it should be begun: why it should continue to be, as
          why it should once be. If it should be begun without remaining, the
          beginning would be in vain. In order to the soul’s being now in a
          justified state, and now free from condemnation, it is necessary that
          it should now be in Christ, and not merely that it should once have
          been in him. Rom. 8:1, “There is no condemnation to them which are in
          Christ Jesus.” The soul is saved in Christ, as being now in him, when
          the salvation is bestowed, and not merely as remembering that it once
          was in him. Phil. 3:9, “That I may be found in him, not having mine
          own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the
          faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.” 1 John
          2:28, “And now, little children, abide in him; that when he shall
          appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his
          coming.” In order for people to be blessed after death, it is
          necessary not only that they should once be in him, but that they
          should die in him. Rev. 14:13, “Blessed are the dead that die in the
          Lord.” And there is the same reason why faith, the uniting
          qualification, should remain in order to the union’s remaining, as why
          it should once be, in order to the union’s once being.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that although the sinner is actually and finally justified on the
          first act of faith, yet the perseverance of faith, even then, comes
          into consideration, as one thing on which the fitness of acceptance to
          life depends. God in the act of justification, which is passed on a
          sinner’s first believing, has respect to perseverance, as being
          virtually contained in that first act of faith, and it is looked upon,
          and taken by him that justifies, as being as it were a property in
          that faith. God has respect to the believer’s continuance in faith,
          and he is justified by that, as though it already were, because by
          divine establishment it shall follow, and it being by divine
          constitution connected with that first faith, as much as if it were a
          property in it, it is then considered as such, and so justification is
          not suspended. But were it not for this, it would be needful that it
          should be suspended, till the sinner had actually persevered in faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that it is so, that God in the act of final justification which he
          passes at the sinner’s conversion, has respect to perseverance in
          faith, and future acts of faith, as being virtually implied in the
          first act, is further manifest by this, viz. That in a sinner’s
          justification, at his conversion there is virtually contained a
          forgiveness as to eternal and deserved punishment, not only of all
          past sins, but also of all future infirmities and acts of sin that
          they shall be guilty of, because that first justification is decisive
          and final. And yet pardon, in the order of nature, properly follows
          the crime, and also follows those acts of repentance and faith that
          respect the crime pardoned, as is manifest both from reason and
          Scripture. David, in the beginning of Psalm 32 speaks of the
          forgiveness of sins which were doubtless committed long after he was
          first godly, as being consequent on those sins, and on his repentance
          and faith with respect to them, and yet this forgiveness is spoken of
          by the apostle in the 4th of Romans, as an instance of justification
          by faith. Probably the sin David there speaks of is the same that he
          committed in the matter of Uriah, and so the pardon the same with that
          release from death or eternal punishment, which the prophet Nathan
          speaks of, 2 Sam. 12:13, “The Lord also hath put away thy sin; thou
          shalt not die.” Not only does the manifestation of this pardon follow
          the sin in the order of time, but the pardon itself, in the order of
          nature, follows David’s repentance and faith with respect to this sin.
          For it is spoken of in Psalm 32 as depending on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But inasmuch as a sinner, in his first justification, is forever
          justified and freed from all obligation to eternal punishment, it
          hence of necessity follows, that future faith and repentance are
          beheld, in that justification, as virtually contained in that first
          faith and repentance. Because repentance of those future sins, and
          faith in a Redeemer, with respect to them, or at least, the
          continuance of that habit and principle in the heart that has such an
          actual repentance and faith in its nature and tendency, is now made
          sure by God’s promise. — If remission of sins committed after
          conversion, in the order of nature, follows that faith and repentance
          that is after them, then it follows that future sins are respected in
          the first justification, no otherwise than as future faith and
          repentance are respected in it. And future repentance and faith are
          looked upon by him that justifies, as virtually implied in the first
          repentance and faith, in the same manner as justification from future
          sins is virtually implied in the first justification, which is the
          thing that was to be proved.
        </p>
        <p>
          And besides, if no other act of faith could be concerned in
          justification but the first act, it will then follow that Christians
          ought never to seek justification by any other act of faith. For if
          justification is not to be obtained by after acts of faith, then
          surely it is not a duty to seek it by such acts. And so it can never
          be a duty for persons after they are once converted, by faith to seek
          God, or believingly to look to him for the remission of sin, or
          deliverance from the guilt of it, because deliverance from the guilt
          of sin, is part of what belongs to justification. And if it be not
          proper for converts by faith to look to God through Christ for it,
          then it will follow that it is not proper for them to pray for it. For
          Christian prayer to God for a blessing, is but an expression of faith
          in God for that blessing: prayer is only the voice of faith. But if
          these things are so, it will follow that the petition in the Lord’s
          prayer, forgive us our debts, is not proper to be put up by the
          disciples of Christ, or to be used in Christian assemblies, and that
          Christ improperly directed his disciples to use that petition, when
          they were all of them, except Judas, converted before. The debt that
          Christ directs his disciples to pray for the forgiveness of, can mean
          nothing else but the punishment that sin deserves, or the debt that we
          owe to divine justice, the ten thousand talents we owe our Lord. To
          pray that God would forgive our debts, is undoubtedly the same thing
          as to pray that God would release us from obligation to due
          punishment. But releasing from obligation to the punishment due to
          sin, and forgiving the debt that we owe to divine justice, is what
          appertains to justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then to suppose that no after acts of faith are concerned in the
          business of justification, and so that it is not proper for any ever
          to seek justification by such acts, would be forever to cut off those
          Christians that are doubtful concerning their first act of faith, from
          the joy and peace of believing. As the business of a justifying faith
          is to obtain pardon and peace with God by looking to God, and trusting
          in him for these blessings, so the joy and peace of that faith is in
          the apprehension of pardon and peace obtained by such a trust. This a
          Christian that is doubtful of his first act of faith cannot have from
          that act, because, by the supposition, he is doubtful whether it be an
          act of faith, and so whether be did obtain pardon and peace by that
          act. The proper remedy, in such a case, is now by faith to look to God
          in Christ for these blessings, but he is cut off from this remedy,
          because he is uncertain whether he his warrant so to do. For he does
          not know but that he has believed already, and if so, then he has no
          warrant to look to God by faith for these blessings now, because, by
          the supposition, no new act of faith is a proper means of obtaining
          these blessings. So he can never properly obtain the joy of faith, for
          there are acts of true faith that are very weak, and the first act may
          be so as well as others. It may be like the first motion of the infant
          in the womb: it may be so weak an act, that the Christian, by
          examining it, may never be able to determine whether it was a true act
          of faith or no. It is evident from fact, and abundant experience, that
          many Christians are forever at a loss to determine which was their
          first act of faith. And those saints who have had a good degree of
          satisfaction concerning their faith, may be subject to great
          declensions and falls, in which case they are liable to great fears of
          eternal punishment. The proper way of deliverance, is to forsake their
          sin by repentance, and by faith now to come to Christ for deliverance
          from the deserved eternal punishment. But this it would not be, if
          deliverance from that punishment was not this way to be obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is a still more plain and direct evidence of what I am now
          arguing for, is that the act of faith which Abraham exercised in the
          great promise of the covenant of grace that God made to him, of which
          it is expressly said, Gal. 3:6, “It was accounted to him for
          righteousness” — the grand instance and proof that the apostle so much
          insists upon throughout Romans 4, and Galatians 3, to confirm his
          doctrine of justification by faith alone — was not Abraham’s first act
          of faith, but was exerted long after he had by faith forsaken his own
          country, Heb. 11:8, and had been treated as an eminent friend of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the apostle Paul, in Philippians 3, tells us how earnestly
          he sought justification by faith, or to win Christ and obtain that
          righteousness which was by the faith of him, in what he did after his
          conversion. Phil. 3:8, 9, “For whom I have suffered the loss of all
          things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be
          found in him, not having mine own righteousness which is of the law,
          but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which
          is of God by faith.” And in the two next verses he expresses the same
          thing in other words, and tells us how he went through sufferings, and
          became conformable to Christ’s death, that he might be a partaker with
          Christ in the benefit of his resurrection, which the same apostle
          elsewhere teaches us, is especially justification. Christ’s
          resurrection was his justification. In this, he that was put to death
          in the flesh, was justified by the Spirit, and he that was delivered
          for our offenses, rose again for our justification. And the apostle
          tells us in the verses that follow in that third chapter of
          Philippians, that he thus sought to attain the righteousness which is
          through the faith of Christ, and so to partake of the benefit of his
          resurrection, still as though he had not already attained, but that he
          continued to follow after it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the whole, it appears that the perseverance of faith is necessary,
          even to the congruity of justification, and that not the less, because
          a sinner is justified, and perseverance promised, on the first act of
          faith. But God, in that justification, has respect, not only to the
          past act of faith, but to his own promise of future acts, and to the
          fitness of a qualification beheld as yet only in his own promise. And
          that perseverance in faith is thus necessary to salvation, not merely
          as a sine qua non, or as a universal concomitant of it, but by reason
          of such an influence and dependence, seems manifest by many
          Scriptures, I would mention two or three — Heb. 3:6, “Whose house are
          we, if we hold fast the confidence, and the rejoicing of the hope firm
          unto the end.” Verse 14, “For we are made partakers of Christ, if we
          hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end.” Heb.
          6:12, “Be ye followers of them, who through faith and patience inherit
          the promises.” Rom. 11:20, “Well, because of unbelief they were broken
          off; but thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And, as the congruity to a final justification depends on perseverance
          in faith, as well as the first act, so oftentimes the manifestation of
          justification in the conscience, arises a great deal more from after
          acts, than the first act. All the difference whereby the first act of
          faith has a concern in this affair that is peculiar, seems to be, as
          it were, only an accidental difference, arising from the circumstance
          of time, or its being first in order of time, and not from any
          peculiar respect that God has to it, or any influence it has of a
          peculiar nature, in the affair of our salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus it is that a truly Christian walk, and the acts of an
          evangelical, child-like, believing obedience, are concerned in the
          affair of our justification, and seem to be sometimes so spoken of in
          Scripture, viz. as an expression of a persevering faith in the Son of
          God, the only Savior. Faith unites to Christ, and so gives a congruity
          to justification, not merely as remaining a dormant principle in the
          heart, but as being and appearing in its active expressions. The
          obedience of a Christian, so far as it is truly evangelical, and
          performed with the Spirit of the Son sent forth into the heart, has
          all relation to Christ the Mediator, and is but an expression of the
          soul’s believing unition to Christ. All evangelical works are works of
          that faith that worketh by love, and every such act of obedience,
          wherein it is inward, and the act of the soul, is only a new effective
          act of reception of Christ, and adherence to the glorious Savior.
          Hence that of the apostle, Gal. 2:20, “I live; yet not I, but Christ
          liveth in me; and the life that I now live in the flesh, is by the
          faith of the Son of God.” And hence we are directed, in whatever we
          do, whether in word or deed, to do all in the name of the Lord Jesus
          Christ, Col. 3:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that God in justification has respect, not only to the first act
          of faith, but also to future persevering acts, as expressed in life,
          seems manifest by Rom. 1:17, “For therein is the righteousness of God
          revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by
          faith.” And Heb. 10:38, 39, “Now the just shall live by faith; but if
          any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are
          not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe, to
          the saving of the soul.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So that, as was before said of faith, so may it be said of a
          child-like believing obedience: it has no concern in justification by
          any virtue or excellency in it, but only as there is a reception of
          Christ in it. And this is no more contrary to the apostle’s frequent
          assertion of our being justified without the works of the law, than to
          say that we are justified by faith. For faith is as much a work, or
          act of Christian obedience, as the expressions of faith, in spiritual
          life and walk. And therefore, as we say that faith does not justify as
          a work, so we say of all these effective expressions of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the reverse of the scheme of our modem divines, who hold that
          faith justifies only as an act or expression of obedience. Whereas, in
          truth, obedience has no concern in justification, any otherwise than
          as an expression of faith.
        </p>
        <p>I now proceed to the</p>
        <p>IV. Thing proposed, viz. To answer objections.</p>
        <p>
          Object. 1. We frequently find promises of eternal life and salvation,
          and sometimes of justification itself, made to our own virtue and
          obedience. Eternal life is promised to obedience, in Rom. 2:7, “To
          them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory, honor,
          and immortality, eternal life:” And the like in innumerable other
          places. And justification itself is promised to that virtue of a
          forgiving spirit or temper in us, Mat. 6:14, “For, if ye forgive men
          their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if
          you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive
          your trespasses.” All allow that justification in great part consists
          in the forgiveness of sins.
        </p>
        <p>To this I answer,</p>
        <p>
          1. These things being promised to our virtue and obedience, argues no
          more, than that there is a connection between them and evangelical
          obedience, which, I have already observed, is not the thing in
          dispute. All that can be proved by obedience and salvation being
          connected in the promise, is that obedience and salvation are
          connected in fact, which nobody denies, and whether it be owned or
          denied, is, as has been shown, nothing to the purpose. There is no
          need that an admission to a title to salvation should be given on the
          account of our obedience, in order to the promises being true. If we
          find such a promise, that he that obeys shall be saved, or he that is
          holy shall be justified, all that is needful, in order to such
          promises being true, is that it be really so: that he that obeys shall
          be saved, and that holiness and justification shall indeed go
          together. That proposition may be a truth, that he that obeys shall be
          saved, because obedience and salvation are connected together in fact,
          and yet an acceptance to a title to salvation not be granted upon the
          account of any of our own virtue or obedience. What is a promise, but
          only a declaration of future truth, for the comfort and encouragement
          of the person to whom it is declared? Promises are conditional
          propositions, and, as has been already observed, it is not the thing
          in dispute, whether other things besides faith may not have the place
          of the condition in such propositions wherein pardon and salvation are
          the consequent.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Promises may rationally be made to signs and evidences of faith,
          and yet the thing promised not be upon the account of the sign, but
          the thing signified. Thus, for instance, human government may
          rationally make promises of such and such privileges to those that can
          show such evidences of their being free of such a city, or members of
          such a corporation, or descended of such a family, when it is not at
          all for the sake of that which is the evidence or sign, in itself
          considered, that they are admitted to such a privilege, but only and
          purely for the sake of that which it is an evidence of. And though God
          does not stand in need of signs to know whether we have true faith or
          not, yet our own consciences do, so that it is much for our comfort
          that promises are made to signs of faith. Finding in ourselves a
          forgiving temper and disposition, may be a most proper and natural
          evidence to our consciences, that our hearts have, in a sense of our
          own utter unworthiness, truly closed and fallen in with the way of
          free and infinitely gracious forgiveness of our sins by Jesus Christ,
          whence we may be enabled, with the greater comfort, to apply to
          ourselves the promises of forgiveness by Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It has been just now shown, how that acts of evangelical obedience
          are indeed concerned in our justification itself, and are not excluded
          from that condition that justification depends upon, without the least
          prejudice to that doctrine of justification by faith, without any
          goodness of our own, that has been maintained. Therefore it can be no
          objection against this doctrine, that we have sometimes in Scripture
          promises of pardon and acceptance made to such acts of obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Promises of particular benefits implied in justification and
          salvation, may especially be fitly made to such expressions and
          evidences of faith as they have a peculiar natural likeness and
          suitableness to. As forgiveness is promised to a forgiving spirit in
          us, obtaining mercy is fitly promised to mercifulness in us, and the
          like, and that upon several accounts, they are the most natural
          evidences of our heart’s closing with those benefits by faith. For
          they do especially show the sweet accord and consent that there is
          between the heart and these benefits, and by reason of the natural
          likeness that there is between the virtue and the benefit, the one has
          the greater tendency to bring the other to mind. The practice of the
          virtue tends the more to renew the sense, and refresh the hope of the
          blessing promised, and also to convince the conscience of the justice
          of being denied the benefit, if the duty be neglected. Besides the
          sense and manifestation of divine forgiveness in our own consciences —
          yea, and many exercises of God’s forgiving mercy (as it respects God’s
          fatherly displeasure), granted after justification, through the course
          of a Christian’s life — may be given as the proper rewards of a
          forgiving spirit, and yet this not be at all to the prejudice of the
          doctrine we have maintained, as will more fully appear, when we come
          to answer another objection hereafter to be mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object. 2. Our own obedience, and inherent holiness, is necessary to
          prepare men for heaven, and therefore is doubtless what recommends
          persons to God’s acceptance, as the heirs of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>To this I answer,</p>
        <p>
          1. Our own obedience being necessary, in order to a preparation for an
          actual bestowment of glory, is no argument that it is the thing upon
          the account of which we are accepted to a right to it. God may, and
          does do many things to prepare the saints for glory, after he has
          accepted them as the heirs of glory. A parent may do much to prepare a
          child for an inheritance in its education, after the child is an heir.
          Yea, there are many things necessary to fit a child for the actual
          possession of the inheritance, yet not necessary in order to its
          having a right to the inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If everything that is necessary to prepare men for glory must be
          the proper condition of justification, then perfect holiness is the
          condition of justification. Men must be made perfectly holy, before
          they are admitted to the enjoyment of the blessedness of heaven, for
          there must in no wise enter in there any spiritual defilement. And
          therefore, when a saint dies, he leaves all his sin and corruption
          when he leaves the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object. 3. Our obedience is not only indissolubly connected with
          salvation, and preparatory to it, but the Scripture expressly speaks
          of bestowing eternal blessings as rewards for the good deeds of the
          saints. Mat. 10:42, “Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these
          little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, he
          shall in no wise lose his reward.” 1 Cor 3:8, “Every man shall receive
          his own reward, according to his own labor.” And in many other places.
          This seems to militate against the doctrine that has been maintained,
          two ways: (1.) The bestowing a reward, carries in it a respect to a
          moral fitness in the thing rewarded to the reward. The very notion of
          a reward being a benefit bestowed in testimony of acceptance of, and
          respect to, the goodness or amiableness of some qualification or work
          in the person rewarded. Besides, the Scripture seems to explain itself
          in this matter, in Rev. 3:4, “Thou hast a few names, even in Sardis,
          which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in
          white; for they are worthy.” This is here given as the reason why they
          should have such a reward, “because they were worthy;” which, though
          we suppose it to imply no proper merit, yet it at least implies a
          moral fitness, or that the excellency of their virtue in God’s sight
          recommends them to such a reward, which seems directly repugnant to
          what has been supposed, viz. that we are accepted, and approved of
          God, as the heirs of salvation, not out of regard to the excellency of
          our own virtue or goodness, or any moral fitness therein to such a
          reward, but only on account of the dignity and moral fitness of
          Christ’s righteousness. (2.) Our being eternally rewarded for our own
          holiness and good works, necessarily supposes that our future
          happiness will be greater or smaller, in some proportion as our own
          holiness and obedience is more or less, and that there are different
          degrees of glory, according to different degrees of virtue and good
          works, is a doctrine very expressly and frequently taught us in
          Scripture. But this seems quite inconsistent with the saints all
          having their future blessedness as a reward of Christ’s righteousness.
          For if Christ’s righteousness be imputed to all, and this be what
          entitles each one to glory, then it is the same righteousness that
          entitles one to glory which entitles another. But if all have glory as
          the reward of the same righteousness, why have not all the same glory?
          Does not the same righteousness merit as much glory when imputed to
          one as when imputed to another?
        </p>
        <p>
          In answer to the first part of this objection, I would observe, that
          it does not argue that we are justified by our good deeds, that we
          shall have eternal blessings in reward for them. For it is in
          consequence of our justification, that our good deeds become
          rewardable with spiritual and eternal rewards. The acceptableness, and
          so the rewardableness, of our virtue, is not antecedent to
          justification, but follows it, and is built entirely upon it, which is
          the reverse of what those in the adverse scheme of justification
          suppose, viz. that justification is built on the acceptableness and
          rewardableness of our virtue. They suppose that a saving interest in
          Christ is given as a reward of our virtue, or (which is the same
          thing), as a testimony of God’s acceptance of our excellency in our
          virtue. But the contrary is true: that God’s respect to our virtue as
          our amiableness in his sight, and his acceptance of it as rewardable,
          is entirely built on our interest in Christ already established. So
          that the relation to Christ, whereby believers in scripture language
          are said to be in Christ, is the very foundation of our virtues and
          good deeds being accepted of God, and so their being rewarded. For a
          reward is a testimony of acceptance. For we, and all that we do, are
          accepted only in the beloved, Eph. 1:6. Our sacrifices are acceptable,
          only through our interest in him, and through his worthiness and
          preciousness being, as it were, made ours. 1 Pet. 2:4, 5, “To whom
          coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen
          of God, and precious. Ye also as lively stones, are built up a
          spiritual house, an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
          acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.” Here being actually built on this
          stone, precious to God, is mentioned as all the ground of the
          acceptableness of our good works to God, and their becoming also
          precious in his eyes. So, Heb. 13:21, “Make you perfect in every good
          work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his
          sight, through Jesus Christ.” And hence we are directed, whatever we
          offer to God, to offer it in Christ’s name, as expecting to have it
          accepted no other way, than from the value that God has to that name.
          Col. 3:17, “And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name
          of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.” To act
          in Christ’s name, is to act under him as our head, and as having him
          to stand for us, and represent us to God-ward.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason of this may be seen from what has been already said, to
          show it is not meet that anything in us should be accepted of God as
          any excellency of our persons, until we are actually in Christ, and
          justified through him. The loveliness of the virtue of fallen
          creatures is nothing in the sight of God, till he beholds them in
          Christ, and clothed with his righteousness. 1. Because till then we
          stand condemned before God, by his own holy law, to his utter
          rejection and abhorrence. And, 2. Because we are infinitely guilty
          before him, and the loveliness of our virtue bears no proportion to
          our guilt, and must therefore pass for nothing before a strict judge.
          And, 3. Because our good deeds and virtuous acts themselves are in a
          sense corrupt, and the hatefulness of the corruption of them, if we
          are beheld as we are in ourselves, or separate from Christ, infinitely
          outweighs the loveliness of the good that is in them. So that if no
          other sin was considered but only that which attends the act of virtue
          itself, the loveliness vanishes into nothing in comparison of it, and
          therefore the virtue must pass for nothing, out of Christ. Not only
          are our best duties defiled, in being attended with the exercises of
          sin and corruption which precede, follow, and are intermingled with
          them, but even the holy acts themselves, and the gracious exercises of
          the godly, are defective. Though the act most simply considered is
          good, yet take the acts in their measure and dimensions, and the
          manner in which they are exerted, and they are sinfully defective:
          there is that defect in them that may well be called the corruption of
          them. That defect is properly sin, an expression of a vile sinfulness
          of heart and what tends to provoke the just anger of God, not because
          the exercises of love and other grace is not equal to God’s
          loveliness. For it is impossible the love of creatures (men or angels)
          should be so, but because the act is so very disproportionate to the
          occasion given for love or other grace, considering God’s loveliness,
          the manifestation that is made of it, the exercises of kindness, the
          capacity of human nature, and our advantages (and the like) together.
          — A negative expression of corruption may be as truly sin, and as just
          cause of provocation, as a positive. Thus if a worthy and excellent
          person should, from mere generosity and goodness, exceedingly lay out
          himself, and with great expense and suffering save another’s life, or
          redeem him from some extreme calamity, and if that other person should
          never thank him for it, or express the least gratitude any way, this
          would be a negative expression of his ingratitude and baseness. But
          [it] is equivalent to an act of ingratitude, or positive exercise of a
          base unworthy spirit, and is truly an expression of it, and brings as
          much blame as if he by some positive act had much injured another
          person. And so it would be (only in a lesser degree) if the gratitude
          was but very small, bearing no proportion to the benefit obligation.
          As if, for so great and extraordinary a kindness, he should express no
          more gratitude than would have been becoming towards a person who had
          only given him a cup of water when thirsty, or shown him the way in a
          journey when at a loss, or had done him some such small kindness. If
          he should come to his benefactor to express his gratitude, and should
          do after this manner, he might truly be said to act unworthily and
          odiously, he would show a most ungrateful spirit. His doing after such
          a manner might justly be abhorred by all, and yet the gratitude, that
          little there is of it, most simply considered, and so far as it goes,
          is good. And so it is with respect to our exercise of love, and
          gratitude, and other graces, towards God. They are defectively corrupt
          and sinful, and take them as they are, in their manner and measure,
          might justly be odious and provoking to God, and would necessarily be
          so, were we beheld out of Christ. For in that this defect is sin, it
          is infinitely hateful, and so the hatefulness of the very act
          infinitely outweighs the loveliness of it, because all sin has
          infinite hatefulness and heinousness. But our holiness has but little
          value and loveliness, as has been elsewhere demonstrated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, though it be true that the saints are rewarded for their good
          works, yet it is for Christ’s sake only, and not for the excellency of
          their works in themselves considered, or beheld separately from
          Christ. For so they have no excellency in God’s sight, or
          acceptableness to him, as has now been shown. It is acknowledged that
          God, in rewarding the holiness and good works of believers, does in
          some respect give them happiness as a testimony of his respect to the
          loveliness of their holiness and good works in his sight. For that is
          the very notion of a reward. But it is in a very different sense from
          what would have been if man had not fallen, which would have been to
          bestow eternal life on man, as a testimony of God’s respect to the
          loveliness of what man did, considered as in itself, and as in man
          separately by himself, and not beheld as a member of Christ. In which
          sense also, the scheme of justification we are opposing necessarily
          supposes the excellency of our virtue to be respected and rewarded.
          For it supposes a saving interest in Christ itself to be given as a
          reward of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two things come to pass, relating to the saints’ reward for their
          inherent righteousness, by virtue of their relation to Christ. 1. The
          guilt of their persons is all done away, and the pollution and
          hatefulness that attends and is in their good works, is hid. 2. Their
          relation to Christ adds a positive value and dignity to their good
          works in God’s sight. That little holiness, and those faint and feeble
          acts of love, and other grace, receive and exceeding value in the
          sight of God, by virtue of God’s beholding them as in Christ, and as
          it were members of one so infinitely worthy in his eyes, and that
          because God looks upon the persons as of greater dignity on this
          account. Isa. 43:4, “Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou has
          been honorable.” God, for Christ’s sake, and because they are members
          of his own righteous and dear Son, sets an exceeding value upon their
          persons. Hence it follows, that he also sets a great value upon their
          good acts and offerings. The same love and obedience in a person of
          greater dignity and value in God’s sight, is more valuable in his eyes
          than in one of less dignity. Love is valuable in proportion to the
          dignity of the person whose love it is, because so far as anyone gives
          his love to another, he gives himself, in that he gives his heart. But
          this is a more excellent offering, in proportion as the person whose
          self is offered is more worthy. Believers are become immensely more
          honorable in God’s esteem by virtue of their relation to Christ, than
          man would have been considered as by himself, though he had been free
          from sin: as a mean person becomes more honorable when married to a
          king. Hence God will probably reward the little weak love, and poor
          and exceeding imperfect obedience of believers in Christ, with more
          glorious reward than he would have done Adam’s perfect obedience.
          According to the tenor of the first covenant, the person was to be
          accepted and rewarded, only for the work’s sake. But by the covenant
          of grace, the work is accepted and rewarded, only for the person’s
          sake: the person being beheld antecedently as a member of Christ, and
          clothed with his righteousness. So that though the saints’ inherent
          holiness is rewarded, yet this very reward is indeed not the less
          founded on the worthiness and righteousness of Christ. None of the
          value that their works have in his sight, nor any of the acceptance
          they have with him, is out of Christ, and out of his righteousness.
          But his worthiness as mediator is the prime and only foundation on
          which all is built, and the universal source whence all arises. God
          indeed does great things out of regard to the saints’ loveliness, but
          it is only as a secondary and derivative loveliness. When I speak of a
          derivative loveliness, I do not mean only, that the qualifications
          themselves accepted as lovely, are derived from Christ, from his power
          and purchase, but that the acceptance of them as a loveliness, and all
          the value that is set upon them, and all their connection with the
          reward, is founded in, and derived from, Christ’s righteousness and
          worthiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we suppose that not only higher degrees of glory in heaven, but
          heaven itself, is in some respect given in reward for the holiness and
          good works of the saints, in this secondary and derivative sense, it
          will not prejudice the doctrine we have maintained. It is no way
          impossible that God may bestow heavens’ glory wholly out of respect to
          Christ’s righteousness, and yet in reward for man’s inherent holiness,
          in different respects, and different ways. It may be only Christ’s
          righteousness that God has respect to, for its own sake, the
          independent acceptableness and dignity of it being sufficient of
          itself to recommend all that believe in Christ to a title to this
          glory. So it may be only by this that persons enter into a title to
          heaven, or have their prime right to it. Yet God may also have respect
          to the saints’ own holiness, for Christ’s sake, and as deriving a
          value from Christ’s merit, which he may testify in bestowing heaven
          upon them. The saints being beheld as members of Christ, their
          obedience is looked upon by God as something of Christ’s: it being the
          obedience of the members of Christ, as the sufferings of the members
          of Christ are looked upon, in some respect, as the sufferings of
          Christ. Hence the apostle, speaking of his sufferings, says, Col.
          1:24, “Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that
          which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.” To the same
          purpose is Mat. 25:35, etc. I was hungry, naked, sick, and in prison,
          etc. And so that in Rev. 11:8 “And their dead bodies shall lie in the
          street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt,
          where also our Lord was crucified.”
        </p>
        <p>
          By the merit and righteousness of Christ, such favor of God towards
          the believer may be obtained, as that God may hereby be already, as it
          were, disposed to make them perfectly and eternally happy. But yet
          this does not hinder, but that God in his wisdom may choose to bestow
          this perfect and eternal happiness in this way, viz. in some respect
          as a reward of their holiness and obedience. It is not impossible but
          that the blessedness may be bestowed as a reward for that which is
          done after that an interest is already obtained in that favor, which
          (to speak of God after the manner of men) disposes God to bestow the
          blessedness. Our heavenly Father may already have that favor for a
          child, whereby he may be thoroughly ready to give the child an
          inheritance, because he is his child, which he is by the purchase of
          Christ’s righteousness, and yet that the Father may choose to bestow
          the inheritance on the child in a way of reward for his dutifulness,
          and behaving in a manner becoming a child. And so great a reward may
          not be judged more than a meet reward for his dutifulness, but that so
          great a reward is judged meet, does not arise from the excellency of
          the obedience absolutely considered, but from his standing in so near
          and honorable a relation to God, as that of a child, which is obtained
          only by the righteousness of Christ. And thus the reward, and the
          greatness of it, arises properly from the righteousness of Christ,
          though it be indeed in some sort the reward of their obedience. As a
          father might justly esteem the inheritance no more than a meet reward
          for the obedience of his child, and yet esteem it more than a meet
          reward for the obedience of a servant. The favor whence a believer’s
          heavenly Father bestows the eternal inheritance, and his title as an
          heir, is founded in that relation he stands in to him as a child,
          purchased by Christ’s righteousness: though he in wisdom chooses to
          bestow it in such a way, and therein to testify his acceptance of the
          amiableness of his obedience in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Believers having a title to heaven by faith antecedent to their
          obedience, or its being absolutely promised to them before, does not
          hinder but that the actual bestowment of heaven may also be a
          testimony of God’s regard to their obedience, though performed
          afterwards. Thus it was with Abraham, the father and pattern of all
          believers. God bestowed upon him that blessing of multiplying his seed
          as the stars of heaven, and causing that in his seed all the families
          of the earth should be blessed, in reward for his obedience in
          offering up his son Isaac, Gen. 22:16, 17, 18, “And said, By myself
          have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing,
          and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son; that in blessing I will
          bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars
          of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and they seed
          shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the
          nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.”
          And yet the very same blessings had been from time to time promised to
          Abraham, in the most positive terms, and the promise, with great
          solemnity, confirmed and sealed to him, as Gen. 12:2, 3; chap. 13:16;
          chap. 15:1, 4-7, etc. Gen. 17 throughout; chap. 18:10, 18.
        </p>
        <p>
          From what has been said we may easily solve the difficulty arising
          from that text in Rev. 3:4, “They shall walk with me in white, for
          they are worthy;” which is parallel with that text in Luke 20:35, “But
          they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the
          resurrection from the dead.” I allow (as in the objection) that this
          worthiness does doubtless denote a moral fitness to the reward, or
          that God looks on these glorious benefits as a meet testimony of his
          regard to the value which their persons and performances have in his
          sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God looks on these glorious benefits as a meet testimony of his
          regard to the value which their persons have in his sight. But he sets
          this value upon their persons purely for Christ’s sake. They are such
          jewels, and have such preciousness in his eyes, only because they are
          beheld in Christ, and by reason of the worthiness of the head they are
          the members of, and the stock they are grafted into. And the value
          that God sets upon them on this account is so great, that God thinks
          meet, from regard to it, to admit them to such exceeding glory. The
          saints, on account of their relation to Christ, are such precious
          jewels in God’s sight, that they are thought worthy of a place in his
          own crown. Mal. 3:17; Zec. 9:16. So far as the saints are said to be
          valuable in God’s sight, on whatever account, so far may they properly
          be said to be worthy, or meet for that honor which is answerable to
          the value or price which God sets upon them. A child or wife of a
          prince is worthy to be treated with great honor. Therefore if a mean
          person should be adopted to be a child of a prince, or should be
          espoused to a prince, it would be proper to say, that she was worthy
          of such and such honor and respect. There would be no force upon the
          words in saying that she ought to have such respect paid her, for she
          is worthy, though it be only on account of her relation to the prince
          that she is so.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. From the value God sets upon their persons, for the sake of
          Christ’s worthiness, he also sets a high value on their virtue and
          performances. Their meek and quiet spirit is of great price in his
          sight. Their fruits are pleasant fruits, their offerings are an odor
          of sweet smell to him, and that because of the value he sets on their
          persons, as has been already observed and explained. This preciousness
          or high valuableness of believers is a moral fitness to a reward. Yet
          this valuableness is all in the righteousness of Christ, that is the
          foundation of it. The thing respected is not excellency in them
          separately by themselves, or in their virtue by itself, but the value
          in God’s account arises from other considerations, which is the
          natural import of Luke 20:35, “They which shall be accounted worthy to
          obtain that world,” etc. and Luke 21:36, “That ye may be accounted
          worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to
          stand before the Son of man.” 2 Thes. 1:5, “That ye may be counted
          worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer.”
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a vast difference between this scheme, and what is supposed
          in the scheme of those that oppose the doctrine of justification by
          faith alone. This lays the foundation of first acceptance with God,
          and all actual salvation consequent upon it, wholly in Christ and his
          righteousness. On the contrary, in their scheme, a regard to man’s own
          excellency or virtue is supposed to be first, and to have the place of
          the first foundation in actual salvation, though not in that
          ineffectual redemption, which they suppose common to all. They lay the
          foundation of all discriminating salvation in man’s own virtue and
          moral excellency. This is the very bottom stone in this affair, for
          they suppose that it is from regard to our virtue, that even a special
          interest in Christ itself is given. The foundation being thus
          contrary, the whole scheme becomes exceeding diverse and contrary. The
          one is an evangelical scheme, the other a legal one. The one is
          utterly inconsistent with our being justified by Christ’s
          righteousness, the other not at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          From what has been said, we may understand, not only how the
          forgiveness of sin granted in justification is indissolubly connected
          with a forgiving spirit in us, but how there may be many exercises of
          forgiving mercy granted in reward for our forgiving those who trespass
          against us. For none will deny but that there are many acts of divine
          forgiveness towards the saints, that do not presuppose an unjustified
          state immediately preceding that forgiveness. None will deny, that
          saints who never fell from a justified state, yet commit many sins
          which God forgives afterwards, by laying aside his fatherly
          displeasure. This forgiveness may be in reward for our forgiveness,
          without any prejudice to the doctrine that has been maintained, as
          well as other mercies and blessings consequent on justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to the second part of the objection, that relates to the
          different degrees of glory, and the seeming inconsistency there is in
          it, that the degrees of glory in different saints should be greater or
          lesser according to their inherent holiness and good works, and yet,
          that everyone’s glory should be purchased with the price of the very
          same imputed righteousness, — I answer that Christ, by his
          righteousness, purchased for everyone complete and perfect happiness,
          according to his capacity. But this does not hinder but that the
          saints, being of various capacities, may have various degrees of
          happiness, and yet all their happiness be the fruit of Christ’s
          purchase. Indeed it cannot be properly said, that Christ purchased any
          particular degree of happiness, so that the value of Christ’s
          righteousness in the sight of God, is sufficient to raise a believer
          so high in happiness, and no higher, and so that if the believer were
          made happier, it would exceed the value of Christ’s righteousness. But
          in general, Christ purchased eternal life, or perfect happiness for
          all, according to their several capacities. The saints are as so many
          vessels of different sizes, cast into a sea of happiness, where every
          vessel is full: this Christ purchased for all. But after all, it is
          left to God’s sovereign pleasure to determine the largeness of the
          vessel. Christ’s righteousness meddles not with this matter. Eph 4:4,
          5, 6, 7, “There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in
          one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism,” etc. —
          “But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of
          the gift of Christ.” God may dispense in this matter according to what
          rule he pleases, not the less for what Christ has done: he may
          dispense either without condition, or upon what condition he pleases
          to fix. It is evident that Christ’s righteousness meddles not with
          this matter, for what Christ did was to fulfill the covenant of works,
          but the covenant of works did not meddle at all with this. If Adam had
          persevered in perfect obedience, he and his posterity would have had
          perfect and full happiness. Everyone’s happiness would have so
          answered his capacity, that he would have been completely blessed. But
          God would have been at liberty to have made some of one capacity, and
          other of another, as he pleased. — The angels have obtained eternal
          life, or a state of confirmed glory, by a covenant of works, whose
          condition was perfect obedience. But yet some are higher in glory than
          others, according to the several capacities that God, according to his
          sovereign pleasure, has given them. So that it being still left with
          God, notwithstanding the perfect obedience of the second Adam, to fix
          the degree of each one’s capacity by what rule he pleases, he has been
          pleased to fix the degree of capacity, and so of glory, by the
          proportion of the saints’ grace and fruitfulness here. He gives higher
          degrees of glory, in reward for higher degrees of holiness and good
          works, because it pleases him, and yet all the happiness of each saint
          is indeed the fruit of the purchase of Christ’s obedience. If it had
          been but one man that Christ had obeyed and died for, and it had
          pleased God to make him a very large capacity, Christ’s perfect
          obedience would have purchased that his capacity should be filled, and
          then all his happiness might properly be said to be the fruit of
          Christ’s perfect obedience. Though, if he had been of a less capacity,
          he would not have had so much happiness by the same obedience, and yet
          would have had as much as Christ merited for him. Christ’s
          righteousness meddles not with the degree of happiness, any otherwise
          than as he merits that it should be full and perfect, according to the
          capacity. So it may be said to be concerned in the degree of
          happiness, as perfect is a degree with respect to imperfect, but it
          meddles not with degrees of perfect happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          This matter may be yet better understood, if we consider that Christ
          and the whole church of saints are, as it were, one body, of which he
          is the Head, and they members, of different place and capacity. Now
          the whole body, head, and members, have communion in Christ’s
          righteousness: they are all partakers of the benefit of it. Christ
          himself the Head is rewarded for it, and every member is partaker of
          the benefit and reward. But it does by no means follow, that every
          part should equally partake of the benefit, but every part in
          proportion to its place and capacity. The Head partakes of far more
          than other parts, and the more noble members partake of more than the
          inferior. As it is in a natural body that enjoys perfect health, the
          head, and the heart, and lungs, have a greater share of this health.
          They have it more seated in them, than the hands and feet, because
          they are parts of greater capacity, though the hands and feet are as
          much in perfect health as those nobler parts of the body. So it is in
          the mystical body of Christ: all the members are partakers of the
          benefit of the Head, but it is according to the different capacity and
          place they have in the body. God determines that place and capacity as
          he pleases. He makes whom he pleases the foot, and whom he pleases the
          hand, and whom he pleases the lungs, etc. 1 Cor 12:18, “God hath set
          the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.”
          God efficaciously determines the place and capacity of every member,
          by the different degrees of grace and assistance in the improvement of
          it in this world. Those that he intends for the highest place in the
          body, he gives them most of his Spirit, the greatest share of the
          divine nature, the Spirit and nature of Christ Jesus the Head, and
          that assistance whereby they perform the most excellent works, and do
          most abound in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object. 4. It may be objected against what has been supposed (viz.
          that rewards are given to our good works, only in consequence of an
          interest in Christ, or in testimony of God’s respect to the excellency
          or value of them in his sight, as built on an interest in Christ’s
          righteousness already obtained). That the Scripture speaks of an
          interest in Christ itself, as being given out of respect to our moral
          fitness. Mat. 10:37, 38, 39, “He that loveth father or mother more
          than me, is not worthy of me: he that loveth son or daughter more than
          me, is not worthy of me: he that taketh not up his cross, and
          followeth after me, is not worthy of me: he that findeth his life,
          shall lose it,” etc. Worthiness here at least signifies a moral
          fitness, or an excellency that recommends. And this place seems to
          intimate as though it were from respect to a moral fitness that men
          are admitted even to an union with Christ, and interest in him.
          Therefore this worthiness cannot be consequent on being in Christ, and
          by the imputation of his worthiness, or from any value that is in us,
          or in our actions in God’s sight, as beheld in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this I answer, that though persons when they are accepted, are not
          accepted as worthy, yet when they are rejected, they are rejected as
          unworthy. He that does not love Christ above other things, but treats
          him with such indignity, as to set him below earthly things, shall be
          treated as unworthy of Christ. His unworthiness of Christ, especially
          in that particular, shall be marked against him, and imputed to him.
          And though he be a professing Christian, and live in the enjoyment of
          the gospel, and has been visibly ingrafted into Christ, and admitted
          as one of his disciples, as Judas was, yet he shall be thrust out in
          wrath, as a punishment of his vile treatment of Christ. The
          forementioned words do not imply that if a man does love Christ above
          father and mother, etc. that he would be worthy. The most they imply
          is that such a visible Christian shall be treated and thrust out as
          unworthy. He that believes is not received for the worthiness or moral
          fitness of faith, but yet the visible Christian is cast out by God,
          for the unworthiness and moral unfitness of unbelief. A being accepted
          as one of Christ’s, is not the reward of believing, but being thrust
          out from being one of Christ’s disciples, after a visible admission as
          such, is properly a punishment of unbelief. John 3:18,19, “He that
          believeth on him, is not condemned; but he that believeth not, is
          condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only
          begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come
          into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because
          their deeds were evil.” Salvation is promised to faith as a free gift,
          but damnation is threatened to unbelief as a debt, or punishment due
          to unbelief. They who believed while in the wilderness, did not enter
          into Canaan, because of the worthiness of their faith. But God swore
          in his wrath, that they that believed not should not enter in, because
          of the unworthiness of their unbelief. Admitting a soul to an union
          with Christ is an act of free and sovereign grace, but excluding at
          death, and at the day of judgment, those professors of Christianity
          who have had the offers of a Savior, and enjoyed great privileges as
          God’s people, is a judicial proceeding, and a just punishment of their
          unworthy treatment of Christ. The design of this saying of Christ is
          to make them sensible of the unworthiness of their treatment of
          Christ, who professed him to be their Lord and Savior, and set him
          below father and mother, etc. and not to show the worthiness of loving
          him above father and mother. If a beggar should be offered any great
          and precious gift, but as soon as offered, should trample it under his
          feet, it might be taken from him, as unworthy to have it. Or if a
          malefactor should have his pardon offered him, that he might be freed
          from execution, and should only scoff at it, his pardon might be
          refused him, as unworthy of it. Though if he had received it, he would
          not have had it for his worthiness, or as being recommended to it by
          his virtue. For his being a malefactor supposes him unworthy, and its
          being offered him to have it only on accepting, supposes that the king
          looks for no worthiness, nothing in him for which he should bestow
          pardon as a reward. This may teach us how to understand Acts 13:46,
          “It was necessary that the Word of God should first have been spoken
          unto you; but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy
          of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Object. 5. It is objected against the doctrine of justification by
          faith alone, that repentance is evidently spoken of in Scripture as
          that which is in a special manner the condition of remission of sins:
          but remission of sins is by all allowed to be that wherein
          justification does (at least) in great part consist.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it must certainly arise from a misunderstanding of what the
          Scripture says about repentance, to suppose that faith and repentance
          are two distinct things, that in like manner are the conditions of
          justification. For it is most plain from the Scripture, that the
          condition of justification, or that in us by which we are justified,
          is but one, and that is faith. Faith and repentance are not two
          distinct conditions of justification, nor are they two distinct things
          that together make one condition of justification. But faith
          comprehends the whole of that by which we are justified, or by which
          we come to have an interest in Christ, and there is nothing else that
          has a parallel concern with it in the affair of our salvation. And
          this the divines on the other side themselves are sensible of, and
          therefore they suppose that the faith the apostle Paul speaks of,
          which he says we are justified by alone, comprehends in it repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          And therefore, in answer to the objection, I would say that when
          repentance is spoken of in Scripture as the condition of pardon,
          thereby is not intended any particular grace, or act, properly
          distinct from faith, that has a parallel influence with it in the
          affair of our pardon or justification. But by repentance is intended
          nothing distinct from active conversion (or conversion actively
          considered), as it respects the term from which. Active conversion is
          a motion or exercise of the mind that respects two terms, viz. sin and
          God, and by repentance is meant this conversion, or active change of
          the mind, so far as it is conversant about the term from which or
          about sin. This is what the word repentance properly signifies: a
          change of the mind, or, which is the same thing, the turning or the
          conversion of the mind. Repentance is this turning, as it respects
          what is turned from. Acts 26:19. — “Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I
          showed unto them of Damascus and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the
          coasts of Judea, and then to the aaaaaGentiles, that they should
          repent, and turn to God.” Both these are the same turning, but only
          with respect to opposite terms. In the former is expressed the
          exercise of mind about sin in this turning: in the other, the exercise
          of mind towards God.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we look over the Scriptures that speak of evangelical repentance,
          we shall presently see that repentance is to be understood in this
          sense, as Mat. 9:13, “I am nota come to call the righteous, but
          sinners to repentance.” Luke 13:3, “Except ye repent, ye shall all
          likewise perish.” And chap. 15:7, 10, “There is joy in heaven over one
          sinner that repenteth,” i. e. over one sinner that is converted. Acts
          11:18, “Then hath God alsoto the Gentiles granted repentance unto
          life.” This is said by the Christians of the circumcision at
          Jerusalem, upon Peter’s giving an account of the conversion of
          Cornelius and his family, and their embracing the gospel, though Peter
          had said nothing expressly about their sorrow for sin. And again, Acts
          17:30, “But now commandeth all men every where to “repent.” And Luke
          16:30, “Nay, father Abraham, but if one went to them frothe dead, they
          would repent.” 2 Pet. 3:9, “The Lord is not slack concerning his
          promise, as some men count slackness, but is long-suffering toward us,
          not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
          repentance.” It is plain that in these and other places, by repentance
          is meant conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is true, that conversion is the condition of pardon and
          justification. But if it be so, how absurd is it to say, that
          conversion is one condition of justification, and faith another, as
          though they were two distributively distinct and parallel conditions?
          Conversion is the condition of justification, because it is that great
          change by which we are brought from sin to Christ, and by which we
          become believers in him: agreeable to Mat. 21:32, “And ye, when ye had
          seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.” When we
          are directed to repent, that our sins may be blotted out, it is as
          much as to say, let your minds and hearts be changed, that your sins
          may be blotted out. But if it be said, let your hearts be changed,
          that you may be justified, and believe, that you may be justified,
          does it therefore follow, that the heart being changed is one
          condition ofjustification, and believing another? But our minds must
          be changed, that we may believe, and so may be justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          And besides, evangelical repentance, being active conversion, is not
          to be treated of as a particular grace, properly and entirely distinct
          from faith, as by some it seems to have been. What is conversion, but
          the sinful, alienated soul’s closing with Christ, or th sinner’s being
          brought to believe in Christ? That exercise of soul in conversion that
          respects sin, cannot be excluded out of the nature of faith in Christ:
          there is something in faith, or closing with Christ, that respects
          sin, and that is evangelical repentance. That repentance which in
          Scripture is called, repentance for the remission of sins, is that
          very principle or operation of the mind itself that is called faith,
          so far as it is conversant about sin. Justifying faith in a Mediator
          is conversant about two things. It is conversant about sin or evil to
          be rejected and to be delivered from, and about positive good to be
          accepted and obtained by the Mediator. As conversant about the former
          of these, it is
        </p>
        <p>
          evangelical repentance, or repentance for remission of sins. Surely
          they must be veryignorant, or at least very inconsiderate, of the
          whole tenor of the gospel, who think that the repentance by which
          remission of sins is obtained, can be completed as to all that is
          essential to it, without any respect to Christ, or application of the
          mind to the Mediator, who alone has made atonement for sin. — Surely
          so great a part of salvation as remission of sins, is not to be
          obtained without looking or coming to the great and only Savior. It is
          true, repentance, in its more general abstracted nature, is only a
          sorrow for sin, and forsaking of it, which is a duty of natural
          religion. But evangelical repentance, for repentance for remission of
          sins, has more than this essential to it: a dependence of soul on the
          Mediator for deliverance from sin, is of the essence of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That justifying repentance has the nature of faith, seems evident by
          Acts 19:4, “Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of
          repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him
          which should come after him, that is, on ChristJesus.” The latter
          words, “saying unto the people, that they should believe on him,” etc.
          are evidently exegetical of the former, and explain how he preached
          repentance for the remission of sins. When it is said, that he
          preached repentance for the remission of sin, saying that they should
          believe on Christ, it cannot be supposed but that his saying, that
          they should believe on Christ, was intended as directing them what to
          do that they might obtain the remission of sins. So 2 Tim. 2:25, “In
          meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if Godperadventure
          will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.” That
          acknowledging of the truth which there is in believing, is here spoken
          of as what is retained in repentance. And on the other hand, that
          faith includes repentance in its nature, is evident by the apostle’s
          speaking of sin as destroyed in faith, Gal. 2:18. — In the preceding
          verses the apostle mentions an objection against the doctrine of
          justification by faith alone, viz. that it tends to encourage men in
          sin, and so to make Christ the minister of sin. This objection he
          rejects and refutes with this, “If I build again the things that I
          destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.” If sin be destroyed by
          faith, it must be by repentance of sin included in it. For we know
          that it is our repentance of sin, or the ìåôáíïéá, or turning of the
          mind from sin, that is our destroying our sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          That in justifying faith which directly respects sin, or the evil to
          be delivered from by the Mediator, is as follows: a sense of our own
          sinfulness, and the hatefulness of it, and a hearty acknowledgment of
          its desert of the threatened punishment, looking to the free mercy of
          God in a Redeemer, for deliverance from it and its punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this, here described, three things may be noted: 1. That it
          is the very same with that evangelical repentance to which remission
          of sins is promised in Scripture. 2. That it is of the essence of
          justifying faith, and is the same with that faith, so far as it is
          conversant about evil to be delivered from by the Mediator. 3. That
          this is indeed the proper and peculiar condition of remission of sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. All of it is essential to evangelical repentance, and is indeed the
          very thing meant by that repentance, to which remission of sins is
          promised in the gospel. As to the former part of the description, viz.
          a sense of our own sinfulness, and the hatefulness of it, and a hearty
          acknowledgment of its desert of wrath, none will deny it to be
          included in repentance. But this does not comprehend the whole essence
          of evangelical repentance. But what follows does also properly and
          essentially belong to its nature, looking to the free mercy of God in
          a Redeemer, for deliverance from it, and the punishment of it. That
          repentance to which remission is promised, not only always has this
          with it, but it is contained in it, as what is of the proper nature
          and essence of it: and respect is ever had to this in the nature of
          repentance, whenever remission is promised to it. And it is especially
          from respect to this in the nature of repentance, that it has that
          promise made to it. If this latter part be missing, it fails of the
          nature of that evangelical repentance to which remission of sins is
          promised. If repentance remains in sorrow for sin, and does not reach
          to a looking to the free mercy of God in Christ for pardon, it is not
          that which is the condition of pardon, neither shall pardon be
          obtained by it. Evangelical repentance is an humiliation for sin
          before God. But the sinner never comes and humbles himself before God
          in any other repentance, but that which includes hoping in his mercy
          for remission. If sorrow be not accompanied with that, there will be
          no coming to God in it, but a flying further from him. There is some
          worship of God in justifying repentance, but that is not in any other
          repentance which has not a sense of and faith in the divine mercy to
          forgive sin, Psa. 130:4, “There is forgiveness with thee, that thou
          mayest be feared.” The promise of mercy to a true penitent, in Pro.
          28:13 is expressed in these terms, “Whoso confesseth and forsaketh his
          sins, shall have mercy.” But there is faith in God’s mercy in that
          confessing. The psalmist (Psalm 32) speaking of the blessedness of the
          man whose transgression is forgiven — and whose sin is covered, to
          whom the Lord imputes not sin — says that while he kept silence his
          bones waxed old, but he acknowledged his sin unto God: his iniquity he
          did not hide. He said he would confess his transgression to the Lord,
          and then God forgave the iniquity of his sin. The manner of expression
          plainly holds forth, that then he began to encourage himself in the
          mercy of God, but his bones waxed old while he kept silence. And
          therefore the apostle Paul, in the 4th of Romans, brings this
          instance, to confirm the doctrine of justification by faith alone,
          that he had been insisting on. When sin is aright confessed to God,
          there is always faith in that act. That confessing of sin which is
          joined with despair, as in Judas, is not the confession to which the
          promise is made. In Acts 2:38, the direction given to those who were
          pricked in their heart with a sense of the guilt of sin, was to repent
          and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of their
          sins. Being baptized in the name of Christ for the remission of sins,
          implied faith in Christ for the remission of sins. Repentance for the
          remission of sins was typified of old by the priest’s confessing the
          sins of the people over the scapegoat, laying his hands on him, Lev.
          16:21, denoting it is that repentance and confession of sin only that
          obtains remission, which is made over Christ the great sacrifice, and
          with dependence on him. Many other things might be produced from the
          Scripture, that in like manner confirm this point, but these may be
          sufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. All the forementioned description is of the essence of justifying
          faith, and not different from it, so far as it is conversant about
          sin, or the evil to be delivered from by the Mediator. For it is
          doubtless of the essence of justifying faith, to embrace Christ as a
          Savior from sin and its punishment, and all that is contained in that
          act is contained in the nature of faith itself. But in the act of
          embracing Christ as a Savior from our sin and its punishment, is
          implied a sense of our sinfulness, and a hatred for our sins, or a
          rejecting them with abhorrence, and a sense of our desert of
          punishment. Embracing Christ as a Savior from sin, implies the
          contrary act, viz. rejecting sin. If we fly to the light to be
          delivered from darkness, the same act is contrary to darkness, viz. a
          rejecting of it. In proportion to the earnestness with which we
          embrace Christ as a Savior from sin, in the same proportion is the
          abhorrence with which we reject sin, in the same act. Yea, suppose
          there be in the nature of faith, as conversant about sin, no more than
          the hearty embracing of Christ as a Savior from the punishment of sin,
          this act will imply in it the whole of the above-mentioned
          description. It implies a sense of our own sinfulness. Certainly in
          the hearty embracing of a Savior from the punishment of our
          sinfulness, there is the exercise of a sense that we are sinful. We
          cannot heartily embrace Christ as a Savior from the punishment of that
          which we are not sensible we are guilty of. There is also in the same
          act, a sense of our desert of the threatened punishment. We cannot
          heartily embrace Christ as a Savior from that which we are not
          sensible that we have deserved. For if we are not sensible that we
          have deserved the punishment, we shall not be sensible that we have
          any need of a Savior from it, or, at least, shall not be convinced but
          that God who offers the Savior, unjustly makes him needful, and we
          cannot heartily embrace such an offer. And further, there is implied
          in a hearty embracing Christ as a Savior from punishment, not only a
          conviction of conscience, that we have deserved the punishment, such
          as the devils and damned have, but there is a hearty acknowledgment of
          it, with the submission of the soul, so as with the accord of the
          heart, to own that God might be just in the punishment. If the heart
          rises against the act or judgment of God, in holding us obliged to the
          punishment, when he offers us his Son as a Savior from the punishment,
          we cannot with the consent of the heart receive him in that character.
          But if persons thus submit to the righteousness of so dreadful a
          punishment of sin, this carries in it a hatred of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          That such a sense of our sinfulness, and utter unworthiness, and
          desert of punishment, belongs to the nature of saving faith, is what
          the Scripture from time to time holds forth, as particularly in Mat.
          15:26-28. “But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the
          children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs. And she said, Truth, Lord:
          yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master’s table.
          Then Jesus answered, and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith.”
          — And Luke 7:6-9. “The centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him,
          Lord, trouble not thyself, for I am not worthy that thou shouldst
          enter under my roof. Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come
          unto thee; but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed: for I
          also am a man set under authority,” etc. — “When Jesus heard these
          things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the
          people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great
          faith, no, not in Israel.” And also verse 37, 38. “And behold, a woman
          in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat
          in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster-box of ointment, and
          stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with
          tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his
          feet, and anointed them with the ointment.” Together with verse 50.
          “He said unto the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.”
        </p>
        <p>
          These things do not necessarily suppose that repentance and faith are
          words of just the same signification. For it is only so much in
          justifying faith as respects the evil to be delivered from by the
          Savior, that is called repentance. Besides, both repentance and faith
          take them only in their general nature, [and] are entirely distinct.
          Repentance is a sorrow for sin, and forsaking of it, and faith is a
          trusting in God’s sufficiency and truth. But faith and repentance, as
          evangelical duties, or justifying faith, and repentance for remission
          of sins, contain more in them, and imply a respect to a mediator, and
          involve each other’s nature: *2* though they still bear the name of
          faith and repentance, from those general moral virtues — that
          repentance, which is a duty of natural religion, and that faith, which
          was a duty required under the first covenant — that are contained in
          this evangelical act, which severally appear, when this act is
          considered with respect to its different terms and objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be objected here that the Scripture sometimes mentions faith
          and repentance together, as if they were entirely distinct things, as
          in Mark 1:15, “Repent ye, and believe the gospel.” But there is not
          need of understanding these as two distinct conditions of salvation,
          but the words are exegetical one of another. It is to teach us after
          what manner we must repent, viz. as believing the gospel, and after
          what manner we must believe the gospel, viz. as repenting. These words
          no more prove faith and repentance to be entirely distinct, than those
          fore-mentioned, Mat. 21:32. “And ye, when ye had seen it, repented not
          afterwards, that ye might believe him.” Or those, 2 Tim. 2:25. “If
          peradventure God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the
          truth.” The apostle, in Acts 19:4 seems to have reference to these
          words of John the Baptist, “John baptized with the baptism of
          repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe,” etc.
          where the latter words, as we have already observed, are to explain
          how he preached repentance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another Scripture where faith and repentance are mentioned together,
          is Acts 20:21. “Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks,
          repentance towards God, and faith towards the Lord Jesus Christ.” It
          may be objected, that in this place, faith and repentance are not only
          spoken of as distinct things, but having distinct objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this I answer, that faith and repentance, in their general nature,
          are distinct things, and repentance for the remission of sins, or that
          in justifying faith that respects the evil to be delivered from, so
          far as it regards that term, which is what especially denominates it
          repentance, has respect to God as the object, because he is the Being
          offended by sin, and to be reconciled, but that in this justifying
          act, whence it is denominated faith, does more especially respect
          Christ. But let us interpret it how we will, the objection of faith
          being here so distinguished from repentance, is as much of an
          objection against the scheme of those that oppose justification by
          faith alone, as against this scheme. For they hold that the justifying
          faith the apostle Paul speaks of, includes repentance, as has been
          already observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This repentance that has been described, is indeed the special
          condition of remission of sins. This seems very evident by the
          Scripture, as particularly, Mark 1:4. “John did baptize in the
          wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance, for the remission of
          sins.” So, Luke 3:3, “And be came into all the country about Jordan,
          preaching the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins.” Luke
          24:47, “And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
          in his name among all nations.” Acts 5:31, “Him hath God exalted with
          his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance
          unto Israel, and forgiveness of sins.” Acts 2:38. Repent, and be
          baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the
          remission of sins.” And, chap. 3:19. “Repent ye therefore, and be
          converted, that your sins may be blotted out.” The like is evident by
          Lev. 26:40-42; Job. 33:27, 28; Psa. 32:5; Pro. 28:13; Jer. 3:13. And 1
          John 1:9 and other places.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the reason may be plain from what has been said. We need not
          wonder that what in faith especially respects sin, should be
          especially the condition of remission of sins, or that this motion or
          exercise of the soul, as it rejects and flies from evil and embraces
          Christ as a Savior from it, should especially be the condition of
          being free from that evil: in like manner, as the same principle or
          motion, as it seeks good, and cleaves to Christ as the procurer of
          that good, should be the condition of obtaining that good. Faith with
          respect to good is accepting and with respect to evil it is rejecting.
          Yea this rejecting evil is itself an act of acceptance. It is
          accepting freedom or separation from that evil, and this freedom or
          separation is the benefit bestowed in remission. No wonder that what
          in faith immediately respects this benefit, and is our acceptance of
          it, should be the special condition of our having it. It is so with
          respect to all the benefits that Christ has purchased. Trusting in God
          through Christ for such a particular benefit that we need, is the
          special condition of obtaining that benefit. When we need protection
          from enemies, the exercise of faith with respect to such a benefit, or
          trusting in Christ for protection from enemies, is especially the way
          to obtain that particular benefit, rather than trusting in Christ for
          something else, and so of any other benefit that might be mentioned.
          So prayer (which is the expression of faith) for a particular mercy
          needed, is especially the way to obtain that mercy. — So that no
          argument can be drawn from hence against the doctrine of justification
          by faith alone. And there is that in the nature of repentance, which
          peculiarly tends to establish the contrary of justification by works.
          For nothing so much renounces our own worthiness and excellency, as
          repentance. The very nature of it is to acknowledge our own utter
          sinfulness and unworthiness, and to renounce our own goodness and all
          confidence in self; and so to trust in the propitiation of the
          Mediator, and ascribe all the glory of forgiveness to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object. 6. The last objection I shall mention, is that paragraph in
          the 3d chapter of James, where persons are said expressly to be
          justified by works: Jam. 2:21. “Was not Abraham our father justified
          by works?” Verse 24. “Ye see then how that by works a man is
          justified, and not by faith only.” Verse 25. “Was not Rahab the harlot
          justified by works?”
        </p>
        <p>In answer to this objection, I would,</p>
        <p>
          1. Take notice of the great unfairness of the divines that oppose us,
          in the improvement they make of this passage against us. All will
          allow, that in that proposition of St. James, “By works a man is
          justified, and not by faith only,” one of the terms, either the word
          faith, or else the word justify, is not to be understood precisely in
          the same sense as the same terms when used by St. Paul, because they
          suppose, as well as we, that it was not the intent of the apostle
          James to contradict St. Paul in that doctrine of justification by
          faith alone, in which he had instructed the churches. But if we
          understand both the terms, as used by each apostle, in precisely the
          same sense, then what one asserts is a precise, direct, and full
          contradiction of the other: the one affirming and the other denying
          the very same thing. So that all the controversy from this text comes
          to this, viz. which of these two terms shall be understood in a
          diversity from St. Paul. They say that it is the word faith, for they
          suppose that when the apostle Paul uses the word, and makes faith that
          by which alone we are justified, that then by it is understood a
          compliance with and practice of Christianity in general, so as to
          include all saving Christian virtue and obedience. But as the apostle
          James uses the word faith in this place, they suppose thereby is to be
          understood only an assent of the understanding to the truth of gospel
          doctrines, as distinguished from good works, and that may exist
          separate from them, and from all saving grace. We, on the other hand,
          suppose that the word justify is to be understood in a different sense
          from the apostle Paul. So that they are forced to go as far in their
          scheme, in altering the sense of terms from Paul’s use of them, as we.
          But yet at the same time that they freely vary the sense of the former
          of them, viz. faith, yet when we understand the latter, viz. justify,
          in a different sense from St. Paul, they exclaim against us. What
          necessity of framing this distinction, but only to serve an opinion?
          At this rate a man may maintain anything, though never so contrary to
          Scripture, and elude the clearest text in the Bible! Though they do
          not show us why we have not as good warrant to understand the word
          justify in a diversity from St. Paul, as they the word faith. If the
          sense of one of the words must be varied on either scheme, to make the
          apostle James’s doctrine consistent with the apostle Paul’s, and if
          varying the sense of one term or the other be all that stands in the
          way of their agreeing with either scheme, and if varying the sense of
          the latter be in itself as fair as of the former, then the text lies
          as fair for one scheme as the other, and can no more fairly be an
          objection against our scheme than theirs. And if so, what becomes of
          all this great objection from this passage in James?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If there be no more difficulty in varying the sense of one of these
          terms than another, from anything in the text itself, so as to make
          the words suit with either scheme, then certainly that is to be chosen
          that is most agreeable to the current of Scripture, and other places
          where the same matter is more particularly and fully treated of, and
          therefore that we should understand the word justify in this passage
          of James, in a sense in some respects diverse from that in which St.
          Paul uses it. For by what has been already said, it may appear, that
          there is no one doctrine in the whole Bible more fully asserted,
          explained, and urged, than the doctrine of justification by faith
          alone, without any of our own righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There is a very fair interpretation of this passage of St. James,
          no way inconsistent with this doctrine of justification, which I have
          shown that other scriptures abundantly teach, which the words
          themselves will as well allow of, as that which the objectors put upon
          them, and much better agrees with the context: and that is, that works
          are here spoken of as justifying as evidences. A man may be said to be
          justified by that which clears him, or vindicates him, or makes the
          goodness of his cause manifest. When a person has a cause tried in a
          civil court, and is justified or cleared, he may be said in different
          senses to be justified or cleared, by the goodness of his cause, and
          by the goodness of the evidences of it. He may be said to be cleared
          by what evidences his cause to be good, but not in the same sense as
          he is by that which makes his cause to be good. That which renders his
          cause good, is the proper ground of his justification. It is by that
          that he is himself a proper subject of it, but evidences justify, only
          as they manifest that his cause is good in fact, whether they are of
          such a nature as to have any influence to render it so or no. It is by
          works that our cause appears to be good, but by faith our cause not
          only appears to be good, but becomes good, because thereby we are
          united to Christ. That the word justify should be sometimes understood
          to signify the former of these, as well as the latter, is agreeable to
          the use of the word in common speech: as we say such an one stood up
          to justify another, i.e. he endeavored to show or manifest his cause
          to be good. — And it is certain that the word is sometimes used in
          this sense in Scripture, when speaking of our being justified before
          God: as where it is said, we shall be justified by our words, Mat.
          12:37. “For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words
          thou shalt be condemned.” It cannot be meant that men are accepted
          before God on the account of their words. For God has told us nothing
          more plainly, than that it is the heart that he looks at, and that
          when he acts as judge towards men, in order to justifying or
          condemning, he tries the heart, Jer. 11:20. “But, O Lord of hosts,
          that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me
          see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.”
          Psa. 7:8, 9, “The Lord shall judge the people: judge me, O Lord,
          according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is
          in me. O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but
          establish the just; for the righteous God trieth the hearts and
          reins.” Verse 11, “God judgeth the righteous.” And many other places
          to the like purpose. And therefore men can be justified by their
          words, no otherwise than as evidences or manifestations of what is in
          the heart. And it is thus that Christ speaks of the words in this very
          place, as is evident by the context, Mat. 12:34, 35. “Out of the
          abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good
          treasure of the heart,” etc. The words, or sounds themselves, are
          neither parts of godliness nor evidences of godliness, but as signs of
          what is inward.
        </p>
        <p>
          God himself, when he acts towards men as judge, in order to a
          declarative judgment, makes use of evidences, and so judges men by
          their works. And therefore, at the day of judgment, God will judge men
          according to their works. For though God will stand in no need of
          evidence to inform him what is right, yet it is to be considered that
          he will then sit in judgment, not as earthly judges do, to find out
          what is right in a cause, but to declare and manifest what is right.
          And therefore that day is called by the apostle, “the day of the
          revelation of the righteous judgment of God,” Rom. 2:5.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be justified, is to be approved of and accepted, but a man may be
          said to be approved and accepted in two respects: the one is to be
          approved really, and the other to be approved and accepted
          declaratively. Justification is twofold: it is either the acceptance
          and approbation of the judge itself, or the manifestation of that
          approbation by a sentence or judgment declared by the judge, either to
          our own consciences or to the world. If justification be understood in
          the former sense, for the approbation itself, that is only that by
          which we become fit to be approved. But if it be understood in the
          latter sense, for the manifestation of this approbation, it is by
          whatever is a proper evidence of that fitness. In the former, only
          faith is concerned, because it is by that only in us that we become
          fit to be accepted and approved. In the latter, whatever is an
          evidence of our fitness, is alike concerned. And therefore, take
          justification in this sense, and then faith, and all other graces and
          good works, have a common and equal concern in it. For any other
          grace, or holy act, is equally an evidence of a qualification for
          acceptance or approbation, as faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          To justify has always, in common speech, signified indifferently,
          either simply approbation, or testifying that approbation: sometimes
          one, and sometimes the other; because they are both the same, only as
          one is outwardly what the other is inwardly. So we, and it may be all
          nations, are wont to give the same name to two things, when one is
          only declarative of the other. Thus sometimes judging, intends only
          judging in our thoughts; at other times, testifying and declaring
          judgment. So such words as justify, condemn, accept, reject, prize,
          slight, approve, renounce, are sometimes put for mental acts, at other
          times, for an outward treatment. So in the sense in which the apostle
          James seems to use the word justify for manifestative justification, a
          man is justified not only by faith, but also by works: as a tree is
          manifested to be good, not only by immediately examining the tree, but
          also by the fruit, Pro. 20:11, “Even a child is known by his doing,
          whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The drift of the apostle does not require that he should be understood
          in any other sense; for all that he aims at, as appears by a view of
          the context, is to prove that good works are necessary. The error of
          those that he opposed was this: that good works were not necessary to
          salvation, that if they did but believe that there was but one God,
          and that Christ was the Son of God and the like, and were baptized,
          they were safe, let them live how they would, which doctrine greatly
          tended to licentiousness. The evincing the contrary of this is
          evidently the apostle’s scope.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that we should understand the apostle, of works justifying as an
          evidence, and in a declarative judgment, is what a due consideration
          of the context will naturally lead us to. — For it is plain, that the
          apostle is here insisting on works, in the quality of a necessary
          manifestation and evidence of faith, or as what the truth of faith is
          made to appear by: as Jam. 2:18, “Show me thy faith without thy works,
          and I will show thee my faith by my works.” And when he says, verse
          26, “As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is
          dead also.” It is much more rational and natural to understand him as
          speaking of works, as the proper signs and evidences of the reality,
          life, and goodness of faith. Not that the very works or actions done
          are properly the life of faith, as the spirit in the body, but it is
          the active, working nature of faith, of which the actions or works
          done are the signs, that is itself the life and spirit of faith. The
          sign of a thing is often in scripture language said to be that thing;
          as it is in that comparison by which the apostle illustrates it. Not
          the actions themselves of a body, are properly the life or spirit of
          the body, but the active nature, of which those actions or motions are
          the signs, is the life of the body. That which makes men pronounce
          anything to be alive is that they observe it has an active operative
          nature, which they observe no otherwise than by the actions or motions
          which are the signs of it. It is plainly the apostle’s aim to prove,
          that if faith has not works, it is a sign that it is not a good sort
          of faith, which would not have been to his purpose if it was his
          design to show that it is not by faith alone, though of a right sort,
          that we have acceptance with God, but that we are accepted on the
          account of obedience as well as faith. It is evident, by the apostle’s
          reasoning, that the necessity of works, is not from their having a
          parallel concern in our salvation with faith. But he speaks of works
          only as related to faith, and expressive of it, which, after all,
          leaves faith the alone fundamental condition, without anything else
          having a parallel concern with it in this affair; and other things
          conditions, only as several expressions and evidences of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the apostle speaks of works justifying only as a sign, or
          evidence, and in God’s declarative judgment, is further confirmed by
          Jam. 2:21, “Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
          offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?” Here the apostle seems
          plainly to refer to that declarative judgment of God concerning
          Abraham’s sincerity, manifested to him, for the peace and assurance of
          his own conscience, after his offering up Isaac his son on the altar,
          Gen. 22:12, “Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not
          withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.” But here it is plain, and
          expressed in the very words of justification or approbation, that this
          work of Abraham offering up his son on the altar, justified him as an
          evidence. When the apostle James says, we are justified by works, he
          may and ought to be understood in a sense agreeable to the instance he
          brings for the proof of it: but justification in that instance appears
          by the works of justification themselves, to be by works as an
          evidence. And where this instance of Abraham’s obedience is elsewhere
          mentioned, in the New Testament, it is mentioned as a fruit and
          evidence of his faith. Heb. 11:17, “By faith Abraham, when he was
          tried, offered up Isaac; and he that had received the promises,
          offered up his only-begotten son.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And in the other instance which the apostle mentions, Jam. 2:25.
          “Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she
          had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?” The
          apostle refers to a declarative judgment, in that particular testimony
          which was given of God’s approbation of her as a believer, in
          directing Joshua to save her when the rest of Jericho was destroyed,
          Jos. 6:25, “And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s
          household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto
          this day: because she hid the messengers which Joshua sent to spy out
          Jericho.” This was accepted as an evidence and expression of her
          faith. Heb. 11:31, “By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them
          that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.” The
          apostle in saying, “Was not Rahab the harlot justified by works?” by
          the manner of his speaking has reference to something in her history.
          But we have no account in her history of any other justification of
          her but this.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If, notwithstanding, any choose to take justification in St.
          James’s precisely as we do in Paul’s epistles, for God’s acceptance or
          approbation itself, and not any expression of that approbation, what
          has been already said concerning the manner in which acts of
          evangelical obedience are concerned in the affair of our
          justification, affords a very easy, clear, and full answer. For if we
          take works as acts or expressions of faith, they are not excluded. So
          a man is not justified by faith only, but also by works; i.e. he is
          not justified only by faith as a principle in the heart, or in its
          first and more immanent acts, but also by the effective acts of it in
          life, which are the expressions of the life of faith, as the
          operations and actions of the body are of the life of that; agreeable
          to Jam. 2:26.
        </p>
        <p>
          What has been said in answer to these objections, may also, I hope,
          abundantly serve for an answer to another objection, often made
          against this doctrine, viz. that it encourages licentiousness in life.
          For, from what has been said, we may see that the Scripture doctrine
          of justification by faith alone, without any manner of goodness or
          excellency of ours, does in no wise diminish either the necessity or
          benefit of a sincere evangelical universal obedience. Man’s salvation
          is not only indissolubly connected with obedience, and damnation with
          the want of it, in those who have opportunity for it, but depends upon
          it in many respects. It is the way to salvation, and the necessary
          preparation for it. Eternal blessings are bestowed in reward for it,
          and our justification in our own consciences and at the day of
          judgment depends on it, as the proper evidence of our acceptable
          state; and that even in accepting of us as entitled to life in our
          justification, God has respect to this, as that on which the fitness
          of such an act of justification depends: so that our salvation does as
          truly depend upon it, as if we were justified for the moral excellency
          of it. And besides all this, the degree of our happiness to all
          eternity is suspended on, and determined by, the degree of this. So
          that this gospel-scheme of justification is as far from encouraging
          licentiousness, and contains as much to encourage and excite to strict
          and universal obedience, and the utmost possible eminency of holiness,
          as any scheme that can be devised, and indeed unspeakably more.
        </p>
        <p>I come now to the</p>
        <p>
          V. And last thing proposed, which is, to consider the “importance of
          this doctrine.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I know there are many that make as though this controversy was of no
          great importance: that it is chiefly a matter of nice speculation,
          depending on certain subtle distinctions, which many that make use of
          them do not understand themselves: that the difference is not of such
          consequence as to be worth being zealous about: and that more hurt is
          done by raising disputes about it than good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed I am far from thinking that it is of absolute necessity that
          persons should understand, and be agreed upon, all the distinctions
          needful particularly to explain and defend this doctrine against all
          cavils and objections. Yet all Christians should strive after an
          increase of knowledge, and none should content themselves without some
          clear and distinct understanding in this point. But we should believe
          in the general, according to the clear and abundant revelations of
          God’s word, that it is none of our own excellency, virtue, or
          righteousness, that is the ground of our being received from a state
          of condemnation into a state of acceptance in God’s sight, but only
          Jesus Christ, and his righteousness and worthiness, received by faith.
          This I think to be of great importance, at least in application to
          ourselves, and that for the following reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the Scripture treats of this doctrine, as a doctrine of very
          great importance. That there is a certain doctrine of justification by
          faith, in opposition to justification by the works of the law, which
          the Apostle Paul insists upon as of the greatest importance, none will
          deny, because there is nothing in the Bible more apparent. The
          apostle, under the infallible conduct of the Spirit of God, thought it
          worth his most strenuous and zealous disputing about and defending. He
          speaks of the contrary doctrine as fatal and ruinous to the souls of
          men, in the latter end of the ninth chapter of Romans, and beginning
          of the tenth. He speaks of it as subversive of the gospel of Christ,
          and calls it another gospel, and says concerning it: if anyone,
          “though an angel from heaven, preach it, let him be accursed;” Gal.
          1:6-9 compared with the following part of the epistle. Certainly we
          must allow the apostles to be good judges of the importance and
          tendency of doctrines, at least the Holy Ghost in them. And doubtless
          we are safe, and in no danger of harshness and censoriousness, if we
          only follow him, and keep close to his express teachings, in what we
          believe and say of the hurtful and pernicious tendency of any error.
          Why are we to blame for saying what the Bible has taught us to say, or
          for believing what the Holy Ghost has taught us to that end that we
          might believe it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the adverse scheme lays another foundation of man’s salvation
          than God has laid. I do not now speak of that ineffectual redemption
          that they suppose to be universal, and what all mankind are equally
          the subjects of. But I say, it lays entirely another foundation of
          man’s actual, discriminating salvation, or that salvation, wherein
          true Christians differ from wicked men. We suppose the foundation of
          this to be Christ’s worthiness and righteousness. On the contrary,
          that scheme supposes it to be man’s own virtue, even so, that this is
          the ground of a saving interest in Christ itself. It takes away Christ
          out of the place of the bottom stone, and puts in men’s own virtue in
          the room of him, so that Christ himself in the affair of
          distinguishing, actual salvation, is laid upon this foundation. And
          the foundation being so different, I leave it to everyone to judge
          whether the difference between the two schemes consists only in
          punctilios of small consequence. The foundations being contrary, makes
          the whole scheme exceeding diverse and opposite: the one is a gospel
          scheme, the other a legal one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, it is in this doctrine that the most essential difference lies
          between the covenant of grace and the first covenant. The adverse
          scheme of justification supposes that we are justified by our works,
          in the very same sense wherein man was to have been justified by his
          works under the first covenant. By that covenant our first parents
          were not to have had eternal life given them for any proper merit in
          their obedience, because their perfect obedience was a debt that they
          owed God. Nor was it to be bestowed for any proportion between the
          dignity of their obedience, and the value of the reward, but only it
          was to be bestowed from a regard to a moral fitness in the virtue of
          their obedience, to the reward of God’s favor. A title to eternal life
          was to be given them, as a testimony of God’s pleasedness with their
          works, or his regard to the inherent beauty of their virtue. And so it
          is the very same way that those in the adverse scheme suppose that we
          are received into God’s special favor now, and to those saving
          benefits that are the testimonies of it. I am sensible the divines of
          that side entirely disclaim the popish doctrine of merit, and are free
          to speak of our utter unworthiness, and the great imperfection of all
          our services. But after all, it is our virtue, imperfect as it is,
          that recommends men to God, by which good men come to have a saving
          interest in Christ, and God’s favor, rather than others. These things
          are bestowed in testimony of God’s respect to their goodness. So that
          whether they will allow the term merit or no, yet they hold, that we
          are accepted by our own merit, in the same sense, though not in the
          same degree, as under the first covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the great and most distinguishing difference between that covenant
          and the covenant of grace is, that by the covenant of grace we are not
          thus justified by our own works, but only by faith in Jesus Christ. It
          is on this account chiefly that the new covenant deserves the name of
          a covenant of grace, as is evident by Rom. 4:16: “Therefore it is of
          faith, that it might be by grace.” And chap. 3:20, 24, “Therefore by
          the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight…
          Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in
          Jesus Christ.” And Rom. 11:6, “And if by grace, then it is no more of
          works; otherwise grace is no more grace: but if it be of works; then
          it is no more grace; otherwise work is no more work.” Gal. 5:4,
          “Whosoever of you are justified by the law, ye are fallen from grace.”
          And therefore the apostle, when in the same epistle to the Galatians,
          speaking of the doctrine of justification by works as another gospel,
          adds, “which is not another,” Gal. 1:6, 7. It is no gospel at all: it
          is law. It is no covenant of grace, but of works. It is not an
          evangelical, but a legal doctrine. Certainly that doctrine wherein
          consists the greatest and most essential difference between the
          covenant of grace and the first covenant, must be a doctrine of great
          importance. That doctrine of the gospel by which above all others it
          is worthy of the name gospel, is doubtless a very important doctrine
          of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, this is the main thing for which fallen men stood in need of
          divine revelation, to teach us how we who have sinned may come to be
          again accepted of God, or, which is the same thing, how the sinner may
          be justified. Something beyond the light of nature is necessary to
          salvation chiefly on this account. Mere natural reason afforded no
          means by which we could come to the knowledge of this: it depending on
          the sovereign pleasure of the Being that we had offended by sin. This
          seems to be the great drift of that revelation which God has given,
          and of all those mysteries it reveals, all those great doctrines that
          are peculiarly doctrines of revelation, and above the light of nature.
          It seems to have been very much on this account, that it was requisite
          that the doctrine of the Trinity itself should be revealed to us. That
          by a discovery of the concern of the several divine persons in the
          great affair of our salvation, we might the better understand and see
          how all our dependence in this affair is on God, and our sufficiency
          all in him, and not in ourselves: that he is all in all in this
          business, agreeable to 1 Cor. 1:29-31, “That no flesh should glory in
          his presence. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made
          unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
          that according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in
          the Lord.” What is the gospel, but only the glad tidings of a new way
          of acceptance with God unto life, a way wherein sinners may come to be
          free from the guilt of sin, and obtain a title to eternal life? And
          if, when this way is revealed, it is rejected, and another of man’s
          devising be put in the room of it, without doubt, it must be an error
          of great importance, and the apostle might well say it was another
          gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, the contrary scheme of justification derogates much from the
          honor of God and the Mediator. I have already shown how it diminishes
          the glory of the Mediator, in ascribing that to man’s virtue and
          goodness, which belongs alone to his worthiness and righteousness. By
          the apostle’s sense of the matter it renders Christ needless, Gal.
          5:4, “Christ is become of no effect to you, whosoever of you are
          justified by the law.” If that scheme of justification be followed in
          its consequences, it utterly overthrows the glory of all the great
          things that have been contrived, and done, and suffered in the work of
          redemption. Gal. 2:21, “If righteousness come by the law, Christ is
          dead in vain.” It has also been already shown how it diminishes the
          glory of divine grace (which is the attribute God has especially set
          himself to glorify in the work of redemption), and so that it greatly
          diminishes the obligation to gratitude in the sinner that is saved.
          Yea, in the sense of the apostle, it makes void the distinguishing
          grace of the gospel, Gal. 5:4, “Whosoever of you are justified by the
          law, are fallen from grace.” It diminishes the glory of the grace of
          God and the Redeemer, and proportionably magnifies man. It makes the
          goodness and excellency of fallen man to be something, which I have
          shown are nothing. I have also already shown, that it is contrary to
          the truth of God in the threatening of his holy law, to justify the
          sinner for his virtue. And whether it were contrary to God’s truth or
          no, it is a scheme of things very unworthy of God. It supposes that
          God, when about to lift up a poor, forlorn malefactor, condemned to
          eternal misery for sinning against his Majesty, and to make him
          unspeakably and eternally happy, by bestowing his Son and himself upon
          him, as it were, sets all this to sale, for the price of his virtue
          and excellency. I know that those we oppose acknowledge, that the
          price is very disproportionate to the benefit bestowed, and say, that
          God’s grace is wonderfully manifested in accepting so little virtue,
          and bestowing so glorious a reward for such imperfect righteousness.
          But seeing we are such infinitely sinful and abominable creatures in
          God’s sight, and by our infinite guilt have brought ourselves into
          such wretched and deplorable circumstances — and all our
          righteousnesses are nothing, and ten thousand times worse than nothing
          (if God looks upon them as they be in themselves — is it not immensely
          more worthy of the infinite majesty and glory of God, to deliver and
          make happy such wretched vagabonds and captives, without any money or
          price of theirs, or any manner of expectation of any excellency or
          virtue in them, in any wise to recommend them? Will it not betray a
          foolish, exalting opinion of ourselves, and a mean one of God, to have
          thought of offering anything of ours, to recommend us to the favor of
          being brought from wallowing, like filthy swine, in the mire of our
          sins, and from the enmity and misery of devils in the lowest hell, to
          the state of God’s dear children, in the everlasting arms of his love
          in heavenly glory, or to imagine that that is the constitution of God,
          that we should bring our filthy rags, and offer them to him as the
          price of this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth, the opposite scheme does most directly tend to lead men to
          trust in their own righteousness for justification, which is a thing
          fatal to the soul. This is what men are of themselves exceedingly
          prone to do (and that though they are never so much taught the
          contrary), through the partial and high thoughts they have of
          themselves, and their exceeding dullness of apprehending any such
          mystery as our being accepted for the righteousness of another. But
          this scheme does directly teach men to trust in their own
          righteousness for justification, in that it teaches them that this is
          indeed what they must be justified by, being the way of justification
          that God himself has appointed. So that if a man had naturally no
          disposition to trust in his own righteousness, yet if he embraced this
          scheme, and acted consistent with it, it would lead him to it. But
          that trusting in our own righteousness, is a thing fatal to the soul,
          is what the Scripture plainly teaches us. It tells us that it will
          cause that Christ shall profit us nothing, and be of no effect to us,
          Gal. 5:2-4. For though the apostle speaks there particularly of
          circumcision, yet it is not merely being circumcised, but trusting in
          circumcision as a righteousness, that the apostle has respect to. He
          could not mean that merely being circumcised would render Christ of no
          profit or effect to a person, for we read that he himself, for certain
          reasons, took Timothy and circumcised him, Acts 16:3. And the same is
          evident by the context, and by the rest of the epistle. And the
          apostle speaks of trusting in their own righteousness as fatal to the
          Jews, Rom 9:31, 32, “But Israel, which followed after the law of
          righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
          Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the
          works of the law; for they stumbled at that stumbling stone.” Together
          with Rom. 10:3, “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and
          going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted
          themselves unto the righteousness of God.” And this spoken of as fatal
          to the Pharisees, in the parable of the Pharisee and the publican,
          which Christ spoke to them in order to reprove them for trusting in
          themselves that they were righteous. The design of the parable is to
          show them, that the very publicans shall be justified, rather than
          they, as appears by the reflection Christ makes upon it, Luke 18:14,
          “I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the
          other;” that is, this and not the other. The fatal tendency of it
          might also be proved from its inconsistency with the nature of
          justifying faith, and with the nature of that humiliation that the
          Scripture often speaks of as absolutely necessary to salvation. But
          these Scriptures are so express, that it is needless to bring any
          further arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          How far a wonderful and mysterious agency of God’s Spirit may so
          influence some men’s hearts, that their practice in this regard may be
          contrary to their own principles, so that they shall not trust in
          their own righteousness, though they profess that men are justified by
          their own righteousness — or how far they may believe the doctrine of
          justification by men’s own righteousness in general, and yet not
          believe it in a particular application of it to themselves — or how
          far that error which they may have been led into by education, or
          cunning sophistry of others, may yet be indeed contrary to the
          prevailing disposition of their hearts, and contrary to their practice
          — or how far some may seem to maintain a doctrine contrary to this
          gospel doctrine of justification, that really do not, but only express
          themselves differently from others, or seem to oppose it through their
          misunderstanding of our expressions, or we of theirs, when indeed our
          real sentiments are the same in the main — or may seem to differ more
          than they do, by using terms that are without a precisely fixed and
          determinate meaning — or to be wide in their sentiments from this
          doctrine, for want of a distinct understanding of it: whose hearts, at
          the same time, entirely agree with it, and if once it was clearly
          explained to their understandings, would immediately close with it,
          and embrace it. How far these things may be, I will not determine, but
          am fully persuaded that great allowances are to be made on these and
          such like accounts, in innumerable instances. Though it is manifest
          from what has been said, that the teaching and propagating contrary
          doctrines and schemes, is of a pernicious and fatal tendency.
