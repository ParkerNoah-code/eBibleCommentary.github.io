          Ephesians 3:10, “To the intent that now unto the principalities and
          powers in heavenly places, might be known by the church the manifold
          wisdom of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle is speaking in the context of the glorious doctrine of the
          redemption of sinners by Jesus Christ; and how it was in a great
          measure kept hid in the past ages of the world. It was a mystery that
          before they did not understand, but now it was in a glorious manner
          brought to light (verse 3-5). — “By revelation he made known unto me
          the mystery (as I wrote afore in few words; whereby when ye read ye
          may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ), which in other
          ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed
          unto his holy apostles and prophets, by the spirit.” And (verse 8, 9)
          “Unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given,
          that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of
          Christ; and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery,
          which, from the beginning of the world, has been hid in God, who
          created all things by Jesus Christ.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And the apostle in the text informs us that what Christ had
          accomplished towards his church, the work of redemption, had not only
          in a great measure unveiled the mystery to the church in this world,
          but God had more clearly and fully opened it to the understanding even
          of the angels themselves, and that this was one end of God in it, to
          discover the glory of his wisdom to the angels. “To the intent that
          now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be
          known by the church the manifold wisdom of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          One end of revealing God’s counsels concerning the work of redemption,
          is making known God’s wisdom. It is called manifold wisdom because of
          the manifold glorious ends that are attained by it. The excellent
          designs, hereby accomplished, are very manifold. The wisdom of God in
          this is of vast extent. The contrivance is so manifold that one may
          spend an eternity in discovering more of the excellent ends and
          designs accomplished by it, and the multitude and vast variety of
          things that are, by divine contrivance, brought to conspire to the
          bringing about those ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may observe to whom it is that God would manifest this his wisdom,
          by revealing the mystery of our redemption; — and they are not only
          men, but the angels. “To the intent that now unto the principalities
          and powers in heavenly places might be known — the manifold wisdom of
          God.” The angels are often called principalities and powers because of
          the exalted dignity of their nature. The angels excel in strength and
          wisdom. Those who are the wise men of the earth are called princes in
          the style of the apostle. 1 Cor. 2:6, “Howbeit we speak wisdom among
          them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the
          princes of this world” — verse 8, “Which none of the princes of this
          world knew; for had they known it, they would not have crucified the
          Lord of glory.” So the angels are called principalities for their
          great wisdom. They may also be so called for the honor God has put
          upon them, in employing them as his ministers and instruments,
          wherewith he governs the world, and therefore are called thrones,
          dominions, and principalities, and powers, Col. 1:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are called principalities and powers in heavenly places, as
          distinguishing them from those that are in places of earthy power and
          dignity. The offices or places of dignity and power that the angels
          sustain, are not earthly, but heavenly. They are places of honor and
          power in the heavenly city and the heavenly kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          One end of God in revealing his design or contrivance for redemption,
          as he has so fully and gloriously done by Jesus Christ, is that the
          angels in heaven may behold the glory of his wisdom by it. Though they
          are such bright intelligencies, and do always behold the face of God
          the Father, and know so much; yet here is matter of instruction for
          them. Here they may see more of the diving wisdom than ever they had
          seen before. It was a new discovery of the wisdom of God to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The time when this display of the wisdom of God was especially made to
          the angels is when Christ introduced the gospel-dispensation, implied
          in those words, “To the intent that now unto the principalities,” etc.
          When Christ came into the world and died, and actually performed the
          work of redemption — when he had fully and plainly revealed the
          counsels of God concerning it; and accordingly introduced the
          evangelical dispensation, and erected the gospel-church — then the
          angels understood more of the mystery of man’s redemption, and the
          manifold designs and counsels of divine wisdom, then ever they had
          done before.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the foregoing verse the apostle, after speaking of revealing this
          wisdom of God to man, “And to make all men see, what is the fellowship
          of this mystery,” etc. speaks of this mystery as a thing from the
          beginning kept hid till now, “The mystery, which from the beginning of
          the world had been hid in God — that now,” etc. In this verse he
          mentions another end, viz. that he may, at the same time, make the
          angels also see God’s wisdom in his glorious scheme of redemption. —
          “Now at this time,” implies that it was before a mystery kept hid from
          them in comparison of what it is now. And here is room enough for the
          angels to discover more and more to all eternity of the wisdom of God
          in this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe the medium by which the angels come by this knowledge, viz.
          the church — “That now unto principalities — might be known by the
          church,” — i.e. by the things they see done in the church, or towards
          the church. and by what they see concerning the church. So has it
          pleased the sovereign God, that the angels should have the most
          glorious discoveries of divine wisdom by his doings towards his
          church, a sort of beings much inferior to themselves. It has pleased
          God to put this honor upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wisdom appearing in the way of salvation by Jesus Christ is far
          above the wisdom of the angels. For here it is mentioned as one end of
          God in revealing the contrivance of our salvation, that the angels
          thereby might see and know how great and manifold the wisdom of God
          is, to hold forth the divine wisdom to the angels’ view and
          admiration. But why is it so, if this wisdom be not higher than their
          own wisdom? It never would have been mentioned as one end of revealing
          the contrivance of redemption, that the angels might see how manifold
          God’s wisdom is, if all the wisdom to be seen in it was no greater
          than their own. It is mentioned as a wisdom such as they had never
          seen before, not in God, much less in themselves. That now might be
          known how manifold the wisdom of God is, now, four thousand years
          since the creation. — In all that time the angels had always beheld
          the face of God, and had been studying God’s works of creation. Yet
          they never, till that day, had seen anything like that; never knew how
          manifold God’s wisdom is, as now they knew it by the church.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>Wonderful things done, by which salvation is procured.</p>
        <p>
          SUCH is the choice of the person chosen to be our redeemer, — the
          substituting of him in our room, — his incarnation — his life — his
          death — and exaltation. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We will consider the choice of the person to be our redeemer. When
          God designed the redemption of mankind, his great wisdom appears in
          that he pitched upon his own, his only-begotten, Son, to be the person
          to perform the work. He was a redeemer of God’s own choosing, and
          therefore he is called in Scripture, God’s elect (Isa. 42:1). The
          wisdom of choosing this person to be the redeemer, appears in his
          being every way a fit person for this undertaking. It was necessary
          that the person that is the redeemer should be a divine person. — None
          but a divine person was sufficient for this great work. The work is
          infinitely unequal to any creature. It was requisite that the redeemer
          of sinners should be himself infinitely holy. None could take away the
          infinite evil of sin, but one that infinitely far from and contrary to
          sin himself. Christ is a fit person upon this account.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was requisite that the person, in order to be sufficient for this
          undertaking, should be one of infinite dignity and worthiness, that he
          might be capable of meriting infinite blessings. The Son of God is a
          fit person on this account. It was necessary, that he should be a
          person of infinite power and wisdom. For this work is so difficult
          that it requires such an one. Christ is a fit person also upon this
          account. It was requisite that he should be a person infinitely dear
          to God the father, in order to give an infinite value to his
          transactions in the Father’s esteem, and that the Father’s love to him
          might balance the offense and provocation by our sins. Christ is a fit
          person upon this account. Therefore called the beloved (Eph. 1:6), He
          has made us accepted in the beloved.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was requisite, that the person should be one that could act in this
          as of his own absolute right: one that, in himself, is not a servant
          or subject. Because, if he is one that cannot act of his own right, he
          cannot merit anything. He that is a servant, and that can do no more
          than he is bound to do, cannot merit. And then he that has nothing
          that is absolutely his own, cannot pay any price to redeem another.
          Upon this account Christ is a fit person. And none but a divine person
          can be fit. — And he must be a person also of infinite mercy and love.
          For no other person but such an one would undertake a work so
          difficult, for a creature so unworthy as man. Upon this account also
          Christ is a fit person. — It was requisite that he should be a person
          of unchangeable perfect truth and faithfulness. Otherwise he would not
          be fit to be depended on by us in so great an affair. Christ is also a
          fit person upon this account.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wisdom of God in choosing his eternal Son, appears, not only in
          that he is a fit person; but in that he was the only fit person of all
          persons, whether created or uncreated. No created person, neither man
          nor angel, was fit for this undertaking. For we have just now shown
          that he must be a person of infinite holiness — dignity — power —
          wisdom, infinitely dear to God — of infinite love and mercy; and one
          that may act of his own absolute right. But no creature, how excellent
          soever, has any one of these qualifications. — There are three
          uncreated persons of the Trinity, The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And
          Christ alone of these was a suitable person for a redeemer. It was not
          meet, that the redeemer should be God the Father. Because he, in the
          divine economy of the persons of the Trinity, was the person that
          holds the rights of the God-head, and so was the person offended,
          whose justice required satisfaction; and was to be appeased by a
          mediator. It was not meet it should be the Holy Ghost, for in being
          mediator between the Father and the saints, he is in some sense so
          between the Father and the Spirit. The saints, in all their spiritual
          transactions with God, act by the Spirit; or rather, it is the Spirit
          of God that acts in them. They are the temples of the Holy Ghost. The
          Holy Spirit dwelling in them is their principle of action, in all
          their transactings with God. But in these spiritual transactings with
          God, they act by a mediator. These spiritual and holy exercises cannot
          be acceptable, or avail anything with God, as from a fallen creature,
          but by a mediator. Therefore Christ, in being mediator between the
          Father and the saints, may be said to be mediator between the Father
          and the Holy Spirit, that acts in the saints. And therefore it was
          meet, that the mediator should not be either the Father or the Spirit,
          but a middle person between them both. It is the Spirit in the saints,
          that seeks the blessing of God, by faith and prayer, and, as the
          apostle says, with groanings that cannot be uttered (Rom. 8:26)
          “Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not
          what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
          intercession for us, with groanings that cannot be uttered.” The
          Spirit in the saints seeks divine blessings of God by and through a
          mediator. And therefore that mediator must not be the Spirit, but
          another person.
        </p>
        <p>
          It shows a divine wisdom, to know that he was a fit person. No other
          but one of divine wisdom could have known it. None but one of infinite
          wisdom could have thought of him to be a redeemer of sinners. For he,
          as he is God, is one of the persons offended by sin, against whom man
          by his sin had rebelled. Who but God infinitely wise could ever have
          thought of him to be a redeemer of sinners; against whom they had
          sinned, to whom they were enemies, and of whom they deserved
          infinitely ill? Who would ever have thought of him as one that should
          set his heart upon man, and exercise infinite love and pity to him and
          exhibit infinite wisdom, power, and merit in redeeming him? We
          proceed,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. To consider the substituting of this person in our room. After
          choosing the person to be our redeemer, the next step of divine wisdom
          is, to contrive the way how he should perform this work. If God had
          declared who the person was that should do this work and had gone no
          further, no creature could have thought which way this person could
          have performed the work. If God had told them that his own Son must be
          the redeemer, and that he alone was a fit person for the work, and
          that he was a person every way fit and sufficient for it, — but had
          proposed to them to contrive a way how this fit and sufficient person
          should proceed, — we may well suppose that all created understandings
          would have been utterly at a loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing necessary to be done is that this Son of God should
          become our representative and surety. And so be substituted in the
          sinner’s room. But who of created intelligences would have thought of
          any such thing as the eternal and infinitely beloved Son of God being
          substituted in the room of sinners? his standing in stead of a sinner,
          a rebel, an object of the wrath of God? Who would have thought of a
          person of infinite glory representing sinful worms, that had made
          themselves by sin infinitely provoking and abominable?
        </p>
        <p>
          For if the Son of God be substituted in the sinner’s room, then his
          sin must be charged upon him. He will thereby take the guilt of the
          sinner upon himself. He must be subject to the same law that man was,
          both as to the commands, and threatenings. But who would have thought
          of any such thing concerning the Son of God? But we proceed,
        </p>
        <p>
          III. To consider the incarnation Of Jesus Christ. The next step of
          divine wisdom in contriving how Christ should perform the work of
          redeeming sinners, was in determining his incarnation. Suppose God had
          revealed his counsels thus far to created understandings, that his own
          Son was the person chosen for this work, that he had substituted him
          in the sinner’s obligations and guilt on himself — and had revealed no
          more, but had left the rest to them to find out. It is no way probable
          that even then they could ever have thought of a way, whereby this
          person might actually have performed the work of redemption. For if
          the Son of God be substituted in the sinner’s stead, then he takes the
          sinners’ obligations on himself. For instance, he must take the
          obligation the sinner is under to perform perfect obedience to the
          divine law. But it is not probable, that any creature could have
          conceived how that could be possible. — How should a person who is the
          eternal JEHOVAH, become a servant, be under law, and perform obedience
          even to the law of man?
        </p>
        <p>
          And again, if the Son of God be substituted in the sinner’s stead,
          then he comes under the sinner’s obligation to suffer the punishment
          which man’s sin had deserved. And who could have thought that to be
          possible? For how should a divine person, who is essentially,
          unchangeably, and infinitely happy, suffer pain and torment? And how
          should he who is the object of God’s infinitely dear love, suffer the
          wrath of his Father? It is not to be supposed, that created wisdom
          ever would have found out a way how to have got over these
          difficulties. But divine wisdom has found out a way, viz. by the
          incarnation of the Son of God. That the Word should be made flesh,
          that he might be both God and man, in one person. What created
          understanding could have conceived that such a thing was possible? Yet
          these things could never be proved to be impossible. This distinction
          duly considered will show the futility of many Socinian objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if God had revealed to them that it was possible and even that it
          should be, but left them to find out how it should be, we may well
          suppose that they would all have been puzzled and confounded to
          conceive of a way for so uniting a man to the eternal Son of God, that
          they should be but one person, that one who is truly a man in all
          respects, should indeed be the very same Son of God that was with God
          from all eternity. This is a great mystery to us. Hereby, a person
          that is infinite, omnipotent, and unchangeable, is become, in a sense,
          a finite, a feeble man, a man subject to our sinless infirmities,
          passions, and calamities! The great God, the sovereign of heaven and
          earth, is thus become a worm of the dust. (Psa. 22:6) “I am a worm,
          and no man.” He that is eternal and self-existent, and all-sufficient,
          now is come to stand in need of food and clothing. He becomes poor,
          “has not where to lay his head; — stands in need of the charity of
          men, and is maintained by it! It is far above us, to conceive how it
          is done. It is a great wonder and mystery to us. But it was no mystery
          to divine wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The next thing to be considered is the life of Christ in this
          world. The wisdom of God appears in the circumstances of his life —
          and in the work and business of his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the circumstances of his life. If God had revealed that his own
          Son should be incarnate, and should live in this world in the human
          nature, and it had been left to men to determine what circumstances of
          life would have been most suitable for him, human wisdom would have
          determined, that he should appear in the world in a most magnificent
          manner, with very extraordinary outward ensigns of honor, authority,
          and power, far above any of the kings of the earth. That here he
          should reign in great visible pomp and splendor over all nations. —
          And thus it was that men’s wisdom did determine, before Christ came.
          The wise, the great men among the Jews, scribes and Pharisees, who are
          called “Princes of this world,” did expect the Messiah would thus
          appear. But the wisdom of God chose quite otherwise. It chose that
          when the Son of God became man, he should begin his life in a stable,
          for many years dwell obscurely in a family of low degree in the world,
          and be in low outward circumstances, that he should be poor, and not
          have where to lay his head, that he should be maintained by the
          charity of some of his disciples, that he should “Grow up as a tender
          plant, and as a root out of a dry ground,” (Isa. 53:2). “That he
          should not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the
          streets,” (Isa. 42:2). That he should come to Zion in a lowly manner,
          “riding on an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.” — “That he should
          be despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with
          grief.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And now the divine determination in this matter is made known, we may
          safely conclude that it is far the most suitable, and that it would
          not have been at all suitable for God, when he was manifest in flesh,
          to appear with earthly pomp, wealth, and grandeur. No! these things
          are infinitely too mean and despicable for the Son of God to show as
          if he affected or esteemed them. Men, if they had this way proposed to
          them, would have been ready to condemn it, as foolish and very
          unsuitable for the Son of God. “But the foolishness of God is wiser
          than men,” (1 Cor. 1:25). “And God hath brought to nought the wisdom
          of this world, and the princes of this world,” (1 Cor. 2:6). Christ,
          by thus appearing in mean and low outward circumstances in the world,
          has poured contempt upon all worldly wealth and glory, and has taught
          us to despise it. And if it becomes mean men to despise them, how much
          more did it become the Son of God! And then Christ hereby has taught
          us to be lowly in heart. If he who was infinitely high and great, was
          thus lowly, how lowly should we be, who are indeed so vile!
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the wisdom of God appears in the work and business of the life
          of Christ. Particularly , that he should perfectly obey the law of
          God, under such great temptations, that he should have conflicts with,
          and overcome, for us, in a way of obedience, the powers of earth and
          hell, that he should be subject to, not only the moral law, but the
          ceremonial also, that heavy yoke of bondage. Christ went through the
          time of his public ministry, in delivering to us divine instructions
          and doctrines. The wisdom of God appears in giving us such a one to be
          our prophet and teacher, who is a divine person, who in himself the
          very wisdom and Word of God; and was from all eternity in the bosom of
          the Father. His word is of greater authority and weight than if
          delivered by the mouth of an ordinary prophet. And how wisely ordered
          that the same should be our teacher and Redeemer, in order that his
          relations and offices, as Redeemer, might the more sweeten and endear
          his instructions to us. We are ready to give heed to what is said by
          those who are dear to us. Our love to their persons makes us to
          delight in their discourse. It is therefore wisely ordered, that he
          who has done so much to endear himself to us, should be appointed our
          great prophet, to deliver to us divine doctrines.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The next thing to be considered is the death of Christ. This is a
          means of salvation for poor sinners, that no other but divine wisdom
          would have pitched upon. And when revealed, it was doubtless greatly
          to the surprise of all the hosts of heaven, and they never will cease
          to wonder at it. How astonishing is it, that a person who is blessed
          forever, and is infinitely and essentially happy, should endure the
          greatest sufferings that ever were endured on earth! That a person who
          is the supreme Lord and judge of the world, should be arraigned, and
          should stand at the judgment-seat of mortal worms, and then be
          condemned. That a person who is the living God, and the fountain of
          life, should be put to death. That a person who created the world, and
          gives life to all his creatures, should be put to death by his own
          creatures. That a person of infinite majesty and glory, and so the
          object of love, praises, and adorations of angels, should be mocked
          and spit upon by the vilest of men. That a person, infinitely good,
          and who is love itself, should suffer the greatest cruelty. That a
          person who is infinitely beloved of the Father, should be put to
          inexpressible anguish under his own Father’s wrath. That he who is
          King of heaven, who has heaven for his throne, and the earth for his
          footstool, should be buried in the prison of the grave. How wonderful
          is this! And yet this is the way that God’s wisdom has fixed upon, as
          the way of sinner’s salvation, as neither unsuitable nor dishonorable
          to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The last thing done to procure salvation for sinners is Christ’s
          exaltation. Divine wisdom saw it needful, or most expedient, that the
          same person who died upon the cross, should sit at his right hand, on
          his own throne, as supreme Governor of the world, and should have
          particularly the absolute disposal of all things relating to man’s
          salvation, and should be the judge of the world. This was needful,
          because it was requisite that the same person who purchased salvation,
          should have the bestowing of it. For it is not fit, that God should at
          all transact with the fallen creature in a way of mercy, but by a
          mediator. And this is exceedingly for the strengthening of the faith
          and comfort of the saints, that he who has endured so much to purchase
          salvation for them, has all things in heaven and in delivered unto
          him, that he might bestow eternal life on them for whom he purchased
          it. And that the same person that loved them so greatly as to shed his
          precious blood for them, was to be their final judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          This then was another thing full of wonders, that he who was man as
          well as God, he who was a servant, and died like a malefactor; should
          be made the sovereign Lord of heaven and earth, angels and men, the
          absolute disposer of eternal life and death, the supreme judge of all
          created intelligent beings, for eternity: and should have committed to
          him all the governing power of God the Father. And that, not only as
          God, but as God-man, not exclusive of the human nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          As it is wonderful, that a person who is truly divine should be
          humbled so as to become a servant, and to suffer as a malefactor, so
          it is in like manner wonderful that he who is God-man, not exclusive
          of the manhood, should be exalted to the power and honor of the great
          God of heaven and earth. But such wonders as these has infinite wisdom
          contrived, and accomplished in order to our salvation.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>In this way of salvation God is greatly glorified.</p>
        <p>
          GOD has greatly glorified himself in the work of creation and
          providence. All his works praise him, and his glory shines brightly
          from them all. But as some stars differ from others in glory, so the
          glory of God shines brighter in some of his works than in others. And
          amongst all these, the work of redemption is like the sun in his
          strength. The glory of the author is abundantly the most resplendent
          in this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Each attribute of God is glorified in the work or redemption. How
          God has exceedingly glorified his wisdom, may more fully appear before
          we have done with this subject. But more particularly,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, God has exceedingly glorified his power in this work. — It
          shows the great and inconceivable power of God to unite natures so
          infinitely different, as the divine and human nature, in one person.
          If God can make one who is truly God, and one that is truly man, the
          self-same person, what is it that he cannot do? This is a greater and
          more marvelous work than creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The power of God most gloriously appears in man’s being actually saved
          and redeemed in this way. In his being bought out of a state of sin
          and misery, into a conformity to God, and at last to the full and
          perfect enjoyment of God. This is a more glorious demonstration of
          divine power, than creating things out of nothing, upon two accounts.
          One is, the effect is greater and more excellent. To produce the new
          creature is a more glorious effect, than merely to produce a creature.
          — Making a holy creature, a creature in the spiritual image of God, in
          the image of the divine excellencies, and a partaker of the divine
          nature — is a greater effect than merely to give being. And therefore
          as the effect is greater, it is a more glorious manifestation of
          power.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, in this effect of the actual redemption of sinners, the term
          from which, is more distant from the term to which, than in the work
          of creation. The term from which, in the work of creation, is nothing,
          and the term to which, is being. But the term from which, in the work
          of redemption, is a state infinitely worse than nothing; and the term
          to which, a holy and a happy being, a state infinitely better than
          mere being. The terms in the production of the last are much more
          remote from one another, than in the first.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then the production of this last effect is a more glorious
          manifestation of power than the work of creation, the terms are very
          distant — as nothing is very remote from being — yet there is no
          opposition to the creating power of God. — But in redemption, the
          divine power meets with and overcomes great opposition. There is great
          opposition in a state of sin to a state of grace. Men’s lusts and
          corruptions are exceedingly opposite to grace and holiness, and
          greatly resist the production of the effect. But this opposition is
          completely overcome in actual redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, there is the great opposition from Satan. The power of God is
          very glorious in this work because it therein conquers the strongest
          and most powerful enemies. Power never appears more illustrious than
          in conquering. Jesus Christ, in this work, conquers and triumphs over
          thousands of devils, strong and mighty spirits, uniting all their
          strength against him. Luke 11:21, “When a strong man armed keepeth his
          palace, his goods are in peace, but when a stronger than he shall
          overcome him, he taketh from his all his armour wherein he trusted,
          and divideth his spoil.” Col. 2:15, “And having spoiled principalities
          and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in the
          cross.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the justice of God is exceedingly glorified in this work. God
          is so strictly and immutably just, that he would not spare his beloved
          Son when he took upon him the guilt of men’s sins, and was substituted
          in the room of sinners. He would not abate him the least mite of that
          debt which justice demanded. Justice should take place, though it cost
          his infinitely dear Son his precious blood, and his enduring such
          extraordinary reproach, and pain, and death in its most dreadful form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, the holiness of God is also exceedingly glorious in this work.
          Never did God so manifest his hatred of sin as in the death and
          sufferings of his only-begotten Son. Hereby he showed himself
          unappeasable to sin, and that it was impossible for him to be at peace
          with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, God has also exceedingly glorified his truth in this way, both
          in his threatenings and promises. Herein is fulfilled the threatenings
          of the law, wherein God said, “In the day thou eatest thereof thou
          shalt surely die. And cursed is every one that continueth not in all
          things written in the book of the law to do them.” God showed hereby,
          that not only heaven and earth should pass away, but, which is more,
          that the blood of him who is the eternal Jehovah should be spilt,
          rather than one jot or tittle of his word should fail, till all be
          fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, and lastly, God has exceedingly glorified his mercy and love in
          this work. The mercy of God was an attribute never seen before in its
          exercises, till it was seen in this work of redemption, or the fruits
          of it. The goodness of God appeared towards the angels in giving them
          being and blessedness. It appeared glorious towards man in his
          primitive state, a state of holiness and happiness. But now God has
          shown that he can find in his heart to love sinners, who deserve his
          infinite hatred. And not only has he shown that he can love them, but
          love them so as to give them more and do greater things for them than
          ever he did for the holy angels, that never sinned nor offended their
          Creator. He loved sinful men so as to give them a greater gift than
          ever he gave the angels; so as to give his own Son, and not only to
          give him to be their possession and enjoyment, but to give him to be
          their sacrifice. And herein he has done more for them than if he had
          given them all the visible world; yea, more than if he had given them
          all the angels, and all heaven besides. God has loved them so, that
          hereby he purchased for them deliverance from eternal misery, and the
          possession of immortal glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Each person of the Trinity is exceedingly glorified in this work.
          Herein the work of redemption is distinguished from all the other
          works of God. The attributes of God are glorious in his other works.
          But the three persons of the Trinity are distinctly glorified in no
          work as in this of redemption. In this work every distinct person has
          his distinct parts and offices assigned him. Each one has his
          particular and distinct concern in it, agreeable to their distinct,
          personal properties, relations, and economical offices. The redeemed
          have an equal concern with and dependence upon each person, in this
          affair, and owe equal honor and praise to each of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Father appoints and provides the Redeemer, and accepts the price
          of redemption. The Son is the Redeemer and the price. He redeems by
          offering up himself. The Holy Ghost immediately communicates to us the
          thing purchased. Yea, and he is the good purchased. The sum of what
          Christ purchased for us is holiness and happiness. But the Holy Ghost
          is the great principle both of all holiness and happiness. The Holy
          Ghost is the sum of all that Christ purchased for men. Gal. 3:13, 14,
          “He was made a curse for us, that we might receive the promise of The
          Spirit, through faith.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The blessedness of the redeemed consists in partaking of Christ’s
          fullness, which consists in partaking of that Spirit, which is given
          not by measure unto him. This is the oil that was poured upon the head
          of the church, which ran down to the members of his body, to the
          skirts of his garment. Thus we have an equal concern with and
          dependence upon each of the persons of the Trinity, distinctly; upon
          the Father, as he provides the Redeemer, and the person of whom the
          purchase is made, — the Son as the purchaser, and the price, — the
          Holy Ghost, as the good purchased.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>
          The good attained by salvation is wonderfully various and exceeding
          great.
        </p>
        <p>
          HERE we may distinctly consider — the variety — and the greatness — of
          the good procured for men.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The good procured by salvation is wonderfully various. Here are all
          sorts of good procured for fallen man, that he does or can really
          need, or is capable of. The wisdom of God appears in the way of
          salvation, in that it is most worthy of an infinitely wise God,
          because every way perfect and sufficient. We, in our fallen state, are
          most necessitous creatures, full of wants: but they are here all
          answered. Every sort of good is here procured, whatever would really
          contribute to our happiness, and even many things that we could not
          have thought of, had not Christ purchased them for us, and revealed
          them to us. Every demand of our circumstances, and craving of our
          natures, is here exactly answered. For instance,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we stand in need of peace with God. We had provoked God to
          anger, his wrath abode upon us, and we needed to have it appeased.
          This is done for us in this way of salvation. For Christ, by shedding
          his blood, has fully satisfied justice, and appeased God’s wrath, for
          all that shall believe in him. By the sentence of the law we were
          condemned to hell. And we needed to have our sins pardoned that we
          might be delivered from hell. But in this work, pardon of sin and
          deliverance from hell, is fully purchased for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, we needed not only to have God’s wrath appeased and our sins
          pardoned, but we needed to have the favor of God. To have God, not
          only not our enemy, but our friend. Now God’s favor is purchased for
          us by the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, we needed not only to be delivered from hell, but to have some
          satisfying happiness bestowed. Man has a natural craving and thirst
          after happiness. And [he] will thirst and crave, till his capacity is
          filled. And his capacity is of vast extent. And nothing but an
          infinite good can fill and satisfy his desires. But, notwithstanding,
          provision is made in this way of salvation to answer those needed,
          there is a satisfying happiness purchased for us, that which is fully
          answerable to the capacity and cravings our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is food procured to answer all the appetites and faculties of our
          souls. God has made the soul of man of a spiritual nature. And
          therefore he needs a corresponding happiness, some spiritual object,
          in the enjoyment of which he may be happy. Christ has purchased the
          enjoyment of God, who is the great and original Spirit, as the portion
          of our souls. And he has purchased the Spirit of God to come and dwell
          in us as an eternal principle of happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          God has made man a rational, intelligent creature. And man needs some
          good that shall be a suitable object of his understanding for him to
          contemplate, wherein he may have full and sufficient exercise for his
          capacious faculties, in their utmost extent. Here is an object that is
          great and noble, and worthy of the exercise of the noblest faculties
          of the rational soul. — God himself should be theirs, for them forever
          to behold and contemplate. His glorious perfections and works are most
          worthy objects. And there is room enough for improving them, and still
          to exercise their faculties to all eternity. — What object can be more
          worthy to exercise the understanding of a rational soul, than the
          glories of the Divine Being, with which the heavenly intelligences,
          and even the infinite understanding of God himself is entertained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our souls need some good that shall be a suitable object of the will
          and affections, a suitable object for the choice, the acquiescence,
          the love, and the joy of the rational soul. Provision is made for this
          also in this way of salvation. There is an infinitely excellent Being
          offered to be chosen, to be rested in, to be loved, to be rejoiced in,
          by us, even God himself, who is infinitely lovely, the fountain of all
          good; a fountain that can never be exhausted, where we can be in no
          danger of going to excess in our love and joy. And here we may be
          assured ever to find our joy and delight in enjoyments answerable to
          our love and desires.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, there is all possible enjoyment of this object procured in
          this way of salvation. When persons entirely set their love upon
          another, they naturally desire to see that person. Merely to hear of
          the person, does not satisfy love. So here is provision made that we
          should see God, the object of our supreme love. Not only that we
          should hear and read of him in his word, but that we should see him
          with a spiritual eye here. And not only so, but that we should have
          the satisfaction of seeing God face to face hereafter. This is
          promised Mat. 5:8, “Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see
          God.” It is promised that we shall not see God, as through a glass
          darkly, as we do now, but face to face, 1 Cor. 13:12. That we shall
          see Christ as He is, 1 John 3:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          We naturally desire not only to see those whom we love, but to
          converse with them. Provision is made for this also, that we should
          have spiritual conversation with God while in this world, and that we
          should be hereafter admitted to converse with Christ in the most
          intimate manner possible. Provision is made in this way of salvation,
          that we should converse with God much more intimately than otherwise
          it would have been possible for us. For now Christ is incarnate, is in
          our nature. He is become one of us, whereby we are under advantages
          for an immensely more free and intimate converse with him, than could
          have been, if he had remained only in the divine nature, and so in a
          nature infinitely distant from us. — We naturally desire not only to
          converse with those whom we greatly love, but to dwell with them.
          Provision, through Christ, is made for this. It is purchased and
          provided that we should dwell with God in his own house in heaven,
          which is called our Father’s house. — To dwell forever in God’s
          presence, and at his right hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          We naturally desire to have a right in that person whom we greatly
          love. Provision is made, in this way of salvation, that we should have
          a right in God; a right to Him. This is the promise of the covenant of
          grace, “That he will be our God.” God, with all his glorious
          perfections and attributes, with all his power and wisdom, and with
          all his majesty and glory, will be ours. So that we may call him our
          inheritance, and the portion of our souls. What we can humbly claim by
          faith, having this portion made over to us by a firm instrument, by a
          covenant ordered in all things and sure. — And we may also hereby
          claim a right to Jesus Christ. Love desires that the right should be
          mutual. The lover desires, not only to have a right to the beloved,
          but that the beloved should also have a right to him. He desires to be
          his beloved’s, as well as his beloved should be his. Provision is also
          made for this, in this wise method of salvation, that God should have
          a special propriety in the redeemed, that they should be in a
          distinguishing manner his, that they should be his peculiar people. We
          are told that God sets apart the godly for himself, Psa. 4:3. They are
          called God’s jewels. The spouse speaks it with great satisfaction and
          rejoicing. Song 2:16, “My beloved is mine, and I am His.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Love desires to stand in some near relation to the beloved. Provision
          is made by Christ, that we should stand in the nearest possible
          relation to God, that he should be our Father, and we should be his
          children. We are often instructed in the Holy Scriptures, that God is
          the Father of believers, and that they are his family. — And not only
          so, but they stand in the nearest relation to Christ Jesus. There is
          the closest union possible. The souls of believers are married to
          Christ. The church is the bride, the Lamb’s wife. Yea, there is yet a
          nearer similitude. Believers are as the very members of Christ, and of
          his flesh and of his bones, Eph. 5:30. Yea, this is not near enough
          yet, but they are one spirit, 1 Cor. 6:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          Love naturally inclines to a conformity to the beloved. To have those
          excellencies, upon the account of which he is beloved, copied in
          himself. Provision is made in this way of salvation, that we may be
          conformed to God; that we shall be transformed into the same image. 2
          Cor. 3:18, “We all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory
          of the Lord, are changed into the same image form glory to glory.” —
          And that hereafter we shall see him as he is, and be like him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the natural desire of love to do something for the beloved,
          either for his pleasure or honor. Provision is made for this also, in
          this way of salvation, that we should be made instruments of
          glorifying God, and promoting his kingdom here, and of glorifying him
          to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, in this way of salvation, provision is made for our having
          every sort of good that man naturally craves, as honor, wealth, and
          pleasure. — Here is provision made that we should be brought to the
          highest honor. This is what God has promised, that those that honor
          him, he will honor. And that true Christians shall be kings and priest
          unto God. — Christ promised, that as his Father has appointed unto him
          a kingdom, so he will appoint unto them, that they may eat and drink
          at his table in his kingdom. He has promised to crown them with a
          crown of glory, and that they shall sit with him in his throne. That
          he will confess their names before his Father, and before his angels.
          That he will give them a new name; and that they shall walk with him
          in white.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ has also purchased for them the greatest wealth. All those that
          are in Christ are rich. They are now rich. They have the best riches,
          being rich in faith, and the graces of the Spirit of God. They have
          gold tried in the fire. They have durable riches and righteousness.
          They have treasure in heaven, where neither thief approaches, nor moth
          corrupts. An inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and fadeth not
          away. They are possessors of all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ has also purchased pleasure for them, pleasures that are
          immensely preferable to all the pleasures of sense, most exquisitely
          sweet, and satisfying. He has purchased for them fullness of joy, and
          pleasures forevermore at God’s right hand. And they shall drink of the
          river of God’s pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth, Christ has purchased all needed good both for soul and body.
          While we are here, we stand in need of these earthly thing. And of
          these Christ has purchased all that are best for us. He has purchased
          for the body that God should feed and clothe us. Mat. 6:26, “How much
          more shall he feed you, O ye of little faith!” How much more shall he
          clothe you! Christ has purchased, that God should take care of us, and
          provide what is needed of these things, as a father provides for his
          children. 1 Pet. 5:7, “Casting your care upon him, for he careth for
          you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventh, Christ has purchased good that is suitable for his people in
          all conditions. There is, in this way of salvation, respect had to,
          and provision made for, all circumstances that they can be in. Here is
          provision made, for a time of affliction — for a time of poverty and
          pinching want — for a time of bereavement and mourning — for spiritual
          darkness — for a day of temptation — for a time of persecution — and
          for a time of death. Here is such a provision made that is sufficient
          to carry a person above death, and all it terrors, and to give him a
          complete triumph over that king of terrors. Here is enough to sweeten
          the grave, and make it cease to seem desirable, and in its near
          approach to be not terrible but joyful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eighth, there is provision made in this way of salvation for the life
          and blessedness of soul and body to all eternity. Christ has
          purchased, that we should be delivered from a state of temporal death,
          as well as spiritual and eternal. The bodies of the saints shall be
          raised to life. He has purchased all manner of perfection for the body
          of which it is capable. It shall be raised a spiritual body in
          incorruption and glory, and be made like Christ’s glorious body, to
          shine as the sun in the kingdom of his Father, and to exist in a
          glorified state in union with the soul to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ninth, but man in his fallen state still needs something else in order
          to his happiness, that these fore-mentioned blessings should be
          purchased for him, viz.. he needs to be qualified for the possession
          and enjoyment of them. In order to our having a title to these
          blessings of the covenant of grace (so that we can scripturally claim
          an interest in them), there is a certain condition must be performed
          by us. We must believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and accept of him as
          offered in the gospel for a Savior. But, as we cannot do this of
          ourselves, Christ has purchased this also for all the elect. He has
          purchased, that they shall have faith given them, whereby they shall
          be (actively) united to Christ, and so have a (pleadable) title to his
          benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          But still something further is necessary for man, in order to his
          coming to the actual possession of the inheritance. A man, as soon as
          he has believed, has a title to the inheritance. But in order to come
          to the actual possession of it, he must persevere in a way of
          holiness. There is not only a gate that must be entered, but there is
          a narrow way that must be traveled before we can arrive at heavenly
          blessedness. And that is a way of universal and persevering holiness.
          But men, after they have believed, cannot persevere in a way of
          holiness of themselves. But there is sufficient provision made for
          this also, in the way of salvation by Jesus Christ. The matter of a
          saint’s perseverance is sufficiently secured by the purchase that
          Christ has made.
        </p>
        <p>
          But still there is something else needful in order to qualify a person
          for the actual entering upon the enjoyments and employments of a
          glorified estate, viz. that he should be made perfectly holy; that all
          remainders of sin should be taken away. For there cannot any sin enter
          into heaven. No soul must go into the glorious presence of God, with
          the least degree of the filth of sin. But there is provision made. For
          Christ has purchased that all sin shall be taken away out of the
          hearts of believers at death, and that they should be made perfectly
          holy, whereby they shall be fully and perfectly qualified to enter
          upon the pleasures and enjoyments of the new Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. To consider the good attained for us by this way of salvation, as
          exceeding great.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is not only every sort of good we need, but of every sort in
          that degree, so as to answer the extent of our capacity, and the
          greatest stretch of our desires, and indeed of our conceptions. They
          are not only greater than our conceptions are here, but also greater
          than ever they could be, were it not that God’s relation, and our own
          experience, will teach us. They are greater than the tongue of angels
          can declare, the deliverance that we have in it is exceeding great. It
          is deliverance from guilt, from sin itself, from the anger of God, and
          from the miseries of hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          How great is the good conferred! The objective good in the infinite
          God, and the glorious Redeemer, Jesus Christ. How great is the love of
          the Father, and the Son! And how near the relation between them and
          the true believer! How close the union, how intimate the communion,
          and ultimately how clear will be the vision in glory!
        </p>
        <p>
          There are great communications made to the believing soul on earth,
          but how much greater in heaven! Then their conformity to God will be
          perfect, their enjoyment of him will be full, their honor great and
          unsullied, and the glory of body and soul ineffable. The riches of the
          Christian are immense. All things are included in his treasure.
          Pleasures unspeakably and inconceivably great await him, rivers of
          delight, fullness of joy; and all of infinite duration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The benefit procured for us, is doubly infinite. Our deliverance is an
          infinite benefit, because the evil we are delivered from in infinite.
          And the positive good bestowed is eternal, viz. the full enjoyment of
          all those blessings merited.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IV</p>
        <p>How angels are benefited by the salvation of men.</p>
        <p>
          SO has the wisdom of God contrived this affair, that the benefit of
          what he has done therein should be so extensive, as to reach the elect
          angels. It is for men that the work of redemption is wrought out. And
          yet the benefit of the things done in this work is not confined to
          them, though all that is properly called redemption, or included in
          it, is confined to men. The angels cannot partake in this, having
          never fallen. Yet they have great indirect benefit by it. — God has so
          wisely ordered, that what has been done in this directly and
          especially for men, should redound to the exceeding benefit of all
          intelligent creatures who are in favor with God. The benefit of it is
          so diffusive as to reach heaven itself. So great and manifold is the
          good attained in this work, that those glorious spirits who are so
          much above us, and were so highly exalted in happiness before, yet
          should receive great addition hereby. — I will show how in some
          particulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The angels hereby see a great and wonderful manifestation of the
          glory of God. The happiness of angels as well as of men consists very
          much in beholding the glory of God. The excellency of the Divine Being
          is a most delightful subject of contemplation to the saints on earth,
          but much more to the angels in heaven. The more holy any being is, the
          more sweet and delightful will it be to him to behold the glory and
          beauty of the Supreme Being. — Therefore the beholding of the glory of
          God must be ravishing to the holy angels of God who are perfect in
          holiness, and never had their minds leavened with sin. The
          manifestations of the glory of God, are as it were the food that
          satisfies the angels. They live thereon. It is their greatest
          happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is without doubt much of their employment to behold the glory of
          God appearing in his works. Therefore this work of redemption greatly
          contributes to their happiness and delight, as the glory of God is so
          exceedingly manifested by it. For what is done, is done, in the sight
          of the angels, as is evident by many passages of Holy Scripture. And
          they behold the glory of God appearing herein with entertainment and
          delight, as it is manifest by 1 Pet. 1:12, “Which things the angels
          desire to look into.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The angels have this advantage, that now they may behold the glory of
          God in the face of Jesus Christ, where it shines with a peculiar
          luster and brightness. 1 Tim. 3:16, “Great is the mystery of
          godliness, God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit,
          seen of angels.” Perhaps all God’s attributes are more gloriously
          manifested in this work than in any other that ever the angels saw.
          There is certainly a fuller manifestation of some of his attributes
          than ever they saw before, as is evident by the text. And especially,
          it is so with respect to the mercy of God, that sweet and endearing
          attribute of the divine nature. The angels of heaven never saw so much
          grace manifested before, as in the work of redemption, nor in any
          measure equal to it. How full of joy does it fill the hearts of the
          angels, to see such a boundless and bottomless ocean of love and grace
          in their God. And therefore with what rejoicing do all the angels
          praise Christ for his being slain! Rev. 5:11, 12, “And I beheld and
          heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the beasts
          and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten
          thousand, and thousands of thousands; saying with a loud voice, Worthy
          is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom,
          and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.”
        </p>
        <p>
          II. They have this benefit by it, that hereby Jesus Christ, God-man,
          is become their head. God, subsisting in three persons, Father, Son,
          and Holy Ghost, was the king of angels, and would have been, if it had
          not been for our redemption. But it was owing to what is done in this
          work, that Jesus Christ as God-man, becomes the head of the angels.
          Christ is now not only the head of angels simply as God, but as
          God-man. Col. 2:10, “And ye are complete in him, who is the head of
          all principality and power.” Eph. 1:20-22, “Which he wrought in
          Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him on his own right
          hand in heavenly places, far above all principality and power, and
          might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
          world, but also in that which is to come. And hath put all things
          under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the
          church.”
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a part of the exaltation and glory of Christ which God confers
          on him as his reward. And not only so, but it is greatly to the
          angels’ benefit. It is God’s manner in his dealings with his elect
          creatures, in the same works wherein he glorifies himself, or his Son,
          greatly to benefit them. The same dealings of his that are most for
          his glory, shall be most for their good. — That Christ, God-man,
          should be made the head of the angels, is greatly to their benefit
          several ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, because they become hereby more nearly related to so glorious a
          person, the Son of God, than otherwise they would have. The angels
          esteem it a great honor done them to be related to such a person as
          Jesus Christ, God-man, who is an infinitely honorable person.
        </p>
        <p>
          The angels, by Christ becoming their head, are with the saints
          gathered together in one in Christ, Eph. 1:10. They by virtue hereof,
          though Christ be not their Redeemer as he is ours, have a right and
          propriety in this glorious person, as well as we. He is theirs. Though
          not their Savior, yet he is their head of government, and head of
          influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, again, this is greatly to their benefit, as they are under
          advantages for a far more intimate converse with God. The divine
          nature is at an infinite distance from the nature of angels, as well
          as from the nature of man. This distance forbids a familiarity and
          intimacy of intercourse. — It is therefore a great advantage to the
          angels that God has come to them in a created nature, and in that
          nature has become their head, so that their intercourse and enjoyment
          may be more intimate. They are invited by the similar qualifications
          of the created nature, with which the Son of God is invested.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, it is for the benefit of the angels, as hereby the elect of
          mankind are gathered into their society. Christ, by the work of
          redemption, gathers in the elect of mankind to join the angels of
          heaven. Eph. 1:10, “That in the dispensation of the fullness of times,
          he might gather in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven,
          and which are on earth, even in him.” Men are brought in to join with
          the angels in their work of praising God, to partake with them of
          their enjoyments. The angels greatly rejoice at this. They rejoice
          when but one person is gathered in, as Christ teaches us. Luke 15:10,
          “Likewise I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels
          of God over one sinner that repenteth.” The heavenly society is made
          more complete by this accession of the saints to it. They contribute
          to the happiness of each other. The angels rejoice that others are
          added to join them and assist them in praising God. — And thus the
          vacancy by the fall of angels is filled up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, it tends to make the angels to prize their happiness the more
          when they see how much it cost to purchase the same happiness for man.
          Though they knew so much, yet they are not incapable of being taught
          more and more the worth of their own happiness. For when they saw how
          much it cost to purchase the same happiness for man, even the precious
          blood of the Son of God, this tended to give them a great sense of the
          infinite value of their happiness. They never saw such a testimony of
          the value of the eternal enjoyment of God before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we have shown, how the wisdom of God appears in the work of
          redemption in the good ends attained thereby, with respect to God,
          men, and good angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          But are there any good ends obtained with respect to bad angels, God’s
          grand enemies? Undoubtedly there are, as may appear from the few
          following considerations. Satan and his angels rebelled against God in
          heaven, and proudly presumed to try their strength with his. And when
          God by his almighty power overcame the strength of Satan, and sent him
          like lightning from heaven to hell with all his army, Satan still
          hoped to get the victory by subtlety. Though he could not overcome by
          power, yet he hoped to succeed by craft. And so by his subtlety to
          disappoint God of his end in creating this lower world. — God
          therefore has shown his great wisdom in overthrowing Satan’s design.
          He has disappointed the devices of the crafty, so that they cannot
          perform their enterprise. He has carried their counsel headlong.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Satan thought to have disappointed God of his glory, which he
          designed in creation this lower world, and to make mankind be for his
          own glory, in setting up himself god over them. Now Christ, by what he
          has done in the work of redemption, has overthrown Satan, and utterly
          frustrated him as to this end. God is exceedingly glorified in the
          elect, to the surprise of angels and devils. God by redemption has all
          the glory that he intended, and more than either men, angels, or
          devils imagined that God intended. God might have glorified his
          justice in the destruction of all mankind. But it was God’s design in
          creation the world, to glorify his goodness and love. And not only to
          be glorified eventually, but to be served and glorified actually by
          men. Satan intended to frustrate God of this end. But, by the
          redemption of Jesus Christ, his design is confounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Another design of the devil was to gratify his envy in the utter
          destruction of mankind. But, by the redemption of Jesus Christ, this
          malicious design of Satan is crossed, because all the elect are
          brought to their designed happiness, which is much greater than ever
          Satan thought it was in God’s heart to bestow on man. And though some
          of mankind are left to be miserable, yet that does not answer Satan’s
          end. For this also is ordered for God’s glory. No more are left
          miserable than God saw meet to glorify his justice upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          One end why God suffered Satan to do what he did in procuring the fall
          of man was that his Son might be glorified in conquering that strong,
          subtle, and proud spirit, and triumphing over him. How glorious does
          Christ Jesus appear in baffling and triumphing over this proud king of
          darkness, and all the haughty confederate rulers of hell. How glorious
          a sight is it to see the meek and patient Lamb of God leading that
          proud, malicious, and mighty enemy in triumph! What songs does this
          cause in heaven! It was a glorious sight in Israel, who came out with
          timbrels and with dances, and sang, “Saul hath slain his thousands,
          and David his ten thousands.” But how much more glorious to see the
          Son of David, the Son of God, carrying the head of the spiritual
          Goliath, the champion of the armies of hell, in triumph to the
          heavenly Jerusalem! It is with a principal view to this, that Christ
          is called, “the Lord of hosts, or armies, and a man of war,” Exo.
          15:3. And Psa. 24:8, “Who is this king of glory! The Lord strong and
          mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.”
        </p>
        <p>SECTION V</p>
        <p>
          In this way of salvation wonderful glory redounds to God, as to the
          effect of divine wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. BY this contrivance for our redemption, God’s greatest dishonor is
          made an occasion of his greatest glory. Sin is a thing by which God is
          greatly dishonored. The nature of its principle is enmity against God,
          and contempt of him. And man, by his rebellion, has greatly dishonored
          God. But this dishonor, by the contrivance of our redemption, is made
          an occasion of the greatest manifestation of God’s glory that ever
          was. Sin, the greatest evil, is made an occasion of the greatest good.
          It is the nature of a principle of sin that it seeks to dethrone God.
          But this is made an occasion of the greatest manifestation of God’s
          royal majesty and glory that ever was. By sin, man has slighted and
          despised God, but this is made an occasion of his appearing the more
          greatly honorable. Sin casts contempt upon the authority and law of
          God. But this, by the contrivance of our redemption, is made the
          occasion of the greatest honour done to that same authority, and to
          that very law. It was a greater honor to the law of God that Christ
          was subject to it, and obeyed it, than if all mankind had obeyed it.
          It was greater honor to God’s authority that Christ showed such great
          respect, and such entire subjection to it, than the perfect obedience
          of all the angels in heaven. Man by his sin showed his enmity against
          the holiness of God. But this is made an occasion of the greatest
          manifestation of God’s holiness. The holiness of God never appeared to
          so great a degree, as when God executed vengeance upon his own dear
          Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. So has the wisdom of God contrived that those attributes are
          glorified in man’s salvation, whose glory seemed to require his
          destruction. When man had fallen, several attributes of God seemed to
          require his destruction. The justice of God requires that sin be
          punished as it deserves. But it deserves no less than eternal
          destruction. God proclaims it as a part of glory of his nature that he
          will in no wise clear the guilty, Exo. 34:7. The holiness of God
          seemed to require man’s destruction. For God by his holiness
          infinitely hates sin. This seemed to require therefore that God should
          manifest a proportionable hatred of the sinner. And that he should be
          forever an enemy unto him. The truth of God seemed also to require
          man’s destruction. For eternal death was what God had threatened for
          sin, one jot or tittle of which threatening cannot by any means pass
          away. But yet so has God contrived, that those very attributes not
          only allow of man’s redemption, and are not inconsistent with it, but
          they are glorified in it. Even vindictive justice is glorified in the
          death and sufferings of Christ. The holiness of God, or his holy
          hatred of sin, that seemed to require man’s damnation, is seen in
          Christ’s dying for sinners. So herein also is manifested and glorified
          the truth of God, in the threatenings of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Yea, it is so ordered now that the glory of these attributes
          requires the salvation of those that believe. The justice of God that
          required man’s damnation, and seemed inconsistent with his salvation,
          now as much requires the salvation of those that believe in Christ, as
          ever before it required their damnation. Salvation is an absolute debt
          to the believer from God, so that he may in justice demand it, on
          account of what his surety has done. For Christ has satisfied justice
          fully for his sin. It is but a piece of justice, that the creditor
          should release the debtor, when he has fully paid the debt. And again,
          the believer may demand eternal life, because it has been merited by
          Christ, by a merit of condignity. So is it contrived, that justice
          that seemed to require man’s destruction, now requires his salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the truth of God that seemed to require man’s damnation, now
          requires his salvation. At the same time that the threatening of the
          law stands good, there is a promise of eternal life to many who have
          broken the law. They both stand good at the same time. And the truth
          of God requires that both should be fulfilled. How much soever they
          seemed to clash, yet so is the matter contrived in this way of
          salvation, that both are fulfilled and do not interfere one with
          another.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the very time that God uttered the threatening, “In the day thou
          eatest thereof thou shalt surely die,” and at the time that Adam had
          first eaten the forbidden fruit, there was then an existing promise,
          that many thousands of Adam’s race should obtain eternal life. This
          promise was made to Jesus Christ before the world was. What a
          difficulty and inconsistency did there seem to be here? But it was no
          difficulty to the wisdom of God that the promise and the threatening
          should be both fully accomplished to the glory of God’s truth in each
          of them. Psa. 25:10, “Mercy and truth are met together, righteousness
          and peace have kissed each other.”
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Those very attributes which seemed to require man’s destruction
          are more glorious in his salvation than they would have been in his
          destruction. The revenging justice of God is a great deal more
          manifested in the death of Christ than it would have been if all
          mankind had been sufferers to all eternity. If man had remained under
          the guilt and imputation of sin, the justice of God would not have had
          such a trial as it had, when his own Son was under the imputation of
          sin. If all mankind had stood guilty, and justice had called for
          vengeance upon them, that would not have been such a trial of the
          inflexibleness and unchangeableness of the justice of God, as when his
          own Son, who was the object of his infinite love, and in whom he
          infinitely delighted, stood with the imputation of guilt upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the greatest trial that could be, to manifest whether God’s
          justice was perfect and unchangeable, or not. Whether God was so just
          that he would not upon any account abate of what justice required. And
          whether God would have any respect to persons in judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the majesty of God appears much more in the sufferings of Christ
          than it would have done in the eternal sufferings of all mankind. The
          majesty of a prince appears greater in the just punishment of great
          personages under the guilt of treason, than of inferior persons. The
          sufferings of Christ have this advantage over the eternal sufferings
          of the wicked, for impressing upon the minds of the spectators a sense
          of the dread majesty of God, and his infinite hatred of sin; viz. that
          the eternal sufferings of the wicked never will be seen actually
          accomplished, and finished, whereas they have seen that which is
          equivalent to those eternal sufferings actually fulfilled and finished
          in the sufferings of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Such is the wisdom of salvation, that the more any of the elect
          have dishonored God, the more is God glorified in this redemption.
          Such wonders as these are accomplished by the wisdom of this way of
          salvation. Such things as these, if they had been proposed to any
          created intelligence, would have seemed strange and unaccountable
          paradoxes, till the counsels of divine wisdom concerning the matter
          were unfolded.
        </p>
        <p>
          So sufficient is this way of salvation, that it is not inconsistent
          with any of God’s attributes to save the chief of sinners. However
          great a sinner any one has been, yet God can, if he pleased, save
          without any injury to the glory of any one attribute. And not only so,
          but the more sinful any one has been, the more does God glorify
          himself in his salvation. The more does he glorify his power, that he
          can redeem one in whom sin so abounds, and of whom Satan has such
          strong possession. — The greater triumph has Christ over his grand
          adversary, in redeeming and setting at liberty from his bondage those
          that were his greatest vassals. The more does the sufficiency of
          Christ appear, in that it is sufficient for such vile wretches.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more is the sovereignty and boundless extent of the mercy of God
          manifested, in that it is sufficient to redeem those that are
          undeserving. Rom. 5:20, “Where sin abounded, grace did much more
          abound.”
        </p>
        <p>SECTION VI</p>
        <p>
          How the wisdom of God appears in the manner and circumstances of
          obtaining the good intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          WE now come to take notice of some wonderful circumstances of the
          attainment of our good, hereby; which shows the great wisdom of the
          contrivance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. So has God contrived in this way, that a sinful creature should
          become not guilty; and that he who has no righteousness of his own,
          should become righteous. These things, if they had been proposed,
          would have appeared contradictious to any but the divine
          understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it had been proposed to any created intelligence, to find out a way
          in which a sinful creature should not be a guilty creature, how
          impossible would it have been judged, that there should be any way at
          all. It would doubtless have been judged impossible but that he who
          has committed sin, must stand guilty of the sin he has committed. And
          if sin necessarily obliges to punishment, it must oblige him who has
          committed it. If punishment and sin be inseparable, then that
          punishment, and the sinner are inseparable. If the law denounces death
          to the person who is guilty of sin, and if it be impossible that the
          law should not take place, then he who has committed sin must die.
          Thus any created understanding would have thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if it had been proposed that here should be some way found out,
          wherein man might be righteous without fulfilling righteousness
          himself, so that he might reasonably and properly be looked upon and
          accepted as a righteous person, and adjudged to the reward of
          righteousness, and yet have no righteousness, and yet have broken the
          law, and done nothing else but break it — this doubtless would have
          been looked upon as impossible and contradictious.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yet the wisdom of God has truly accomplished each of these things.
          He has accomplished that men, though sinners, should be without guilt,
          in that he has found out a way that the threatenings of the law should
          truly and properly be fulfilled, and punishment be executed on sin,
          and yet not on the sinner. The sufferings of Christ answer the demands
          of the law, with respect to the sins of those who believe in him. And
          justice is truly satisfied thereby. And the law is fulfilled and
          answered by the obedience of Christ, so that his righteousness should
          properly be our righteousness. Though not performed by us, yet it is
          properly and reasonably accepted for us, as much as if we had
          performed it ourselves. Divine wisdom has so contrived, that such an
          interchanging of sin and righteousness should be consistent, and most
          agreeable with reason, with the law, and God’s holy attributes. For
          Jesus Christ has so united himself to us, and us to him, as to make
          himself ours, our head. The love of Christ to the elect is so great,
          that God the Father looks upon it proper and suitable to account
          Christ and the elect as one; and accordingly to account what Christ
          does and suffers, as if they did and suffered it. — That love of
          Christ which is so great as to render him willing to put himself in
          the stead of the elect, and to bear the misery that they deserved,
          does, in the Father’s account, so unite Christ and the elect, that
          they may be looked upon as legally one.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. It shows wonderful wisdom that our good should be procured by such
          seemingly unlikely and opposite means, as the humiliation of the Son
          of God. When Christ was about to undertake that great work of
          redemption, he did not take the method that any creature wisdom would
          have thought as the most proper. Creature wisdom would have determined
          that in order to his effectually and more gloriously accomplishing
          such a great work, he should rather have been exalted higher, if it
          had been possible, rather than humbled so low. — Earthly kings and
          princes, when they are about to engage in any great and difficult
          work, will put on their strength, an will appear in all their majesty
          and power, that they may be successful. — But when Christ was about to
          perform the great work of redeeming a lost world, the wisdom of God
          took an opposite method, and determined that he should be humbled and
          abased to a mean state, and appear in low circumstances. He did not
          deck himself with glory, but laid it aside. He emptied himself. Phil.
          2:6, 7, 8, “Being in the form of God — he made himself of no
          reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the
          likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled
          himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.”
          — Creature wisdom would have thought that Christ, in order to perform
          this great work, should deck himself with all his strength. But divine
          wisdom determined that he should be made weak, or put on the
          infirmities of human nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          And why did divine wisdom determine that he should become thus weak?
          It was that he might be subject to want, and to suffering, and to the
          power and malice of his enemies. But then what advantage could it be
          to him in this work, to be subject to the power and malice of his
          enemies? It was the very design on which he came into the world, to
          overcome his enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who would have thought that this was the way to overthrow them, that
          he should become weak and feeble, and for that very end that he might
          be subject to their power and malice. But this is the very means by
          which God determined that Christ should prevail against his enemies,
          even that he should be subject to their power, that they might prevail
          against him, so as to put him to disgrace, and pain, and death.
        </p>
        <p>
          What other but divine wisdom could ever have determined, that this was
          the way to be taken in order to being successful in the work of our
          redemption. This would have appeared to creature wisdom the most
          direct course to be frustrated that could be devised. But it was
          indeed the way to glorious success, and the only way. “The foolishness
          of God is wiser than men,” 1 Cor. 1:25. God has brought strength out
          of weakness, glory out of ignominy and reproach. Christ’s shame and
          reproach are the only means by which a way is made to our eternal
          honor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wisdom of God has made Christ’s humiliation the means of our
          exaltation. His coming down from heaven is that which brings us to
          heaven. The wisdom of God has made life the fruit of death. The death
          of Christ was the only means by which we could have eternal life. The
          death of a person who was God, was the only way by which we could come
          to have life in God. — Here favor is made to arise out of wrath; our
          acceptance into God’s favor out of God’s wrath upon his own Son. A
          blessing rises out of curse; our everlasting blessedness, from Christ
          being made a curse for us. Our righteousness is made to rise out
          Christ’s imputed guilt. He was made sin for us that we might be made
          the righteousness of God, 2 Cor. 5:21. By such wonderful means has the
          wisdom of God procured our salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Our sin and misery, by this contrivance, are made an occasion of
          our greater blessedness. This is a very wonderful thing. It would have
          been a very wonderful thing if we had been merely restored from sin
          and misery, to be as we were before. But it was a much more wonderful
          thing that we should be brought to a higher blessedness than ever, and
          that our sin and misery should be the occasion of it, and should make
          way for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it was wonderful that sin should be made the occasion of our
          greater blessedness. For sin deserves misery. By our sin we had
          deserved to be everlastingly miserable. But this is so turned by
          divine wisdom, that it is made an occasion of our being more happy. —
          It was a strange thing that sin should be the occasion of anything
          else but misery. But divine wisdom has found out a way whereby the
          sinner might not only escape being miserable, but that he should be
          happier than before he sinned, yea than he would have been if he had
          never sinned at all. And this sin and unworthiness of his are the
          occasion of this greater blessedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, it was a wonderful thing that man’s own misery should be an
          occasion of his greater happiness. For happiness and misery are
          contraries. And man’s misery was very great. He was under the wrath
          and curse of God, and condemned to everlasting burning. — But the sin
          and misery of man, by this contrivance, are made an occasion of his
          being more happy, not only than he was before the fall, but than he
          would have been if he never had fallen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our first parents, if they had stood and persevered in perfect
          obedience, till God had given them the fruit of the tree of life as a
          seal of their reward, would probably have been advanced to higher
          happiness. For they before were but in a state probation for their
          reward. And it is not to be supposed but that their happiness was to
          have been greater after they had persisted in obedience, and had
          actually received the reward, than it was while they were in a state
          of trial for it. But by the redemption of Christ, the sin and misery
          of the elect are made an occasion of their being brought to a higher
          happiness than mankind would have had if they had persisted in
          obedience till they had received the reward. — For,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Man is hereby brought to a greater and nearer union with God. If
          man had never fallen, God would have remained man’s friend. He would
          have enjoyed God’s favor, and so would have been the object of
          Christ’s favor, as he would have had the favor of all the persons of
          the Trinity. — But now Christ becoming our surety and Savior, and
          having taken on him our nature, occasions between Christ and us an
          union of a quite different kind, and a nearer relation than otherwise
          would have been. The fall is the occasion of Christ’s becoming our
          head, and the church his body. And believers are become his brethren,
          and spouse, in a manner that otherwise would not have been. And by our
          union with Christ we have a greater union with the natural Son of God.
          Gal. 4:4-6, “When the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his
          Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were
          under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because
          ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your
          hearts, crying, Abba, Father.” And therefore Christ has taught us, in
          all our addresses to God, to call him our Father, in like manner as he
          calls him Father John 20:17, “Go tell my brethren, behold I ascend to
          my Father, and your Father.”
        </p>
        <p>
          This is one of the wonderful things brought about by the work of
          redemption, that thereby our separation from God is made an occasion
          of a greater union than was before, or otherwise would have been. —
          When we fell, there was dreadful separation made betwixt God and us,
          but this is made an occasion of a greater union. John 17:20-23,
          “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe
          on me through their word; that they all may be one, as thou Father art
          in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us: that the world
          may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me
          I have given them: that they may be one, even as we are one: I in
          them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Man now has greater manifestations of the glory and love of God
          than otherwise he would have had. In the manifestations of these two
          things, man’s happiness principally consists. Now, man by the work of
          redemption, has greater manifestation of both, than otherwise he would
          have had. We have already spoken particularly of the glory of God, and
          what advantages even the angels have by the discoveries of it in this
          work. But if they have such advantages, much more will man who is far
          more directly concerned in this affair than they. — Here are
          immediately greater displays of the love of God, than man had before
          he fell: or, as we may well suppose, than he would have had, if he had
          never fallen. God now manifests his love to his people by sending his
          Son into the world to die for them. There never would have been any
          such testimony of the love of God, if man had not fallen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ manifests his love, by coming into the world, and laying down
          his life. This is the greatest testimony of divine love that can be
          conceived. Now surely the greater discoveries God’s people have of his
          love to them, the more occasion will they have to rejoice in that
          love. Here will be a delightful theme for the saints to contemplate to
          all eternity, which they never could have had, if man never had
          fallen, viz. the dying love of Christ. They will have occasion now to
          sing that song forever. Rev. 1:5,6, “Unto him that loved us, and
          washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and
          priests unto God and his Father; to whom be glory and dominion for
          ever. Amen.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Man now has greater motives offered him to love God than otherwise
          he ever would have had. Man’s happiness consists in mutual love
          between God and man, in seeing God’s love to him, and in reciprocally
          loving God. And the more he sees of God’s love to him, and the more he
          loves God, the more happy must he be. His love to God is as necessary
          in order to his happiness, as the seeing of God’s love to him. For he
          can have no joy in beholding God’s love to him, any otherwise than as
          he loves God. — This make the saints prize God’s love to them. For
          they love him. If they did not love God, to see his love to them would
          not make them happy. But the more any person loves another, the more
          will he be delighted in the manifestations of that other’s love. —
          There is provision therefore made for both in the work of redemption.
          There are greater manifestations of the love of God to us, than there
          would have been if man had not fallen. And also there are greater
          motives to love him than otherwise there would have been. There are
          greater obligations to love him, for God has done more for us to win
          our love. Christ has died for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, man is now brought to a more universal and immediate and
          sensible dependence on God, than otherwise he would have been. All his
          happiness is now of him, through him, in him. If man had not fallen,
          he would have had all his happiness of God by his own righteousness.
          But now it is by the righteousness of Christ. He would have had all
          his holiness of God, but not so sensibly, because then he would have
          been holy from the beginning, as soon as he received his being. But
          now, he is first sinful and universally corrupt, and afterwards is
          made holy. If man had held his integrity misery would have been a
          stranger to him. And therefore happiness would not have been so
          sensible a derivation from God, as it is now, when man looks to God
          from the deeps of distress, cries repeatedly to him, and waits upon
          him. He is convinced by abundant experience, that he has no place of
          resort but God, who is graciously pleased, in consequence of man’s
          earnest and persevering suit, to appear to his relief, to take him out
          of the miry clay and horrible pit, set him upon a rock, establish his
          goings, and put a new song into his mouth. — By man’s having thus a
          more immediate, universal, and sensible dependence, God does more
          entirely secure man’s undivided respect. There is a greater motive for
          man to make God his all in all, — to love him rejoice in him as his
          only portion.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. By the contrivance for our salvation, man’s sin and misery are but
          an occasion of his being brought to a more full and free converse with
          and enjoyment of God than otherwise would have been. For as we have
          observed already, the union is greater; and the greater the union, the
          more full the communion, and intimate the intercourse. — Christ is
          come down to man in his own nature. And hereby he may converse with
          Christ more intimately, than the infinite distance of the divine
          nature would allow. This advantage is more than what the angels have.
          For Christ is not only in a created nature, but he is in man’s own
          nature. — We have also advantages for a more full enjoyment of God. By
          Christ’s incarnation, the saints may see God with their bodily eyes,
          as well as by an intellectual view. The saints, after the day of
          judgment, will consist of both body and soul. They will have outward
          as well as spiritual sight. It is now ordered by divine wisdom, that
          God himself, or a divine person, should be the principal entertainment
          of both these kinds of sight, spiritual and corporal. And the saints
          in heaven shall not only have an intellectual sight of God, but they
          shall see a divine person as they see one another; not only
          spiritually, but outwardly. — The body of Jesus Christ will appear
          with that transcendent visible majesty and beauty, which is
          exceedingly expressive of the divine majesty, beauty, and glory. The
          body of Christ shall appear with the glory of God upon it, as Christ
          tells us. Mat. 16:27, “The Son of man shall come in the glory of his
          Father.” Thus to see God will be a great happiness to the saints. Job
          comforted himself that he should see God with his bodily eyes. Job
          19:26, “And though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my
          flesh shall I see God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Man’s sin and misery is made an occasion of his greater happiness,
          as he has now a greater relish of happiness, by reason of his
          knowledge of both. In order to happiness, there must be two things,
          viz. union to a proper object — and a relish of the object. Man’s
          misery is made an occasion of increasing both these by the work of
          redemption. We have shown already, that the union is increased, and so
          is the relish too, by the knowledge man now has of evil. These
          contraries, good and evil, heighten the sense of one another. The
          forbidden tree was called the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Of
          evil, because by it we came to the experience of evil. Of good,
          because we should never have known so well what good was, if it had
          not been for that tree. We are taught the value of good, by our
          knowledge of its contrary, evil. This teaches us to prize good, and
          makes us the more to relish and rejoice in it. The saints know
          something what a state of sin and alienation from God is. They know
          something what the anger of God is, and what it is to be in danger of
          hell. And this makes them the more exceedingly to rejoice in the favor
          and in the enjoyment of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take two persons; one who never knew what evil was, but was happy from
          the first moment of his being, having the favor of God, and numerous
          tokens of it; another who is in a very doleful and undone condition.
          Let there be bestowed upon these two persons the same blessings,
          [subjectively,] the same good things. And let them be objectively in
          the same glorious circumstances, — and which will rejoice most?
          Doubtless he that was brought to this happiness out of a miserable and
          doleful state. So the saints in heaven will forever the more rejoice
          in God, and in the enjoyment of his love, for their being brought to
          it out of a most lamentable state and condition.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION VII</p>
        <p>Some wonderful circumstances of the overthrow of Satan.</p>
        <p>
          THE wisdom of God greatly and remarkably appears in so exceedingly
          baffling and compounding all the subtlety of the old serpent. Power
          never appears so conspicuous as when opposed and conquering
          opposition. The same may be said of wisdom. It never appears so
          brightly, and with such advantage, as when opposed by the subtlety of
          some very crafty enemy, and in baffling and confounding that subtlety.
          — The devil is exceeding subtle. The subtlety of the serpent is
          emblematical of his, Gen. 3:1. He was once one of the brightest
          intelligences of heaven, and one of the brightest, if not the very
          brightest, of all. And all the devils were once morning stars, of a
          glorious brightness of understanding. They still have the same
          faculties, though they ceased to be influenced and guided by the Holy
          Spirit of God. And so their heavenly wisdom is turned into hellish
          craft and subtlety. — God in the work of redemption has wondrously
          baffled the utmost craft of the devils, and though they are all
          combined to frustrate God’s designs of glory to himself, and goodness
          to men. — The wisdom of God appears very glorious herein. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Consider the weak and seemingly despicable means and weapons that
          God employs to overthrow Satan. Christ poured the greater contempt
          upon Satan in the victory that he obtained over him, by reason of the
          means of his preparing himself for it, and the weapons he has used.
          Christ chooses to encounter Satan in the human nature, in a poor,
          frail, afflicted state. He did as David did. David when going against
          the Philistine refused Saul’s armor, a helmet of brass, a coat of
          mail, and his sword. No, he puts them all off. Goliath comes mightily
          armed against David, with a helmet of brass upon his head, a coat of
          mail weighing five thousand shekels of brass, greaves of brass upon
          his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders, a spear, whose
          staff was like a weaver’s beam, and the spear’s head weighing six
          hundred shekels of iron. And besides all this, he had one bearing a
          shield before him. But David takes nothing but a staff in his hand,
          and a shepherd’s bag and a sling, and he goes against the Philistine.
          So the weapons that Christ made use of were his poverty, afflictions
          and reproaches, sufferings and death. His principal weapon was his
          cross, the instrument of his own reproachful death. These were
          seemingly weak and despicable instruments to wield against such a
          giant as Satan. And doubtless the devil disdained them as much as
          Goliath did David’s staves and sling. But with such weapons as these
          has Christ in a human, weak, mortal nature overthrown and baffled all
          the craft of hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such disgrace and contempt has Christ poured upon Satan. David had a
          more glorious victory over Goliath for his conquering him with such
          mean instruments; and Samson over the Philistines, for killing so many
          of them with such a despicable weapon as the jaw-bone of an ass. It is
          spoken of in Scripture as a glorious triumph of Christ over the devil,
          that he should overcome him by such a despicable weapon as his cross.
          Col. 2:14, 15, “Blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances that was
          against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way,
          nailing it to his cross: and having spoiled principalities and powers,
          he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.” — God
          shows his great and infinite wisdom in taking this method, to confound
          the wisdom and subtlety of his enemies. He hereby shows how easily he
          can do it, and that he infinitely wiser than they. 1 Cor. 1:27-29,
          “God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to confound the
          wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world, to confound
          the things that are mighty: and the base things of the world, and
          things that are despised, hath God chosen; yea, and things that are
          not, to bring to nought the things that are.”
        </p>
        <p>
          II. God has thereby confounded Satan with his own weapons. It is so
          contrived in the work of redemption, that our grand enemy should be
          made a means of his own confusion. And that, by those very things
          whereby he endeavors to rob God of his glory, and to destroy mankind,
          he is made an instrument of frustrating his own designs. His most
          subtle and powerful endeavors for accomplishing his designs are made a
          means of confounding them, and of promoting the contrary. Of this, I
          will mention but two instances.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, his procuring man’s fall is made an occasion of the contrary to
          what he designed. Indeed he has hereby procured the ruin of multitudes
          of mankind, which he aimed at. But in this he does not frustrate God’s
          design from all eternity to glorify himself. And the misery of
          multitudes of mankind will prove no content to him, but will enhance
          his own misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          What Satan did in tempting man to fall is made an occasion of the
          contrary to what he intended, in that it gave occasion for God to
          glorify himself the more; and giveth occasion for the elect being
          brought to higher happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The happy state of man was envied by Satan. That man who was of
          earthly original should be advance to such honors, when he who was
          originally of a so much more noble nature should be cast down to such
          disgrace, his pride could not bear. How then would Satan triumph, when
          he had brought him down!
        </p>
        <p>
          The devil tempted our first parents with this, that if they would eat
          of the forbidden fruit, they should be a gods. — It was a lie in
          Satan’s mouth. For he aimed at nothing else but to fool man out of his
          happiness, and make him his own slave and vassal, with a blinded
          expectation of being like a god. — But little did Satan think that God
          would turn it so, as to make man’s fall an occasion of God’s becoming
          man. And so an occasion of our nature being advanced to a state of
          closer union to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          By this means it comes to pass, that one in man’s nature now sits at
          the right hand of God, invested with divine power and glory, and
          reigns over heaven and earth with God-like power and dominion. Thus is
          Satan disappointed in his subtlety. As he intended that saying, Ye
          shall be as gods, it was lie, to decoy and befool man. Little did he
          think that it would be in such manner verified by the incarnation of
          the Son of God. And this is the occasion also of all the elect being
          united to this divine person, so that they become one with Christ.
          Believers are as members and parts of Christ. Yea, the church is
          called Christ. Little did Satan think, that his telling that lie to
          our first parents, “Ye shall be as gods,” would be the occasion of
          their being members of Christ the Son of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, Satan is made a means of his own confusion in this: — It was
          Satan’s design, in tempting man to sin, to make man his captive and
          slave forever; to have plagued, and triumphed over him. And this very
          thing is a means to bring it about, that man instead of being his
          vassal should be his judge. The elect, instead of being his captives,
          to be forever tormented and triumphed over by him, shall sit as judges
          to sentence him to everlasting torment. It has been the means, that
          one in man’s nature, should be his supreme Judge. It was man’s nature
          that Satan so envied, and sought to make a prey of. But Jesus Christ
          at the last day shall come in man’s nature. And the devils shall be
          all brought to stand trembling at his bar. And he shall judge, and
          condemn them, and execute the wrath of God upon them. And not only
          shall Christ in the human nature judge the devils, but all the saints
          shall judge them with Christ as assessors with him in judgment. 1 Cor.
          6:3, “Know ye not that we shall judge angels?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, In another instance Satan is made a means of his own
          confusion, that is, in his procuring the death of Christ. Satan set
          himself to oppose Christ as soon as he appeared. — He sought, by all
          means, to procure his ruin. He set the Jews against him. He filled the
          minds of the scribes and Pharisees with the most bitter persecuting
          malice against Christ. He sought by all means to procure his death.
          And that he might be put to the most ignominious death. We read “that
          Satan entered into Judas, and tempted him to betray him,” Luke 22:3.
          And Christ speaks of his sufferings as being the effects of the power
          of darkness. Luke 22:53, “When I was daily with you in the temple, ye
          stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour and the
          power of darkness.” — But Satan hereby overthrows his own kingdom.
          Christ came into the world to destroy the works of the devil. And this
          was the very thing that did it, viz. the blood and death of Christ.
          The cross was the devil’s own weapon. And with this weapon he was
          overthrown; as David cut off Goliath’s head with his own sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ thus making Satan a means of his own confusion was typified of
          old by Samson’s getting honey out of the carcass of the lion. There is
          more implied in Samson’s riddle, “Out of the eater came forth meat,
          and out of the strong came forth sweetness,” than ever the Philistines
          explained. It was verified by Christ in a far more glorious manner.
          God’s enemies and ours are taken in the pit which they themselves have
          dug. And their own soul is taken in the net which they have laid. Thus
          we have shown, in some measure, the wisdom of this way of salvation by
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION VIII</p>
        <p>The superiority of this wisdom to that of the angels.</p>
        <p>
          THE wisdom of this contrivance appears to have been above the wisdom
          of the angels by the following things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. It appears that the angels did not fully comprehend the
          contrivance, till they saw it accomplished. They knew that man was to
          be redeemed, long before Christ came into the world. But yet they did
          not fully comprehend it until they saw it. This is evident by the
          expression in the text. That now might be known unto the
          principalities–the manifold wisdom of God. i.e. Now the work is
          actually accomplished by Jesus Christ. Which implies that it was now
          new to them. — If they understood no more of it now, than they had all
          along, the apostle would never have expressed himself so. For he is
          speaking of it as a mystery, in a measure kept hid until now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is to be considered that the angels had four thousand years to
          contemplate this affair. And they did not want inclination and desire
          to understand and look into it, as the Scripture teaches us. They had
          also a great deal to put them upon an attentive contemplation of it.
          For when it was made known that God had such a design, it must appear
          a new and wonderful thing to them. They had seen their fellow-angels
          destroyed without mercy. And this redeeming of the fallen sinful
          creature was quite a new thing. It must needs be astonishing to them,
          when God had revealed this design of mercy to them presently after the
          fall. And had given an intimation of it, in saying, “The seed of the
          woman shall bruise the serpent’s head.” They knew that God had such a
          design. For they were, from the beginning, ministering spirits, sent
          forth to minister to those that were the heirs of salvation. — They
          were present at the institution of the typical dispensation, that was
          so full of shadows of gospel-truth, Psa. 69:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          The angels contemplating the contrivance of our redemption was
          typified by the posture of the cherubim over the mercy-seat, which was
          the lid of the ark. These emblems were made bending down towards the
          ark and mercy-seat. — This is what the apostle Peter is thought to
          have some reference to, 1 Pet. 1:12. Yet the angels, though for four
          thousand years they had been studying this contrivance, did not fully
          comprehend it till they saw it accomplished. This shows that the
          wisdom of it was far above theirs. For if they could not fully
          comprehend it after it had been revealed that there was such a design
          — and after much of it had already been made known in the Old
          Testament — how much less could they have found it out of themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider for what end this wisdom of God was made known unto the
          angels, viz. that they might admire and prize it. It was made known to
          them, that they might see how manifold, how great and glorious, it is;
          that they might see the unspeakable “depths of the riches of the
          wisdom and knowledge of God,” as the apostle expresses it, Rom. 11:33.
          — It was manifested to them that they might see the glory of God in
          it, and how great and wonderful the mystery was. 1 Tim. 3:16, “Great
          is the mystery of godliness; God was manifest in the flesh, justified
          in the spirit, seen of angels.” Now if the wisdom of it were not far
          above their own understandings, this would not be shown them for the
          express purpose that they might admire and praise God for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It appears to be above the wisdom of the angels because they are
          still contemplating it, and endeavoring to see more and more of it.
          Indeed there is room for their faculties to employ themselves to all
          eternity. It is evident, from 1 Peter 1:12, that they are still
          employing themselves in endeavoring to see more and more of God’s
          wisdom appearing in the work of redemption, “Searching what, or what
          manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify,
          when it testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and the
          glory that should follow. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto
          themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now
          reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you, with
          the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire
          to look into.” They still desire to look into it, after they have seen
          it accomplished. They do not so perfectly comprehend all the wisdom
          that is to be seen in it. But they are contemplating, looking into it,
          that they may see more and more. But there will still be room enough
          in this work to employ the angelical understandings.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IX</p>
        <p>The subject improved</p>
        <p>
          I. HENCE we may learn the blindness of the world that the wisdom
          appearing the work of redemption is no more admired in it. God has
          revealed this his glorious design and contrivance to the world, sends
          forth his gospel, and causes it to be preached abroad, in order to
          declare to the world that his infinite wisdom has been engaged for
          man’s salvation. But how little is it regarded! There are some who
          have their eyes opened to behold the wondrous things of the gospel,
          who see the glory of God in, and admire the wisdom of it. But the
          greater part are wholly blind to it. They see nothing in all this that
          is any way glorious and wonderful. Though the angels account it worthy
          of their most engaged and deep contemplation; yet the greater part of
          men take little notice of it. It is all a dull story and dead letter
          to many of them. They cannot see anything in it above the wisdom of
          men. Yea, the gospel to many seems foolishness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the light that shines in the world be so exceeding glorious,
          yet how few are there that do see it. The glory of God’s wisdom in
          this work is surpassing the brightness of the sun. But so blind is the
          world that it sees nothing. It does not know that the Son of
          righteousness shines. Thus it has been in all ages, and wherever the
          gospel has been preached, ministers of the Word of God in all ages
          have had occasion to say, Who has believed our report, and to whom is
          the arm of the Lord revealed? Thus the prophets were sent to many with
          that errand. Isa. 6:9, 10, “Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed,
          but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the
          heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;
          lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
          understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When Christ that glorious prophet came, and more fully revealed the
          counsels of God concerning our redemption, how many were then blind!
          How much did Christ complain of them! How blind were the scribes and
          Pharisees, the most noted sect of men among the Jews for wisdom. They
          beheld no glory in that gospel which Christ preached unto them, which
          gave him occasion to call them fools and blind, Mat. 23:17. — So it
          was again in the apostles’ times. In all places where they preached,
          some believed, and some believed not, Acts 28:24. “As many as were
          ordained to eternal life believed,” chap. 13:48. “The election
          obtained, but the rest were blinded,” Rom. 11:7. And so it is still in
          those places where the gospel is preached. There are a few who see the
          glory of the gospel. God has a small number whose eyes he opens, who
          are called out of darkness into marvelous light, and who have an
          understanding to see the wisdom and fitness of the way of life. But
          how many are there who sit under the preaching of the gospel all their
          days, yet never see any divine wisdom or glory in it! To their dying
          day they are unaffected with it. When they hear it, they see nothing
          to attract their attention, much less excite any admiration. To preach
          the gospel to them will serve very well to lull them asleep, but
          produces very little other effect upon them. This shows the exceeding
          wickedness of the heart of man. How affecting the thought, that
          infinite wisdom should be set on work, so as to surprise the angels,
          and to entertain them from age to age: — and that to men, though so
          plainly set before them, it should appear foolishness! 1 Cor. 1:18,
          “The preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness.”
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This is a great confirmation of the truth of the gospel. The
          gospel stands in no need of external evidences of its truth and
          divinity. It carries its own light and evidence with it. — There is
          that in its nature that sufficiently distinguishes it, to those who
          are spiritually enlightened, from all the effects of human invention.
          There are evident appearances of the divine perfections, the stamp of
          divine glory, of which this of the divine wisdom is not the least
          part.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is as much in the gospel to show that it is no work of men, as
          there is in the sun in the firmament. As persons of mature reason who
          look upon the sun, and consider the nature of it, its wonderful
          height, its course, its brightness and heat, may know that it is no
          work of man. So, if the gospel be duly considered, if the true nature
          of it be seen, it may be known that it is no work of man, and that it
          must be form God. And if the wisdom appearing in the gospel be duly
          considered, it will be seen as much to excel all human wisdom, as the
          sun’s light excels the light of fires of our own kindling. — The
          contrivance of our salvation is of such a nature that no one can
          rationally conclude that man had any hand in it. The nature of the
          contrivance is such, so out of the way of all human thoughts, so
          different from all human inventions, so much more sublime, excellent,
          and worthy, that it does not savor at all of the craft or subtlety of
          man. It savors of God only.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any are ready to think man might have found out such a way of
          salvation for sinners — so honorable to God, to his holiness and
          authority — they do not well consider the scantiness of human
          understanding. Mankind were of a poor capacity for any such
          undertaking. For, till the gospel enlightened the world, they had but
          miserable notions of what was honorable to God. They could have but
          poor notions of what way would be suitable to the divine perfections.
          For they were woefully in the dark about these divine perfections
          themselves, till the gospel came abroad in the world. They had strange
          notions about a Deity. Most of them thought there were many gods.
          “They changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image like to
          corruptible man, and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping
          things,” Rom. 1:23. They attributed vices to God. Even the
          philosophers, their wisest men entertained but imperfect notions of
          the Supreme Being. How then should men find out a way so glorious and
          honorable to God, and agreeable to his perfection, who had no wisdom
          enough to get any tolerable notions of God, till the gospel was
          revealed to them. They groped in the dark. Their notions showed the
          infinite insufficiency of man’s blind understanding for any such
          undertaking, as the contriving of a way of salvation every way
          honorable to God, and suitable to the needs of a fallen creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          But since the gospel has told what God’s counsels are, and how he has
          contrived a way for our salvation, men are ready to despise it, and
          foolishly to exalt their own understanding, and to imagine they could
          have found out as good a way themselves. When, alas! men, of
          themselves, had no notion of what was honorable to God, and suitable
          for a Divine Being. — They did not so much as think of the necessity
          of God’s law being answered, and justice satisfied. And if they had,
          how dreadfully would they have been puzzled to have found out the way
          how! Who would have thought of a trinity of persons in the Godhead,
          and that one should sustain the rights of the Godhead, and another
          should be the Mediator, and another should make application of
          redemption? Who would have thought of such a thing as three distinct
          persons, and yet but one God? All the same Being, and yet three
          persons! Who would have thought of this, in order to have found out a
          way for satisfying justice? Who would have thought of a way for
          answering the law that threatened eternal death, without the sinner’s
          suffering eternal death? And who would have thought of any such thing
          as a divine person suffering the wrath of God? And if they had who
          would have contrived a way how he should suffer, since the divine
          nature cannot suffer?
        </p>
        <p>
          Who would have thought of any such thing as God becoming man, two
          natures and but one person? These things are exceedingly out of the
          way of human thought and contrivance. It is most unreasonable to think
          that the world, who, till the gospel enlightened them, were so blind
          about the nature of God and divine things, should contrive such a way
          that should prove thus to answer all ends, every way to suit what the
          case required, most glorious to God, and answerable to all man’s
          necessities. Everything is so fully provided for, and no absurdity to
          be found in the whole affair, but all speaking forth the most perfect
          wisdom. That there should be no infringement upon holiness or justice,
          nothing dishonorable to the majesty of God, no encouragement to sin,
          all possible motives to holiness, all manner of happiness provided,
          and Satan so confounded and entirely overthrown. How truly wonderful!
        </p>
        <p>
          And if we suppose that all this notwithstanding was the invention of
          men, whose invention should it be? Who should be pitched upon as the
          most likely to invent it? It was not the invention of the Jews. For
          they were the most bitter enemies to it. The wise men among them, when
          they first heard of it, conceived malice against it, till the apostles
          preached it to them. And it appeared a very foolish doctrine to the
          wise men among them. The doctrine of Christ crucified was not only to
          the Jews a stumbling-block, but also to the Greeks foolishness, 1 Cor.
          1:23. Besides, it was contrary to all their notions about a Deity, and
          they knew nothing about the fall of man, and the like, till the gospel
          revealed it to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not the invention of the apostles. For the apostles, of
          themselves, were no way capable of any such learned contrivance. They
          were poor fishermen and publicans, an obscure and illiterate sort of
          men, till they were extra-ordinarily taught. They were all surprised
          when they first heard of it. When they heard that Christ must die for
          sinners, they were offended at it. And it was a long while before they
          were brought fully to receive it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is but one way left. And that is, to suppose, that Christ was a
          mere man, a very subtle crafty man, and that he invented it all. But
          this is as unreasonable as the rest. For it would have been all
          against himself, to invent a way of salvation by his own crucifixion,
          a most tormenting and ignominious death.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. How great a sin they are guilty of who despise and reject this
          way of salvation! When God has manifested such unsearchable riches of
          wisdom, when all the persons of the Trinity have as it were held a
          consultation from all eternity in providing a way of salvation for us
          sinful miserable worms — a way that should be sufficient and every way
          suitable for us — a way that should be in all things complete, whereby
          we might have not only full pardon of all our sins, and deliverance
          from hell, but also full blessedness in heaven forever, — How must God
          needs be provoked, when after all, men reject this way of salvation!
        </p>
        <p>
          When salvation comes to be preached, and is offered to them in this
          way, when they are invited to accept of its benefits, and yet they
          despise and refuse it, they thus practically deny it to be a wise way,
          and call this wisdom of God foolishness. — How provoking it must be
          when such a poor creature as man shall rise up and find fault with
          that wisdom which is so far above the wisdom of angels! This is one
          thing wherein consists the heinousness of the sin of unbelief, that it
          implies a rejecting and despising of divine wisdom in the way of
          salvation by Jesus Christ. — Unbelief finds fault with the wisdom of
          God in the choice of the person, for performing this work. It dislikes
          the person of Christ. It sees no form nor comeliness in him, nor
          beauty wherefore it should desire him.
        </p>
        <p>
          That person whom the wisdom of God looked upon as the fittest person
          of any, the only fit person, is despised and rejected by unbelief. —
          Men, through unbelief, find fault with the salvation itself that
          Christ has purchased. They do not like to be saved as Christ would
          save. They do not like to be made holy, and to have such a happiness
          as is to be had in God for a portion.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may not be amiss here to mention two or three ways whereby persons
          are guilty of a provoking contempt of the wisdom of God in the way of
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, they are guilty of a provoking contempt, who live in a careless
          neglect of their salvation. They who are secure in their sins, and are
          not much concerned about either salvation or damnation. This is
          practically charging God with folly. — Its language is, that all is in
          vain, and to no purpose, that God has contrived and consulted for our
          salvation, when there was no need of it. They are well enough as they
          are. They do not see any great necessity of a Savior. They like that
          state they are in, and do not much desire to be delivered out of it. —
          They do not thank him for all his consultation and contrivance, and
          think he might have spared his cost. God has greatly minded that,
          which they do not think worth minding, and has contrived abundantly
          for that which they do not trouble their heads about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, they are guilty of provoking contempt of the wisdom of this
          way of salvation, who go about to contrive ways of their own. They who
          are not content with salvation by the righteousness of Christ, which
          God has provided, are for contriving some way of being saved by their
          own righteousness. — These find fault with the wisdom of God’s way,
          and set up their own wisdom in opposition to it. How greatly must God
          be provoked by such conduct!
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, those that entertain discouraged and despairing apprehension
          about their salvation cast contempt on the wisdom of God. They think
          that because they have been such great sinners, God will not be
          willing to pardon them [and] Christ will not be willing to accept of
          them. They fear that Christ, in the invitations of the gospel, does
          not mean such wicked creatures as they are; that because they have
          committed so much sin, they have sinned beyond the reach of mercy.
          They think it is in vain for them to seek for salvation, as though it
          were not all-sufficient: — as though the wisdom of God had not found
          out a way that was sufficient for the salvation of great sinners.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION X</p>
        <p>The misery of unbelievers</p>
        <p>
          UNBELIEVERS have no portion in this matter. There is a most glorious
          way of salvation, but you, who are unbelievers, have no interest in
          it. The wisdom of God has been gloriously employed for the deliverance
          of men from a miserable, doleful state. But you are never the better
          for it, because you reject it. If you continue in that state, this
          wisdom will do you no good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ is a glorious person, every way fit to be a Savior of sinners,
          a person who has power sufficient, wisdom sufficient, merit
          sufficient, and love sufficient for perfecting this work. And he is
          the only fit person. But you have no right in him. You can lay claim
          to no benefit by his power, wisdom, love, or merits. — This wisdom of
          God has found out a way whereby this Savior might satisfy justice, and
          fulfill the law for us. But you have no lot in the incarnation, death,
          and sufferings of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wisdom of God has contrived a way of salvation that there should
          be procured for us perfect and everlasting happiness. Here is a most
          glorious portion, viz. the Divine Being himself, with his glorious
          perfections. Here it is purchased, that we should see God face to face
          — that we should converse and dwell with God in his own glorious
          habitation — that we should be the children of God, and be conformed
          to him. — Here we have prepared all needed good, both for the souls
          and bodies of sinners, all needed earthly good things while here, and
          glory for both body and soul hereafter forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you are never the better for all this. You have no lot nor portion
          in any of it. Notwithstanding all this rich provision, you remain in
          the same miserable state and condition, in which you came into the
          world. Though the provision of the gospel be so full, yet your poor
          soul remains in a famishing, perishing state. You remain dead in
          trespasses and sins, under the dominion of Satan, in a condemned
          state, having the wrath of God abiding on you, and being daily exposed
          to the dreadful effects of it in hell. Notwithstanding all this
          provision, you remain wretched and miserable, poor and blind and
          naked. O that you might turn to God through Jesus Christ, be numbered
          among his disciples and faithful followers, and so be entitled to
          their privileges! They have an interest in this glorious Savior, and
          are entitled to all the ineffable blessedness of his kingdom, so far
          as their capacities will admit. But you remain without Christ, being
          aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenant of
          promise, having no well-grounded hope, and without God in the world. —
          Further consider a few things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. It argues the great misery of sinners that the wisdom of God should
          be exercised to such a degree in order to find out a way to deliver
          them from it. Their case surely was most deplorable, since it required
          infinite wisdom to find out a way for their deliverance. The wisdom of
          angels was not sufficient. Nothing but divine wisdom could reach and
          remedy their case. And all the persons of the Trinity did enter into a
          consultation about it. If man’s misery were not very great, divine
          wisdom would not have been exercised for his deliverance from it. God
          would not contrive and do things so wonderful in a trivial affair. If
          the salvation of a sinner were not a great salvation, from an
          exceeding great misery, it is not to be supposed, that God’s wisdom
          should be more signalized in this affair than in any other whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          But so it is, this contrivance seems to be spoken of in Scripture as
          the master-piece of divine wisdom. This work of redemption is
          represented as most wonderful, and spoken of in Scripture in the most
          exalted manner of any work of God. — Doubtless therefore salvation is
          a great thing. And consequently the misery that sinners are saved from
          is a great and unspeakable misery. Now this is the misery that you are
          all in, who remain in a natural condition. This is the condemnation
          you lie under. This is the wrath of God that abides upon you. The
          wisdom of God knew it to be a very doleful thing for a person to be in
          a natural state, and therefore did so exercise itself to deliver
          miserable sinners out of it. But this is the state that many among us
          do yet remain in.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Consider, that if you continue in the state you are in, you will
          be so far from being the better for this contrivance, that you will be
          much more miserable for it. The justice and wisdom of the way of
          salvation will be your condemnation. “This is the condemnation, that
          light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than
          light,” John 3:19. If you continue in the state that you are now in,
          it would have been better for you, if Christ had never died for
          sinners, if God had left all mankind to perish, as he did the fallen
          angels. Your punishment then would have been light in comparison of
          what it will be now. You will have greater sins by far to answer for;
          and all your sins will be abundantly the more aggravated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I have been upon this subject, I have observed that the work of
          redemption is an occasion of the elect being brought to greater
          happiness than man could have had, if he had not fallen. And it is
          also true as to reprobates, that it will be an occasion of their
          having greater misery that they would have had, if there had been no
          redemption. 2 Cor. 2:15, “For we are unto God a sweet savour of
          Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish. To the one we
          are a savour of death unto death; and to the other we are a savour of
          life unto life.” If you perish at last, you will be the more miserable
          for the benefits of the gospel being so glorious, and that because
          your crime in rejecting and despising them will be the more heinous.
          Heb. 2:3, “How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation.”
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Whilst you continue an unbeliever, the more you hear of this way
          of salvation, your condition will become the more miserable. The
          longer you sit under the preaching of the gospel, the more doleful
          does you case grow. Your guilt continually increases. For your refusal
          of the gospel, and your rejections of this way of salvation, are so
          much the oftener repeated. Every time you hear the gospel preached,
          you are guilty of renewed rejection of it, the guilt of which
          therefore you will have lying upon you. And the more you hear of the
          suitableness and glory of this way, the greater is your guilt who
          still continue to reject it. Every new illustration of the wisdom and
          grace of God in redemption adds to you guilt. Mat. 23:37, “O
          Jerusalem, Jerusalem — how often would I have gathered thy children
          together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye
          would not!” — What adds to your misery is, that as long as it
          continues, it is a growing evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Consider the danger there is, that you will never have any lot or
          portion in this matter, seeing there are but few that have. Christ has
          told us that strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth
          unto life, and few there be that find it. There have been but few in
          all ages of the world. Many seek, and many hope that they shall
          obtain. There are but few that intend to be damned, while many hope
          that they shall some way or other find means to escape eternal misery.
          But after all, there are but few saved, or obtain the benefits of
          redemption.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION XI</p>
        <p>Exhortation to come to Christ</p>
        <p>
          I CONCLUDE with an use of exhortation to come to Christ, and accept of
          salvation in this way. You are invited to come to Christ, heartily to
          close with him, and trust in him for salvation. And if you do so, you
          shall have the benefit of all, as much as if the whole had been
          contrived for you alone. God has already contrived everything that is
          needful for your salvation. And there is nothing wanting but your
          consent. Since God has taken this matter of the redemption of sinners
          into his own hand, he has made thorough work of it. He has not left it
          for you to finish. Satisfaction is already made, righteousness is
          already wrought out, death and hell are already conquered. The
          Redeemer has already taken possession of glory, and keeps it in his
          hands to bestow on them who come to him. There were many difficulties
          in the way, but they are all removed. The Savior has already triumphed
          over all, and is at the right hand of God, to give eternal life to his
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Salvation is ready brought to your door and the Savior stands, knocks,
          and calls that you would open to him, that he might bring it in to
          you. There remains nothing but your consent. All the difficulty now
          remaining is with your own heart. If you perish now, it must be wholly
          at your door. It must be because you would not come to Christ that you
          might have life, and because you virtually choose death rather than
          life. Pro. 8:36, “He that sinneth against me, wrongeth his own soul:
          all they that hate me love death.” — All that is now required of you
          is that your heart should close with Christ as a Savior. Here
          consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That the wisdom of God has so contrived, that he has forestalled
          all your objections. If you make objections against Christ and the way
          of salvation, they must be all unreasonable. You cannot reasonably
          object that your sins are of such a nature, that God’s honor will not
          allow of your pardon. It is true God insists upon his own honor. He is
          a God that will be honored, and his majesty shall be vindicated. And
          when sinners cast contempt upon him, his honor may be repaired by the
          punishment of sin without the sinner’s suffering, how great soever the
          sin be. Herein the wisdom of this way appears, that there is a
          sufficiency for the greatest and most heinous transgressors.
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot object that God the Father will not be willing to accept
          you, for the Mediator’s sake, for he has chosen his own Son to be a
          mediator, to cut off any such objections. So you may be sure that God
          will receive you if you go to him, through Christ. — You cannot object
          that God the Father has not given sufficient assurance of salvation to
          believers. For the principal things, those which would have been most
          difficult to believe, are already fulfilled. God has already given his
          Son to die for us. This, before it was accomplished, was much more
          strange, and difficult to believe, than that he should give eternal
          life to sinners after Christ died for them. Rom. 8:32, “He that spared
          not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not
          with him freely give us all things.”
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no room to doubt but that if we accept of Christ, God will
          give eternal life. For he has given it already into the hands of our
          Savior for us. He has entrusted him with the whole affair. He has
          given all things into his hands, that he might give eternal life to as
          many as should come to him. The Father has appointed him who died for
          believers, to be their judge, to have the whole determination of the
          matter, and the disposal of the reward, in his own hand. And you
          cannot doubt but that Christ will be willing to bestow eternal life on
          them for whom he purchased it. For if he is not willing to bestow it,
          surely he never would have died to purchase it. Who can think that
          Christ would be so desirous of sinners being saved, as to undergo so
          much for it, and not be willing to let them have it, when he had
          obtained it for them. — Consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The wisdom of God has contrived that there should be in the person
          of the Savior all manner of attractives to draw us to him. He has in
          him all possible excellency. He is possessed of all the beauty and
          glory of the God-head. — So that there can be no manner of excellency,
          nor degree of excellency that we can devise, but what is in the person
          of the Savior. — But yet so redundant has the wisdom of God been, in
          providing attractives in order that we should come to Christ, it has
          so ordered that there should also be all human excellencies in him. If
          there be anything attractive in this consideration, that Christ is one
          in our own nature, one of us, this is true of Christ. He is not only
          in the divine, but in the human nature. He is truly a man, and has all
          possible human excellencies. He was of a most excellent spirit, wise
          and holy, condescending and meek, and of a lowly, benign, and
          benevolent disposition. Again,
        </p>
        <p>
          The wisdom of God has chosen a person of great love to sinners, and
          who should show that love in the most endearing manner possible. What
          more condescending love can there be, than the love of a divine person
          to such worms in the dust? What greater love can there be, than dying
          love? And what more endearing expression of love, than dying for the
          beloved? And the wisdom of God has so contrived, that Christ shall
          sustain that office which should most tend to endear him to us, and
          draw us to him: the office of a redeemer, a redeemer from eternal
          misery, and the purchaser of all happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if all this be not enough to draw us, the wisdom of God has
          ordered more. It has provided us a Savior that should offer himself to
          us in the most endearing relation. He offers to receive us as friends.
          To receive us to an union to himself, to become our spiritual husband
          and portion forever. — And the wisdom of God has provided us a Savior
          that woos in a manner that has the greatest tendency to win our
          hearts. His word is most attractive. He stands at our door and knocks.
          He does not merely command us to receive him, but he condescends to
          apply himself to us in a more endearing manner. He entreats and
          beseeches us in his word and by his messengers.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The wisdom of God has contrived that there should be all manner
          of attractives in the benefits that Christ offers you. There are not
          only the excellencies of the person of Christ to draw you to him, but
          the desirable benefits he offers. Here is what is most suitable to the
          cravings of the human nature. Men when distressed and burdened, long
          for ease and rest. Here it is offered to us in Christ. “Come unto me”,
          says he, “all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give your
          rest.” — Men when in fear of danger, long for safety. Here it is
          provided for us in Christ. God promises that he will become a shield
          and buckler, a strong rock and high tower to those that trust in him.
          — Those that mourn need comfort. Christ tells us that “he came to
          comfort those that mourn,” Isa. 61:2. — The blind need to have their
          eyes opened. The light is sweet to men. Christ offers to anoint our
          eyes with eye salve that we may see glorious light. He will be our
          sun, and the light of God’s countenance. — What is more dear to men
          than life? Christ has purchased for men, that they should live
          forever. Psa. 21:4, “He asked life of thee and thou gavest it him,
          even length of days for ever and ever.” — How greatly is a crown
          prized and admired by the children of men! And Christ offers this —
          not a corruptible crown, but an incorruptible and far more glorious
          crown than any worn by earthly kings; a crown of glory, the luster of
          which shall never fade, nor decay; with an everlasting kingdom. — Do
          men love pleasures? Here are pleasures forevermore. What could there
          be more to draw our hearts to Jesus Christ, and to make us willing to
          accept of him for our Savior, with all his unspeakable benefits?
