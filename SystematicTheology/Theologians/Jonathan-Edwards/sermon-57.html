          Revelation 14:2, “And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of
          many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the
          voice of harpers harping with their harps.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We may observe in these words (1.) What it was that John heard, viz.
          the voice and melody of a company praising God. It is said in the next
          verse that they sung a new song before the throne. (2.) Whence he
          heard this voice, “I heard,” says he, “a voice from heaven.” This
          company that he heard praising God was in heaven. It is said in the
          following verse, “They sung this song before the throne, and before
          the four living creatures, and the elders.” But the throne of God, and
          the four living creatures, and the four and twenty elders, are all
          represented in these visions of John, as being in heaven. So that this
          voice was the voice of the heavenly inhabitants, the voice of the
          blessed and glorious company that is in heaven, before the throne of
          God there. (3.) The kind of voice, which is here set forth in a very
          lively and elegant manner. It is said to be as the voice of many
          waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, and as the voice of
          harpers harping with their harps. Hereby several things are
          represented in a very striking manner. 1. The distance of the voice.
          2. That it was the voice of a vast and innumerable multitude, so that
          it was as the voice of many waters. How naturally does this represent
          the joint, continual, and loud voice of a vast multitude at a
          distance, that it resembled the voice of many waters. 3. The loudness
          of the voice. It was as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of
          a great thunder; which describes the extraordinary fervency of their
          praises, and how lively and vigorous they were therein, and how that
          everyone praised God with all his might. They all, joining together,
          sung with such fervency, that heaven did as it were ring with their
          praises. The noise of thunder, and the roaring of many waters, are the
          most great and majestic sounds ever heard upon earth, and are often
          spoken of in the Scriptures as the mightiest sounds. John could not
          distinctly hear what they sang, but they being in heaven, at a great
          distance, he knew not what better to compare it to, than to the
          roaring of the sea, or a great thunder. Yet, 4. It was a melodious
          sound, signified by this expression, I heard the voice of harpers
          harping with their harps. The harp was a stringed instrument that
          David made much use of in praising God. John represents the matter
          thus to us, That the voice which he heard, being at a great distance,
          it was in distinct; and being of such a vast multitude, and such a
          mighty fervent voice, that it seemed in some measure like distant
          thunder, or the roaring of water, and yet he could perceive the music
          of the voice at the same time. Though it was in some respects as
          thunder and the noise of water, yet there was a sweet and excellent
          melody in it. In short, though these comparisons of which John makes
          use, to signify to us what kind of a voice and sound it was that he
          heard, are exceedingly lively and elegant. Yet this seems to be
          evident from them, that what he heard was inexpressible, and that he
          could find nothing that could perfectly represent it. That a voice
          should be as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great
          thunder, and yet like the voice of harpers, is to us not easily to be
          conceived of. But the case was, that John could find no earthly sound
          that was sufficient to represent it; and therefore such various and
          different similitudes are aggregated and cast together to represent
          it. But thus much seems to be signified by it, that it seemed to be
          the voice of an innumerable multitude, and that they were exceedingly
          fervent and mighty in their praises. That the voice of this multitude
          was very great, and exceedingly full of majesty, and yet a most sweet
          and melodious voice at the same time.

          Doctrine. The work of the saints in heaven doth very much consist in
          praising God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Proposition. The saints in heaven are employed. They are not idle.
          They have there much to do. They have a work before them that will
          fill up eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not to suppose, when the saints have finished their course and
          done the works appointed them here in this world, and are got to their
          journey’s end, to their Father’s house, that they will have nothing to
          do. It is true, the saints when they get to heaven, rest from their
          labors and their works follow them. Heaven is not a place of labor and
          travail, but a place of rest. Heb. 4:9. There remaineth a rest for the
          people of God. And it is a place of the reward of labor. But yet the
          rest of heaven does not consist in idleness, and a cessation of all
          action, but only a cessation from all the trouble and toil and
          tediousness of action. The most perfect rest is consistent with being
          continually employed. So it is in heaven. Though the saints are
          exceedingly full of action, yet their activity is perfectly free from
          all labor, or weariness, or unpleasantness. They shall rest from their
          work, that is, from all work of labor and self-denial, and grief,
          care, and watchfulness, but they will not cease from action. The
          saints in glory are represented as employed in serving God, as well as
          the saints on earth, though it be without any difficulty or
          opposition. Rev. 22:3, “And there shall be no more curse: but the
          throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall
          serve him.” Yea, we are told, that they shall serve God day and night,
          that is, continually or without ceasing. Rev. 7:15, “Therefore are
          they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his
          temple.” And yet this shall be without any manner of trouble, as it
          follows in the next verse. “They shall hunger no more, neither thirst
          any more, neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat.” In this
          world saints labor, as it were, in the wearisome heat of the sun. But
          there, though they shall still serve God, yet shall the sun not light
          on them nor any heat. In one sense, the saints and angels in heaven
          rest not day nor night, Rev. 4:8, that is, they never cease from their
          blessed employment. Perfection of happiness does not consist in
          idleness, but on the contrary, it very much consists in action. The
          angels are blessed spirits, and yet they are exceedingly active in
          serving God. They are as a flame of fire, which is the most active
          thing that we see in this world. God himself enjoys infinite happiness
          and prefect bliss, and yet he is not inactive, but is himself in his
          own nature a perfect act, and is continually at work in bringing to
          pass his own purposes and ends. That principle of holiness that is in
          its perfection in the saints in heaven, is a most active principle. So
          that though they enjoy perfect rest, yet they are a great deal more
          active than they were when in this world. In this world they were
          exceedingly dull, and heavy, and inactive, but now they are a flame of
          fire. The saints in heaven are not merely passive in their happiness.
          They do not merely enjoy God passively, but in an active manner. They
          are not only acted upon by God, but they mutually act towards him, and
          in this action and re-action consists the heavenly happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Proposition. Their employment consists very much in praising God.
        </p>
        <p>
          John the beloved disciple had often visions of heaven, and in almost
          every instance had a vision of the inhabitants as praising God. So in
          the fourth chapter he tells us, that he looked, and behold, a door was
          opened in heaven, and he was called up thither, and that he saw the
          throne of God and him that sat on the throne. And there he gives us an
          account how those that were round about the throne were praising God.
          The four living creatures rest not day nor night, saying, Holy, holy,
          holy Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. And when
          those living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him, the
          four and twenty elders fall down before him and worship him, etc.,
          etc. Again in the fifth chapter, we have an account how they sing
          praises to Christ, Rev. 5:8, 9, etc. And so in Rev. 7:9, 10, 11, 12.
          And in Rev. 11:16, 17. And in the twelfth chapter, 10th verse. And in
          Rev. 15:2, 3, 4. And in the beginning of the nineteenth chapter we
          have an account how the hosts of heaven sing hallelujahs to God. By
          all which it most evidently appears, that their work very much
          consists in praising God and Christ. We have but a very imperfect
          knowledge of the future state of blessedness, and of their employment.
          Without doubt they have various employments there. We cannot
          reasonably question but they are employed in contributing to each
          other’s delight. They shall dwell together in society. They shall also
          probably be employed in contemplating on God, his glorious
          perfections, and glorious works, and so gaining knowledge in these
          things. And doubtless they will be employed many ways, that we know
          nothing of: but this we may determine, that much of their employment
          consists in praising God, and that for the following reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, because they there see God. This is a blessedness promised to
          the saints, that they shall see God, Mat. 5:8. That they see God,
          sufficiently shows the reason why they praise him. They that see God
          cannot but praise him. He is a Being of such glory and excellency that
          the sight of this excellency of his will necessarily influence them
          that behold it to praise him. Such a glorious sight will awaken and
          rouse all the powers of the soul, and will irresistibly impel them,
          and draw them into acts of praise. Such a sight enlarges their souls,
          and fills them with admiration, and with an unspeakable exultation of
          spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          ’Tis from the little that the saints have seen of God, and know of him
          in this world that they are excited to praise him in the degree they
          do here. But here they see but as in a glass darkly; they have only
          now and then a little glimpse of God’s excellency. But then they shall
          have the transcendent gory and divine excellency of God set in their
          immediate and full view. They shall dwell in his immediate glorious
          presence and shall see face to face, 1 Cor. 13:12. Now the saints see
          the glory of God but by a reflected light, as we in the night see the
          light of the sun reflected from the moon. But in heaven they shall
          directly behold the Sun of righteousness, and shall look full upon him
          when shining in all his glory. This being the case, it can be no
          otherwise, but that they should very much employ themselves in
          praising God. When they behold the glorious power of God, they cannot
          but praise that power. When they see God’s wisdom that is so
          wonderful, and infinitely beyond all created wisdom, they cannot but
          continually praise that wisdom. When they view the infinitely pure and
          lovely holiness of God, whereby the heavens themselves are not pure in
          comparison with him, how can they avoid with an exalted heart to
          praise that beauty of the divine nature! When they see the infinite
          grace of God, and see what a boundless ocean of mercy and love he is,
          how can they but celebrate that grace with the highest praise!
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, they will have another sense of the greatness of the fruits of
          God’s mercy than we have here in this world. They will not only have a
          sight of the glorious attributes of God’s goodness and mercy in their
          beatific vision of God, but they will be sensible of the exceeding
          greatness of the fruits of it; the greatness of the benefits that he
          has bestowed. They will have another sense of the greatness and
          manifoldness of the communications of his goodness to his creation in
          general. They will be more sensible how that God is the fountain of
          all good, the Father of lights, from whom proceeds every good and
          perfect gift. We do now but little consider, in comparison with what
          we should do, how full the world is of God’s goodness, and how it
          appears in the sun, moon, and stars, and in the earth and seas, with
          all their fullness, and wheresoever we turn our eyes, and how all
          ranks and orders of being, from the highest angel to the lowest
          insect, are dependent upon, and maintained by, the goodness of God.
          These the saints in heaven clearly see. They see how the universe is
          replenished with his goodness, and how the communications of his
          goodness are incessantly issuing from God as from an everflowing
          fountain, and are poured forth all around in vast profusion into every
          part of heaven and earth, as light is every moment diffused from the
          sun. We have but faint imperfect notions of these things, but the
          saints in heaven see them with perfect clearness. They have another
          sense of the greatness of God’s goodness to mankind, and to the
          church, and to them in particular, than any of us have. They have
          another sense of the greatness of God’s goodness in the temporal
          mercies which God bestowed upon them while they were here in this
          world, though they know that spiritual mercies are infinitely greater.
          But especially they have an immensely greater sense of the exceeding
          greatness of the fruits of God’s grace and mercy bestowed in
          redemption. They have another sense how great a gift the gift of God’s
          only-begotten Son is. They have another sense of the greatness and
          dignity of the person of Christ, and how great a thing it was for him
          to become man, and how great a thing it was for him to lay down his
          life, and to endure the shameful and accursed death of the cross. They
          have another sense how great the benefits are that Christ has
          purchased for men, how great a mercy it is to have sin pardoned, and
          to be delivered from the misery of hell. They have another sense how
          dreadful that misery is, for the damned are tormented in the presence
          of the holy angels and saints, and they see the smoke of their
          torment; and have another sense what eternity is, and so are
          proportionably more sensible how great a mercy it is to be delivered
          from that torment. They have another sense how great a fruit of God’s
          grace it is to be the children of God, and to have a right and title
          to eternal glory. They are sensible of the greatness of the benefits
          that Christ has purchased, by their experience. For they are in
          possession of the blessedness and glory that he has purchased. They
          taste the sweetness of it. And therefore they are more sensible what
          cause they have to praise God for these things. The grace and goodness
          of God in the work of redemption appears so wonderful to them that
          their thoughts of it do excite them to the most ardent praise. When
          they take a view of the grace of God and of the love of Christ in
          redemption, they see that there is cause that they should exert the
          utmost of their capacities, and spend an eternity in praising God and
          the Lamb. It is but a very little that we at best can conceive of the
          greatness of the benefits of redemption, and therefore we are but
          little affected by it, and our praises for it are low and dull things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, another reason is [that] they will be perfect in humility. In
          order to a person’s being rightly disposed to the work of praise, he
          must be an humble person. A proud person is for assuming all praise to
          himself and is not disposed to ascribe it to God. It is humility only
          that will enable us to say from the heart, “Not unto us, not unto us,
          O Lord, but unto thy name be the glory.” The humble person admires the
          goodness and grace of God to him. He sees more how wonderful it is
          that God should take such notice of him, and show such kindness to
          him, that is so much below his notice. Now the saints in heaven have
          this grace of humility perfected in them. They do as much excel the
          saints on earth in humility as in other graces. Though they are so
          much above the saints on earth in holiness and in their exalted state,
          yet they are vastly more humble than the saints on earth be. They are
          as much lower in humility as they are higher in honor and happiness.
          And the reason of it is that they know more of God. They see more of
          his greatness and infinite highness, and therefore are more sensible
          how wonderful it is that God should take so much notice of them, to
          have such communion with them, and give them such a full enjoyment of
          him. They are far more sensible what unworthy creatures they have
          been, that God should bestow such mercies upon them, than the saints
          on earth. They have a greater sight of the evil of sin. They see more
          what filthy vile creatures they were by nature, and how dreadfully
          they provoked God by actual sin, and how they have deserved God’s
          hatred and wrath. The saints in heaven have as much greater a sense of
          their unworthiness in their natural state than the saints on earth as
          they have a greater sense of God’s glorious excellency. For it is the
          sight of God’s excellency which gives them a sight of their own
          unworthiness. And therefore they do proportionally admire the love of
          God to them in giving Christ to die for them, and the love of Christ
          in being willing to offer himself for their sins, and of the wonderful
          mercy of God in their conversion, and bestowing eternal life upon
          them. The humble sense the saints have of their own unworthiness, doth
          greatly engage and enlarge their hearts in praise to him for his
          infinite mercy and grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, their love to God and Christ will be perfect. Love is a
          principal ingredient in the grace of thankfulness. There is a
          counterfeit thankfulness in which there is no love. But there is love
          in exercise in all sincere thankfulness. And the greater any person’s
          love is, the more will he be disposed to praise. Love will cause him
          to delight in the work. He that loves God, proportionably seeks the
          glory of God, and loves to give him glory. Now the hearts of the
          saints in heaven are all, as it were, a pure flame of love. Love is
          the grace that never faileth. Whether there be prophecies, they shall
          fail, whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. Faith shall
          cease in vision, and hope in fruition, but love never faileth. The
          grace of love will be exalted to its greatest height and highest
          perfection in heaven. And love will vent itself in praise. Heaven will
          ring with praise because it is full of love to God. This is the reason
          that great assembly, that innumerable host, [praises] God with such
          ardency, that their praise is as the voice of many waters, and as the
          mighty thunderings, because they are animated by so ardent, vigorous,
          and powerful a principle of divine love.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>I. This subject may be applied in the way of INSTRUCTION.</p>
        <p>
          First, hence we may learn the excellency of this work of praising God.
          That it is a most excellent employment, appears because it is a
          heavenly employment. It is that work wherein the saints and angels are
          continually employed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we sincerely and frequently praise God, we shall therein be like
          the heavenly inhabitants, and join with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          That it is the work of heaven shows it to be the most honorable work.
          No employment can be a greater honor to a man than to praise God. It
          is the peculiar dignity of the nature of man, and the very thing
          wherein his nature is exalted above things without reason, and things
          without life, that he is made capable of actively glorifying his
          Creator. Other creatures do glorify God. The sun, moon, and stars, and
          the earth and waters, and all the trees of the field, and grass and
          herbs, and fishes and insects do glorify God. Psa. 19:1-6; Job 12:7,
          8. But herein is the peculiar dignity of the nature of man, that he is
          capable of glorifying him as a cause, by counsel, understandingly and
          voluntarily, which is a heavenly work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, this doctrine may give us an idea of the glorious and happy
          state of the saints in heaven. It shows how joyfully and gloriously
          they spend their time. Joy is a great ingredient in praise. There is
          an exultation of spirit in fervent praise. Praise is the most joyful
          work in the world. And how joyful a society are they that join
          together, so many thousands and millions of them, with one heart and
          one soul, to sing a new song before the throne, that fill heaven with
          their glorious melody! How joyful they are in their work, appears in
          the text, by their fervency in it, so that their voices resounded as
          the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder. What
          ineffable joy was there in those harpers whom John heard harping with
          their harps!
        </p>
        <p>
          This shows how different a state the saints are in in heaven, from
          what they are in this world. Here much of the work to which the saints
          are called, consists in laboring, in fighting, in toilsome traveling
          in a waste howling wilderness, in mourning and suffering, and in
          offering up strong crying and tears. But there in heaven, their work
          continually is to lift up their joyful songs of praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          This world is a valley of tears, a world filled with sighs and groans.
          One is groaning under some bodily pain. Another is mourning and
          lamenting over a dear departed friend. Another is crying out by reason
          of the arm of the oppressor. But in heaven there is no mixture of such
          sounds as these. There is nothing to be heard amongst them but the
          sweet and glorious melody of God’s praises. There is a holy
          cheerfulness to be seen throughout that blessed society. Rev. 21:4,
          “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be
          no more death, neither sorrow nor crying.” They shall never have
          anything more to do with sighing and crying; but their eternal work
          henceforward shall be praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          This should make us long for heaven, where they spend their time so
          joyfully and gloriously. The saints especially have reason to be
          earnestly breathing after that happy state, where they may in so
          joyful a manner praise God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, this may put natural persons upon reflecting on their own
          state, that they have no part nor lot in this matter. You are an alien
          from the commonwealth of Israel. You are not one of the people of God.
          You do not belong to their society that are to spend their eternity
          after that joyful manner, which you have now heard. You have no right
          nor portion in heaven. If you hereafter come and offer yourself to be
          admitted into this blessed society, in your present state; if you come
          and try to be admitted, you will be thrust out. You will be driven
          away. If you come and knock, and cry to be admitted to the wedding,
          saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us, all will be to no purpose! You will
          hear no other word except Depart! You shall be shut out into outer
          darkness. You shall not be permitted to sing among the children, but
          shall be driven out, to howl among dogs. Rev. 22:14, 15, “Blessed are
          they that do his commandments, that they may have a right to the tree
          of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city; for without
          are dogs,” etc. You are in danger of spending eternity, not in
          joyfully singing praises, but in a quite contrary manner; in weeping,
          in wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and blaspheming God because of your
          pains and because of your plagues. You shall see others coming from
          the east and the west, and sitting down with Abraham, and Isaac, and
          Jacob, in the kingdom of God, taking their places among that blessed,
          happy society, and joining their voices in their heavenly music. But
          you see your lot. You shall have other work to do. Isa. 65:14,
          “Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart; but ye shall cry for
          sorrow of heart, and howl for vexation of spirit.”
        </p>
        <p>
          II. In the way of EXHORTATION. — If it be so that praising God is very
          much the employment of heaven, hence let all be exhorted to the work
          and duty of praising God. The following considerations will show why
          we should be stirred up by this doctrine to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let it be considered that the church on earth is the same
          society with those saints who are praising God in heaven. There is not
          one church of Christ in heaven, and another here upon earth. Though
          the one be sometimes called the church triumphant, and the other the
          church militant, yet they are not indeed two churches. By the church
          triumphant is meant the triumphant part of the church. And by the
          church militant, the militant part of it, for there is but one
          universal or catholic church. Song 6:9, “My dove, my undefiled, is but
          one.” Christ has and hath many members.” The glorious assembly and the
          saints on earth make but one family. Eph. 3:15, “Of whom the whole
          family in heaven and earth is named.” Though some are in heaven, and
          some on earth, in very different circumstances, yet they are all
          united. For there is but one body, and one spirit, and one Lord Jesus
          Christ. One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all,
          and in all. God hath in Christ united the inhabitants of heaven, and
          the holy inhabitants of this earth, and hath made them one. Eph. 1:10,
          “That in the dispensation of the fulness of time, he might gather
          together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and
          which are on earth, even in him.” Heaven is at a great distance from
          the earth. It is called a far country. Mat. 25:14. Yet the distance of
          place does not separate them so as to make two societies. For though
          the saints on earth, at present, are at a distance from heaven, yet
          they belong there. That is their proper home. The saints that are in
          this world are strangers here. And therefore the apostle reproved the
          Christians in his day, for acting as though they belonged to this
          world. Col. 2:20, “Why, as though living in the world, are ye subject
          to ordinances?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of a people may be in their own land, and some in a strange land.
          And yet be but one people. Some of a family may be at home, and some
          sojourning abroad. And yet be but one family. The saints on earth,
          though they be not actually in heaven, yet have their inheritance in
          heaven, and are traveling towards heaven, and will arrive there in a
          little time. They are nearly related to the saints in heaven. They are
          their brethren, being children of the same Father, and fellow heirs
          with Jesus Christ. In Eph. 2:19, the saints on earth are said to be
          fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God. And the
          apostle tells the Christian Hebrews, Heb. 12:22-24, that they were
          “come to mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly
          Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general
          assembly and church of the first-born, which are written in heaven,
          and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made
          perfect.” But how were they come to this heavenly city, and this
          glorious assembly, when they were yet here on earth? They were come to
          them, ere they were brought and united to them in the same family. But
          this is what I would inculcate by all this, that the church of God on
          earth ought to be employed in the same work with the saints in heaven,
          because they are the same society. As they are but one family, have
          but one Father, one inheritance, so they should have but one work. The
          church on earth ought to join with the saints in heaven in their
          employment, as God hath joined them in one society by his grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          We profess to be of the visible people of Christ, to be Christians and
          not heathens, and so belong to the universal church. We profess
          therefore to be of the same society, and shall not walk answerably to
          our profession, unless we employ ourselves in the same work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, let it be considered, that we all of us hope to spend an
          eternity with the saints in heaven, and in the same work of praising
          God. There is, it may be, not one of us but who hopes to be a saint in
          heaven, and there continually to sing praises to God and the Lamb. But
          how disagreeable will it be with such a hope, to live in the neglect
          of praising God now! We ought now to begin that work which we intend
          shall be the work of another world. For this life is given us on
          purpose that therein we might prepare for a future life. The present
          state is a state of probation and preparation, a state of preparation
          for the enjoyments and employment of another, future, and eternal
          state. And no one is ever admitted to those enjoyments and
          employments, but those who are prepared for them here. If ever we
          would go to heaven, we must be fitted for heaven in this world. We
          must here have our souls molded and fashioned for that work and that
          happiness. They must be formed for praise, and they must begin their
          work here. The beginnings of future things are in this world. The seed
          must be sown here. The foundation must be laid in this world. Here is
          laid the foundation of future misery, and of future happiness. If it
          be not begun here, it never will be begun. If our hearts be not in
          some measure tuned to praise in this world, we shall never do anything
          at the work hereafter. The light must dawn in this world, or the sun
          will never rise in the next. As we therefore all of us would be, and
          hope to be, of that blessed company which praise God in heaven, we
          should now inure ourselves to the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, those works of God’s mercy for which the saints in heaven will
          chiefly praise him, have been wrought amongst us in this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mercy and grace of God for which the saints in heaven will chiefly
          praise him is his mercy exercised in he work of redemption, which work
          has been wrought out in this world. This love of God is the chief
          object of their admiration, and what they chiefly contemplate, and
          that employs their most ardent praises.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grace of Christ, about which their praises will be principally
          employed is that he should so love sinful man as to undertake for him,
          to take upon him man’s nature, and lay down his life for him. We find
          that is the subject of their praises in Rev. 5:8, 9, “And when he had
          taken the book, the four living creatures, and the four and twenty
          elders, fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and
          golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints; and they
          sang a new song, Thou art worthy, for thou hast redeemed us to God by
          thy blood.”
        </p>
        <p>
          They will chiefly praise God for these fruits of his mercy, because
          these are the greatest fruits of it that ever have been, far greater
          than the glorifying of saints. The saints in heaven will praise God
          for bestowing glory upon them. But the actual bestowment of glory upon
          them, after it has been purchased by the blood of Christ, is in no
          measure so great a thing as the purchasing of it by his blood. For
          Christ, the eternal Son of God, to become man, and to lay down his
          life, was a far greater thing than the glorifying of all the saints
          that ever have been, or ever will be glorified, from the beginning of
          the world to the end of it. The giving Christ to die, comprehends all
          other mercies. For all other mercies are through this. The giving of
          Christ is a greater thing than the giving of all things else for the
          sake of Christ. This evidently appears, from Rom. 8:32, “He who spared
          not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not
          with him also freely give us all things?” So that the work of
          redemption is that for which the saints in heaven do chiefly praise
          God. But this work has been wrought here, among us in this world. “The
          Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” The incarnation of Christ
          was a thing that was brought to pass in this world, and the sufferings
          and death of Christ were also accomplished on earth. Shall heaven be
          filled with praises for what was done on earth, and shall there be no
          praises on earth where it was done?
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, if you praise God sincerely in this world, it will be a sign
          that you are really to be one of those that shall praise him in
          heaven. If any man be found sincerely glorifying God, he will in due
          time be brought to them, as one who is fit to be of their company.
          Heaven is the appointed place of all sincere praisers of God. They are
          all to be gathered together there. And no man can sincerely praise God
          unless he be one of those who are redeemed from among men, one that
          God has separated from the rest of the world, and set apart for
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, if we begin now to exercise ourselves in the work of heaven, it
          will be the way to have foretastes of the enjoyments of heaven. The
          business and the happiness go together. This will be the way to have
          your heart filled with spiritual joy and comfort. If you heartily
          praise God, you shall rejoice in him, and he will show you more of
          himself, of his glory and love, that you may still have greater cause
          of praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I proceed to give some DIRECTIONS for the performance of this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, be directed, in order to your acceptably performing this duty,
          to repent of your sins, and turn to God. If you have not a work of
          conversion wrought in you, you will do nothing to any purpose in this
          work of praise. An unconverted person never once sincerely or
          acceptably praises God. If you would do the work of the saints in
          heaven, you must be, not only in profession, but really, one of their
          society. For there are none else can do their work. As in the verse
          following the text: “And they sung as it were a new song, before the
          throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no
          man could learn that song, but the hundred and forty-four thousand,
          which were redeemed from the earth.” A hundred and forty-four thousand
          is a mystical number for the church of God, or the assembly of the
          saints, or those that are redeemed from the earth.. There is no man
          can learn the song that they sing in heaven, but those of that number.
          It is beyond the reach of all natural men, let them be persons of ever
          so great abilities and sagacity. They never can learn that heavenly
          song, if they be not of that number. For it is only the sanctifying,
          saving instruction of the Spirit of God, that can teach us that song.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, labor after more and more of those principles from whence the
          praise of the saints in heaven doth arise. You have already heard that
          the saints in heaven do praise the Lord so fervently because they see
          him. Labor therefore that you, though you have not an immediate vision
          of God, as they have, may yet have a clear spiritual sight of him, and
          that you may know more of God, and have frequent discoveries of him
          made to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have heard that the saints in heaven make praise so much their
          work, because of the great sense they have of the greatness and
          wonderfulness of the fruits of the Lord’s goodness. Labor therefore to
          get your minds more deeply impressed with such a sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          The saints in glory are so much employed in praise, because they are
          perfect in humility, and have so great a sense of the infinite
          distance between God and them. They have a great sense of their own
          unworthiness, that they are by nature unworthy of any of the mercy of
          God. Labor therefore that you may obtain more of a sense of your own
          littleness, and vileness; that you may see more what you are, how ill
          you have deserved at the hands of God, and how you are less than the
          least of all his mercies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hearts of the saints in heaven are all inflamed with divine love,
          which continually influences them to praise God. Seek that this
          principle may abound in you, and then you likewise will delight in
          praising God. It will be a most sweet and pleasant employment to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, labor, in your praises, to praise God, so far as may be, in the
          same manner that the saints do in heaven. They praise him fervently,
          with their whole heart, and with all their strength, as was
          represented in vision to John by the exceeding loudness of their
          praise. Labor therefore that you may not be cold and dull in your
          praises, but that you also may praise God fervently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The saints in heaven praise God humbly. Let it also be your delight to
          abase yourselves, to exalt God, and set him upon the throne, and to
          lie at his footstool.
        </p>
        <p>
          The saints in heaven praise God unitedly. They praise him with one
          heart and one soul, in a most firm union. Endeavor that you may thus
          praise God in union with his people, having your hearts knit to them
          in fervent love and charity, which will be a great help to your
          praising and glorifying God unitedly with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. In the way of REPROOF to those who neglect the singing of God’s
          praises. Certainly, such a neglect is not consonant to the hope and
          expectation of spending an eternity in that work. It is an appointment
          of God, that we should not only praise in our prayers, but that we
          should sing his praises. It was a part of divine worship, not only
          under the Old Testament, but the New. Thus we read that Christ and his
          disciples sung praises together, Mat. 26:30. So it is commanded, Eph.
          5:18, 19, “Be ye filled with the Spirit, speaking to yourselves in
          psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in
          your hearts to the Lord.” And Col. 3:16, “Let the word of Christ dwell
          in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in
          psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your
          hearts to the Lord.” 1 Cor. 14:15, “I will sing with the spirit, and I
          will sing with the understanding also.” So also the saints in heaven
          are represented as singing God’s praises. And is that their happy and
          glorious employment; and yet shall it be so neglected by us, who hope
          for heaven? If there be any of the godly that do neglect this duty, I
          would desire them to consider how discordant such a neglect is with
          their profession, with their state, and with the mercies which God has
          bestowed. How much cause has God given you to sing his praise! You
          have received more to prompt you to praise God than all the natural
          men in the world. And can you content yourself to live in the world
          without singing the praises of your heavenly Father, and your glorious
          Redeemer?
        </p>
        <p>
          Parents ought to be careful that their children are instructed in
          singing, that they may be capable of performing that part of divine
          worship. This we should do, as we would have our children trained up
          for heaven, for we all of us would have our children go to heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. In the way of CONSOLATION to the godly. It may be matter of great
          comfort to you that you are to spend your eternity with the saints in
          heaven, where it is so much their work to praise God. The saints are
          sensible what cause they have to praise God, and oftentimes are ready
          to say they long to praise him more and that they never can praise him
          enough. This may be a consolation to you, that you shall have a whole
          eternity in which to praise him. They earnestly desire to praise God
          better. This, therefore, may be your consolation, that in heaven your
          heart shall be enlarged, you shall be enabled to praise him in an
          immensely more perfect and exalted manner than you can do in this
          world. You shall not be troubled with such a dead, dull heart, with so
          much coldness, so many clogs and burdens from corruption, and from a
          earthly mind; with a wandering, unsteady heart; with so much darkness
          and so much hypocrisy. You shall be one of that vast assembly that
          praise God so fervently, that their voice is “as the voice of many
          waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings.”

          You long to have others praise God, to have every one praise him.
          There there will be enough to help you, and join you in praising him,
          and those that are capable of doing it ten thousand times better than
          saints on earth. Thousands and thousands of angels and glorified
          saints will be around you, all united to you in the dearest love, all
          disposed to praise God, not only for themselves, but for his mercy to
          you.
