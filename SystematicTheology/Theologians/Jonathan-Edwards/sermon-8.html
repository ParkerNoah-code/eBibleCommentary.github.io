          Deuteronomy 32:35, “Their foot shall slide in due time.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In this verse is threatened the vengeance of God on the wicked
          unbelieving Israelites, who were God’s visible people, and who lived
          under the means of grace; but who, notwithstanding all God’s wonderful
          works towards them, remained (as ver. 28.) void of counsel, having no
          understanding in them. Under all the cultivations of heaven, they
          brought forth bitter and poisonous fruit; as in the two verses next
          preceding the text. The expression I have chosen for my text, Their
          foot shall slide in due time, seems to imply the following doings,
          relating to the punishment and destruction to which these wicked
          Israelites were exposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That they were always exposed to destruction; as one that stands or
          walks in slippery places is always exposed to fall. This is implied in
          the manner of their destruction coming upon them, being represented by
          their foot sliding. The same is expressed, Psalm 73:18. “Surely thou
          didst set them in slippery places; thou castedst them down into
          destruction.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It implies, that they were always exposed to sudden unexpected
          destruction. As he that walks in slippery places is every moment
          liable to fall, he cannot foresee one moment whether he shall stand or
          fall the next; and when he does fall, he falls at once without
          warning: Which is also expressed in Psalm 73:18, 19. “Surely thou
          didst set them in slippery places; thou castedst them down into
          destruction: How are they brought into desolation as in a moment!”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Another thing implied is, that they are liable to fall of
          themselves, without being thrown down by the hand of another; as he
          that stands or walks on slippery ground needs nothing but his own
          weight to throw him down.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. That the reason why they are not fallen already, and do not fall
          now, is only that God’s appointed time is not come. For it is said,
          that when that due time, or appointed time comes, their foot shall
          slide. Then they shall be left to fall, as they are inclined by their
          own weight. God will not hold them up in these slippery places any
          longer, but will let them go; and then at that very instant, they
          shall fall into destruction; as he that stands on such slippery
          declining ground, on the edge of a pit, he cannot stand alone, when he
          is let go he immediately falls and is lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          The observation from the words that I would now insist upon is this.
          “There is nothing that keeps wicked men at any one moment out of hell,
          but the mere pleasure of God.” By the mere pleasure of God, I mean his
          sovereign pleasure, his arbitrary will, restrained by no obligation,
          hindered by no manner of difficulty, any more than if nothing else but
          God’s mere will had in the least degree, or in any respect whatsoever,
          any hand in the preservation of wicked men one moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth of this observation may appear by the following
          considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. There is no want of power in God to cast wicked men into hell at
          any moment. Men’s hands cannot be strong when God rises up. The
          strongest have no power to resist him, nor can any deliver out of his
          hands.-He is not only able to cast wicked men into hell, but he can
          most easily do it. Sometimes an earthly prince meets with a great deal
          of difficulty to subdue a rebel, who has found means to fortify
          himself, and has made himself strong by the numbers of his followers.
          But it is not so with God. There is no fortress that is any defense
          from the power of God. Though hand join in hand, and vast multitudes
          of God’s enemies combine and associate themselves, they are easily
          broken in pieces. They are as great heaps of light chaff before the
          whirlwind; or large quantities of dry stubble before devouring flames.
          We find it easy to tread on and crush a worm that we see crawling on
          the earth; so it is easy for us to cut or singe a slender thread that
          any thing hangs by: thus easy is it for God, when he pleases, to cast
          his enemies down to hell. What are we, that we should think to stand
          before him, at whose rebuke the earth trembles, and before whom the
          rocks are thrown down?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They deserve to be cast into hell; so that divine justice never
          stands in the way, it makes no objection against God’s using his power
          at any moment to destroy them. Yea, on the contrary, justice calls
          aloud for an infinite punishment of their sins. Divine justice says of
          the tree that brings forth such grapes of Sodom, “Cut it down, why
          cumbereth it the ground?” Luke xiii. 7. The sword of divine justice is
          every moment brandished over their heads, and it is nothing but the
          hand of arbitrary mercy, and God’s mere will, that holds it back.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They are already under a sentence of condemnation to hell. They do
          not only justly deserve to be cast down thither, but the sentence of
          the law of God, that eternal and immutable rule of righteousness that
          God has fixed between him and mankind, is gone out against them, and
          stands against them; so that they are bound over already to hell. John
          iii. 18. “He that believeth not is condemned already.” So that every
          unconverted man properly belongs to hell; that is his place; from
          thence he is, John viii. 23. “Ye are from beneath.” And thither be is
          bound; it is the place that justice, and God’s word, and the sentence
          of his unchangeable law assign to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. They are now the objects of that very same anger and wrath of God,
          that is expressed in the torments of hell. And the reason why they do
          not go down to hell at each moment, is not because God, in whose power
          they are, is not then very angry with them; as he is with many
          miserable creatures now tormented in hell, who there feel and bear the
          fierceness of his wrath. Yea, God is a great deal more angry with
          great numbers that are now on earth: yea, doubtless, with many that
          are now in this congregation, who it may be are at ease, than he is
          with many of those who are now in the flames of hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that it is not because God is unmindful of their wickedness, and
          does not resent it, that he does not let loose his hand and cut them
          off. God is not altogether such an one as themselves, though they may
          imagine him to be so. The wrath of God burns against them, their
          damnation does not slumber; the pit is prepared, the fire is made
          ready, the furnace is now hot, ready to receive them; the flames do
          now rage and glow. The glittering sword is whet, and held over them,
          and the pit hath opened its mouth under them.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The devil stands ready to fall upon them, and seize them as his
          own, at what moment God shall permit him. They belong to him; he has
          their souls in his possession, and under his dominion. The scripture
          represents them as his goods, Luke 11:12. The devils watch them; they
          are ever by them at their right hand; they stand waiting for them,
          like greedy hungry lions that see their prey, and expect to have it,
          but are for the present kept back. If God should withdraw his hand, by
          which they are restrained, they would in one moment fly upon their
          poor souls. The old serpent is gaping for them; hell opens its mouth
          wide to receive them; and if God should permit it, they would be
          hastily swallowed up and lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. There are in the souls of wicked men those hellish principles
          reigning, that would presently kindle and flame out into hell fire, if
          it were not for God’s restraints. There is laid in the very nature of
          carnal men, a foundation for the torments of hell. There are those
          corrupt principles, in reigning power in them, and in full possession
          of them, that are seeds of hell fire. These principles are active and
          powerful, exceeding violent in their nature, and if it were not for
          the restraining hand of God upon them, they would soon break out, they
          would flame out after the same manner as the same corruptions, the
          same enmity does in the hearts of damned souls, and would beget the
          same torments as they do in them. The souls of the wicked are in
          scripture compared to the troubled sea, Isa. 57:20. For the present,
          God restrains their wickedness by his mighty power, as he does the
          raging waves of the troubled sea, saying, “Hitherto shalt thou come,
          but no further;” but if God should withdraw that restraining power, it
          would soon carry all before it. Sin is the ruin and misery of the
          soul; it is destructive in its nature; and if God should leave it
          without restraint, there would need nothing else to make the soul
          perfectly miserable. The corruption of the heart of man is immoderate
          and boundless in its fury; and while wicked men live here, it is like
          fire pent up by God’s restraints, whereas if it were let loose, it
          would set on fire the course of nature; and as the heart is now a sink
          of sin, so if sin was not restrained, it would immediately turn the
          soul into a fiery oven, or a furnace of fire and brimstone.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. It is no security to wicked men for one moment, that there are no
          visible means of death at hand. It is no security to a natural man,
          that he is now in health, and that he does not see which way he should
          now immediately go out of the world by any accident, and that there is
          no visible danger in any respect in his circumstances. The manifold
          and continual experience of the world in all ages, shows this is no
          evidence, that a man is not on the very brink of eternity, and that
          the next step will not be into another world. The unseen, unthought-of
          ways and means of persons going suddenly out of the world are
          innumerable and inconceivable. Unconverted men walk over the pit of
          hell on a rotten covering, and there are innumerable places in this
          covering so weak that they will not bear their weight, and these
          places are not seen. The arrows of death fly unseen at noon-day; the
          sharpest sight cannot discern them. God has so many different
          unsearchable ways of taking wicked men out of the world and sending
          them to hell, that there is nothing to make it appear, that God had
          need to be at the expense of a miracle, or go out of the ordinary
          course of his providence, to destroy any wicked man, at any moment.
          All the means that there are of sinners going out of the world, are so
          in God’s hands, and so universally and absolutely subject to his power
          and determination, that it does not depend at all the less on the mere
          will of God, whether sinners shall at any moment go to hell, than if
          means were never made use of, or at all concerned in the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Natural men’s prudence and care to preserve their own lives, or the
          care of others to preserve them, do not secure them a moment. To this,
          divine providence and universal experience do also bear testimony.
          There is this clear evidence that men’s own wisdom is no security to
          them from death; that if it were otherwise we should see some
          difference between the wise and politic men of the world, and others,
          with regard to their liableness to early and unexpected death: but how
          is it in fact? Eccles. ii. 16. “How dieth the wise man? even as the
          fool.”
        </p>
        <p>
          9. All wicked men’s pains and contrivance which they use to escape
          hell, while they continue to reject Christ, and so remain wicked men,
          do not secure them from hell one moment. Almost every natural man that
          hears of hell, flatters himself that he shall escape it; he depends
          upon himself for his own security; he flatters himself in what he has
          done, in what he is now doing, or what he intends to do. Every one
          lays out matters in his own mind how he shall avoid damnation, and
          flatters himself that he contrives well for himself, and that his
          schemes will not fail. They hear indeed that there are but few saved,
          and that the greater part of men that have died heretofore are gone to
          hell; but each one imagines that he lays out matters better for his
          own escape than others have done. He does not intend to come to that
          place of torment; he says within himself, that he intends to take
          effectual care, and to order matters so for himself as not to fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the foolish children of men miserably delude themselves in their
          own schemes, and in confidence in their own strength and wisdom; they
          trust to nothing but a shadow. The greater part of those who
          heretofore have lived under the same means of grace, and are now dead,
          are undoubtedly gone to hell; and it was not because they were not as
          wise as those who are now alive: it was not because they did not lay
          out matters as well for themselves to secure their own escape. If we
          could speak with them, and inquire of them, one by one, whether they
          expected, when alive, and when they used to hear about hell ever to be
          the subjects of that misery: we doubtless, should hear one and another
          reply, “No, I never intended to come here: I had laid out matters
          otherwise in my mind; I thought I should contrive well for myself: I
          thought my scheme good. I intended to take effectual care; but it came
          upon me unexpected; I did not look for it at that time, and in that
          manner; it came as a thief: Death outwitted me: God’s wrath was too
          quick for me. Oh, my cursed foolishness! I was flattering myself, and
          pleasing myself with vain dreams of what I would do hereafter; and
          when I was saying, Peace and safety, then suddenly destruction came
          upon me.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. God has laid himself under no obligation, by any promise to keep
          any natural man out of hell one moment. God certainly has made no
          promises either of eternal life, or of any deliverance or preservation
          from eternal death, but what are contained in the covenant of grace,
          the promises that are given in Christ, in whom all the promises are
          yea and amen. But surely they have no interest in the promises of the
          covenant of grace who are not the children of the covenant, who do not
          believe in any of the promises, and have no interest in the Mediator
          of the covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that, whatever some have imagined and pretended about promises made
          to natural men’s earnest seeking and knocking, it is plain and
          manifest, that whatever pains a natural man takes in religion,
          whatever prayers he makes, till he believes in Christ, God is under no
          manner of obligation to keep him a moment from eternal destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that, thus it is that natural men are held in the hand of God, over
          the pit of hell; they have deserved the fiery pit, and are already
          sentenced to it; and God is dreadfully provoked, his anger is as great
          towards them as to those that are actually suffering the executions of
          the fierceness of his wrath in hell, and they have done nothing in the
          least to appease or abate that anger, neither is God in the least
          bound by any promise to hold them up one moment; the devil is waiting
          for them, hell is gaping for them, the flames gather and flash about
          them, and would fain lay hold on them, and swallow them up; the fire
          pent up in their own hearts is struggling to break out: and they have
          no interest in any Mediator, there are no means within reach that can
          be any security to them. In short, they have no refuge, nothing to
          take hold of, all that preserves them every moment is the mere
          arbitrary will, and uncovenanted, unobliged forbearance of an incensed
          God.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          The use of this awful subject may be for awakening unconverted persons
          in this congregation. This that you have heard is the case of every
          one of you that are out of Christ.-That world of misery, that lake of
          burning brimstone, is extended abroad under you. There is the dreadful
          pit of the glowing flames of the wrath of God; there is hell’s wide
          gaping mouth open; and you have nothing to stand upon, nor any thing
          to take hold of, there is nothing between you and hell but the air; it
          is only the power and mere pleasure of God that holds you up.
        </p>
        <p>
          You probably are not sensible of this; you find you are kept out of
          hell, but do not see the hand of God in it; but look at other things,
          as the good state of your bodily constitution, your care of your own
          life, and the means you use for your own preservation. But indeed
          these things are nothing; if God should withdraw his band, they would
          avail no more to keep you from falling, than the thin air to hold up a
          person that is suspended in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your wickedness makes you as it were heavy as lead, and to tend
          downwards with great weight and pressure towards hell; and if God
          should let you go, you would immediately sink and swiftly descend and
          plunge into the bottomless gulf, and your healthy constitution, and
          your own care and prudence, and best contrivance, and all your
          righteousness, would have no more influence to uphold you and keep you
          out of hell, than a spider’s web would have to stop a falling rock.
          Were it not for the sovereign pleasure of God, the earth would not
          bear you one moment; for you are a burden to it; the creation groans
          with you; the creature is made subject to the bondage of your
          corruption, not willingly; the sun does not willingly shine upon you
          to give you light to serve sin and Satan; the earth does not willingly
          yield her increase to satisfy your lusts; nor is it willingly a stage
          for your wickedness to be acted upon; the air does not willingly serve
          you for breath to maintain the flame of life in your vitals, while you
          spend your life in the service of God’s enemies. God’s creatures are
          good, and were made for men to serve God with, and do not willingly
          subserve to any other purpose, and groan when they are abused to
          purposes so directly contrary to their nature and end. And the world
          would spew you out, were it not for the sovereign hand of him who hath
          subjected it in hope. There are black clouds of God’s wrath now
          hanging directly over your heads, full of the dreadful storm, and big
          with thunder; and were it not for the restraining hand of God, it
          would immediately burst forth upon you. The sovereign pleasure of God,
          for the present, stays his rough wind; otherwise it would come with
          fury, and your destruction would come like a whirlwind, and you would
          be like the chaff of the summer threshing floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wrath of God is like great waters that are dammed for the present;
          they increase more and more, and rise higher and higher, till an
          outlet is given; and the longer the stream is stopped, the more rapid
          and mighty is its course, when once it is let loose. It is true, that
          judgment against your evil works has not been executed hitherto; the
          floods of God’s vengeance have been withheld; but your guilt in the
          mean time is constantly increasing, and you are every day treasuring
          up more wrath; the waters are constantly rising, and waxing more and
          more mighty; and there is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, that
          holds the waters back, that are unwilling to be stopped, and press
          hard to go forward. If God should only withdraw his hand from the
          flood-gate, it would immediately fly open, and the fiery floods of the
          fierceness and wrath of God, would rush forth with inconceivable fury,
          and would come upon you with omnipotent power; and if your strength
          were ten thousand times greater than it is, yea, ten thousand times
          greater than the strength of the stoutest, sturdiest devil in hell, it
          would be nothing to withstand or endure it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bow of God’s wrath is bent, and the arrow made ready on the
          string, and justice bends the arrow at your heart, and strains the
          bow, and it is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, and that of an
          angry God, without any promise or obligation at all, that keeps the
          arrow one moment from being made drunk with your blood. Thus all you
          that never passed under a great change of heart, by the mighty power
          of the Spirit of God upon your souls; all you that were never born
          again, and made new creatures, and raised from being dead in sin, to a
          state of new, and before altogether unexperienced light and life, are
          in the hands of an angry God. However you may have reformed your life
          in many things, and may have had religious affections, and may keep up
          a form of religion in your families and closets, and in the house of
          God, it is nothing but his mere pleasure that keeps you from being
          this moment swallowed up in everlasting destruction. However
          unconvinced you may now be of the truth of what you hear, by and by
          you will be fully convinced of it. Those that are gone from being in
          the like circumstances with you, see that it was so with them; for
          destruction came suddenly upon most of them; when they expected
          nothing of it, and while they were saying, Peace and safety: now they
          see, that those things on which they depended for peace and safety,
          were nothing but thin air and empty shadows.
        </p>
        <p>
          The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a
          spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you, and is
          dreadfully provoked: his wrath towards you burns like fire; he looks
          upon you as worthy of nothing else, but to be cast into the fire; he
          is of purer eyes than to bear to have you in his sight; you are ten
          thousand times more abominable in his eyes, than the most hateful
          venomous serpent is in ours. You have offended him infinitely more
          than ever a stubborn rebel did his prince; and yet it is nothing but
          his hand that holds you from falling into the fire every moment. It is
          to be ascribed to nothing else, that you did not go to hell the last
          night; that you was suffered to awake again in this world, after you
          closed your eyes to sleep. And there is no other reason to be given,
          why you have not dropped into hell since you arose in the morning, but
          that God’s hand has held you up. There is no other reason to be given
          why you have not gone to hell, since you have sat here in the house of
          God, provoking his pure eyes by your sinful wicked manner of attending
          his solemn worship. Yea, there is nothing else that is to be given as
          a reason why you do not this very moment drop down into hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          O sinner! Consider the fearful danger you are in: it is a great
          furnace of wrath, a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of
          wrath, that you are held over in the hand of that God, whose wrath is
          provoked and incensed as much against you, as against many of the
          damned in hell. You hang by a slender thread, with the flames of
          divine wrath flashing about it, and ready every moment to singe it,
          and burn it asunder; and you have no interest in any Mediator, and
          nothing to lay hold of to save yourself, nothing to keep off the
          flames of wrath, nothing of your own, nothing that you ever have done,
          nothing that you can do, to induce God to spare you one moment. And
          consider here more particularly
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Whose wrath it is: it is the wrath of the infinite God. If it were
          only the wrath of man, though it were of the most potent prince, it
          would be comparatively little to be regarded. The wrath of kings is
          very much dreaded, especially of absolute monarchs, who have the
          possessions and lives of their subjects wholly in their power, to be
          disposed of at their mere will. Prov. 20:2. “The fear of a king is as
          the roaring of a lion: Whoso provoketh him to anger, sinneth against
          his own soul.” The subject that very much enrages an arbitrary prince,
          is liable to suffer the most extreme torments that human art can
          invent, or human power can inflict. But the greatest earthly
          potentates in their greatest majesty and strength, and when clothed in
          their greatest terrors, are but feeble, despicable worms of the dust,
          in comparison of the great and almighty Creator and King of heaven and
          earth. It is but little that they can do, when most enraged, and when
          they have exerted the utmost of their fury. All the kings of the
          earth, before God, are as grasshoppers; they are nothing, and less
          than nothing: both their love and their hatred is to be despised. The
          wrath of the great King of kings, is as much more terrible than
          theirs, as his majesty is greater. Luke 12:4, 5. “And I say unto you,
          my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that,
          have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom you shall
          fear: fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to cast into
          hell: yea, I say unto you, Fear him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is the fierceness of his wrath that you are exposed to. We often
          read of the fury of God; as in Isaiah lix. 18. “According to their
          deeds, accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries.” So Isaiah
          66:15. “For behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his
          chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his
          rebuke with flames of fire.” And in many other places. So, Rev. 19:15,
          we read of “the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty
          God.” The words are exceeding terrible. If it had only been said, “the
          wrath of God,” the words would have implied that which is infinitely
          dreadful: but it is “the fierceness and wrath of God.” The fury of
          God! the fierceness of Jehovah! Oh, how dreadful must that be! Who can
          utter or conceive what such expressions carry in them! But it is also
          “the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.” As though there would be a
          very great manifestation of his almighty power in what the fierceness
          of his wrath should inflict, as though omnipotence should be as it
          were enraged, and exerted, as men are wont to exert their strength in
          the fierceness of their wrath. Oh! then, what will be the consequence!
          What will become of the poor worms that shall suffer it! Whose hands
          can be strong? And whose heart can endure? To what a dreadful,
          inexpressible, inconceivable depth of misery must the poor creature be
          sunk who shall be the subject of this!
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider this, you that are here present, that yet remain in an
          unregenerate state. That God will execute the fierceness of his anger,
          implies, that he will inflict wrath without any pity. When God beholds
          the ineffable extremity of your case, and sees your torment to be so
          vastly disproportioned to your strength, and sees how your poor soul
          is crushed, and sinks down, as it were, into an infinite gloom; he
          will have no compassion upon you, he will not forbear the executions
          of his wrath, or in the least lighten his hand; there shall be no
          moderation or mercy, nor will God then at all stay his rough wind; he
          will have no regard to your welfare, nor be at all careful lest you
          should suffer too much in any other sense, than only that you shall
          not suffer beyond what strict justice requires. Nothing shall be
          withheld, because it is so hard for you to bear. Ezek. viii. 18.
          “Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither
          will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice,
          yet I will not hear them.” Now God stands ready to pity you; this is a
          day of mercy; you may cry now with some encouragement of obtaining
          mercy. But when once the day of mercy is past, your most lamentable
          and dolorous cries and shrieks will be in vain; you will be wholly
          lost and thrown away of God, as to any regard to your welfare. God
          will have no other use to put you to, but to suffer misery; you shall
          be continued in being to no other end; for you will be a vessel of
          wrath fitted to destruction; and there will be no other use of this
          vessel, but to be filled full of wrath. God will be so far from
          pitying you when you cry to him, that it is said he will only “laugh
          and mock,” Prov. 1:25, 26, &amp;c.
        </p>
        <p>
          How awful are those words, Isa. 63:3, which are the words of the great
          God. “I will tread them in mine anger, and will trample them in my
          fury, and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will
          stain all my raiment.” It is perhaps impossible to conceive of words
          that carry in them greater manifestations of these three things, vis.
          contempt, and hatred, and fierceness of indignation. If you cry to God
          to pity you, he will be so far from pitying you in your doleful case,
          or showing you the least regard or favour, that instead of that, he
          will only tread you under foot. And though he will know that you
          cannot bear the weight of omnipotence treading upon you, yet he will
          not regard that, but he will crush you under his feet without mercy;
          he will crush out your blood, and make it fly, and it shall be
          sprinkled on his garments, so as to stain all his raiment. He will not
          only hate you, but he will have you, in the utmost contempt: no place
          shall be thought fit for you, but under his feet to be trodden down as
          the mire of the streets.
        </p>
        <p>
          The misery you are exposed to is that which God will inflict to that
          end, that he might show what that wrath of Jehovah is. God hath had it
          on his heart to show to angels and men, both how excellent his love
          is, and also how terrible his wrath is. Sometimes earthly kings have a
          mind to show how terrible their wrath is, by the extreme punishments
          they would execute on those that would provoke them. Nebuchadnezzar,
          that mighty and haughty monarch of the Chaldean empire, was willing to
          show his wrath when enraged with Shadrach, Meshech, and Abednego; and
          accordingly gave orders that the burning fiery furnace should be
          heated seven times hotter than it was before; doubtless, it was raised
          to the utmost degree of fierceness that human art could raise it. But
          the great God is also willing to show his wrath, and magnify his awful
          majesty and mighty power in the extreme sufferings of his enemies.
          Rom. 9:22. “What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his
          power known, endure with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath
          fitted to destruction?” And seeing this is his design, and what he has
          determined, even to show how terrible the unrestrained wrath, the fury
          and fierceness of Jehovah is, he will do it to effect. There will be
          something accomplished and brought to pass that will be dreadful with
          a witness. When the great and angry God hath risen up and executed his
          awful vengeance on the poor sinner, and the wretch is actually
          suffering the infinite weight and power of his indignation, then will
          God call upon the whole universe to behold that awful majesty and
          mighty power that is to be seen in it. Isa. 33:12-14. “And the people
          shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut up shall they be burnt
          in the fire. Hear ye that are far off, what I have done; and ye that
          are near, acknowledge my might. The sinners in Zion are afraid;
          fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites,” &amp;c.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it will be with you that are in an unconverted state, if you
          continue in it; the infinite might, and majesty, and terribleness of
          the omnipotent God shall be magnified upon you, in the ineffable
          strength of your torments. You shall be tormented in the presence of
          the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb; and when you shall
          be in this state of suffering, the glorious inhabitants of heaven
          shall go forth and look on the awful spectacle, that they may see what
          the wrath and fierceness of the Almighty is; and when they have seen
          it, they will fall down and adore that great power and majesty. Isa.
          lxvi. 23, 24. “And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to
          another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to
          worship before me, saith the Lord. And they shall go forth and look
          upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me; for
          their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched, and
          they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.”<br />
          4. It is everlasting wrath. It would be dreadful to suffer this
          fierceness and wrath of Almighty God one moment; but you must suffer
          it to all eternity. There will be no end to this exquisite horrible
          misery. When you look forward, you shall see a long for ever, a
          boundless duration before you, which will swallow up your thoughts,
          and amaze your soul; and you will absolutely despair of ever having
          any deliverance, any end, any mitigation, any rest at all. You will
          know certainly that you must wear out long ages, millions of millions
          of ages, in wrestling and conflicting with this almighty merciless
          vengeance; and then when you have so done, when so many ages have
          actually been spent by you in this manner, you will know that all is
          but a point to what remains. So that your punishment will indeed be
          infinite. Oh, who can express what the state of a soul in such
          circumstances is! All that we can possibly say about it, gives but a
          very feeble, faint representation of it; it is inexpressible and
          inconceivable: For “who knows the power of God’s anger?”
        </p>
        <p>
          How dreadful is the state of those that are daily and hourly in the
          danger of this great wrath and infinite misery! But this is the dismal
          case of every soul in this congregation that has not been born again,
          however moral and strict, sober and religious, they may otherwise be.
          Oh that you would consider it, whether you be young or old! There is
          reason to think, that there are many in this congregation now hearing
          this discourse, that will actually be the subjects of this very misery
          to all eternity. We know not who they are, or in what seats they sit,
          or what thoughts they now have. It may be they are now at ease, and
          hear all these things without much disturbance, and are now flattering
          themselves that they are not the persons, promising themselves that
          they shall escape. If we knew that there was one person, and but one,
          in the whole congregation, that was to be the subject of this misery,
          what an awful thing would it be to think of! If we knew who it was,
          what an awful sight would it be to see such a person! How might all
          the rest of the congregation lift up a lamentable and bitter cry over
          him! But, alas! instead of one, how many is it likely will remember
          this discourse in hell? And it would be a wonder, if some that are now
          present should not be in hell in a very short time, even before this
          year is out. And it would be no wonder if some persons, that now sit
          here, in some seats of this meeting-house, in health, quiet and
          secure, should be there before to-morrow morning. Those of you that
          finally continue in a natural condition, that shall keep out of hell
          longest will be there in a little time! your damnation does not
          slumber; it will come swiftly, and, in all probability, very suddenly
          upon many of you. You have reason to wonder that you are not already
          in hell. It is doubtless the case of some whom you have seen and
          known, that never deserved hell more than you, and that heretofore
          appeared as likely to have been now alive as you. Their case is past
          all hope; they are crying in extreme misery and perfect despair; but
          here you are in the land of the living and in the house of God, and
          have an opportunity to obtain salvation. What would not those poor
          damned hopeless souls give for one day’s opportunity such as you now
          enjoy!
        </p>
        <p>
          And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ
          has thrown the door of mercy wide open, and stands in calling and
          crying with a loud voice to poor sinners; a day wherein many are
          flocking to him, and pressing into the kingdom of God. Many are daily
          coming from the east, west, north and south; many that were very
          lately in the same miserable condition that you are in, are now in a
          happy state, with their hearts filled with love to him who has loved
          them, and washed them from their sins in his own blood, and rejoicing
          in hope of the glory of God. How awful is it to be left behind at such
          a day! To see so many others feasting, while you are pining and
          perishing! To see so many rejoicing and singing for joy of heart,
          while you have cause to mourn for sorrow of heart, and howl for
          vexation of spirit! How can you rest one moment in such a condition?
          Are not your souls as precious as the souls of the people at Suffield,
          where they are flocking from day to day to Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
          Are there not many here who have lived long in the world, and are not
          to this day born again? and so are aliens from the commonwealth of
          Israel, and have done nothing ever since they have lived, but treasure
          up wrath against the day of wrath? Oh, sirs, your case, in an especial
          manner, is extremely dangerous. Your guilt and hardness of heart is
          extremely great. Do you not see how generally persons of your years
          are passed over and left, in the present remarkable and wonderful
          dispensation of God’s mercy? You had need to consider yourselves, and
          awake thoroughly out of sleep. You cannot bear the fierceness and
          wrath of the infinite God.-And you, young men, and young women, will
          you neglect this precious season which you now enjoy, when so many
          others of your age are renouncing all youthful vanities, and flocking
          to Christ? You especially have now an extraordinary opportunity; but
          if you neglect it, it will soon be with you as with those persons who
          spent all the precious days of youth in sin, and are now come to such
          a dreadful pass in blindness and hardness. And you, children, who are
          unconverted, do not you know that you are going down to hell, to bear
          the dreadful wrath of that God, who is now angry with you every day
          and every night? Will you be content to be the children of the devil,
          when so many other children in the land are converted, and are become
          the holy and happy children of the King of kings?
        </p>
        <p>
          And let every one that is yet out of Christ, and hanging over the pit
          of hell, whether they be old men and women, or middle aged, or young
          people, or little children, now harken to the loud calls of God’s word
          and providence. This acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great
          favours to some, will doubtless be a day of as remarkable vengeance to
          others. Men’s hearts harden, and their guilt increases apace at such a
          day as this, if they neglect their souls; and never was there so great
          danger of such persons being given up to hardness of heart and
          blindness of mind. God seems now to be hastily gathering in his elect
          in all parts of the land; and probably the greater part of adult
          persons that ever shall be saved, will be brought in now in a little
          time, and that it will be as it was on the great out-pouring of the
          Spirit upon the Jews in the apostles’ days; the election will obtain,
          and the rest will be blinded. If this should be the case with you, you
          will eternally curse this day, and will curse the day that ever you
          was born, to see such a season of the pouring out of God’s Spirit, and
          will wish that you had died and gone to hell before you had seen it.
          Now undoubtedly it is, as it was in the days of John the Baptist, the
          axe is in an extraordinary manner laid at the root of the trees, that
          every tree which brings not forth good fruit, may be hewn down and
          cast into the fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, let every one that is out of Christ, now awake and fly from
          the wrath to come. The wrath of Almighty God is now undoubtedly
          hanging over a great part of this congregation: Let every one fly out
          of Sodom: “Haste and escape for your lives, look not behind you,
          escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed.”
