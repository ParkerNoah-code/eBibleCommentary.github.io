          1 Thessalonians 2:16, “To fill up their sins alway; for the wrath is
          come upon them to the uttermost.”
        </p>
        <p>
          IN verse 14, the apostle commends the Christian Thessalonians that
          they became the followers of the churches of God in Judea, both in
          faith and in sufferings. In faith, in that they received the Word, not
          as the word of man, but as it is in truth the Word of God. In
          sufferings, in that they had suffered like things of their own
          countrymen, as they had of the Jews. Upon which the apostle sets forth
          the persecuting, cruel, and perverse wickedness of that people, “who
          both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have,” says he,
          “persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men,
          forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, that they might be saved.”
          Then come in the words of the text; “To fill up their sins alway; for
          the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.”
        </p>
        <p>In these words we may observe two things:</p>
        <p>
          1. To what effect was the heinous wickedness and obstinacy of the
          Jews, viz. to fill up their sins. God hath set bounds to every man’s
          wickedness. He suffers men to live, and to go on in sin, till they
          have filled up their measure, and then cuts them off. To this effect
          was the wickedness and obstinacy of the Jews. They were exceedingly
          wicked, and thereby filled up the measure of their sins a great pace.
          And the reason why they were permitted to be so obstinate under the
          preaching and miracles of Christ, and of the apostles, and under all
          the means used with them, was, that they might fill up the measure of
          their sins. This is agreeable to what Christ said, Mat. 23:31, 32,
          “Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children
          of them which killed the prophets. Fill ye up then the measure of your
          fathers.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The punishment of their wickedness. “The wrath is come upon them to
          the uttermost.” There is a connection between the measure of men’s
          sin, and the measure of punishment. When they have filled up the
          measure of their sin, then is filled up the measure of God’s wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          The degree of their punishment, is the uttermost degree. This may
          respect both a national and personal punishment. If we take it as a
          national punishment, a little after the time when the epistle was
          written, wrath came upon the nation of the Jews to the uttermost, in
          their terrible destruction by the Romans; when, as Christ said, “was
          great tribulation, such as never was since the beginning of the world
          to that time,” Mat. 24:21. That nation had before suffered many of the
          fruits of divine wrath for their sins; but this was beyond all, this
          was their highest degree of punishment as a nation. If we take it as a
          personal punishment, then it respects their punishment in hell. God
          often punishes men very dreadfully in this world; but in hell “wrath
          comes on them to the uttermost.” — By this expression is also denoted
          the certainty of this punishment. For though the punishment was then
          future, yet it is spoken of as present: “The wrath is come upon them
          to the uttermost.” It was as certain as if it had already taken place.
          God, who knows all things, speaks of things that are not as though
          they were; for things present and things future are equally certain
          with him. It also denotes the near approach of it. The wrath IS come;
          i.e. it is just at hand; it is at the door; as it proved with respect
          to that nation; their terrible destruction by the Romans was soon
          after the apostle wrote this epistle.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          When those that continue in sin shall have filled up the measure of
          their sin, then wrath will come upon them to the uttermost.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. PROP. There is a certain measure that God hath set to the sin of
          every wicked man. God says concerning the sin of man, as he says to
          the raging waves of the sea, Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further.
          The measure of some is much greater than of others. Some reprobates
          commit but a little sin in comparison with others, and so are to
          endure proportionably a smaller punishment. There are many vessels of
          wrath; but some are smaller and others greater vessels. Some will
          contain comparatively but little wrath, others a greater measure of
          it. Sometimes, when we see men go to dreadful lengths, and become very
          heinously wicked, we are ready to wonder that God lets them alone. He
          sees them go on in such audacious wickedness, and keeps silence, nor
          does anything to interrupt them, but they go smoothly on, and meet
          with no hurt. But sometimes the reason why God lets them alone is
          because they have not filled up the measure of their sins. When they
          live in dreadful wickedness, they are but filling up the measure which
          God hath limited for them. This is sometimes why God suffers very
          wicked men to live so long; because their iniquity is not full, Gen.
          15:16, “The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.” For this reason
          also God sometimes suffers them to live in prosperity. Their
          prosperity is a snare to them, and an occasion of their sinning a
          great deal more. Wherefore God suffers them to have such a snare,
          because he suffers them to fill up a larger measure. So, for this
          cause, he sometimes suffers them to live under great light, and great
          means and advantages, at the same time to neglect and misimprove all.
          Everyone shall live till he hath filled up his measure.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. PROP. While men continue in sin, they are filling the measure set
          them. This is the work in which they spend their whole lives. They
          begin in their childhood; and if they live to grow old in sin, they
          still go on with this work. It is the work with which every day is
          filled up. They may alter their business in other respects. They may
          sometimes be about one thing and sometimes about another, but they
          never change from this work of filling up the measure of their sins.
          Whatever they put their hands to, they are still employed in this
          work. This is the first thing that they set themselves about when they
          awake in the morning, and the last thing they do at night. They are
          all the while treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath, and the
          revelation of the righteous judgment of God. It is a gross mistake of
          some natural men, who think that when they read and pray they do not
          add to their sins. But on the contrary, [they] think they diminish
          their guilt by these exercises. They think, that instead of adding to
          their sins, they do something to satisfy for their past offenses. But
          instead of that, they do but add to the measure by their best prayers,
          and by those services with which they themselves are most pleased.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. PROP. When once the measure of their sins is filled up, then
          wrath will come upon them to the uttermost. God will then wait no
          longer upon them. Wicked men think that God is altogether such a one
          as themselves, because, when they commit such wickedness, he keeps
          silence. “Because judgment against an evil work is not executed
          speedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set in
          them to do evil.” But when once they shall have filled up the measure
          of their sins, judgment will be executed; God will not bear with them
          any longer. Now is the day of grace, and the day of patience, which
          they spend in filling up their sins. But when their sins shall be
          full, then will come the day of wrath, the day of the fierce anger of
          God. — God often executes his wrath on ungodly men, in a less degree,
          in this world. He sometimes brings afflictions upon them, and that in
          wrath. Sometimes he expresses his wrath in very sore judgments.
          Sometimes he appears in a terrible manner, not only outwardly, but
          also in the inward expressions of it on their consciences. Some,
          before they died, have had the wrath of God inflicted on their souls
          in degrees that have been intolerable. But these things are only
          forerunners of their punishment, only slight foretastes of wrath. God
          never stirs up all his wrath against wicked men while in this world.
          But when once wicked men shall have filled up the measure of their
          sins, then wrath will come upon them to the uttermost; and that in the
          following respects:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Wrath will come upon them without any restraint or moderation in
          the degree of it. God doth always lay, as it were, a restraint upon
          himself. He doth not stir up his wrath. He stays his rough wind in the
          day of his east wind. He lets not his arm light down on wicked men
          with its full weight. But when sinners shall have filled up the
          measure of their sins, there will be no caution, no restraint. His
          rough wind will not be stayed nor moderated. The wrath of God will be
          poured out like fire. He will come forth, not only in anger, but in
          the fierceness of his anger; he will execute wrath with power, so as
          to show what his wrath is, and make his power known. There will be
          nothing to alleviate his wrath. His heavy wrath will lie on them,
          without anything to lighten the burden, or to keep off, in any
          measure, the full weight of it from pressing the soul. — His eye will
          not spare, neither will he regard the sinner’s cries and lamentations,
          however loud and bitter. Then shall wicked men know that God is the
          Lord. They shall know how great that majesty is which they have
          despised, and how dreadful that threatened wrath is which they have so
          little regarded. Then shall come on wicked men that punishment which
          they deserve. God will exact of them the uttermost farthing. Their
          iniquities are marked before him; they are all written in his book.
          And in the future world he will reckon with them, and they must pay
          all the debt. Their sins are laid up in store with God. They are
          sealed up among his treasures; and them he will recompense, even
          recompense into their bosoms. The consummate degree of punishment will
          not be executed till the day of judgment. But the wicked are sealed
          over to this consummate punishment immediately after death; they are
          cast into hell, and there bound in chains of darkness to the judgment
          of the great day; and they know that the highest degree of punishment
          is coming upon them. Final wrath will be executed without any mixture.
          All mercy [and] all enjoyments will be taken away. God sometimes
          expresses his wrath in this world. But here good things and evil are
          mixed together. In the future there will be only evil things.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Wrath will then be executed without any merciful circumstances. The
          judgments which God executes on ungodly men in this world are attended
          with many merciful circumstances. There is much patience and
          long-suffering, together with judgment. Judgments are joined with
          continuance of opportunity to seek mercy. But in hell there will be no
          more exercises of divine patience. The judgments which God exercises
          on ungodly men in this world are warnings to them to avoid greater
          punishments. But the wrath which will come upon them, when they shall
          have filled up the measure of their sin, will not be of the nature of
          warnings. Indeed they will be effectually awakened, and made
          thoroughly sensible, by what they shall suffer. Yet their being
          awakened and made sensible will do them no good. Many a wicked man
          hath suffered very awful things from God in this world, which have
          been a means of saving good. But that wrath which sinners shall suffer
          after death will be no way for their good. God will have no merciful
          design in it. Neither will it be possible that they should get any
          good by that or by anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Wrath will be so executed, as to perfect the work to which wrath
          tends, viz. utterly to undo the subject of it. Wrath is often so
          executed in this life, as greatly to distress persons, and bring them
          into great calamity. Yet not so as to complete the ruin of those who
          suffer it. But in another world, it will be so executed, as to finish
          their destruction, and render them utterly and perfectly undone. It
          will take away all comfort, all hope, and all support. The soul will
          be, as it were, utterly crushed; the wrath will be wholly intolerable.
          It must sink, and will utterly sink, and will have no more strength to
          keep itself from sinking than a worm would have to keep itself from
          being crushed under the weight of a mountain. The wrath will be so
          great, so mighty and powerful, as wholly to abolish all manner of
          welfare, Mat. 21:44, “But on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind
          him to powder.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. When persons shall have filled up the measure of their sin, that
          wrath will come upon them which is eternal. Though men may suffer very
          terrible and awful judgments in this world, yet those judgments have
          an end. They may be long continued, yet they commonly admit of relief.
          Temporal distresses and sorrows have intermissions and respite, and
          commonly by degrees abate and wear off. But the wrath that shall be
          executed, when the measure of sin shall have been filled up, will have
          no end. Thus it will be to the uttermost as to its duration. It will
          be of so long continuance, that it will be impossible it should be
          longer. Nothing can be longer than eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. When persons shall have filled up the measure of their sin, then
          wrath will come upon them to the uttermost of what is threatened. Sin
          is an infinite evil; and the punishment which God hath threatened
          against it is very dreadful. The threatenings of God against the
          workers of iniquity are very awful; but these threatenings are never
          fully accomplished in this world. However dreadful things some men may
          suffer in this life, yet God never fully executes his threatenings for
          so much as one sin, till they have filled up the whole measure. The
          threatenings of the law are never answered by anything that any man
          suffers here. The most awful judgment in this life doth not answer
          God’s threatenings, either in degree, or in circumstances, or in
          duration. If the greatest sufferings that ever are endured in this
          life should be eternal, it would not answer the threatening. Indeed
          temporal judgments belong to the threatenings of the law; but these
          are not answered by them; they are but foretastes of the punishment.
          “The wages of sin is death.” No expression of wrath that are suffered
          before men have filled up the measure of their sin are its full wages.
          But then, God will reckon with them, and will recompense into their
          bosoms the full deserved sum.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          The use I would make of this doctrine is, of warning to natural men,
          to rest no longer in sin, and to make haste to flee from it. The
          things which have been said, under this doctrine, may well be
          awakening, awful considerations to you. It is awful to consider whose
          wrath it is that abides upon you, and of what wrath you are in danger.
          It is impossible to express the misery of a natural condition. It is
          like being in Sodom, with a dreadful storm of fire and brimstone
          hanging over it, just ready to break forth, and to be poured down upon
          it. The clouds of divine vengeance are full, and just ready to burst.
          Here let those who yet continue in sin, in this town, consider
          particularly,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Under what great means and advantages you continue in sin. God is
          now favoring us with very great and extraordinary means and
          advantages, in that we have such extraordinary tokens of the presence
          of God among us. His Spirit is so remarkably poured out, and
          multitudes of all ages, and all sorts, are converted and brought home
          to Christ. God appears among us in the most extraordinary manner,
          perhaps, that ever he did in New England. The children of Israel saw
          many mighty works of God, when he brought them out of Egypt. But we at
          this day see works more mighty, and of a more glorious nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          We who live under such light, have had loud calls; but now above all.
          Now is a day of salvation. The fountain hath been set open among us in
          an extraordinary manner, and hath stood open for a considerable time.
          Yet you continue in sin, and the calls that you have hitherto had have
          not brought you to be washed in it. What extraordinary advantages have
          you lately enjoyed to stir you up! How hath everything in the town, of
          late, been of tendency! Those things which used to be the greatest
          hindrances have been removed. You have not the ill examples of immoral
          persons to be a temptation to you. There is not now that vain worldly
          talk, and ill company, to divert you, and to be a hindrance to you,
          which there used to be. Now you have multitudes of good examples set
          before you. There are many now all around you, who, instead of
          diverting and hindering you, are earnestly desirous of your salvation,
          and willing to do all that they can to move you to flee to Christ.
          They have a thirsting desire for it. The chief talk in the town has of
          late been about the things of religion, and has been such as hath
          tended to promote, and not to hinder, your souls’ good. Everything all
          around you hath tended to stir you up; and will you yet continue in
          sin?
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of you have continued in sin till you are far advanced in life.
          You were warned when you were children; and some of you had awakenings
          then. However, the time went away. You became men and women; and then
          you stirred up again, you had the strivings of God’s Spirit. And some
          of you have fixed the times when you would make thorough work of
          seeking salvation. Some of you perhaps determined to do it when you
          should be married and settled in the world; others when you should
          have finished such a business, and when your circumstances should be
          so and so altered. Now these times have come, and are past; yet you
          continue in sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of you have had remarkable warnings of providence. Some of you
          have been warned by the deaths of near relations. You have stood by,
          and seen others die and go into eternity; yet this hath not been
          effectual. Some of you have been near death yourselves, have been
          brought nigh the grave in sore sickness, and were full of your
          promises how you would behave yourselves, if it should please God to
          spare your lives. Some of you have very narrowly escaped death by
          dangerous accidents; but God was pleased to spare you, to give you a
          further space to repent; yet you continue in sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of you have seen times of remarkable outpourings of the Spirit of
          God, in this town, in times past; but it had no good effect on you.
          You had the strivings of the Spirit of God too, as well as others. God
          did not so pass by your door, but that he came and knocked; yet you
          stood it out. Now God hath come again in a more remarkable manner than
          ever before, and hath been pouring out his Spirit for some months, in
          its most gracious influence; yet you remain in sin until now. In the
          beginning of this awakening, you were warned to flee from wrath and to
          forsake your sins. You were told what a wide door there was open, what
          an accepted time it was, and were urged to press into the kingdom of
          God. And many did press in; they forsook their sins, and believed in
          Christ. But you, when you had seen it, repented not, that you might
          believe him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then you were warned again, and still others have been pressing and
          thronging into the kingdom of God. Many have fled for refuge, and have
          laid hold on Christ; yet you continue in sin and unbelief. You have
          seen multitudes of all sorts, of all ages, young and old, flocking to
          Christ, and many of about your age and your circumstances. But you
          still are in the same miserable condition in which you used to be. You
          have seen persons daily flocking to Christ, as doves to their windows.
          God hath not only poured out his Spirit on this town, but also on
          other towns around us, and they are flocking in there, as well as
          here. This blessing spreads further and further; many, far and near,
          seem to be setting their faces Zionward. Yet you who live here, where
          this work first began, continue behind still; you have no lot or
          portion in this matter.

          2. How dreadful the wrath of God is, when it is executed to the
          uttermost. To make you in some measure sensible of that, I desire you
          to consider whose wrath it is. The wrath of a king is the roaring of a
          lion; but this is the wrath of Jehovah, the Lord God Omnipotent. Let
          us consider, what can we rationally think of it? How dreadful must be
          the wrath of such a Being, when it comes upon a person to the
          uttermost, without any pity, or moderation, or merciful circumstances!
          What must be the uttermost of his wrath, who made heaven and earth by
          the word of his power; who spake, and it was done, who commanded, and
          it stood fast! What must his wrath be, who commandeth the sun, and it
          rises not, and sealeth up the stars! What must his wrath be, who
          shaketh the earth out of its place, and causeth the pillars of heaven
          to tremble! What must his wrath be, who rebuketh the sea, and maketh
          it dry, who removeth the mountains out of their places, and
          overturneth them in his anger! What must his wrath be, whose majesty
          is so awful, that no man could live in the sight of it! What must the
          wrath of such a Being be, when it comes to the uttermost, when he
          makes his majesty appear and shine bright in the misery of wicked men!
          And what is a worm of the dust before the fury and under the weight of
          this wrath, which the stoutest devils cannot bear, but utterly sink,
          and are crushed under it. — Consider how dreadful the wrath of God is
          sometimes in this world, only in a little taste or view of it.
          Sometimes, when God only enlightens conscience, to have some sense of
          his wrath, it causes the stout-hearted to cry out. Nature is ready to
          sink under it, when indeed it is but a little glimpse of divine wrath
          that is seen. This hath been observed in many cases. But if a slight
          taste and apprehension of wrath be so dreadful and intolerable, what
          must it be, when it comes upon persons to the uttermost! When a few
          drops or little sprinkling of wrath is so distressing and overbearing
          to the soul, how must it be when God opens the flood-gates, and lets
          the mighty deluge of his wrath come pouring down upon men’s guilty
          heads, and brings in all his waves and billows upon their souls! How
          little of God’s wrath will sink them! Psa. 2:12, “When his wrath is
          kindled but a little, blessed are all they that put their trust in
          him.”

        <p>
          3. Consider, you know not what wrath God may be about to execute upon
          wicked men in this world. Wrath may, in some sense, be coming upon
          them, in the present life, to the uttermost, for ought we know. When
          it is said of the Jews, “The wrath is come upon them to the
          uttermost,” respect is had, not only to the execution of divine wrath
          on that people in hell, but that terrible destruction of Judea and
          Jerusalem, which was then near approaching, by the Romans. We know not
          but the wrath is now coming, in some peculiarly awful manner, on the
          wicked world. God seems, by the things which he is doing among us, to
          be coming forth for some great thing. The work which hath been lately
          wrought among us is no ordinary thing. He doth not work in his usual
          way, but in a way very extraordinary; and it is probable, that it is a
          forerunner of some very great revolution. We must not pretend to say
          what is in the womb of providence, or what is in the book of God’s
          secret decrees; yet we may and ought to discern the signs of these
          times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though God be now about to do glorious things for his church and
          people, yet it is probable that they will be accompanied with dreadful
          things to his enemies. It is the manner of God, when he brings about
          any glorious revolution for his people, at the same time to execute
          very awful judgments on his enemies, Deu. 32:43, “Rejoice, O ye
          nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his
          servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be
          merciful unto his land, and to his people.” Isa. 3:10, 11, “Say ye to
          the righteous, It shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit
          of their doings. Woe unto the wicked, it shall be ill with him: for
          the reward of his hands shall be given him.” Isa. 65:13, 14,
          “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, my servants shall eat, but
          ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be
          thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:
          behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for
          sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.” We find in
          Scripture, that where glorious times are prophesied to God’s people,
          there are at the same time awful judgments foretold to his enemies.
          What God is now about to do, we know not. But this we may know, that
          there will be no safety to any but those who are in the ark. —
          Therefore it behooves all to haste and flee for their lives, to get
          into a safe condition, to get into Christ. Then they need not fear,
          though the earth be removed, and the mountains carried into the midst
          of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled; though the
          mountains shake with the swelling thereof: for God will be their
          refuge and strength; they need not be afraid of evil tidings; their
          hearts may be fixed, trusting in the Lord.
