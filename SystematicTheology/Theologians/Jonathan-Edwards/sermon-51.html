        <h2>Procrastination – Proverbs 27:1</h2>
        <p class="title">
          Proverbs 27:1, “Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not
          what a day may bring forth.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The design of the wise man in this book of Proverbs, is to give us the
          precepts of true wisdom, or to teach us how to conduct ourselves
          wisely in the course of our lives. Wisdom very much consists in making
          a wise improvement of time, and of the opportunities we enjoy. This is
          often in Scripture spoken of as a great part of true wisdom; as Deu.
          32:29, “O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
          would consider their latter end!” And Psa. 90:12, “So teach us to
          number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.” So the
          wisdom of the wise virgins is represented as consisting much in this,
          that they improved the proper season to buy oil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the wise man in these books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes,
          agreeably to his design, insists on this part of wisdom. He tells us
          the advantage of seeking Christ early; Pro. 8:17. And advises us “to
          do what our hand findeth to do, with our might;” Ecc. 9:10. He advises
          young people to remember their Creator in the days of their youth,
          while the evil days come not, in which they shall say they have no
          pleasure; Ecc. 12:1. So here he advises us to a wise improvement of
          the present season. — In the words are two things to be particularly
          observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The precept, not to boast of tomorrow; i.e. not to speak or act as
          though it were our own. It is absurd for men to boast of that which is
          not theirs. The wise man would not have us behave ourselves as though
          any time were ours but the present. He that boasts of tomorrow, acts
          as though he had tomorrow in his possession, or had something whereby
          he might depend on it, and call it his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The reason given for this precept; for thou knowest not what a day
          may bring forth. It is a good reason why we should not behave
          ourselves as though the morrow were our own, that indeed it is not; we
          are not sure of it; we have no hold of future time; we know not
          whether we shall see the morrow. Or if we do know that we shall see
          it, we know not what we shall see on it. — Hence, we ought to behave
          ourselves every day, as though we had no dependence on any other.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>Needful precautions.</p>
        <p>
          To prevent a misunderstanding of the doctrine, I observe that it is
          not meant, that we should in every respect behave as though we knew
          that we should not live another day. Not depending on another day, is
          a different thing, from concluding, that we shall not live another
          day. We may have reason for the one, and not for the other. We have
          good reason to depend on another day, but we have no reason to
          conclude, that we shall not live another day.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some respects we ought to carry ourselves, as though we know we
          should not live another day, and should improve every day as if it
          were the last. Particularly, we should live every day as
          conscientiously and as holily as if we knew it were the last. We
          should be as careful every day to avoid all sin, as if we knew that
          that night our souls should be required of us. We should be as careful
          to do every duty which God requires of us, and take as much care that
          we have a good account to give to our Judge, of our improvement of
          that day, as if we concluded that we must be called to give an account
          before another day.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in many other respects, we are not obliged to behave ourselves as
          though we concluded that we should not live to another day. If we had
          reason to conclude that we should not live another day, some things
          would not be our duty which now are our duty. As for instance, in such
          a case it would not be the duty of any person to make provision for
          his temporal subsistence during another day. To neglect which, as
          things now are, would be very imprudent and foolish, as the
          consequences would show, if every man were to act in this manner. If
          so, it would never be man’s duty to plow or sow the field, or to lay
          up for winter; but these things are man’s duty; as Pro. 6:6, “Go to
          the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: which having
          no guide, overseer, or ruler, provideth her meat in the summer, and
          gathereth her food in the harvest.” And chap. 10:5, etc. “He that
          gathereth in the summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in
          harvest, is a son that causeth shame.” And many other places might be
          mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, on the other hand, if we were certain that we should not live
          another day, some things would be our duty today, which now are not
          so. As for instance, it would be proper for us to spend our time in
          giving our dying counsels, and in setting our houses in order. If it
          were revealed to us, that we should die before tomorrow morning, we
          ought to look upon it as a call of God to us, to spend the short
          remainder of our lives in those things which immediately concern our
          departure, more than otherwise it would be our duty to do. —
          Therefore, the words which forbid us to boast of tomorrow, cannot be
          extended so far as to signify, that we ought in all respects to live,
          as if we knew we should not see another day. Yet they undoubtedly
          mean, that we ought not to behave ourselves in any respect, as though
          we depended on another day.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>The precept explained.</p>
        <p>
          Boast not thyself of tomorrow. In this precept two things seem to be
          forbidden.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, boasting ourselves of what shall be on the morrow, or behaving
          ourselves as though we depended on particular things to come to pass
          in this world, in some future time. As when men behave themselves, as
          though they depended on being rich, or promoted to honor hereafter; or
          as though they were sure of accomplishing any particular design
          another day. So did the rich man in the gospel, when he did not only
          promise himself, that he should live many years, but promised himself
          also, that he should be rich many years. Hence he said to his soul,
          that he had much goods laid up for many years.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if men act as though they depended upon it, that they should
          another day accomplish such and such things for their souls, then may
          they be said to boast themselves of tomorrow, and not to behave
          themselves as though they depended on no other day. As when they
          behave themselves, as though they depended upon it, that they should
          at another day have such and such advantages for the good of their
          souls; that they should at another day have the strivings of God’s
          Spirit; that they should at another day find themselves disposed to be
          thorough in seeking their salvation; that they should at another day
          have a more convenient season; and that God at another day would stand
          ready to hear their prayers, and show them mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or if they act as though they depended upon it that they should have
          considerable opportunity on a deathbed to seek mercy; or whatever they
          promise themselves should come to pass respecting them in this world,
          if they act as depending on it, they boast themselves of tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, another thing implied, is our boasting of future time itself,
          or acting as though we depended on it, that we should have our lives
          continued to us another day. Not only is the command of God delivered
          in the text transgressed by those who behave themselves as depending
          upon it, that they shall see and obtain such and such things tomorrow;
          but by those who act as depending upon it, that they shall remain in
          being in this world tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both these ways of boasting of tomorrow are reproved by the apostle
          James, chap. 4:13, “Go to now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we
          will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell,
          and get gain.” By promising themselves that they shall do such and
          such things, and that they shall get gain, they boast themselves of
          what shall come to pass in such a time. The apostle in the next verse
          teaches them, that they ought not to do this, no nor so much as depend
          upon seeing another day, or on having their lives continued, verse 14,
          “Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow: for what is your
          life? It is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then
          vanisheth away.” And in verse 15 he teaches us that both are uncertain
          and dependent on the will of God, viz. Whether we shall live another
          day, and if we do, whether such and such things shall come to pass?
          “For that you ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do
          this or that.” Therefore he add in verse 16, “But now you rejoice in
          your boastings; all such rejoicing is evil.”
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>When men act as though they depend on another day.</p>
        <p>
          First, they will do so, if they set their hearts on the enjoyments of
          his life. I mean not, if they have any manner of affection to them. We
          may have some affection to the enjoyments of this world; otherwise
          they would cease to be enjoyments. If we might have no degree of
          rejoicing in them, we would not be thankful for them. Persons may in a
          degree take delight in earthly friends, and other earthly enjoyments.
          It is agreeable to the wise man’s advice that we should do so. Ecc.
          5:18, “It is good and comely for one to eat and drink, and to enjoy
          the good of all this labour that he taketh under the sun.” — But by
          setting our hearts on these things, by placing our happiness on them,
          and letting out the current of our affections after them — by turning
          and fixing our inclinations so much upon them, that we cannot well
          enjoy ourselves without them, so that very much of the strength of the
          faculties of our minds is employed and taken up about these things —
          we show that we have our dependence on another day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man who doth, thus acts as though he depended on another day, yea
          many other days, in the world. For it is most evident, that if the
          enjoyments of this world be of such a nature that they are not to be
          depended on for one day more, they are not worth the setting of our
          hearts upon them, or the placing of our happiness in them. We may
          rejoice in the enjoyments of the world, but not in such a manner as to
          place the rest of our souls in them. As the apostle saith, we should
          rejoice in them as though we rejoiced not, 1 Cor. 7:30. So that if the
          joy should fail, our stock may hold good. And in this case we must
          behave ourselves only as if we had lost a small stream of joy, but
          still had the fountain in full possession. We should conduct ourselves
          as those who have not the fountain of their joy shaken, though some
          appurtenances have failed. Our happiness as to the body of it, if I
          may so speak, should yet stand as on an immovable foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          They who are very much pleased and elated with the enjoyments of the
          world, certainly behave themselves as though they had much dependence
          on their continuance for more than one or two days more. — They who
          addict themselves to vain mirth, and lead a jovial life, show that
          they set their hearts on the enjoyments of the world, and act as those
          who depend on more days than the present. For if they were sensible,
          they could not depend on any future time, but that death would put an
          eternal end to all their carnal mirth before tomorrow, they would have
          no heart to spend the present day in such a manner as they now do. It
          would immediately produce in them a disposition far from levity and
          vanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when persons are very much sunk with the loss of any temporal
          enjoyments, or with any temporal disappointments, it shows that they
          set their hearts upon them, and behave as though they boasted of
          tomorrow, and depended upon their long continuance of life. If they
          had no such dependence, they would not be overwhelmed by their
          frustration. If they be very much sunk, and the comfort of their lives
          destroyed by it, it shows that those temporal enjoyments were too much
          the foundation on which their comfort stood. That which makes a
          building totter, and threatens its destruction, is not the taking away
          of some of the exterior parts of the superstructure, but the removal
          of some considerable part of the foundation on which the house stands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, if men are proud of their worldly circumstances, it shows that
          they have a dependence on tomorrow; for no man would think it worth
          his while to vaunt himself in that which is to be depended on only for
          a day. Though a man have a great estate today, he will not be puffed
          up with it, unless he depend upon having it tomorrow. A man who hath
          no dependence, but that he may tomorrow may be in the grave, where the
          small and great are upon a level, Job 3:19. Will not be much lifted up
          with his advancement to a post of honor. That person will not be proud
          of his rich and fine clothes, who is sensible that he may be stripped
          by death tomorrow, and sent out of the world, as he came naked into
          it. He will not today be very proud of his personal beauty, who hath
          no dependence on escaping tomorrow that stroke of death which will mar
          all his beauty, and make that face which he now thinks so comely,
          appear ghastly and horrid; when instead of a ruddy and florid
          countenance, there will be the blood settled, cold and congealed, the
          flesh stiff and clayey, the teeth set, the eyes fixed and sunk into
          the head. Nor will he today very much affect to beautify and adorn
          with gaudy and flaunting apparel, that body concerning which he is
          sensible that it may be wrapped in a winding sheet tomorrow, to be
          carried to the grave, there to rot, and be covered and filled with
          worms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, when men envy others their worldly enjoyments, their wealth,
          their worldly ease, or their titles and high places — their sensual
          pleasures, or any of their worldly circumstances — it shows, that they
          set their hearts on the things of the world; and that they are not
          sensible that these things are not to be depended upon for another
          day. If they were, they would not think them worth their envy. They
          would appear so worthless in their eyes, that they would not care who
          had them, nor who went without them. — So when they contend about
          worldly possessions and enjoyments (as almost all the contentions that
          are in the world are about these things), it shows that they have
          dependence on tomorrow. Otherwise they would not think the enjoyments
          of the world worth contending about. They would be very much of the
          temper recommended by Jesus Christ. Mat. 5:40, “He that will sue thee
          at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, men behave themselves as if they depended on another day, when
          they rest at ease today, in a condition out of which they must be
          delivered before they die. When a man’s mind is at rest, there is
          something that he rests in. It must have some foundation, either real
          or imaginary. But if the man be in a condition from which he is
          sensible he must some time or other be delivered, or be undone, it is
          impossible that he should rest in the thoughts of remaining in his
          condition always, and never being delivered from it. For no man is
          willing to be ruined. No man can rest in that which he conceives to be
          connected with his own misery and undoing. — Therefore, if he rest in
          such a condition for the present, it must be on a supposition, that he
          shall be delivered from it. If he rest in it today, it must be because
          he depends on being delivered another day, and therefore depends on
          seeing another day.
        </p>
        <p>
          We in this land generally profess, that as we are by sinful nature, we
          are exposed to eternal death, and that therefore there is a necessity
          that we get out of a natural condition some time before we die. And
          those among us who are sensible that they have never passed through
          any such change as in Scripture is called a being born again, though
          they be not sufficiently convinced that there is any such place as
          hell, yet have a kind of belief in it; at least they do not conclude
          that there is no such place, and therefore cannot but be sensible that
          it would be dreadful to die unconverted. Therefore, if they be in a
          considerable degree of ease and quietness in their condition, it must
          be because they have a dependence on being delivered out of such a
          condition some time before they die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inasmuch as they are easy, remaining in such a condition today,
          without any prospect of present deliverance, it shows plainly that
          they depend on another day. If they did not, they could have no
          quietness in their spirits; because, if there be no grounds of
          dependence on any further opportunity, then what they are exposed to,
          by missing the opportunity which they have today, is infinitely
          dreadful. — Persons who are secure in their sins, under the light of
          the gospel, unless they be deceived with a false hope, are generally
          so because they boast themselves of tomorrow. They depend on future
          opportunity; they flatter themselves with hopes of living long in the
          world; they depend on what shall come to pass hereafter; they depend
          on the fulfillment of their good intentions as to what they will do at
          a more convenient season.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, men behave themselves as those who depend on another day, when
          they neglect anything today which must be done before they die. If
          there be anything, which is absolutely necessary to be done sometime
          before death, and the necessity of it be sufficiently declared and
          shown to the person for whom it is thus necessary, if he neglects
          setting about it immediately, sincerely, and with all his might,
          certainly it carries this face with it, that the man depends upon its
          being done hereafter, and consequently that he shall have opportunity
          to do it. — Because, as to those things which are absolutely necessary
          to be done, there is need, not only of a possibility of a future
          opportunity; but of something which is to be depended on, some good
          ground to conclude that we shall have future opportunity. Therefore,
          whoever lives under this gospel, and does not this day thoroughly
          reform his life, by casting away every abomination, and denying every
          lust — and doth not apply himself to the practice of the whole of his
          duty towards God and man, and begin to make religion his main business
          — he acts as one who depends on another day; because he is abundantly
          taught that these things must be done before he dies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who have been seeking salvation for a great while, in a dull,
          insincere, and slightly manner, and find no good effect of it, have
          abundant reason to conclude, that some time before they die, they must
          not only seek, but strive to enter in at the strait gate, and must be
          violent for the kingdom of heaven. And therefore, if they do not begin
          thus today, they act as those who depend on another day. — So those
          who have hitherto lived in the neglect of some particular known duty,
          whether it be secret prayer, or paying some old debt, which they have
          long owed to their neighbor — or the duty of confessing some fault to
          a brother who hath aught against them, or of making restitution for
          some injury — they act as those who depend on another day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth, men behave themselves as though they depended on another day,
          if they do that today which some time or other must be undone. There
          are many things done by men which must be undone by them. They must go
          back again from the way which they have gone, or they are ruined to
          all eternity. Therefore, in doing these things, they act as those who
          depend on future opportunity to undo them. As when a man cheats or
          defrauds his neighbor in anything, he acts as one that boasts of
          tomorrow. For he must undo what he doth before he dies; he must some
          time or other make restitution, or divine justice, which oversees all
          things, and governs the whole world, and will see to it that right be
          done, will not let go its hold of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when men hearken to temptation, and yield to the solicitations of
          their lusts to commit any sin they act as those who depend on another
          day. They do what must be undone. What they then do must be undone by
          hearty and thorough repentance, or they are ruined and lost forever.
          So if persons have been seeking salvation for a time, and afterwards
          are guilty of backsliding, and turn back after their hands have been
          put to the plow, they act as those who depend on another day. For what
          they now do, they must undo some time or other. They must go back
          again from their backsliding, and have all their work to do over
          again. And these things must be undone in this world, while men live;
          for there will be no undoing of them afterwards; they may be suffered
          for, but never can be undone.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IV</p>
        <p>Why we ought not to boast of tomorrow.</p>
        <p>
          I come now to show, why we ought not thus to boast ourselves of
          tomorrow; but on the contrary, to behave ourselves every day as though
          we had no dependence on another. And there is this plain and
          sufficient REASON for it, viz. that we have no grounds of dependence
          on another day. We have neither any foundation to depend upon seeing
          any particular things come to pass another day, which we may hope or
          wish for, nor upon enjoying another day in this world. We have nothing
          for a foundation of dependence that we shall not be in eternity before
          tomorrow, as both reason and experience show. — We have no promise of
          God that we shall ever see another day. We are in God’s hands; our
          lives are in his hands; he hath set out bounds; the number of our
          months and days are with him; nor hath he told them to us. We see that
          the life of man at longest is very short, and nothing is more
          uncertain. And it is a thing universal among mankind, that they know
          not the day of their death. We see that great natural abilities, and
          sharpness of wit, and clearness of discernment, do not help to any
          discovery in this matter. Wise men are as uncertain of the term of
          their lives as others.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are so many ways and means whereby the lives of men come to an
          end, that no circumstances in which a man can be are any security to
          him from death. That it is but a very little while till tomorrow, is
          no good ground of dependence that we shall live till then. We see that
          deaths as sudden as our dying before tomorrow morning, are common in
          the world. We very often see or hear of sudden deaths. How many
          suddenly, in a few minutes, pass from a state of health to a state of
          death, in the daytime, by several kinds of disease, which give no
          warning of their approach, and by many unforeseen accidents! How many
          go to sleep in health, and are found dead in their beds in the
          morning! So that our present health is no good ground of dependence
          that we shall live to see another day. — That persons are now in youth
          is no good ground of dependence upon another day; for sudden
          unexpected deaths are common even among those who are in the bloom of
          youth. Nor is it any ground of dependence in this case, that a man is
          of a more than ordinary healthy and strong constitution. It is found
          by experience, that such are liable to sudden death as well as others.
          Job 21:23, “One dieth in his full strength. His breasts are full of
          milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.”
        </p>
        <p>
          That persons have already lived to see a great many days, and that
          after they had been often in times past, told that they were uncertain
          of any future time. Or that persons have a strong desire to live
          longer; or that they are now very unprepared for death, both on
          temporal and spiritual accounts; is no ground of dependence on the
          future. Death tarries for no man, but comes when and to whom he is
          sent, and strikes the deadly blow, whether the man be prepared or not.
          That men have been very useful in their day, and that it is of great
          importance to their families and neighbors that they should live
          longer, is no ground of dependence. The most useful men are often cut
          down by death, in the midst of their usefulness. The same may be said,
          though we cannot see which way death should come at us before
          tomorrow. To how many accidents, to how many diseases, are we liable,
          which may prove fatal before tomorrow, which yet it is impossible for
          us to foresee! So, if we be very careful of our lives, and our health,
          not to expose ourselves to any dangers, still this is no ground of
          dependence as to any future time. Death comes in many ways which were
          not thought of. Men foresee not the means of their death, any more
          than the fish securely swimming in the water foresee the net, or the
          bird that securely feeds upon the bait sees the snare. It is as the
          wise man observes, in Ecc. 9:12, “For man also knoweth not his time;
          as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are
          caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time,
          when it falleth suddenly upon them.”
        </p>
        <p>SECTION V</p>
        <p>Serious inquiries.</p>
        <p>
          I shall improve this doctrine, by putting you upon examining
          yourselves, whether you do not boast yourselves of tomorrow, or
          whether you do not live in such a manner as you would not, were it not
          that you depend on future time and future opportunity in the world.
          Would not your behavior be very different from what it now is, if you
          every day lived and acted without any dependence on seeing one day
          more? — You cannot but acknowledge it to be most reasonable, that you
          should live and act thus. You cannot but own, that you have no good
          ground of dependence on another day; and therefore that you cannot act
          wisely any otherwise than in acting as one who hath no dependence on
          any such thing. Therefore inquire whether you act wisely and
          reasonably in this respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, do you not set your hearts much more on this world, than you
          would, if you had no dependence on the morrow? Is not the language of
          the rich man in the gospel, the secret language of your hearts? “Soul,
          thou hast much goods laid up for many years,” etc. Is not this the
          language of your hearts, with respect to what you have gotten already;
          which makes you place your happiness so much in it? And with respect
          to what of the world you are seeking and pursuing, is it not with a
          dependence on enjoying it for a great while, when you shall have
          obtained it? Are not your lands and other possessions which you have
          gotten, or are about to get, in your own imagination, yours for a
          great while? — Would your mind be so filled with thoughts and cares
          about these things, so much to the exclusion of another world. Would
          you lay yourselves under so great disadvantages for your soul’s good,
          by involving yourselves in worldly cares, if you had no dependence on
          having anything to do with these things for more than the present day?
          If you did not depend on considerably more time in the world, would
          your inquiry be so much, What shall we eat, and what shall we drink,
          and wherewithal shall we be clothed? And so little, How shall we make
          our calling and election sure? How shall we be assured that we are
          upon a good foundation for another world, and that we are in such a
          state, that death cannot hurt us? How shall we be sure that we are
          ready to appear before the judgment-seat of a heart-searching God? —
          Would there be so much of your time spent in laying up treasure on
          earth — and so little in laying up treasure in heaven, that you might
          have store against the day of death — were it not that you put death
          at a distance? Would you be so much raised at your temporal
          prosperity, and so much sunk when you meet with crosses and
          disappointments in your worldly affairs, if you did not think that
          continuance in the world is to be depended on for more days than the
          present? — Let those who very much affect to adorn their bodies in
          gaudy apparel, inquire whether they would think it worth their while
          to spend so much time to make themselves fine, and to set themselves
          forth as gayer than others, if they really had no dependence that
          their bodies would be preserved one day longer from being clasped in
          the cold arms of death?
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, inquire, whether you would not much less meddle with the
          concerns of others, and be much more employed with your own hearts, if
          each day you had no dependence on living another day. If you were
          sensible that you had had no other day to depend upon than this, you
          would be sensible that you had great affairs of your own to attend to.
          You would find a great deal of business at home between God and your
          own soul. And considering that you cannot depend upon another day, it
          would seem to you that you have but a short time in which to do it,
          and that therefore you have need to be much engaged. You would find so
          much to be done, and so much difficulty in doing it, that you would
          have little leisure, and little heart, to intermeddle with the
          business of others. Your business would be confined to a much narrower
          compass. You would have so much to do at home in your closets, and
          with your own hearts, that you would find no occasion to go abroad for
          intermeddling business to fill up your time.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the truth is, men conceive a great deal of time which they have to
          be filled up, and hence they want business. They depend on tomorrow,
          and the day following, and next month, and next year, yea many years
          to come. When they are young they depend on living to be middle-aged,
          and when middle-aged they depend on old age, and always put far away
          the day of death. Let them be young or old, there always seems to them
          to be a great vacancy between them and death. Hence they wander to and
          fro for business to fill up that vacancy. — Whereas if they were
          sensible of the uncertainty of life, they would, in the first place,
          make sure of their own business. The business of their own precious,
          immortal souls would be done, before they would attend much to the
          business of other people. They would have no desire or disposition to
          concern themselves with every private quarrel which breaks out in the
          neighborhood. They would not think it much concerned them to inquire
          into the matter, and to pass their censure on the affair. They would
          find something else to do, than to sit by the hour together,
          discussing and censuring the conduct of such and such persons,
          gathering up or rehearsing the stories which are carried about to the
          disadvantage of this and that person.
        </p>
        <p>
          We seldom, if ever, see men who are upon sickbeds, and look upon
          themselves very dangerously sick, disposed to spend their time in this
          manner. And the reason is, that they look upon it doubtful whether
          they shall live long. They do not, so much as others, depend on much
          time to spare. Hence their minds are taken up more about their own
          souls’ concerns, than about the concerns of others. So it would be
          with persons in health, if their health did not make them depend on a
          great deal of time in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, if you each day depend on no other than but the present, would
          you not engage and interest yourselves much less in party designs and
          schemes, than you are now wont to do? Among a people divided into two
          parties, as this town hath been for a long time, there is commonly
          much done by the partisans in forming schemes of opposition to one
          another. There is always a strife, who shall get their wills and carry
          their point. This often engages them, if not in open quarrels, in
          secret intrigues. That there is so much done in these things, is a
          certain evidence that they boast themselves of tomorrow, and put death
          at a distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men would certainly find themselves very much indisposed to such
          things, if they were so sensible of the uncertainty of life, as to
          depend on no other day than the present. It is therefore very proper,
          that you should examine yourselves in this particular, at this time.
          If you really depended on no other day than the present, would your
          hearts be so much engaged in strife between two parties, as they often
          are? Would your spirits be so often raised and ruffled? Would you go
          about with so much prejudice against such and such men; harboring so
          much of the old leaven, which so often breaks out in heats of spirit;
          and, as an old sore which was skinned over, but not cured, set to
          raging with a touch which would not have hurt sound flesh? — Commonly
          in the management of a strife between two parties, there is a great
          deal of envy. When any who belong to one of the parties seem to
          prosper, the other party will envy them; it is a grievous thing to
          them. So there is also much contempt. When one of the parties gets the
          ascendant a little over the other, they are ready to make the utmost
          improvement of it, and to insult the other party. — And there is
          commonly in such cases a great deal of mutual secret reproach. When
          those of one party get together, then is the time to inveigh against
          those of the other party, and to set forth their injustice and their
          fraudulent practices. Then is the time for them to pass their censure
          on their words and actions. Then is the time to expose their own
          surmises and suspicions of what the other party intends, what it aims
          at in such and such things, what the purposes of individuals are, and
          what they suppose their secret actions are. — Then is the time for all
          that are friends in the cause, and engaged in the same designs, to
          entertain one another by ridiculing the words and actions of the other
          party, and to make themselves sport of their folly and
          disappointments; and much is done at calling one another Raca and
          fools, or other names equivalent, if not much more than equivalent.
          Then is the time to lay their heads together, to plot and contrive how
          they shall manage such an affair so as to disappoint the other party,
          and obtain their own wills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, these things ought not so to be among a Christian people;
          especially among a people that has made the profession which we have
          made. Nor would they be so if it were not for your dependence on much
          future time in the world. If you were so sensible of your continual
          liableness to death, that every day was the last you depended upon,
          these things certainly would not be so. For let us but consider what
          are the effects of death with respect to such things. It puts an end
          to party-quarrels. Many men hold these quarrels as long as they live.
          They begin young, and hold on through many great and sore afflictions
          and chastisements of Providence. The old sore remains, when the
          supporters of nature bow, and the eyes grow dim, and the hands tremble
          with age. But death, when that comes, puts an end to all their
          quarreling in this world. Death silences the most clamorous, and
          censorious, and backbiting tongue. When men are dead, they cease to
          lay schemes against those of another party. Death dashes all their
          schemes, so far as they have any concern in them. Psa. 146:4, “His
          breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his
          thoughts perish.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When men are dead, they cease to bite and devour others; as it is said
          to have been of old a proverb among the Egyptians, Dead men do not
          bite. There are many who will bite and devour as long as they live,
          but death tames them. Men could not be quiet or safe by them while
          alive, but none will be afraid of them when dead. The bodies of those
          that made such a noise and tumult when alive, when dead, lie as
          quietly among the graves of their neighbors as any others. Their
          enemies, of whom they strove to get their wills while alive, get their
          wills of them when they are dead. Nothing can please their enemies
          better than to have them out of their way. It suits them, that those
          who were so troublesome to them, are locked up safe in the close
          grave, where they will no more stand in their way. — There are no more
          effects of their pride, their craftiness, their hatred and envy. Ecc.
          9:6, “Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy is now
          perished.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The time will soon come, when you who have for many years been at
          times warmly contending one with another, will be very peaceable as to
          this world. Your dead bodies will probably lie quietly together in the
          same burying place. If you do not leave off contending before death,
          how natural will it be for others to have such thoughts as these, when
          they see your corpses; What! Is this the man who used to be so busy in
          carrying on the designs of his party? Oh, now he has done. Now he hath
          no more any part in any of these things. Now it doth not at all
          concern him, who get their wills, or what party is uppermost. We shall
          hear his voice no more in our town meetings. He will not sit any more
          to reproach and laugh at others. He is gone to appear before his
          Judge, and to receive according to his conduct in life. — The
          consideration of such things as these would certainly have a mighty
          effect among us, if we did not put far away the day of death. If all
          acted every day as not depending on any other day, we should be a
          peaceful, quiet people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, inquire, whether or no you do not allow yourselves in some
          things, and endeavor to flatter yourselves that there is no evil in
          them which you would by no means dare to do if you had not a
          dependence on living till tomorrow. It is very common among men, when
          they are strongly enticed to some sinful practice, by their worldly
          interest, or by their carnal appetites, to pretend that they do not
          think there is any evil in it; when indeed they know better. Their
          pretense is only to serve a present turn. And if they expected to have
          their souls required of them that night, they would by no means dare
          to persist in the practice. — Therefore examine the liberties you take
          by this test. What would you think of them, if you now should have the
          following news sent you by some messenger from heaven; John, or Thomas
          (or whatever your name be), this night shall thy soul be required of
          thee. How would such tidings strike you! How would they alter the face
          of things! Doubtless your thoughts would be very quick; you would soon
          begin to reflect on yourselves, and to examine your past and present
          conduct. And in what colors would the liberties you now take, appear
          to you in the case now supposed? Would you then conclude, that there
          is no evil in them? Would you not be less bold to go forward and meet
          death, for having continued in such practices? Would you dare to
          commit such acts again before you die, which now you pretend are
          lawful? Would not the few hours which you would have to live, be at
          all the more uncomfortable to you for having done such things? Would
          you not presently wish that you had let them alone? Yea, would they
          not appear frightful and terrifying to you? If it be thus, it is a
          sign that the reason why you now allow yourselves in them, and plead
          for their lawfulness, is that you put death at a distance, and depend
          on many other days in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, inquire, whether you do not some things on the presumption,
          that you shall hereafter repent of them. Is not this the very thing
          which causes you to dare to do some things? Is it not the very ground
          on which you venture to gratify your lusts? Let young people examine
          all their secret carriage; what they do alone in the dark and in
          secret corners. God knoweth, and your own hearts know, though men do
          not. Put the question impartially to your own consciences; is not this
          the very thing that gives you courage, that God is very merciful, and
          that he often of his sovereign mercy gives repentance of great sins,
          and even willful sins, and in consequence of repentance forgives? And
          so you hope that one day or other he will do so to you. You intend
          some time hereafter earnestly to seek; and you hope you shall be
          awakened. And if you be very earnest, as you intend to be, you hope
          you shall be converted, and then you shall be forgiven, and it will be
          as well as if you had never committed such sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this be the case, consider how you boast of tomorrow, and foolishly
          depend on future opportunity to repent, as well as foolishly presume
          on the mercy of God to give you repentance, at the same time that you
          take a course to provoke God, forever to give you up to a sealed
          hardness and blindness, and to a most fearful damnation; not
          considering that God will glorify his revenging justice as well as his
          mercy; nor remembering the sad example of Esau, “who for a morsel of
          meat sold his birthright; and afterwards, when he would have inherited
          the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance,
          though he sought it carefully with tears.” Heb. 12:16, 17.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth, inquire, whether you improve this day, as one who doth not
          depend upon ever having opportunity to keep another Sabbath, or to
          hear or read another discourse. It appears from what hath been already
          said, that you have no grounds to depend on any more such
          opportunities. Now the day is present, and so you are in the better
          capacity to determine how it is with you. It is but for you to reflect
          upon yourselves, to look inward, and see how it is with you at this
          present time. And how is it? Are you as strict and as diligent in
          keeping this Sabbath, watching your thoughts, keeping your hearts,
          striving in duties both public and private, and improving ordinances,
          as might be expected of one who hath no dependence on ever enjoying
          such an opportunity anymore; one who doth not depend on ever setting
          foot again within the walls of God’s house? — Do you attend to this
          address with that care, and desire, and endeavor to improve it for
          your good, as you would, if you did not depend upon it, that your
          bodies would not be in the grave, and your souls fixed in eternity, in
          their unalterable state, before the next Sabbath?
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventh, are you careful to see to it that grounds of your hope are
          good? A man who hath some hope of being in a state of acceptance with
          God, but is not sure, if he had no dependence on any other day’s
          opportunity of making it sure, would be very strict in examining
          himself and searching the grounds of his hope, and would not rest in
          an uncertainty. He would be very thorough in informing himself what
          might be depended on as good evidence of an interest in Christ, and
          what not; and would be exceedingly strict in searching his own heart,
          to see whether there was anything in him that comes up to the
          requisites laid down in the Scriptures. — If what appears hopeful in
          him were dim and obscure, he would set himself very earnestly to
          obtain that which would be more clear and manifest, and would cry
          earnestly to God for it, and would apply himself to a diligent use of
          means in order to it. And good reason why; for he depends on no other
          opportunity to make his calling and election sure, than what he hath
          today. Inquire therefore whether you be thus thorough in examining
          your hope. And are you thus careful effectually to see to it, that you
          are on a sure foundation? If not, then you behave yourselves as those
          that depend on tomorrow.

        <p>SECTION VI</p>
        <p>How to spend every day.</p>
        <p>
          God hath concealed from us the day of our death, without doubt, partly
          for this end, that we might be excited to be always ready, and might
          live as those that are always waiting for the coming of their Lord,
          agreeably to the counsel which Christ gives us, Mat. 24:42, 43, 44;
          25:13, and Mark 13:32, etc. — That watchman is not faithful who, being
          set to defend a house from thieves, or a city from an enemy at hand,
          will at any hour venture to sleep, trusting that the thief or the
          enemy will not come. Therefore it is expected of the watchman, that he
          behave himself every hour of the night, as one who doth not depend
          upon it that the enemy will tarry until the next hour. Now therefore
          let me, in Christ’s name, renew the call and counsel of Jesus Christ
          to you, to watch as those that know not what hour your Lord will come.
          Let me call upon you who are hitherto in an unrenewed condition.
          Depend not upon, that you will not be in hell before tomorrow morning.
          You have no reason for any such dependence. God hath not promised to
          keep you from it, or to withhold his wrath so long.
        </p>
        <p>
          How can you reasonably be easy or quiet for one day, or one night, in
          such a condition, when you know not but your Lord will come this
          night? And if you should then be found, as you now are, unregenerate,
          how unprepared would you be for his coming, and how fearful would be
          the consequence! Be exhorted therefore, for your own sakes,
          immediately to awake from the sleep of sin, out of sleep, and sleep no
          more, as not depending on any other day. — Let me exhort you to have
          no dependence on any future time; to keep every Sabbath, and to hear
          every sermon, as if it were the last. And when you go into your
          closet, and address yourself to your Father who seeth in secret, do it
          in no dependence on any future opportunity to perform the same duty.
          When you that are young go into company for amusement and diversion,
          consider that it may be the last opportunity of the like nature that
          ever you may have. In all your dealings with your neighbors, act as if
          you were never to make another bargain. Behave in your families
          everyday, as though you depended on no other. — Here I shall offer you
          two motives.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, consider, if you will hearken to this counsel, how much it will
          tend to your safety and peace in life and death. It is the way really
          and truly to be ready for death; yea, to be fit to live or fit to die;
          to be ready for affliction and adversity, and for whatever God in his
          providence shall bring upon you. It is the way to be in, not only an
          habitual, but actual preparedness for all changes, and particularly
          for your last change. — It is the way to possess your souls in a
          serene and undisturbed peace, and to enable you to go on with an
          immovable fortitude of soul, to meet the most frightful changes, to
          encounter the most formidable enemies, and to be ready with unshaken
          confidence to triumph over death whenever you meet him; to have your
          hearts fixed, trusting in God, as one that stands on a firm
          foundation, and hath for his habitation the munition of rocks, that is
          not afraid of evil tidings, but laughs at the fear of the enemy. It
          will be the way for you to possess the quietness and assurance spoken
          of. Isa. 32:17, “The work of righteousness shall be peace, and the
          effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever.” — The
          servant who always stands watching, will not be at all surprised at
          the news that his Lord is coming. This will be the way for you to live
          above the fear of death. Yea, if heaven and earth should shake, you
          may stand firm and unshaken, being settled on a rock, which cannot be
          removed, but abideth forever. O how happy are such persons, who have
          such safety and peace! What a blessed peace is that which arises from
          such a constant preparation for death! How happy therefore is that
          servant whom his Lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing!
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, what dismal calamities and miseries mankind are subject to for
          want of this, for want of behaving themselves every day, as not
          depending on any future day! The way of the world is, one day
          foolishly to depend on another, yea on many others. And what is the
          consequence? Why, the consequence with respect to the greater part of
          the world is, that they live all their days without any true peace or
          rest of soul. They are all their lifetime subject to bondage through
          fear of death. And when death sensibly approaches they are put into a
          terrible fright. They have a dismal view of their past lives. The ill
          improvement of their time, and the sins they have been guilty of,
          stand staring them in the face, and are more frightful to them than so
          many devils. And when they look forward into that eternity whither
          they are going, how dismal is the prospect! O how do their hearts
          shrink at the thought of it! They go before the judgment-seat of God,
          as those that are dragged thither, while they would gladly, if they
          would, hide themselves in the caves and dens of the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what is worse yet than all the disquietude and terror of
          conscience in this world. The consequence of a contrary behavior, with
          respect to the bulk of mankind, is their eternal perdition. They
          flatter themselves that they shall see another day, and then another,
          and trust to that, until finally most of them are swallowed up in
          hell, to lament their folly to all eternity, in the lake that burneth
          with fire and brimstone. — Consider how it was with all the foolish
          virgins who trusted to the delay of the bridegroom’s coming. When he
          came they were surprised, and found unprepared, having no oil in their
          lamps. And while they went to buy, those who were ready went in with
          him to the marriage; and the door was shut against them, and they came
          afterwards crying in vain, Lord, Lord, open to us.
