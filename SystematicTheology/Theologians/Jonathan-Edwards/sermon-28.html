        <p>Psalm 46:10, “Be still, and know that I am God.”</p>
        <p>
          THIS psalm seems to be a song of the church in a time of great
          revolutions and desolations in the world. Therefore the church glories
          in God as her refuge, and strength, and present help, even in times of
          the greatest troubles and overturnings, verses 1-3, “God is our refuge
          and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will we not
          fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried
          into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be
          troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.” The
          church makes her boast of God, not only as being her help, by
          defending her from the desolations and calamities in which the rest of
          the world were involved, but also by supplying her, as a never-failing
          river, with refreshment, comfort, and joy, in the times of public
          calamities. See verse 4, 5, “There is a river, the streams whereof
          shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of
          the Most High. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God
          shall help her, and that right early.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 6th and 8th verses are set forth the terrible changes and
          calamities which were in the world: “The heathen raged, the kingdoms
          were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. Come, behold the
          works of God, what desolations he hath made in the earth.” In the
          verse preceding the text is elegantly set forth the manner in which
          God delivers the church from these calamities, and especially from the
          desolations of war, and the rage of their enemies: “He maketh wars to
          cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the
          spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire;” i.e. he maketh
          wars to cease when they are against his people; he breaketh the bow
          when bent against his saints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then follow the words of the text: “Be still, and know that I am God.”
          The great works of God, wherein his sovereignty appeared, had been
          described in the foregoing verses. In the awful desolations that he
          made, and by delivering his people by terrible things, he showed his
          greatness and dominion. Herein he manifested his power and
          sovereignty, and so commands all to be still, and know that he is God.
          For, says he, “I will be exalted among the heathen; I will be exalted
          in the earth.”
        </p>
        <p>In the words may be observed:</p>
        <p>
          1. A duty described, to be still before God, and under the
          dispensations of his providence; which implies that we must be still
          as to words; not speaking against the sovereign dispensations of
          Providence, or complaining of them; not darkening counsel by words
          without knowledge, or justifying ourselves, and speaking great
          swelling words of vanity. We must be still as to actions and outward
          behavior, so as not to oppose God in his dispensations; and as to the
          inward frame of our hearts, cultivating a calm and quiet submission of
          soul to the sovereign pleasure of God, whatever it be.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We may observe the ground of this duty, viz. the divinity of God.
          His being God is a sufficient reason why we should be still before
          him, in no wise murmuring, or objecting, or opposing, but calmly and
          humbly submitting to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. How we must fulfill this duty, of being still before God, viz. with
          a sense of his divinity, as seeing the ground of this duty, in that we
          know him to be God. Our submission is to be such as becomes rational
          creatures. God doth not require us to submit contrary to reason, but
          to submit as seeing the reason and ground of submission. — Hence, the
          bare consideration that God is God, may well be sufficient to still
          all objections and opposition against the divine sovereign
          dispensations.
        </p>
        <p>This may appear by the following things:</p>
        <p>
          1. In that he is God, he is an absolutely and infinitely perfect
          being; and it is impossible that he should do amiss. As he is eternal,
          and receives not his existence from any other, he cannot be limited in
          his being, or any attribute, to any certain determinate quantity. If
          anything have bounds fixed to it, there must be some cause or reason
          why those bounds are fixed just where they are. Whence it will follow,
          that every limited thing must have some cause. And therefore that
          being which has no cause must be unlimited.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is most evident by the works of God, that his understanding and
          power are infinite. For he that hath made all things out of nothing,
          and upholds, and governs, and manages all things every moment, in all
          ages, without growing weary, must be of infinite power. He must also
          be of infinite knowledge; for if he made all things, and upholds and
          governs all things continually, it will follow, that he knows and
          perfectly sees all things, great and small, in heaven and earth,
          continually at one view; which cannot be without infinite
          understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being thus infinite in understanding and power, he must also be
          perfectly holy; for unholiness always argues some defect, some
          blindness. Where there is no darkness or delusion, there can be no
          unholiness. It is impossible that wickedness should consist with
          infinite light. God being infinite in power and knowledge, he must be
          self-sufficient and all-sufficient. Therefore it is impossible that he
          should be under any temptation to do anything amiss; for he can have
          no end in doing it. When any are tempted to do amiss, it is for
          selfish ends. But how can an all-sufficient Being, who wants nothing,
          be tempted to do evil for selfish ends? So that God is essentially
          holy, and nothing is more impossible than that God should do amiss.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As he is God, he is so great, that he is infinitely above all
          comprehension. And therefore it is unreasonable in us to quarrel with
          his dispensations, because they are mysterious. If he were a being
          that we could comprehend, he would not be God. It would be
          unreasonable to suppose any other, than that there should be many
          things in the nature of God, and in his works and government, to us
          mysterious, and which we never can fully find out.
        </p>
        <p>
          What are we? and what do we make of ourselves, when we expect that God
          and his ways should be upon a level with our understandings? We are
          infinitely unequal to any such thing, as comprehending God. We may
          less unreasonably expect that a nutshell should contain the ocean: Job
          11:7, etc. “Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out
          the Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven, what canst thou
          do? deeper than hell, what canst thou know? The measure thereof is
          longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.” If we were sensible
          of the distance which there is between God and us, we should see the
          reasonableness of that interrogation of the apostle, Rom. 9:20, “Who
          art thou, O man, that repliest against God?”
        </p>
        <p>
          If we find fault with God’s government, we virtually suppose ourselves
          fit to be God’s counselors; whereas it becomes us rather, with great
          humility and adoration, to cry out with the apostle, Rom. 11:33, etc.
          “O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
          How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! For
          who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his counselor?
          Or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him
          again? For of him, and through him, and to him are all things: to whom
          be glory for ever.” If little children should rise up and find fault
          with the supreme legislature of a nation, or quarrel with the
          mysterious administrations of the sovereign, would it not be looked
          upon that they meddled with things too high for them? And what are we
          but babes? Our understandings are infinitely less than those of babes,
          in comparison with the wisdom of God. It becomes us therefore to be
          sensible of it, and to behave ourselves accordingly. Psa. 131:1, 2,
          “Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither do I
          exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. Surely
          I have behaved and quieted myself as a child.” This consideration
          alone of the infinite distance between God and us, and between God’s
          understanding and ours, should be enough to still and quiet us
          concerning all that God does, however mysterious and unintelligible to
          us. — Nor have we any right to expect, that God should particularly
          explain to us the reason of his dispensations. It is fit that God
          should not give any account of his matters to us, worms of the dust,
          that we may be sensible of our distance from him, and adore and submit
          to him in humble reverence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore we find, that when Job was so full of difficulty about the
          divine dispensations, God did not answer him by particularly
          explaining the reasons of his mysterious providence; but by showing
          him what a poor worm, what a nothing he was, and how much he himself
          was above him. This more became God than it would have done, to enter
          into a particular debate with him, or to unfold the mysterious
          difficulties. It became Job to submit to God in those things that he
          could not understand, and to this the reply tended to bring him. It is
          fit that God should dwell in thick darkness, or in light to which no
          man can approach, which no man hath seen nor can see. No wonder that a
          God of infinite glory shines with a brightness too strong and mighty
          for mortal eyes. For the angels themselves, those mighty spirits, are
          represented as covering their faces in this light; Isa. 6.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As he is God, all things are his own, and he hath a right to
          dispose of them according to his own pleasure. All things in this
          lower world are his; Job 41:11, “Whatsoever is under the whole heaven
          is mine.” Yea, the whole universe is God’s; Deu. 10:14, “Behold the
          heaven, and the heaven of heavens is the Lord’s; the earth also with
          all that is therein.” All things are his, because all things are from
          him; they are wholly from him, and from him alone. Those things which
          are made by men, are not wholly from them. When a man builds a house,
          it is not wholly from him. Nothing of which the house is made has its
          being from him. But all creatures are wholly and entirely the fruits
          of God’s power, and therefore it is fit that they should be subject
          to, and for, his pleasure. Pro. 16:4 — And as all things are from God,
          so they are upheld in being by him, and would sink into nothing in a
          moment, if he did not uphold them. And all things are to him. Rom.
          11:36, “For by him, and through him, and to him are all things.” Col.
          1:16, 17, “For by him were all things created that are in heaven, and
          that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or
          dominions, principalities or powers: all things were created by him
          and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things
          consist.” All mankind are his; their lives, and breath, and being;
          “for in him we live, and move, and have our being.” Our souls and
          capacities are from him. Eze. 18:4, “All souls are mine: as the soul
          of the father, so also the soul of the son, is mine.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. In that he is God, he is worthy to be sovereign over all things.
          Sometimes men are the owners of more than they are worthy of. But God
          is not only the owner of the whole world, as all is from and dependent
          on him; but such is his perfection, the excellency and dignity of his
          nature, that he is worthy of sovereignty over all. No man ought in the
          temper of his mind to be opposite to God’s exercising the sovereignty
          of the universe, as if he were not worthy of it; for to be the
          absolute sovereign of the universe is not a glory or dignity too great
          for him. All things in heaven and earth, angels and men, are nothing
          in comparison with him. All are as the drop of the bucket, and as the
          light dust of the balance. It is therefore fit that everything should
          be in his hands, to be disposed of according to his pleasure. — His
          will and pleasure are of infinitely greater importance than the will
          of creatures. It is fit that his will should take place, though
          contrary to the will of all other beings; that he should make himself
          his own end; and order all things for himself. — God is possessed of
          such perfections and excellencies as to qualify him to be the absolute
          sovereign of the world. — Certainly it is more fit that all things be
          under the guidance of a perfect unerring wisdom, than that they should
          be left to themselves to fall in confusion, or be brought to pass by
          blind causes. Yea, it is not fit that any affairs within the
          government of God should be left without the direction of his wise
          providence; least of all, things of the greatest importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is absurd to suppose, that God is obliged to keep every creature
          from sinning and exposing himself to an adequate punishment. For if
          so, then it will follow, that there can be no such thing as a moral
          government of God over reasonable creatures. And it would be an
          absurdity for God to give commands; for he himself would be the party
          bound to see to the performance, and there could be no use of promises
          or threatenings. But if God may leave a creature to sin, and to expose
          himself to punishment, then it is much fitter and better that the
          matter should be ordered by wisdom, who should justly lie exposed by
          sin to punishment, and who not; than that it be left to come to pass
          by confused chance. It is unworthy of the Governor of the world to
          leave things to chance; it belongs to him to govern all things by
          wisdom. — And as God has wisdom to qualify him to be sovereign, so he
          has power also to enable him to execute the determinations of wisdom.
          And he is essentially and invariably holy and righteous, and
          infinitely good; whereby he is qualified to govern the world in the
          best manner. — Therefore, when he acts as sovereign of the world, it
          is fit that we should be still and willingly submit, and in no wise
          oppose his having the glory of his sovereignty; but should in a sense
          of his worthiness, cheerfully ascribe it to him, and say, “Thine is
          the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever;” and say with those
          in Rev. 5:13, “Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to him
          that sitteth upon the throne.”
        </p>
        <p>
          5. In that he is God, he will be sovereign, and will act as such. He
          sits on the throne of his sovereignty, and his kingdom ruleth over
          all. He will be exalted in his sovereign power and dominion, as he
          himself declares; “I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be
          exalted in the earth.” He will have all men to know, that he is most
          high over all the earth. He doth according to his will in the armies
          of heaven and amongst the inhabitants of the earth, and none can stay
          his hand. — There is no such thing as frustrating, or baffling, or
          undermining his designs; for he is great in counsel, and wonderful in
          working. His counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure.
          There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord.
          Whatsoever God doth, it shall be forever. Nothing shall be put to it,
          nor anything taken from it. He will work, and who shall let it? He is
          able to dash in pieces the enemy. If men join hand in hand against
          him, to hinder or oppose his designs, he breaks the bow, he cuts the
          spear in sunder, he burneth the chariot in the fire. — He kills and he
          makes alive, he brings down and raises up just as he pleases. Isa.
          45:6, 7, “That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the
          west, that there is none besides me. I am the Lord, and there is none
          else; I form the light and create darkness; I make peace and create
          evil; I the Lord do all these things.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Great men, and rich men, and wise men cannot hinder God from doing his
          pleasure. He leadeth counselors away spoiled, he accepteth not the
          persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor. There
          are many devices in a man’s heart, but the counsel of the Lord that
          shall stand, and the thoughts of his heart to all generations. — When
          he gives quietness, who can make trouble? When he hides his face, who
          can behold him? He breaketh down, and it cannot be built up again: he
          shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. When he purposeth, who
          shall disannul it? And when his hand is stretched out, who shall turn
          it back? — So there is no hindering God from being sovereign, and
          acting as such. “He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
          will he hardeneth.” He hath the keys of hell and of death. He openeth,
          and no man shutteth: he shutteth, and no man openeth. This may show us
          the folly of opposing ourselves against the sovereign dispensations of
          God; and how much more wisely they act who quietly and sweetly submit
          to his sovereign will.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. In that he is God, he is able to avenge himself on those who oppose
          his sovereignty. He is wise of heart, and mighty in strength. Who hath
          hardened himself against God and prospered? He that will contend with
          God must answer it. And what a poor creature is man to fight against
          God! Is he able to make his part good with him? Whoever of God’s
          enemies deal proudly, he will show that he is above them. They will be
          but as the chaff before the whirlwind, and shall be as the fat of
          lambs. They shall consume into smoke, they shall consume away. “Who
          would set the briers and thorns against him in battle? He would go
          through them, he would burn them together.” Isa. 27:4.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          A manifold improvement might be made of this doctrine, which a little
          reflection may suggest to each of us. But the improvement which I
          shall at this time make of it, shall be only in a use of reproof to
          such under convictions of sin, and fears of hell, as are not still,
          but oppose the sovereignty of God in the disposals of his grace. This
          doctrine shows the unreasonableness, and dreadful wickedness, of your
          refusing heartily to own the sovereignty of God in this matter. It
          shows that you know not that God is God. If you knew this, you would
          be inwardly still and quiet; you would humbly and calmly lie in the
          dust before a sovereign God, and would see sufficient reason for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In objecting and quarreling about the righteousness of God’s laws and
          threatenings, and his sovereign dispensations towards you and others,
          you oppose his divinity, you show your ignorance of his divine
          greatness and excellency, and that you cannot bear that he should have
          divine honor. It is from low, mean thoughts of God, that you do in
          your minds oppose his sovereignty, that you are not sensible how
          dangerous your conduct is, and what an audacious thing it is for such
          a creature as man to strive with his Maker.
        </p>
        <p>
          What poor creatures are you, that you should set up yourselves for
          judges over the Most High; that you should take it upon [yourself] to
          call God to an account; that you should say to the great Jehovah, what
          dost thou? and that you should pass sentence against him! If you knew
          that he is God, you would not act in this manner. But this knowledge
          would be sufficient to still and calm you concerning all God’s
          dispensations, and you would say with Eli, in 1 Sam. 3:18, “It is the
          Lord, let him do what seemeth good in his sight.” — But here I shall
          be more particular in several things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is from mean thoughts of God that you are not convinced that you
          have by your sins deserved his eternal wrath and curse. If you had any
          proper sense of the infinite majesty, greatness, and holiness of God,
          you would see, that to be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone,
          and there to have no rest day nor night, is not a punishment more than
          equal to the demerit of sin. — You would not have so good a thought of
          yourselves; you would not be so clean and pure in your own eyes; you
          would see that vile, unworthy, hell-deserving creatures you are. If
          you had not little thoughts of God, and were to consider how you have
          set yourselves against him — how you have slighted him, his
          commandments and threatenings, and despised his goodness and mercy,
          how often you have disobeyed, how obstinate you have been, how your
          whole lives have been filled up with sin against God — you would not
          wonder that God threatens to destroy you forever, but would wonder
          that he hath not actually done it before now.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you had not mean thoughts of God, you would not find fault with him
          for not setting his love on you who never exercised any love to him.
          You would not think it unjust in God not to seek your interest and
          eternal welfare, who never would be persuaded at all to seek his
          glory. You would not think it unjust in him to slight and disregard
          you, who have so often and so long made light of God. If you had not
          mean thoughts of God, you never would think him obliged to bestow
          eternal salvation upon you, who have never been truly thankful for one
          mercy which you have already received of him. — What do you think of
          yourselves? What great ideas have you of yourselves? And what thoughts
          have you of God, that you think he is obliged to do so much for you
          though you treat him ever so ungratefully for the kindness which he
          hath already bestowed upon you all the days of your lives? It must be
          from little thoughts of God, that you think it unjust in him not to
          regard you when you call upon him; when he hath earnestly called to
          you, so long and so often, and you would not be persuaded to hearken
          to him. What thoughts have you of God, that you think he is more
          obliged to hear what you say to him, than you are to regard what he
          says to you?
        </p>
        <p>
          It is from diminutive thoughts of God, that you think he is obliged to
          show mercy to you when you seek it, though you have been for a long
          time willfully sinning against him, provoking him to anger, and
          presuming that he would show you mercy when you should seek it. What
          kind of thoughts have you of God, that you think he is obliged, as it
          were, to yield himself up to be abused by men, so that when they have
          done, his mercy and pardoning grace shall not be in his own power, but
          he must be obliged to dispense them at their call?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is from little thoughts of God, that you quarrel against his
          justice in the condemnation of sinners, from the doctrine of original
          sin. It must be because you do not know him to be God, and will not
          allow him to be sovereign. It is for want of a sense how much God is
          above you, that those things in him which are above your
          comprehension, are such difficulties and stumbling-blocks to you. It
          is for want of a sense how much the wisdom and understanding of God
          are above yours, and what poor, short-sighted, blind creatures you
          are, in comparison with him. If you were sensible what God is, you
          would see it most reasonable to expect that his ways should be far
          above the reason of man, and that he dwells in light which no man can
          approach unto, which no man hath seen, nor can see. — If men were
          sensible how excellent and perfect a Being he is, they would not be so
          apt to be jealous of him and to suspect him in things which lie beyond
          their understandings. It would be no difficulty with them to trust God
          out of sight. What horrid arrogance in worms of the dust, that they
          should think they have wisdom enough to examine and determine
          concerning what God doth, and to pass sentence on it as unjust! If you
          were sensible how great and glorious a being God is, it would not be
          such a difficulty with you to allow him the dignity of such absolute
          sovereignty, as that he should order as he pleases, whether every
          single man should stand for himself, or whether a common father should
          stand for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is from mean thoughts of God, that you trust in your own
          righteousness, and think that God ought to respect you for it. If you
          knew how great a Being he is, if you saw that he is God indeed, you
          would see how unworthy, how miserable a present it is to be offered to
          such a Being. It is because you are blind, and know not what a Being
          he is with whom you have to do, that you make so much of your own
          righteousness. If you had your eyes open to see that he is God indeed,
          you would wonder how you could think to commend yourselves to so great
          a Being by your gifts, by such poor affections, such broken prayers,
          wherein is so much hypocrisy, and so much selfishness. — If you had
          not very mean thoughts of God, you would wonder that ever you could
          think of purchasing the favor and love of so great a God by your
          services. You would see that it would be unworthy of God to bestow
          such a mercy upon you, and peace with him, and his everlasting love,
          and the enjoyment of himself, for such a price as you have to offer;
          and that he would exceedingly dishonor himself in so doing. — If you
          saw what God is, you would exclaim, as Job did, Job 42:5, 6, “Now mine
          eye seeth thee; wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and
          ashes.” And as Isaiah did, Isa. 6:5, “Woe is me, for I am undone,
          because I am a man of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King,
          the Lord of hosts.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is from mean thoughts of God, that you contend with him, because
          he bestows grace on some, and not on others. Thus God does. He hath
          mercy on whom he will have mercy; he takes one, and leaves another, of
          those who are in like circumstances; as it is said of Jacob and Esau,
          while they were not yet born, and had done neither good nor evil, Rom.
          9:10-13. With this sinners often quarrel. But they who upon this
          ground quarrel with God, suppose him to be bound to bestow his grace
          on sinners. For if he be bound to none, then he may take his choice,
          and bestow it on whom he pleases. And his bestowing it on some brings
          no obligation on him to bestow it on others. Has God no right to his
          own grace? Is it not at his own disposal? And is God incapable of
          making a gift or present of it to any man? For a person cannot make a
          present of that which is not his own, or in his own right. It is
          impossible to give a debt.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what a low thought of God does this argue! Consider what it is you
          would make of God. Must he be so tied up, that he cannot use his own
          pleasure in bestowing his own gifts? Is he obliged to bestow them on
          one, because it is his pleasure to bestow them on another? Is not God
          worthy to have the same right to dispose of his gifts, as a man has of
          his money? Or is it because God is not so great, and therefore should
          be more subject, more under bounds, than men? Is not God worthy to
          have as absolute a propriety in his goods as man has in his? At this
          rate, God cannot make a present of anything; he has nothing of his own
          to bestow. If he have a mind to show a peculiar favor to some, to lay
          some under special obligations, he cannot do it, on the supposition,
          because his favor is not at his own disposal! The truth is, men have
          low thoughts of God, or else they would willingly ascribe sovereignty
          to him in this matter. Mat. 20:15, “Is it not lawful for me to do what
          I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?”
        </p>
        <p>
          God is pleased to show mercy to his enemies, according to his own
          sovereign pleasure. And surely it is fit he should. How unreasonable
          is it to think that God stands bound to his enemies! Therefore
          consider what you do in quarreling with God, and opposing his
          sovereignty. Consider with whom it is you contend. Let all who are
          sensible of their misery, and afraid of the wrath of God, consider
          these things. Those of you who have been long seeking salvation, but
          are in great terrors through fear that God will destroy you, consider
          what you have heard, be still, and know that he is God. When God seems
          to turn a deaf ear to your cries; when he seems to frown upon you;
          when he shows mercy to others, your equals, or those who are worse,
          and who have been seeking a less time than you; — be still. Consider
          who he is that disposes and orders these things. You shall consider
          it. You shall know it. He will make all men to know that he is God.
          You shall either know it for your good here, by submission, or to your
          cost hereafter.
