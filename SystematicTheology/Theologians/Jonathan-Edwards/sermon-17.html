          Luke 16:31, “And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the
          prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the
          dead.”
        </p>
        <p>
          WE here have an account how the rich man in hell — after he had in
          vain begged of Abraham to send Lazarus to his relief-prays that
          Lazarus may be sent to his brethren to warn them, that they might take
          care for their salvation, and escape that place of torment. By the
          way, it may be proper to remark, that we cannot from this conclude,
          that the damned will have any workings of natural affection to their
          near relations in this world, or any concern for their salvation. The
          design of Christ was only parabolically to represent what different
          thoughts worldly and wicked men will have of things, when in hell,
          from what they have while on earth. The rich man, when he was upon
          earth, only minded his honor, ease, and pleasure, and did not think it
          worth while to take care of his soul, and to be at much pains to
          escape hell. But now he is of another mind, and is sensible that if
          his five brethren, who live in the same careless neglect of their
          souls as he did, knew what hell is, they would take more care.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this seems to be put into the parable chiefly to introduce what
          follows, the reply which Abraham made to him, They have Moses and the
          prophets, let them hear them. As much as to say, they have already
          abundant warning and instruction, which God himself hath provided for
          them, let them make use of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rich man replies, Nay, Father Abraham, but if one went unto them
          from the dead, they will repent. Then come in the words of the text,
          And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither
          will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. By Moses and
          the prophets is meant the whole Old Testament, which was the whole
          canon of Scripture which they had in those times. The hearing of them
          implies, attending to what they say, believing them, and obeying them
          — they would not be persuaded — that is, they would not be persuaded
          to take thorough care of their souls, to forsake their sins and turn
          to God, so as to avoid this place of torment — though one rose from
          the dead; though one should go from the invisible world, either from
          heaven, where they see the torments of the damned, or from hell, where
          they feel them.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          The warnings of God’s Word are more fitted to obtain the ends of
          awakening sinners, and bringing them to repentance, than the rising of
          one from the dead to warn them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this passage, Moses and the prophets seem not only to be equalized
          to the warnings of one from the invisible world, but to be preferred
          before them. They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.
          They have already those means which God in his infinite wisdom hath
          seen to be fittest for them, and more suitable to their nature and
          circumstances, than the rising of one from the dead. — But whether
          there can be any more than an equality necessarily inferred or not;
          yet if only the warnings of the Old Testament have an equal tendency
          to bring men to repentance, as the rising of one from the dead; then
          surely these, together with the much clearer revelation under the
          gospel-dispensation by Christ and his apostles — wherein we are
          abundantly more plainly told of another world, and wherein life and
          immortality are brought to light — must have a much greater tendency
          and fitness to obtain these ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sinners are apt to find fault with the means of grace which they
          enjoy, and to say with themselves, If I had ever seen hell, or had
          ever heard the cries of the damned, or had ever seen a person who had
          felt hell-torments, or had seen them at a distance, that would awaken
          me; then I would for sake all my sins, and would do whatever I could
          to escape hell. But now I am only told of hell in the Bible and by
          ministers; and there never was any in this world that saw or felt it:
          so that I am ready to think it is mere delusion and fancy. How do I
          know that there is any hell? How do I know but that when I die there
          will be an end of me?
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is the indisposition of sinners to this great work, to which
          they are directed, which makes them find fault with their means and
          advantages. The slothful and negligent, who hate to bestir themselves,
          are they who object. “The way of the slothful is as a hedge of
          thorns.” — Sinners know not what they would have. They are fixedly
          averse to breaking off their sins by righteousness. And to make the
          matter the more excusable, they object against the sufficiency of
          their means, and so they will not believe, except they see hell, or
          see some person who has seen it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But God, who knows our nature and circumstances, knows what is most
          adapted to them. He who made the faculties of our souls, knows what
          will have the greatest tendency to move them, and to work upon them.
          He who is striving with us, to bring us to repentance and salvation,
          uses the fittest and best means. In contriving and appointing the
          means of our salvation, he chooses better for us than we should for
          ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose a person should rise from the dead to warn sinners, either
          from heaven, where they see the misery of the damned, or from hell,
          where they feel it; and should tell how dismal those torments are,
          having seen or felt them; and suppose he should confirm what he said,
          by declaring that he had seen the smoke of their torments, the raging
          of the flames, the dreadful crew of devils and damned souls together,
          and had heard their dismal cries and shrieks; or suppose he should say
          that he had felt them, and should express by words and actions the
          doleful state of the damned and the extremity of their torments; this
          would probably greatly fright and terrify many sinners who were not
          terrified by reading the Bible, nor by hearing preaching about
          hell-torments. But it would be very much because of the unusualness
          and strangeness of the thing. Men are apt to be much affected with
          strange things, and to be much affrighted by specters in the dark,
          because they are unusual. But if they were as common as preaching is,
          they would lose their effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might be that on such an unusual occasion, as the rising of one
          from the dead, for a while men would reform their lives, and possibly
          some might be so affected as never to forget it. But we are to
          consider which would have the greatest tendency to awaken us, if both
          were alike new and unusual, to be warned of the misery of hell by the
          great God himself, declaring as it were from heaven how dreadful hell
          is, and abundantly warning us about it; or to be warned only by a man
          coming from the invisible world, who had either seen or felt these
          miseries. It is in this view that we shall consider the matter; and we
          shall show what advantages the former mode of warning has above the
          latter; or how the warnings of God’s Word have a greater tendency to
          awaken sinners and bring them to repentance, than the rising of one
          from the dead to warn them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. God, in many respects, knows better what belongs to the punishment
          of sinners than departed souls. Departed souls doubtless know what
          hell-torments are, much better than any on earth. The souls of the
          wicked feel them, and the souls of the saints see them afar off. God
          glorifies his justice in the punishment of ungodly men, in the view of
          the saints and angels, and thereby makes them the more admire the
          riches of his goodness in choosing them to like. As the rich man saw
          Lazarus in heaven afar off, so Lazarus saw the rich man in hell. He
          saw hell-torments. And therefore the rich man desires he may be sent
          to warn his brethren. — And if one should rise from the dead to warn
          wicked men, if it would at all awaken them, it would be because he
          knew what hell-torments were by his own knowledge, and could describe
          them to others, as having seen and felt them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But surely the all-seeing God knows as well as any of the dead, what
          the present sufferings of the damned are. He is everywhere present
          with his all-seeing eye. He is in heaven and in hell, and in and
          through every part of the creation.. He is where every devil is; and
          where every damned soul is, he is present by his knowledge and his
          essence. He not only knows as well as those in heaven, who see at a
          distance; but he knows as perfectly as those who feel the misery. He
          seeth into the innermost recesses of the hearts of those miserable
          spirits. He seeth all the sorrow and anguish that are there; for he
          upholds them in being. They and all the powers of their spirits,
          whereby they are capable of either happiness or misery, are in his
          hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, it is his wrath they endure. He measures out to them their
          several portions of punishment. He makes his wrath enter into them. He
          is a consuming fire to them. His anger is that fire, in which they are
          tormented. He therefore is doubtless able to give us as clear and
          distinct, and as true, an account of hell, as the damned themselves,
          if they should rise from the dead. He needs not any to inform him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knows far better what the eternity of these torments is than any of
          them, He can better tell us how awful a thing eternity is. He knows
          better what the future judgment of sinners will be, when the Lord
          Jesus shall come in flaming fire to take vengeance on them that know
          not God, and obey not the gospel. He knows far better than they how
          much the torment of the wicked will then be increased.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We have the truth upon surer grounds from God’s testimony than we
          could have it from the testimony of one rising from the dead. Suppose
          one should rise from the dead, and tell us of the dreadfulness of
          hell-torments. How precarious a foundation would that be to build
          upon, in a matter of such importance, unless we consider it as
          confirmed by divine testimony. We should be uncertain whether there
          were not some delusion in the case. We know that it is impossible for
          God to lie. And we may know that the matter is just as he declares it
          to us. But if one should come from the dead, we could not be so sure
          that we were no way imposed upon. We could not be so sure that he who
          testified was not himself subject to some delusion. We could not be
          sure that the matter was not strained too high, and represented
          greater than it really is.
        </p>
        <p>
          One coming from the dead could not, merely by force of his own
          testimony, make us sure that we should come to that place of torments
          if we did not repent and reform. And if there should come more
          witnesses than one from the dead, if there should be ever so many, yet
          there is no authority equal to that of God. There is no testimony of
          spirits from the invisible world which would be so indisputable and
          unquestionable as the divine testimony. How could we know, unless by
          some divine revelation, that they who should come from the dead had
          not come to deceive us. How could we know how wicked, or how good they
          were, and upon what views they acted?
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas we have the greatest ground to be assured, that the First
          Being, and the Fountain of all being and perfection, is nothing but
          light and truth itself, and therefore that it is impossible he should
          deceive or be deceived.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The warnings of God’s Word have greatly the advantage, by reason
          of the greatness and majesty of him who speaks. The speeches and
          declarations of those who are great, excellent, and honorable, have a
          greater tendency to move the affections, than the declarations of
          others who are less excellent. Things spoken by a king affect more
          than the same things spoken by a mean man.
        </p>
        <p>
          But God is infinitely greater than kings; he is universal King of
          heaven and earth, the absolute Sovereign of all things. Now, what can
          have a greater tendency to strike the mind and move the heart, than to
          be warned by this great and glorious Being? Shall we be unmoved when
          he speaks who made heaven and earth by the word of his power? If his
          immediate speeches, declarations, and warning, will not influence us,
          what will? Isa. 1:2, “Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the
          Lord hath spoken.” — That is to the present purpose which we have in
          Mat. 21:37, “But last of all he sent his son, saying, They will
          reverence my son.” He sent his servants before, but they did not
          regard them. He therefore, sent his son, who was a much greater and
          more honorable messenger, and said Surely they will regard him.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if God should send messengers from the dead to warn us, even many
          in succession, and men should reject them. We should justly argue,
          that it would have a much greater tendency to make men regard and obey
          the counsel, if he would send his Son, or come himself. But God has
          sent his Son, and therein he hath come himself. He came down from
          heaven, and took upon him our nature, and dwelt among us, teaching and
          warning us concerning hell and damnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Bible, we not only have those warnings which were given by
          inspiration of the prophets, but we have God’s own words, which he
          spake as it were by his own mouth. In the Old Testament is his voice
          out of the midst of the fire and the darkness, from mount Sinai; and
          the New Testament, we have God speaking to us, as dwelling among us.
          He came down from heaven, and instructed us in a familiar manner for a
          long while. And we have his instructions recorded in our Bibles. —
          Now, which has the greatest tendency to influence men, to have one of
          the departed spirits sent back into its body to warn them, or to have
          God himself assume a body and warn them?
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. It more evidently shows the importance of the affair, that God
          should immediately concern himself in it, than the coming of one from
          the dead would do. Those things about which kings most immediately
          concern themselves are commonly matters of the greatest importance,
          while they leave less concernments to be managed by their officers.
          And surely that must be a matter of very great moment, in which God
          shows himself so much concerned as he does in our salvation. God, in
          all ages of the world, hath showed himself very much concerned in this
          matter. How abundantly hath he warned us in his holy word? How earnest
          hath he shown himself in it! How many arguments and expostulations
          hath he used, that we might avoid the way to hell!-This evidently
          argues, that what we are warned about is a matter of the utmost
          concern, and proves it much more than if we were only warned by one
          risen from the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. God warning us of our danger of damnation hath a greater tendency
          to have influence upon us, because he is our Judge. Damnation is a
          punishment to which he condemns and which he inflicts. What he warns
          us of is his own wrath and vengeance. In his word we have his
          threatenings against sin denounced by himself. He tells us, that if we
          go on in sin, he will destroy us, and cast us out of his sight, and
          pour out his wrath upon us, and hold us eternally under misery. He
          tells us so himself; and this hath a much greater tendency to
          influence us, than to be told so by another, who is not to be our
          judge, who hath not in his hands the power of making us miserable. —
          When a king immediately threatens his own displeasure, it has a
          greater tendency to terrify men, than when another man threatens it,
          or warns them of the danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. God is infinitely wise, and knows better how to speak to us so as
          to persuade us, than one risen from the dead. He perfectly knows our
          nature and state, and knows how to adapt his instructions and warnings
          to our frame and circumstances in the world. And without doubt that
          method which God has chosen, is agreeable to his infinite wisdom, and
          most adapted to our nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one should come from hell to warn sinners, it may be he would tell
          them of hell in such a manner as would have more of a tendency to
          drive men into despair, and set them a blaspheming as they do in hell,
          than to excite them to strive for salvation, and diligently to use the
          means which God hath appointed. But God knoweth what revelation of
          hell we can bear, and what hath the most tendency to do us good in
          this our infirm, dark, and sinful state. — The declarations of one
          come from hell might more tend to drive us from God than to bring us
          near to him. It is best for us to be warned and instructed by God, who
          knows best how to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are some of the reasons why the warnings of God’s Word have more
          of a tendency to bring us to repentance, than the warning of one risen
          from the dead.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          I. It is a natural inference from this doctrine, that if these means
          which God hath appointed do not answer to lead men to repentance and
          reformation, no others would. — Although this be not an absolutely
          necessary consequence from the words of the doctrine; yet it seems to
          be Christ’s aim to teach us, that if God’s means will not answer, none
          will. Our own means, those which we can devise, however they may seem
          more likely at a distance to be effectual, if brought to the trial,
          will not prove to be better. The rich man thought that if his brethren
          were warned by one rising from the dead, they would surely repent. But
          Abraham tells him, he is mistaken.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one rising from the dead would not answer the purpose, we may
          rationally conclude that no other kind of means, different from those
          appointed by God, would. For what can we think of, which seems to have
          more tendency to awaken men, and lead to repentance, than one coming
          from the dead to them; except those means which we enjoy. — Indeed men
          can think of many means, which they may imagine, if they enjoyed them,
          would make them believe and repent. But they deceive themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be they think, if they could see some prophet, and see him work
          miracles, that this would awaken them. But how was it then when there
          were prophets? There has rarely been a more degenerate time than that
          of Elijah and Elisha, who wrought so many miracles. The people did not
          regard their prophecies nor their miracles; but walked in their own
          ways, and served their own gods, so that Elijah thought there was none
          left of the true worshippers of God. And how did they treat the
          prophet Jeremiah, solemnly warning them from God of their approaching
          destruction? And how often do the prophets complain that all their
          prophecies and warnings were neglected and despised!
        </p>

          Would it be sufficient if you could hear God speak from heaven? How
          was it in Moses’s time, when they heard God speak out of the midst of
          the fire, and heard the voice of words exceeding loud and full of
          majesty, so that they exceedingly trembled; when they saw mount Sinai
          all covered with smoke, and shaking exceedingly? How did they behave
          themselves? Did they all turn from their sins, and after that walk in
          the ways of God? It is true, they were very much affected at first,
          while it was a new and strange thing to them; but how hard-hearted and
          rebellious were they soon after! They did not scruple to rebel against
          this same great and glorious God. Yea, they made a golden calf while
          Moses was in the mount conversing with God, just after they had seen
          those dreadful appearances of divine majesty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus they rebelled against the Lord, although they had seen so many
          miracles and wonders in Egypt at the Red sea, and in the wilderness;
          although they continually saw the pillar of cloud and of fire going
          before them, were continually fed in a miraculous manner with manna,
          and in the same miraculous manner made to drink water out of the rock.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men are apt to think, that if they had lived in Christ’s time, and had
          seen and heard him, and had seen his miracles, that they would have
          effectually convinced and turned them from sin. But how was it in
          fact? How few were there brought to repentance by all his discourses
          and miracles! How hard-hearted were they! Some were very much affected
          for a little while; but how few constant steady followers had he! He
          was, notwithstanding his miracles, rejected, despised, and even
          murdered by the people among whom he dwelt. And they were men of the
          same natures as sinners in these days.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scripture is full of instances, sufficient to convince us, that if
          the Word of God will not awaken and convert sinners, nothing will. —
          And we see enough in these days to convince us of it. Men sometimes
          meet with those things by which we should not imagine, if we did not
          see it, and were not used to it, but that they would be thoroughly
          awakened and reformed. — They sometimes hear the warnings of dying men
          expecting to go to hell. One would think this would be enough to
          awaken them; and it may be they are affected with it for the present.
          But it only touches them. It vanishes away, and is gone like a puff of
          wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes sinners themselves are laid upon beds of sickness, and their
          lives hang in doubt before them. They are brought to the sides of the
          grave, and to the very mouth of hell, and their hearts are full of
          terror and amazement. Yet if they recover, they soon forget it, and
          return to the ways of folly and wickedness. — Sometimes this is
          repeated; they are taken sick again, are again in extreme peril of
          death, their hearts are full of amazement, and they make many promises
          and vows; yet being recovered, they again soon forget all, and return
          to sin and folly. Such things are enough to convince us, that if the
          Word of God be not sufficient to convince men, and make them break off
          their sins, no external means would be sufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps some may yet be ready to think, that if sinners should see
          hell, and here the cries of the damned, that would be effectual,
          though nothing else would. But if we duly consider the matter, we
          shall see reason to think, that it would not have so great a tendency
          to turn men from sin, as the Word of God. Such a thing would doubtless
          be effectual to terrify and affright men, and probably to death.. Such
          a mean is not at all suitable to our nature and state in the world. If
          it should not fright men to death, it would not have so great a
          tendency to them to make them diligently use means for their salvation
          as the warnings of Scripture. It would probably drive them to despair;
          or so take away their spirits that they would have no heart to seek
          God. Instead of driving them to God, it would probably make them hate
          him more. It would make them more like devils; and set them a
          blaspheming as the damned do. For while the hearts of men are filled
          with natural darkness, they cannot see the glory of the divine justice
          appearing in such extreme torments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the means which God hath instituted for us, are doubtless
          the best, and most conducive to lead men to repentance and salvation.
          They are doubtless far better than any other which we can devise.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Hence we learn the dreadful hardness of men’s hearts, since the
          Word of God hath no more influence upon them, and they are no more
          moved and wrought upon by those means which infinite wisdom hath
          provided. The warnings of the Word of God are, as you have heard,
          better and more powerful means than if one should rise form the dead
          to warn us, and tell us our danger, and the dreadfulness of the wrath
          of God. You have also heard, that if these means will not answer the
          end of awakening and leading sinners to repentance, no other will;
          neither the working of miracles, nor the hearing of God speak with an
          audible voice from heaven, nor anything else. — Yet how few are there
          who are effectually wrought upon by the Word of God! They are very
          thinly sown; there is but here and there one.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we read how the children of Israel conducted themselves in the
          wilderness, how often they murmured and offended; we are ready to
          wonder at the hardness of their hearts. And when we read the history
          of Christ, and how the Jews hated and rejected him notwithstanding his
          many miracles; we are ready to wonder how they could be so
          hard-hearted. But we have as much reason to wonder at ourselves, for
          we have naturally the same sort of hearts that they had. And sinners
          in these days manifest a hardness of heart as much to be wondered at,
          in that they are not influenced by the Word of God. For they who will
          not hear Moses and the prophets, Jesus Christ and his apostles,
          neither would be persuaded, if one should rise from the dead, or if an
          angel should come from heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best means of awakening and conversion are plentifully enjoyed by
          us, much more plentifully in several respects, than they were by those
          who had only Moses and the prophets. In the first place, we have
          divine truth more fully revealed in the Bible than they had then.
          Light now shines abundantly clear. Gospel-truth is revealed, not in
          types and shadows, but plainly. Heaven and hell are much more clearly
          and expressly made known. We are told, that the glory of that
          revelation was no glory in comparison with the revelation of the
          gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we have a greater plenty of Bibles than they had under the
          dispensation of Moses and the prophets. Then there was no such thing
          as printing, and Bibles were scarce things. They seldom had any Bibles
          anywhere else but in their synagogues. But now we have them in our
          houses; we can look into them when we please. Besides Christ hath
          appointed the gospel-ministry, by which we have the Word of God
          explained and enforced every week. Yet how little influence hath the
          Word of God to bring men to repentance!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let this strike conviction into those who never yet have found any
          such effect by the Word of God. Though you are convinced of nothing
          else, yet you have abundant reason to be convinced that your hearts
          are as hard as a stone, and that you are exceedingly stupid and
          sottish.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Hence we may learn how justly and fairly God deals with us. He
          gives us the best means of awakening and reclaiming us from our sins;
          better than if he had sent one from the dead to warn us. He gives us
          those means which are most suited to our nature and circumstances. He
          gives sinners abundant warning before he punishes them. What could he
          have done more than he hath done? We can devise or imagine no sort of
          warning which would have been better than what God hath given us. How
          justly therefore are ungodly men punished! How inexcusable will they
          be!
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Let all make use of the means which God hath instituted. They are
          the best and only means by which we may expect to obtain salvation. We
          shall be most inexcusable therefore if we neglect them. Let us attend
          to the Word of God, read and hear it carefully, consider it
          thoroughly, and daily walk by it. Let us be diligent in this work. The
          Word of God is a great price put into our hands to get wisdom and
          eternal salvation. Let us therefore improve it while we have it, as we
          know not how soon we may be deprived of it; lest Christ say to us, as
          in Luke 19:42, “If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
          day, the things which belong unto thy peace! But now they are hid from
          thine eyes”
