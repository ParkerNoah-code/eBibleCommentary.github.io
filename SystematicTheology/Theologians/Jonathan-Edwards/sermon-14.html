          Hosea 5:15, “I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge
          their offense, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me
          early.”
        </p>
        <p>
          IN the preceding part of the chapter is threatened the destruction of
          Ephraim. Ephraim, in the prophets, generally means the ten tribes, or
          the kingdom of Israel, as distinguished from the kingdom of Judah.
          When we read of Ephraim and Judah in the prophets, thereby is meant
          the whole people of Israel of the twelve tribes, as in verse 12 of
          this chapter, “Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the
          house of Judah as rottenness.” By Judah is meant the two tribes of
          Judah and Benjamin, which were under the king of Judah, and by Ephraim
          is meant the ten tribes under the king of Israel. Ephraim is put for
          the whole kingdom of Israel, because Samaria, the seat of the kingdom,
          the royal city, was in that tribe. In the verse immediately preceding
          the text it is declared in what a terrible manner God was about to
          deal with Ephraim. (Hos. 5:14) “For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion,
          and as a young lion to the house of Judah; I, even I, will tear and go
          away, and none shall rescue him.” In the text God declares how he
          would deal with them after he had torn as a lion, etc. And here,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, God declares how he would withdraw from them. “I will go and
          return to my place;” when I have torn as a lion. I will go away; I
          will leave them in that condition. I will depart from them, and they
          shall see no more of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, what God will wait for in them before he returns to them to
          show them mercy. There are three things here signified.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That they should be sensible of their guilt. “Till they acknowledge
          their offense.” It is in the original, “till they become guilty.” That
          is, till they become guilty in their own eyes, till they are sensible
          of their guilt; in the same sense as the same expression is used in
          Rom. 3:19, “That every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may
          become guilty before God:” that is, become guilty in their own eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That they would be sensible of their misery, implied in the
          expression, “in their affliction they shall seek me.” Their calamity
          was brought upon them, before God had torn them, and left them. But in
          their pride and perverseness, they were not well sensible of their own
          miserable condition, as this prophet observes in Hos. 7:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. That they should be sensible of their need of God’s help, which is
          implied in their seeking God’s face, and seeking him early, that is,
          with great care and earnestness. Before, they would not seek God. They
          were not sensible of their helplessness, as we learn in the verse but
          one preceding the text. “When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his
          wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb.” But
          as we are there told, he could not heal him, nor cure his wound. And
          notwithstanding all the help he could afford, God wounded him, tore
          him as a young lion, and as he declares, would leave him, and he
          should cease going to any other, and should be sensible that no other
          could heal, and accordingly come to him for healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctrine. That it is God’s manner to make men sensible of their misery
          and unworthiness, before he appears in his mercy and love to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That it is ordinarily thus with respect to the bestowment of great
          and signal mercies.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That it is particularly so with respect to revealing his love and
          mercy to their souls.
        </p>
        <p>III. That they are made sensible of the desert of their sin.</p>
        <p>
          I. This is God’s ordinary way before great and signal expressions of
          his mercy and favor. He very commonly so orders it in his providence,
          and so influences men by his Spirit, that they are brought to see
          their miserable condition as they are in themselves, and to despair of
          help from themselves, or from an arm of flesh, before he appears for
          them, and also makes them sensible of their sin, and their
          unworthiness of God’s help. This appears from the account which the
          Scriptures give us of God’s dealings with his people. Joseph, before
          his great advancement in Egypt, must lie in the dungeon to humble him,
          and prepare him for such honor and prosperity. The children of Jacob,
          before Joseph reveals himself to them, and they receive that joy, and
          honor, and prosperity, which were consequent thereupon, pass through a
          train of difficulties and anxieties, till at last they are reduced to
          distress, and are brought to reflect upon their guilt, and to say,
          that they were verily guilty concerning their brother. God humbled
          them in his providence, and then an end was put to all their
          difficulties, and their sorrow was turned into joy upon Joseph’s
          revealing himself to them. Jacob, before he hears the joyful news of
          Joseph’s being yet alive, must be brought into great distress at the
          parting with Benjamin, and supposed loss of Simeon. He was reduced to
          great straits in his mind. He says in Gen. 42:36, “All these things
          are against me.” But soon after this he had these gladsome tidings
          brought to him, “Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the
          land of Egypt.” And to confirm it, he sees the wagons and the noble
          presents, which Joseph sent to him, so that he was now brought to say,
          “It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive. I will go and see him
          before I die.” And so with the children of Israel in Egypt. Their
          bondage must wax more and more extreme. Their bondage had been very
          extreme. But yet Pharaoh gives commandment that more work should be
          laid upon them, and the task-masters tell them they must get their
          straw where they can find it, and nothing of their work should be
          diminished. And quickly upon this was their deliverance. So when the
          children of Israel were brought to the Red sea, the Egyptians pursued
          them, and were just at their heels, and they were reduced to the
          utmost distress. They see that they must assuredly perish, unless God
          work a miracle for them, for they were shut up on all sides: the Red
          sea was before them, and the army of the Egyptians encompassing them
          round behind. And they cried unto the Lord. And then God wonderfully
          appeared for their help, and made them pass through the Red sea, and
          put songs of deliverance into their mouths.
        </p>
        <p>
          So before God brought the children of Israel into Canaan, he led them
          about in a great and terrible wilderness through a train of
          difficulties and temptations for forty years, that he might teach them
          their dependence on him, and the sinfulness of their own hearts. Deu.
          32:10, “He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
          wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the
          apple of his eye.” God brought them into those trials and difficulties
          in the wilderness to humble them, and let them see what was in their
          hearts, that they might be convinced of their own perverseness by the
          many discoveries of it under those temptations, and so that they might
          be sensible that it was not for their righteousness that God made them
          his people, and gave them Canaan, seeing it was so evident that they
          were a stiff-necked people. Deu. 8:2, 3, “And thou shalt remember all
          the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the
          wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in
          thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no. And
          he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna,
          which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might
          make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word
          that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live.” And Deu.
          8:15-17, “Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness,
          wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there
          was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
          who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not,
          that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee
          good at thy latter end; and thou say in thine heart, My power and the
          might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.” And so we have examples
          of this from time to time in the history of the Judges. When Israel
          revolted, God gave them into the hands of their enemies. He let them
          continue in their hands, till they were reduced to great distress, and
          saw that they were in a helpless condition, and were brought to
          reflect on themselves, and to cry unto the Lord. And then God raised
          them up a deliverer. And when they cried unto God, he would not
          deliver them till he had humbled them, and brought them to own their
          unworthiness, and to own that they were in God’s hands. Judges 10
          beginning with the 10th verse, “And the children of Israel cried unto
          the Lord, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have
          forsaken our God, and also served Balaam. And the Lord said unto the
          children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from
          the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
          The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress
          you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand. Yet ye
          have forsaken me, and served other gods; wherefore I will deliver you
          no more, Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them
          deliver you in the time of your tribulation. And the children of
          Israel said unto the Lord, We have sinned; do thou unto us whatsoever
          seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day. And
          they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the Lord;
          and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.” And this is the
          method in which God declared from the beginning he would proceed with
          his people. Lev. 26:40, etc. “If they shall confess their iniquity,
          and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they
          trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto
          me; and that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought
          them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised
          hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their
          iniquity; then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my
          covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I
          remember; and I will remember the land. The land also shall be left of
          them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without
          them; and they shall accept the punishment of their iniquity; because,
          even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul
          abhorred my statutes. And yet for all that, when they be in the land
          of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor
          them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for
          I am the Lord their God. But I will for their sakes remember the
          covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of
          Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God.” It is
          God’s manner, when he will bestow signal blessings in answer to
          prayer, to make men seek them and pray for them with a sense of sin
          and misery. As 1 Kin. 8:38, 39, “What prayer and supplication soever
          be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know
          every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands
          toward this house; then hear thou in heaven, thy dwelling-place, and
          forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose
          heart thou knowest; for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of
          all the children of men.” By knowing the plague of their own hearts is
          meant both their sin and misery. Being sensible of their misery is
          included, as is evident from the manner of expressing the same
          petition of Solomon’s prayer, as it is related in 2 Chr. 6:29, “Then
          what prayer or supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all
          thy people Israel, when every man shall know his own sore and his own
          grief.” By which is probably meant his misery and his sin, which is
          the foundation of it. Paul gives us an account how God brought him to
          have despair in himself before a great deliverance, which he
          experienced. 2 Cor. 1:9, 10, “But we had the sentence of death in
          ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God, which
          raiseth the dead; who delivered us from so great a death.” How did
          Christ humble the woman of Canaan, or bring her to the exercise and
          expression of a sense of her own unworthiness before he answered her,
          and healed her daughter! When she continued to cry, after he answered
          her not a word, and seemed to take no notice of her, and his disciples
          desired him to send her away, and when she continued crying after him,
          he gave a very humbling answer, saying, “It is not meet to take the
          children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.” And when she took it well,
          as owning that being called a dog was not too bad, and owning that she
          was therefore unworthy of children’s bread, she only sought the
          crumbs, then Christ answered her request. And the experience of God’s
          people in all ages corresponds with those examples. It is God’s usual
          method before remarkable discoveries of his mercy and love to them,
          especially by spiritual mercies, in a special manner to humble them,
          and make them sensible of their misery and helplessness in themselves,
          and of their vileness and unworthiness, either by some remarkably
          humbling dispensation of his providence or influence of his Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>We are come now,</p>
        <p>
          II. To show particularly that it is God’s manner to make men sensible
          of their misery and unworthiness before he reveals his saving love and
          mercy to their souls. The mercy of God, which he shows to a sinner
          when he brings him home to the Lord Jesus Christ, is the greatest and
          most wonderful exhibition of mercy and love, of which men are ever the
          subjects. There are other things, in which God greatly expresses his
          mercy and goodness to men, many temporal favors. The mercies already
          mentioned, which God bestowed upon his people of old: his advancing
          Joseph in Egypt, his deliverance of the children of Israel out of
          Egypt, his leading them through the Red sea on dry land, his bringing
          them into Canaan, and driving out the heathen from before them, his
          delivering them from time to time from the hands of their enemies,
          were great mercies. But they were not equal to this of his people from
          under the guilt and dominion of sin. Several of them were typical of
          this, and as God would thus prepare men for the bestowment of those
          less mercies by making them sensible of their guilt and misery, so
          especially will he so do, before he makes known to them this great
          love of his in Jesus Christ. When God designs to show mercy to
          sinners, it is his manner thus to begin with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          He first brings them to reflect upon themselves, and consider and be
          sensible what they are, and what condition they are in. What has
          already been said proves this. There is a harmony between God’s
          dispensations. And as we see that this is God’s manner of dealing with
          men when he gives them other great and remarkable mercies and
          manifestations of his favor, it is a confirmation that it is his
          method of proceeding with the souls of men, when about to reveal his
          mercy and love to them in Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, God makes men consider and be sensible of what sin they are
          guilty. Before, it may be, they were very regardless of this. They
          went on sinning, and never reflected upon what they did. [They] never
          considered or regarded what or how many sins they committed. They saw
          no cause why they should trouble their minds about it. But when God
          convinces them, he brings them to reflect upon themselves. He sets
          their sins in order before their eyes. He brings their old sins to
          their minds, so that they are fresh in their memory — things which
          they had almost forgotten. And many things, which they used to regard
          as light offenses, which were not wont to be a burden to their
          consciences, nor to appear worthy to be taken notice of, they are now
          made to reflect upon. Thus they discover of what a multitude of
          transgressions they have been guilty, which they have heaped up till
          they are grown up to heaven. There are some sins especially, of which
          they have been guilty, which are ever before them, so that they cannot
          get them out of their minds. Sometimes when men are under conviction,
          their sins follow them, and haunt them like a specter. God makes them
          sensible of the sin of their hearts, how corrupt and depraved their
          hearts are. And there are two ways in which he does this. One is by
          setting before them the sins of their lives. They are so set in order
          before them, they appear so many and so aggravated, that they are
          convinced what a fountain of corruption there is in their hearts.
          Their sinful natures appear by their sinful lives. There is sin
          enough, which every man has committed, to convince him, that he is
          sold under sin, that his heart is full of nothing but corruption, if
          God by his Spirit leads him rightly to consider it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way which God sometimes makes use of, is to leave men to such
          internal workings of corruption under the temptations which they have
          in their terrors and fears of hell, as shows them what a corrupt and
          wicked heart they have. God sometimes brings this good out of this
          evil, to make men see the corruption of their nature by the workings
          of it under temptations, which they have in their terrors about
          damnation. God leads them through the wilderness to prove them, and
          let them know what is in their hearts, as he did the children of
          Israel, as we have already observed. By means of the trials which the
          children of Israel had in the wilderness, they might be made sensible
          what a murmuring, perverse, rebellious, unfaithful, and idolatrous
          people they were. So God sometimes makes sinners sensible what wicked
          hearts they have, by their experience of the exercises of corruption,
          while they are under convictions. Not that this will in the least
          excuse men for allowing such workings of corruption in their hearts,
          because God sometimes leaves men to be wicked, that he may afterwards
          turn it to their good, when he in infinite wisdom sees meet so to do.
          We must not go and be wicked on purpose that we may get good by it. It
          will be very absurd, as well as horridly presumptuous, for us so to
          do. Though God sometimes in his sovereign mercy makes those workings
          of corruption, and a spirit of opposition and enmity against God, a
          means of showing them the vileness of their own hearts, and so to turn
          to their good. So God oftentimes is provoked thereby utterly to
          withdraw and forsake them, after the example of those murmurers, whose
          carcasses fell in the wilderness, of whom God sware in his wrath that
          they should never enter into his rest. And they who allow themselves
          therein, are the most likely so to provoke God. But it is God’s manner
          to show men the plague of their own hearts by some means or other,
          before he reveals his redeeming love to their souls. While sinners are
          unconvinced, sin lies hid. They take no notice of it. But God makes
          the law effectual to bring men’s own sins of heart and life to be
          reflected on, and observed. Rom. 7:9, “I was alive without the law
          once, but when the commandment came, sin revived.” Then sin appeared
          and came to light, which was not before observed. Joseph’s revealing
          himself to his brethren, is probably typical of Christ’s revealing
          himself to the soul of a sinner, making known himself in his love, and
          in his near relation of a brother, and a redeemer of his soul. But
          before Joseph revealed himself to them, they were made to reflect upon
          themselves, and say, “we are verily guilty.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, God convinces sinners of the dreadful danger they are in by
          reason of their sin. Having their sins set before them, God makes them
          sensible of the relation which their sin has to misery. And here are
          two things of which they are convinced about their danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God makes them sensible that his displeasure is very dreadful.
          Before they heard often about the anger of God, and the fierceness of
          his wrath, but they were not moved by it. But now they are made
          sensible that it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the
          living God. They are made in some measure sensible of the dreadfulness
          of hell. They are led with fixedness of impression to think what a
          dismal thing it will be to have God an enraged enemy, setting to work
          the misery of a soul, and how dismal it will be to dwell in such
          torment forever without hope. Isa. 33:14 “The sinners in Zion are
          afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall
          dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with
          everlasting burnings?” Other sinners are told of hell, but convinced
          sinners often have hell, as it were, in their view. Their being
          impressed with a sense of the dreadfulness of its misery, is the cause
          why it works upon their imagination oftentimes, and it will seem as
          though they saw the dismal flames of hell; as though they saw God in
          implacable wrath exerting his fury upon them; as though they heard the
          cries and shrieks of the damned.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They are made in some measure sensible of the connection there is
          between their sins and that wrath, or how their sin and guilt exposes
          them to that wrath, of the dreadfulness of which they have such lively
          apprehensions, and so fear takes hold of them. They are afraid that
          will be their portion. And they are sensible that they are in a
          miserable and doleful condition by reason of sin. Many things in the
          Scriptures make it evident that this is God’s method. The account we
          have of our first parents confirms it. They had a sense of guilt and
          danger, before Christ was revealed to them. They were guilty, and were
          afraid of God’s wrath, and ran and hid themselves. They were terribly
          afraid when they heard God coming. And doubtless their sense of their
          guilt and fear, when they were brought before God, and were called to
          an account, and God asked them what they had done, and whether they
          had eaten of that tree, whereof he commanded them that they should not
          eat, prepared them for a discovery of mercy. God made them sensible of
          their guilt and danger before he revealed to them the covenant of
          grace. And it is probable that their reflecting upon what God said
          about the seed of the woman bruising the serpent’s head, soon wrought
          faith: that it was not long before the discovery God made of a
          merciful design towards them was a means of true consolation and hope
          to them. Joseph’s brethren were brought into great distress for fear
          of their lives before Joseph revealed himself to them. Those who were
          converted by Peter’s sermon were first pricked in their hearts in a
          sense of their guilt and their danger. Acts 2:37. And Paul, before he
          had his first comfort, trembled, and was astonished. Acts 9:6. And
          continued three days and three nights, and neither ate nor drank,
          which expressed his great distress. The jailer, before he was
          converted, was in terror. He called for a light, and sprang in and
          came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas. Acts 16:29, 30.
          Christ’s invitation is made more especially to the weary and heavy
          laden, which doubtless has respect, at least partly, to laboring and
          being weary with a sense of guilt and danger. We read when David was
          in the cave, that everyone who was in distress, was gathered unto him.
          1 Sam. 22:1. This doubtless was written as typifying Jesus Christ, and
          the referring of those who were in fear and distress unto him. The
          expression of flying for refuge, by which coming to Christ is
          signified, implies that before they come, they are in fear of some
          evil. They apprehend themselves in danger, and this fear gives wings
          to their feet. Pro. 18:10, “The name of the Lord is a strong tower.”
          The voice of God to a sinner, when he gives him true comfort, is a
          still small voice. But this voice is preceded by a strong wind, and a
          terrible earthquake, and fire, as it was in Horeb when Elijah was
          there. 1 Kin. 19:11, 12, “And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great
          and strong wind rent the mountains and brake in pieces the rocks
          before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind
          an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the
          earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the
          fire a still small voice.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing in the Scriptures, which seems to evince this, is the
          frequent comparison made between the church spiritually bringing forth
          Christ, and a woman in travail, in pain to be delivered. John 16:21
          and Rev. 12:2. The conversion of a sinner is represented by the same
          thing. It is bringing forth Christ in the heart. Paul speaks of men’s
          regeneration as of Christ being brought forth in them. Gal. 4:19. And
          therefore Christ calls believers his mother. Mat. 12:49, 50, “And he
          stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my
          mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of my Father
          which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.”
        </p>
        <p>
          III. They are made sensible of the desert of their sin: that their sin
          deserves that wrath of God to which it exposes them. They are not only
          sensible of the dreadfulness of God’s wrath, how fearful a thing it
          would be to fall into the hands of the living God, and to sustain the
          eternal expressions of his fierce anger, as well as of the connection
          between their sins and this wrath, and how their sins expose them to
          it, but God is also wont, before he comforts them, to show them that
          their sins deserve this wrath. By a clear discovery of the connection
          between their sin and God’s wrath, they are sensible of their danger
          of hell, of which many are in a measure sensible, who are wholly
          insensible of their desert of hell. The threatenings of the law make
          them afraid indeed, that God will punish sins. Yet they have no
          thorough apprehension of their desert of the punishment threatened,
          and therefore many, who are afraid, murmur against God. They charge
          him foolishly with being hard and cruel. But it is God’s manner before
          he speaks peace to them, and reveals his redeeming love and mercy in
          Jesus Christ, to make them sensible that they also deserve it. Thus
          Mat. 18:24-26, “And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto
          him which owed him ten thousand talents. But forasmuch as he had not
          to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children
          and all that he had, and payment to be made. The servant therefore
          fell down and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and
          I will pay thee all. Then the lord of that servant was moved with
          compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.” Very commonly
          when men are first made sensible of their danger, their mouths are
          open against God and his dealings, that is, their hearts are full of
          murmurings. But it is God’s manner before he comforts and reveals his
          mercy and love to them, to stop their mouths, and make them
          acknowledge their guilt, or their desert of the threatened punishment.
          Rom. 3:19, 20, “Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it
          saith to them who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped,
          and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore, by the
          deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for
          by the law is the knowledge of sin.” God would convince men of their
          guilt before he reveals a pardon to them. Now a man cannot be said to
          be thoroughly sensible of his guilt, till he is sensible that he
          deserves hell. A man must be sensible that he is guilty of death, or
          guilty of damnation, to use the scriptural mode of expression, before
          God will reveal to him his freedom from damnation. A sense of guilt
          consists in two things — in a sense of sin, and in a sense of the
          relation which sin has to punishment. Now the relation which sin has
          to punishment, is also twofold. First, the connection which it has
          with punishment, by which it exposes to it, and brings it. Secondly,
          its desert of punishment. When a man is truly convinced of his desert
          of the punishment to which his sin exposes him, then he may be said to
          be thoroughly sensible of his guilt. Then he is become guilty, in the
          sense of our text, and in the sense of Rom. 3:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inquiry. How is it that a sinner is made sensible of his desert of
          God’s wrath? A natural man may have a sense of this, though not the
          same sense which a person may have after conversion, because a natural
          man cannot have a true sight of sin, and of the evil of it. A man
          cannot truly know the evil of sin against God, except it be by a
          discovery of his glory and excellence. Then he will be sensible how
          great an evil it is to sin against him. Yet it cannot be denied that
          natural men are capable of a conviction of their desert of hell, or
          that their consciences may be convinced of it without a sight of God’s
          glory. The consciences of wicked men will also be convinced of the
          justice of their sentence and of their punishment at the day of
          judgment, and doubtless will echo to the sentence of the Judge, and
          condemn them to the same punishment. Here, therefore, we would inquire
          how it is that a natural man may be made sensible of this. First, we
          shall show what is the principle assisted. Second, how it is assisted.
          And third, what are the chief external means which are used in order
          to this.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, what principle in man is assisted in convincing him of his
          desert of eternal punishment? No new principle is infused. Natural men
          have only natural principles, and therefore all that is done by the
          Spirit of God before regeneration is by assisting natural principles.
          To observe, therefore, in answer to this inquiry,
        </p>
        <p>
          That the principle, which is assisted in making natural men sensible
          of their desert of wrath, is natural conscience. Though man has lost a
          principle of love to God, and all spiritual principles, by the fall,
          yet natural conscience remains. Now there are two things, which are
          the proper work of natural conscience. One is to give man a sense of
          right and wrong. A natural man has no sense of the beauty and
          amiability of virtue, or of the turpitude and odiousness of vice. But
          yet every man has that naturally within, which testifies to him that
          some things are right, and others wrong. Thus if a man steals, or
          commits murder, there is something within, which tells him that he has
          done wrong. He knows that he has not done right. Rom. 2:14, 15, “For
          when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things
          contained in the law, these having not the law, are a law unto
          themselves; which show the work of the law written in their hearts,
          their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean
          while accusing, or else excusing, one another.” And the other work of
          natural conscience is to suggest the relation there is between right
          and wrong, and a retribution. Man has that in him, which suggests to
          him, when he has done ill, a relation between that ill and punishment.
          If a man has done that which his conscience tells him is wrong, is
          unjust, his conscience tells him that he deserves to be punished for
          it. Thus natural conscience has a twofold power; a teaching or
          accusing, and a condemning power. The Spirit of God, therefore,
          assists natural conscience the more thoroughly to do this, its work,
          and so convinces a man of sin. Conscience naturally suggests, when he
          has done a known evil, that he deserves punishment, and being assisted
          to its work thoroughly, a man is convinced that he deserves eternal
          punishment. Though natural conscience does remain in the man since the
          fall, yet it greatly needs assistance in order to its work. It is
          greatly hindered in doing its work by sin. Everything in man, which is
          part of his perfection, is hindered and impaired by sin. A faculty of
          reason remains since the fall, but it is greatly impaired and blinded.
          So natural conscience remains, but sin, in a great degree, stupefies
          it, and hinders it in its work. Now when God convinces a sinner, he
          assists his conscience against the stupefaction of sin, and helps it
          to do its work more freely and fully. The Spirit of God works
          immediately upon men’s consciences. In conviction their consciences
          are awakened. They are convinced in their consciences. Their
          consciences smite them and condemn them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, it may be inquired how God assists natural conscience so as to
          convince the sinner of his desert of hell? I answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In general, it is by light. The whole work of God is carried on in
          the heart of man from his first convictions to his conversion by
          light. It is by discoveries which are made to his soul. But by what
          light is it, that a sinner is made sensible that be deserves God’s
          wrath? It is some discovery that he has, which makes him sensible of
          the heinousness of disobeying and casting contempt upon God. The light
          which gives evangelical humiliation, and which makes man sensible of
          the hateful and odious nature of sin, is a discovery of God’s glory
          and excellence and grace. But what is it which a natural man sees of
          God, which makes him sensible that sin against God deserves his wrath.
          For he sees nothing of the excellence and loveliness of God’s glory
          and grace? I answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Particularly, it seems to be a discovery of God’s awful and
          terrible greatness. Natural men cannot see anything of God’s
          loveliness, his amiable and glorious grace, or anything which should
          attract their love, but they may see his terrible greatness to excite
          their terror. Wicked men in another world, though they do not see his
          loveliness and grace, yet they see his awful greatness, and that makes
          them sensible of the heinousness of sin. The damned in hell are
          sensible of the heinousness of their sin. Their consciences declare it
          to them. And they are made sensible of it by what they see of the
          awful greatness of that Being, against whom they have sinned. And
          wicked men in this world are capable of being made sensible of the
          heinousness of sin the same way. If a wicked soul is capable while
          wicked of receiving the discoveries of God’s terrible majesty in
          another world, it is capable of it in this. God may, if he pleases,
          make wicked men sensible of the same thing here. And in this way
          natural men may be so made sensible of the heinousness of sin, as to
          be convinced that they deserve hell, as is evident in that it is by
          this very means, that wicked men will be made sensible of the justice
          of their punishment in another world, and at the day of judgment. For
          then the wicked will see so much of the awful greatness of God, the
          Judge, that it will convince their consciences what a heinous thing it
          was in them to disobey and contemn such a God, and will convince them
          that they therefore deserve his wrath. Which shows that wicked men are
          capable of being convinced in the same way. A wicked man, while a
          wicked man, is capable of hearing the thunders, and seeing the
          devouring fire, of mount Sinai, that is, he is capable of being made
          sensible of that terrible majesty and greatness of God, which was
          discovered at the giving of the law. But this brings me to the
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, thing, viz. the principal outward means, which the Spirit of
          God makes use of in this work of convincing men of their desert of
          hell. And that is the law. The Spirit of God in all his work upon the
          souls of men, works by his Word. And in this whole work of conviction
          of sin, that part of the word is principally made use of; viz. the
          Law. It is the law which makes men sensible of their sin; and it is
          the law, attended with its awful threatenings and curses, which gives
          a sense of the awful greatness, the authority, the power, the jealousy
          of God. Wicked men are made sensible of the tremendous greatness of
          God, as it were, in the same manner in which the children of Israel
          were, viz. by the thunders, and earthquake, and devouring fire, and
          sound of the trumpet, and terrible voice at mount Sinai. All the
          people who were in the camp trembled, and they said, “Let not God
          speak with us, lest we die.” So that it is the law, which God makes
          use of in assisting the natural conscience to do its work. Gal. 3:24,
          “Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.” It is
          the law which God makes use of, to make men sensible of their guilt,
          and to stop their mouths. Rom. 3:19, “Now we know that whatsoever
          things the law saith, it saith to them that are under the law, that
          every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before
          God.” It is the law, which kills men as to trusting in their own
          righteousness. “For I was alive without the law once, but when the
          commandment came, sin revived, and I died.” Gal. 2:19, “For I through
          the law am dead to the law.” Conviction, which precedes conversion, is
          of sin and misery. But men are not thoroughly sensible of their sin or
          guilt, till they are sensible they deserve hell; nor thoroughly
          sensible of their misery, till they are sensible they are helpless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, it is God’s manner to make men sensible of their helplessness
          in their own strength. It is usual with sinners, when they are first
          made sensible of their danger of hell, to attempt by their own
          strength to save themselves. They in some measure see their danger,
          and endeavor to work out their own deliverance. They are striving to
          make themselves better. They strive to convert themselves, to work
          their hearts into a believing frame, and to exercise a saving trust in
          Christ. Having heard that if ever they believe, they must put their
          trust in Christ, and in him alone, for salvation, they think they will
          trust in Christ and cast their souls upon him. And this they endeavor
          to do in their own strength. This is very common with persons upon a
          sick bed, when they are afraid that they shall die and go to hell, and
          are told that they must put their trust in Christ alone for salvation.
          They attempt to do it in their own strength. So sinners will be
          striving without a sense of their insufficiency in themselves to bring
          their own hearts to love God, and to choose him for their portion, and
          to repent of their sins. Or they strive to make themselves better,
          that so God may be more willing to convert them and give them his
          grace, and enable them to believe in Christ, and love God, and repent
          of their sins. But before God appears to them as their help and
          deliverance, it is his manner to make them sensible that they are
          utterly helpless in themselves. They are brought to despair of help
          from themselves. There is a death to all their hopes from themselves.
          Rom. 7:9. Before God opens the prison doors, he makes them see that
          they are shut up, that they are close prisoners, and that there is no
          way in which they can escape. Christ tells us in Isa. 61:1 that he was
          sent to bind up the broken-hearted, and to proclaim liberty to
          captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound. Christ
          was sent to open the prison to them that are not only really, but
          sensibly, bound. Gal. 3:23, “But before faith came, we were kept under
          the law, shut up unto the faith, that should afterwards be revealed.”
          God makes men sensible that they are in a forlorn condition, that they
          are wretched, and miserable, and blind, and naked, before he comforts
          them. Christ tells us in John 9:39, “For judgment I am come into the
          world, that they which see not, might see; and that they which see,
          might be made blind;” meaning, partly at least, by those that see,
          those who think they see: having respect to the Pharisees, who were
          proud of their knowledge, and by the blind, those who are sensibly
          blind. This is emblematically represented by Saul’s blindness before
          his first comfort. He was blind till Ananias came to him to open his
          eyes, probably designed to intimate to us that before God opens the
          eyes of men in conversion, he makes them sensibly blind. God brings
          men to this despair in their own strength in these ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God oftentimes makes use of men’s own experience to convince them
          that they are helpless in themselves. When they first set out in
          seeking salvation, it may be they thought it an easy thing to be
          converted. They thought they should presently bring themselves to
          repent of their sins, and believe in Christ, and accordingly they
          strove in their own strength with hopes of success. But they were
          disappointed. And so God suffers them to go on striving to open their
          own eyes, and mend their own hearts. But they find no success. They
          have been striving to see for a long time, yet they are as blind as
          ever; and can see nothing. It is all Egyptian darkness. They have been
          striving to make themselves better; but they are bad as ever. They
          have often striven to do something which is good, to be in the
          exercise of good affections, which should be acceptable to God, but
          they have no success. And it seems to them, that instead of growing
          better, they grow worse and worse. Their hearts are fuller of wicked
          thoughts than they were at first. They see no more likelihood of their
          conversion than there was at first. So God suffers them to strive in
          their own strength, till they are discouraged, and despair of helping
          themselves. The prodigal son first strove to fill his belly with the
          husks which the swine did eat. But when he despaired of being helped
          in that way, then he came to himself, and entertained thoughts of
          returning to his father’s house.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God sometimes, by a particular assistance of the understanding,
          enables men to see so much of their own hearts, as at once causes them
          to despair of helping themselves. He sometimes convinces them by their
          own trials, suffering them to try a long time to effect their own
          salvation, until they are discouraged. But God, if he pleases, can
          convince men without such endeavors of their own, and sometimes he
          does so, as must be the case in many sudden conversions, of which the
          instances are not unfrequent. By revealing to them their own hearts,
          he sometimes enables them to perceive that they are so remote from the
          exercise of love to God, of faith, and of every other Christian grace,
          as well as from the possession of the least degree of spiritual light,
          that they despair of ever bringing themselves to it. They perceive
          that within their souls all is darkness as darkness itself, and as the
          shadow of death, and that it is too much for them to cause light. They
          find themselves dead to anything good, and therefore despair of
          bringing themselves to the performance of gracious acts. Thus we have
          shown that it is God’s ordinary manner, before he reveals his
          redeeming mercy to the souls of men, to make them sensible of their
          sinfulness and danger, of their desert of the divine wrath, and of
          their utter helplessness in themselves. This we have shown to be most
          accordant with the Holy Scriptures, as well as with God’s method of
          dealing with mankind in other things. And we have shown in an
          imperfect manner how, and by what means, it is that God thus convinces
          men. This work is what Christ speaks of, as one part of the work of
          the Holy Ghost, John 16:8, “When he is come, he will convince the
          world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.” It is God’s
          manner to convince men of sin, before he convinces them of
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>I come now to show the reasons of the doctrine.</p>
        <p>
          The propriety of such a method of proceeding is very obvious. How
          agreeable to the divine wisdom does it seem that the sinner should be
          brought to such a conviction of his danger and misery, as to perceive
          his utter incapacity to help himself by any strength or contrivance of
          his own, and his entire unworthiness of God’s help, and desert of his
          wrath. That he should be brought to acknowledge that God, in the
          exercise of his holy sovereignty, may with perfect justice deal thus
          with him before he appears in his pardoning mercy and love as his
          helper and friend. A man who is converted is successively in two
          exceedingly different states: first, a very miserable, wretched state
          of condemnation, and then in a blessed condition, a state of
          justification. How agreeable, therefore, does it seem to the divine
          wisdom, that such a man should be conscious of this: first, of his
          miserable, condemned state, and then of his happy state; that, as he
          is really first guilty, and under a deep desert of hell, before he is
          really pardoned and admitted to God’s favor, so he should first be
          conscious that he is guilty, and under such a desert of hell, before
          he is conscious of being the object of pardoning and redeeming mercy
          and grace. But the propriety of God’s thus dealing with the souls of
          men will appear perhaps better by considering the following reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is the will of God that the discoveries of his terrible majesty,
          and awful holiness and justice, should accompany the discoveries of
          his grace and love, in order that he may give to his creatures worthy
          and just apprehensions of himself. It is the glory of God that these
          attributes are united in the divine nature, that as he is a being of
          infinite mercy and love and grace, so he is a being of infinite and
          tremendous majesty, and awful holiness and justice. The perfect and
          harmonious union of these attributes in the divine nature, is what
          constitutes the chief part of their glory. God’s awful and terrible
          attributes, and his mild and gentle attributes, reflect glory one on
          the other, and the exercise of the one is in perfect consistency and
          harmony with that of the other. If there were the exercise of the mild
          and gentle attributes without the other, [and] if there were love and
          mercy and grace in inconsistency with God’s authority and justice and
          infinite hatred of sin, it would be no glory. If God’s love and grace
          did not harmonize with his justice and the honor of his majesty, far
          from being an honor, they would be a dishonor to God. Therefore as God
          designs to glorify himself when he makes discoveries of the one, he
          will also make discoveries of the other. When he makes discoveries of
          his love and grace, it shall appear that they harmonize with those
          other attributes. Otherwise his true glory would not be discovered. If
          men were sensible of the love of God without a sense of those other
          attributes, they would be exposed to have improper and unworthy
          apprehensions of God, as though he were gracious to sinners in such a
          manner as did not become a Being of infinite majesty and infinite
          hatred of sin. And as it would expose to unworthy apprehensions of
          God, so it would expose the soul in some respects to behave unsuitably
          towards God. There would not be a due reverence blended with love and
          joy. Such discoveries of love, without answerable discoveries of awful
          greatness, would dispose the soul to come with an undue boldness to
          God. The very nature and design of the gospel show that this is the
          will of God, that those who have the discoveries of his love, should
          also have the discoveries of those other attributes. For this was the
          very end of Christ’s laying down his life, and coming into the world,
          to render the glory of God’s authority, holiness, and justice,
          consistent with his grace in pardoning and justifying sinners, that
          while God thus manifested his mercy, we might not conceive any
          unworthy thoughts of him with respect to those other attributes.
          Seeing, therefore, that this is the very end of Christ’s coming into
          the world, we may conclude that those who are actually redeemed by
          Christ, and have a true discovery of Christ made to their souls, have
          a discovery of God’s terribleness and justice to prepare them for the
          discovery of his love and mercy. God, of old, before the death and
          suffering of Christ were so fully revealed, was ever careful that the
          discoveries of both should be together, so that men might not
          apprehend God’s mercy in pardoning sin and receiving sinners, to the
          disparagement of his justice. When God proclaimed his name to Moses,
          in answer to his desire that he might see God’s glory, he indeed
          proclaimed his mercy: “The Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merciful,
          long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth; keeping mercy for
          thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin.” (Exo.
          34:6, 7) But he did not stop here, but also proclaimed his holy
          justice and vengeance: “and that will by no means clear the guilty;
          visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the
          children’s children unto the third and fourth generation.” (Exo. 34:7)
          Thus they are joined together again in the fourth commandment. “For I,
          the Lord thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
          fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them
          that hate me.” (Exo. 20:5) Thus we find them joined together in
          passages too numerous to be mentioned. When God was about to speak to
          Elijah in Horeb, he was first prepared for such a familiar conversing
          with God by awful manifestations of the divine majesty. First there
          was a wind, which rent the rocks, and then an earthquake, and then a
          devouring fire. 1 Kin. 19:11, 12. God is careful even in heaven, where
          the discoveries of his love and grace are given in such an exalted
          degree, also to provide means for a proportional sense of his
          terribleness, and the dreadfulness of his displeasure, by their
          beholding it in the miseries and torments of the damned, at the same
          time that they enjoy his love. Even the man Christ Jesus was first
          made sensible of the wrath of God, before his exaltation to that
          transcendent height of enjoyment of the Father’s love. And this is one
          reason that God gives sinners a sense of his wrath against their sins,
          and of his justice, before he gives them the discoveries of his
          redeeming love.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Unless a man be thus convinced of his sin and misery before God
          makes him sensible of his redeeming love and mercy, he cannot be
          sensible of that love and mercy as it is, viz. that it is free and
          sovereign. When God reveals his redeeming grace to men, and makes them
          truly sensible of it, he would make them sensible of it as it is.
          God’s grace and love towards sinners is in itself very wonderful, as
          it redeems from dreadful wrath. But men cannot be sensible of this
          until they perceive in some adequate degree how dreadful the wrath of
          God is. God’s redeeming grace and love in Christ is free and
          sovereign, as it is altogether without any worthiness in those who are
          the objects of it. But men cannot be sensible of this, until they are
          sensible of their own unworthiness. The grace of God in Christ is
          glorious and wonderful, as it is not only as the objects of it are
          without worthiness, but as they deserve the everlasting wrath and
          displeasure of God. But they cannot be sensible of this until they are
          made sensible that they deserve God’s eternal wrath. The grace of God
          in Christ is wonderful, as it saves and redeems from so many and so
          great sins, and from the punishment they have deserved. But sinners
          cannot be sensible of this till they are in some measure sensible of
          their sinfulness, and brought to reflect upon the sins of their lives,
          and to see the wickedness of their hearts. It is the glory of God’s
          grace in Christ, that it is so free and sovereign. And doubtless it is
          the will of God, that when he reveals his grace to the soul, it should
          be seen in its proper glory, though not perfectly. When men see the
          glory of God’s grace aright, they see it as free and unmerited, and
          contrary to the demerit of their sins. All who have a spiritual
          understanding of the grace of God in Christ, have a perception of the
          glory of that grace. But the glory of the divine grace appears chiefly
          in its being bestowed on the sinner when he is in a condition so
          exceedingly miserable and necessitous. In order, therefore, that the
          sinner may be sensible of this glory, he must first be sensible of the
          greatness of his misery, and then of the greatness of the divine
          mercy. The heart of man is not prepared to receive the mercy of God in
          Christ, as free and unmerited, till he is sensible of his own demerit.
          Indeed the soul is not capable of receiving a revelation or discovery
          of the redeeming grace of God in Christ, as redeeming grace, without
          being convinced of sin and misery. He must see his sin and misery
          before he can see the grace of God in redeeming him from that sin and
          misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Until the sinner is convinced of his sin and misery, he is not
          prepared to receive the redeeming mercy and grace of God, as through a
          Mediator, because he does not see his need of a Mediator till he sees
          his sin and misery. If there were, on the part of God, any exercise of
          absolute and immediate mercy towards sinners bestowed without any
          satisfaction or purchase, the soul might possibly see that without a
          conviction of its sin and misery. But there is not. All God’s mercy to
          sinners is through a Savior. The redeeming mercy and grace of God is
          mercy and grace in Christ. And when God discovers his mercy to the
          soul, he will discover it as mercy in a Savior; and it is his will
          that the mercy should be received as in and through a Savior, with a
          full consciousness of its being through his righteousness and
          satisfaction. It is the will of God, that as all the spiritual
          comforts which his people receive are in and through Christ, so they
          should be sensible that they receive them through Christ, and that
          they can receive them in no other way. It is the will of God that his
          people should have their eyes directed to Christ, and should depend
          upon him for mercy and favor, [so] that whenever they receive comforts
          through his purchase, they should receive them as from him. And that
          because God would glorify his Son as Mediator, as the glory of man’s
          salvation belongs to Christ, so it is the will of God that all the
          people of Christ, all who are saved by him, should receive their
          salvation as of him, and should attribute the glory of it to him. None
          who will not give the glory of salvation to Christ, should have the
          benefit of it. Upon this account God insists upon it, and it is
          absolutely necessary, that a sinner’s conviction of his sin, and
          misery, and helplessness in himself, should precede or accompany the
          revelation of the redeeming love and grace of God. I shall also
          mention two other ends which are hereby attained.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. By this means the redeeming mercy and love of God are more highly
          prized and rejoiced in, when discovered. By the previous discoveries
          of danger, misery, and helplessness, and desert of wrath, the heart is
          prepared to embrace a discovery of mercy. When the soul stands
          trembling at the brink of the pit, and despairs of any help from
          itself, it is prepared joyfully to receive tidings of deliverance. If
          God is pleased at such a time to make the soul hear his still small
          voice, his call to himself and to a Savior, the soul is prepared to
          give it a joyful reception. The gospel then, if it be heard
          spiritually, will be glad tidings indeed, the most joyful which the
          sinner ever heard. The love of God and of Christ to the world, and to
          him in particular, will be admired, and Christ will be most precious.
          To remember what danger he was in, what seas surrounded him, and then
          to reflect how safe be now is in Christ, and how sufficient Christ is
          to defend him and to answer all his wants, will cause the greater
          exultation of soul. God, in this method of dealing with the souls of
          his elect, consults their happiness, as well as his own glory. And it
          increases happiness, to be made sensible of their misery and
          unworthiness, before God comforts them. For their comfort, when they
          receive it, is so much the sweeter.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The heart is more prepared and disposed to praise God for it. This
          follows from the reasons already mentioned: As they are hereby made
          sensible how free and sovereign the mercy of God is towards them and
          how great his grace in saving them, and as they more highly prize the
          mercy and love of God made known to them, all will dispose them to
          magnify the name of God, to exalt the love of God the Father in giving
          his Son to them, and to exalt Jesus Christ by their praise, who laid
          down his life for them to redeem them from all iniquity. They are
          ready to say, “How miserable should I have been, had not God had pity
          upon me, and provided me a Savior! In what a miserable condition
          should I have been, had not Christ loved me, and given himself for me!
          I must have endured that dreadful wrath of God; I must have suffered
          the punishment which I had deserved by all that great sin and
          wickedness of which I have been guilty.”
