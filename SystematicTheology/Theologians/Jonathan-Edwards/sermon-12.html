          1 Peter 2:9, “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an
          holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises
          of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Subject: That true Christians are: I. A chosen generation. II. A royal
          priesthood. III. A holy nation. IV. A peculiar people.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE apostle in the preceding verses speaks of the great difference
          between Christians and unbelievers, on account of their diverse and
          opposite relations to Jesus Christ. The former have Christ for their
          foundation, they come to him as a living stone, a stone chosen of God,
          and precious; and they also as living stones are built up a spiritual
          house. The Christian church is the temple of God, and particular
          believers are the stones of which that temple is built. The stones of
          Solomon’s temple, which were so curiously polished and well fitted for
          their places in that building, were a type of believers. And Christ is
          the foundation of this building, or the chief corner stone. On the
          contrary, to the latter, to unbelievers, Christ, instead of being a
          foundation on which they rest and depend, is a stone of stumbling, and
          a rock of offense. Instead of being a foundation to support them and
          keep them from falling, he is an occasion of their stumbling and
          falling.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again, to believers Christ is a precious stone: “Unto you
          therefore which believe, he is precious.” But to unbelievers he is a
          stone that is disallowed, and rejected, and set at nought. They set
          light by him, as by the stones of the street. They make no account of
          him, and they disallow him. When they come to build, they cast this
          stone away as being of no use, not fit for a foundation, and not fit
          for a place in their building. In the eighth verse the apostle tells
          the Christians to whom he writes, that those unbelievers who thus
          reject Christ, and to whom he is a stone of stumbling, and rock of
          offense, were appointed to this. “And a stone of stumbling, and a rock
          of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient,
          whereunto also they were appointed.” It was appointed that they should
          stumble at the word that Christ should be an occasion not of their
          salvation, but of their deeper damnation. And then in our text, he
          puts the Christians in mind how far otherwise God had dealt with them,
          than with those reprobates. They were a chosen generation. God had
          rejected the others in his eternal counsels, but themselves he had
          chosen from eternity. They were a chosen generation, a royal
          priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people.
        </p>
        <p>
          As God distinguished the people of Israel of old from all other
          nations, so he distinguishes true Christians. It is probable the
          apostle had in his mind some expressions that are used in the Old
          Testament, concerning the people of Israel. Christians are said here
          to be a chosen generation, according to what was said of Israel of
          old. Deu. 10:15, “Only the Lord thy God had a delight in thy fathers
          to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all
          people, as it is this day.” Christians are here said to be a royal
          priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, agreeable to what was
          said of old of Israel, Exo. 19:5, 6, “Now, therefore, if ye will obey
          my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar
          treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine. And ye
          shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are
          the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is something further said here of Christians than there of
          Israel. There, it is promised to Israel that if they obey, they shall
          be a kingdom of priests. But here, Christians are said to be a
          priesthood of kings, or a royal priesthood. They are a priesthood, and
          they are also kings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I propose to insist distinctly upon the several propositions contained
          in the words of the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. True Christians are a chosen generation. Two things are here
          implied.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that true Christians are chosen by God from the rest of the
          world, to be his.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, that God’s people are of a peculiar descent and pedigree,
          different from all the world besides.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, true Christians are chosen by God from the rest of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          God does not utterly cast off the world of mankind. Though they are
          fallen and corrupted, and there is a curse brought upon the world, yet
          God entertained a design of appropriating a certain number to himself.
          Indeed all men and all creatures are his, as well since as before the
          fall. Whether they are elected or not, they are his. God does not lose
          his right to them by the fall, neither does he lose his power to
          dispose of them: they are still in his hands. Neither does he lose his
          end in creating them. God has made all things for himself, even the
          wicked for the day of evil. It possibly was Satan’s design, in
          endeavoring the fall of man, to cause that God should lose the
          creature that he had made, by getting him away from God into his own
          possession, and to frustrate God of his end in creating man. But this
          Satan has not obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yet in a sense the wicked may be said not to belong to God. God
          doth not own them He has rejected them and cast them away. They are
          not God’s portion, they are Satan’s portion. God has left them, and
          they are lost. When man fell, God left and cast off the bulk of
          mankind. But he was pleased, notwithstanding the universal fall, to
          choose out a number of them to be his, whom he would still appropriate
          to himself. Though the world is a fallen world, yet it was the will of
          God still to have a portion in it, and therefore he chose out some and
          set them apart for himself, Psa. 4:3, “But know that the Lord hath set
          apart him that is godly for himself: the Lord will hear when I call
          unto him.” God’s portion is his people, and Jacob is the lot of his
          inheritance, Deu. 32:9. Those who are God’s enemies, and to whom he is
          an enemy, are still his. But those who are his friends, his children,
          his jewels, that compose his treasure, are his in a very different
          manner. God has chosen the godly out of the rest of the world to be
          nearly related to him, to stand in the relation of children, to have a
          property in him, that they might not only be his people, but that he
          might be their God. He has chosen these to bestow himself upon them.
          He has chosen them from among others to be gracious to them, to show
          them his favor. He has chosen them to enjoy him, to see his glory, and
          to dwell with him forever. He has chosen them as his treasure, as a
          man chooses out gems from a heap of stones, with this difference: the
          man finds gems very different from other stones, and therefore
          chooses, but God chooses them, and therefore they become gems, and
          very different from others, Mal. 3:17, “And they shall be mine, saith
          the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will
          spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.” Psa. 135:4,
          “For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his
          peculiar treasure.” God has chosen them for a most noble and excellent
          use, and therefore they are called vessels unto honor, and elect
          vessels. God has different uses for different men. Some are destined
          to a baser use, and are vessels unto dishonor. Others are chosen for
          the most noble use, for serving and glorifying God, and that God may
          show the glory of divine grace upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several things may here be observed concerning this election of God,
          whereby he chooses truly godly persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This election supposes that the persons chosen are found among
          others. The word election denotes this: it signifies a choosing out.
          The elect are favored by electing grace among the rest of mankind,
          with whom they are found mixed together as the tares and the wheat.
          They are found among them in the same sinfulness, and in the same
          misery, and are alike partakers of original corruption. They are among
          them in being destitute of anything in them that is good, in enmity
          against God, in being in bondage to Satan, in condemnation to eternal
          destruction, and in being without righteousness. So that there is no
          distinction between them prior to that which the election makes. There
          is no respect wherein the elect are not among the common multitude of
          mankind, 1 Cor. 4:7, “For who maketh thee to differ from another? and
          what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now, if thou didst receive
          it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?” 1 Cor.
          6:11, “And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are
          sanctified, but ye are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and
          by the Spirit of our God.” And therefore,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. No foreseen excellency in the elected is the motive that influences
          God to choose them. Election is only from his good pleasure. God’s
          election being the first thing that causes any distinction, there can
          be no distinction already existing, the foresight of which influences
          God to choose them. It is not the seeing of any amiability in them
          above others, that causes God to choose them rather than the rest. God
          does not choose men, because they are excellent, but he makes them
          excellent, and because he has chosen them. It is not because God
          considers them as holy that he chooses them, but he chooses them that
          they might be holy, Eph. 1:4, 5, “According as he hath chosen us in
          him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy, and
          without blame before him in love; having predestinated us unto the
          adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good
          pleasure of his will.” God does not choose them from the foresight of
          any respect they will have towards him more than others. God does not
          choose men and set his care upon them because they love him, for he
          has first loved us, 1 John 4:10, “Herein is love, not that we loved
          God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for
          our sins;” verse 19 (1 John. 4:19), “We love him, because he first
          loved us.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not from any foresight of good works that men do before or after
          conversion. But on the contrary, men do good works because God has
          chosen them, John 15:16, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen
          you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and
          that your fruit should remain; that whatsoever ye shall ask of the
          Father in my name, he may give it you.” Nor did God choose men,
          because he foresaw that they would believe and come to Christ. Faith
          is the consequence of election, and not the cause of it, Acts 13:48,
          “And when the Gentiles heard this they were glad, and glorified the
          word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life,
          believe.” It is because God has chosen men, that he calls them to
          Christ, and causes them to come to him. To suppose that election is
          from the foresight of faith, is to place calling before election,
          which is contrary to the order in which the Scripture represents
          things, Rom. 8:30, “Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also
          called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he
          justified, them he also glorified.” It is not from the foresight of
          any, either moral or natural qualifications, that God chooses men, nor
          because he sees that some men are of a more amiable make, and better
          natural temper or genius, nor because he foresees that some men will
          have better abilities, and will have more wisdom than others and so
          will be able to do more service for God than others, nor because he
          foresees that they will be great and rich and so possessed of greater
          advantages to serve him, 1 Cor. 1:27, 28, “But God hath chosen the
          foolish things of the world, to confound the wise; and God hath chosen
          the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty;
          and the base things of the world, and things despised, hath God
          chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that
          are.” Nor is it from any foresight of men’s endeavors after
          conversion, because he sees that some whom he chooses will do much
          more than others to obtain heaven. But God chooses them, and therefore
          awakens them, and prompts them to strive for conversion. Rom. 9:16,
          “So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but
          of God that showeth mercy.” Election in Scripture is everywhere
          referred to God’s own good pleasure, Mat. 11:26, “Even so, Father; for
          so it seemed good in thy sight.” 2 Tim. 1:9, “Who hath saved us, and
          called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but
          according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ
          Jesus before the world began.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. True Christians are chosen of God from all eternity, not only
          before they were born, but before the world was created. They were
          foreknown of God, and chosen by him out of the world, Eph. 1:4,
          “According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the
          world, that we should be holy, and without blame before him in love.”
          2 Tim. 1:9, “According to his own purpose and grace, which was given
          us in Christ Jesus, before the world began.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. God in election set his love upon those whom he elected, Rom. 9:13,
          “Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.” Jer. 31:3, “The Lord hath
          appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an
          everlasting love; therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee.” 1
          John 4:19, “We love him because he first loved us.” A God of infinite
          goodness and benevolence loves those that have no excellency to move
          or attract it. The love of men is consequent upon some loveliness in
          the object, but the love of God is antecedent to, and the cause of it.
          Believers were from all eternity beloved both by the Father and the
          Son. The eternal love of the Father appears in that he from all
          eternity contrived a way for their salvation, and chose Jesus Christ
          to be their Redeemer, and laid help upon him. It is a fruit of this
          electing love that God sent his Son into the world to die, it was to
          redeem those whom he so loved. 1 John 4:10, “Herein is love, not that
          we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
          propitiation for our sins.” It is a fruit of the eternal, electing
          love of Jesus Christ, that he was willing to come into the world, and
          die for sinners, and that he actually came and died, Gal. 2:20, “I am
          crucified with Christ: nevertheless, I live; yet not I, but Christ
          liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by
          the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”
          And so conversion, and glorification, and all that is done for a
          believer from the first to the last, is a fruit of electing love.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. This electing love of God is singly of every particular person.
          Some deny a particular election, and say that there is no other
          election than a general determination, that all that believe and obey
          shall be saved. Some also own no more than an absolute election of
          nations. But God did from all eternity singly and distinctly choose,
          and set his love upon, every particular person that ever believes, as
          is evident by Gal. 2:20, “Who loved me and gave himself for me.” God
          set his love from eternity upon this and that person, as particularly
          as if there were no other chosen than he. Therefore it is represented
          as though they were mentioned by name, that their names are written in
          the book of life, Luke 10:20, “Notwithstanding, in this rejoice not,
          that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because
          your names are written in heaven.” Rev. 13:8, “And all that dwell upon
          the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book
          of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.”
        </p>
        <p>
          6. In election, believers were from all eternity given to Jesus
          Christ. As believers were chosen from all eternity, so Christ was from
          eternity chosen and appointed to be their Redeemer, and he undertook
          the work of redeeming them. There was a covenant respecting it between
          the Father and Son. Christ, as we have already observed, loved them
          before the creation of the world. Then he had their names, as it were,
          written in a book, and therefore the book of life is called the Lamb’s
          book, Rev. 21:27, “And there shall in no wise enter into it anything
          that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a
          lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.” And he
          bears their names upon his heart, as the high priest of old did the
          names of the tribes of the children of Israel on his breastplate.
          Christ often calls the elect those whom God had given him. John 17:2,
          “As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give
          eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.” In the 9th verse, “I
          pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast
          given me; for they are thine.” In the 11th verse, “And now I am no
          more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee.
          Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given
          me, that they may be one, as we are.”
        </p>
        <p>
          This part of the subject may suggest to us the following reflections.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) God’s thus electing a certain definite number from among fallen
          men from all eternity, is a manifestation of his glory. It shows the
          glory of the divine sovereignty. God hereby declares himself the
          absolute disposer of the creature. He shows us how far his sovereignty
          and dominion extend, in eternally choosing some and passing by others,
          and leaving them to perish. God here appears in a majesty that is
          unparalleled. Those who can see no glory of dominion in this act, have
          not attained to right apprehensions of God, and never have been made
          sensible of his glorious greatness. And here is especially shown the
          glory of divine grace: in God’s having chosen his people to
          blessedness and glory long before they are born, in his choosing them
          out of the mass of mankind from whom they were not distinguished, and
          in his love to them being prior to all that they have or do, being
          uninfluenced by any excellency of theirs, by the light of any labors
          or endeavors of theirs, or any respect of theirs towards him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of election shows that if those who are converted have
          earnestly sought grace and holiness, and in that way have obtained it,
          their obtaining it is not owing to their endeavors, but that it was
          the grace and mercy of God that caused them earnestly to seek
          conversion, that they might obtain it. It shows also that faith itself
          is the gift of God, and that the saints persevering in a way of
          holiness unto glory, is also the fruit of electing love. Believers’
          love to God is the fruit of God’s love to them, and the giving of
          Christ, the preaching of the gospel, and the appointing of ordinances,
          are all fruits of the grace of election. All the grace that is shown
          to any of mankind, either in this world, or in the world to come, is
          comprised in the electing love of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) If believers are the chosen of God, here is a great argument for
          their love and gratitude towards him. The consideration of the
          miserable condition in which God found you, and in which he left
          others, should move your hearts. How wonderful that God should take
          such thought of a poor worm from all eternity! God might have left you
          as well as many others, but it pleased the Lord to set his love upon
          you. What cause have you for love and thankfulness, that God should
          make choice of you, and set you apart for himself, rather than so many
          thousands of others!
        </p>
        <p>
          God has chosen you not merely to be his subjects and servants, but to
          be his children, to be his particular treasure. He has chosen you to
          be blessed forever in the enjoyment of himself, and to dwell with him
          in his glory. He has given you from all eternity to his Son, to be
          united unto him, to become the spouse of Christ. He has chosen you
          that you might be holy and without blame, that you might have your
          filth taken away, and that you might have the image of God put upon
          you, and that your soul might be adorned, to be the bride of his
          glorious and dear Son. What cause for love is here!
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) If believers are a chosen generation, let all labor earnestly to
          make their election sure. If true Christians are chosen of God, this
          should induce all earnestly to inquire whether they are true
          Christians. 2 Pet. 1:5-7, “And besides this, giving all diligence, add
          to your faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge,
          temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness;
          and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness,
          charity.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, true Christians are a distinct race of men. They are of a
          peculiar descent or pedigree, different from the rest of the world.
          This is implied in their being called a generation. There are three
          significations of the word generation in the Scriptures. Sometimes it
          means, as is its meaning in the common use, a class of persons among a
          people, or in the world, that are born together, or so nearly
          together, that the time of their being in the different stages of the
          age of man is the same. They shall be young persons, middle aged, and
          old together. Or they shall be together upon the stage of action. All
          that are together upon the face of the earth, or the stage of action,
          are very often accounted as one generation. Thus when God threatened
          that not one of the Israelites of that generation should see the good
          land, it is meant, all from twenty years old and upwards.
        </p>
        <p>A second meaning is, those who are born of a common progenitor.</p>
        <p>
          A third meaning of the word in Scripture, is, a certain race of
          mankind, whose generation and birth agree, not as to time, but as to
          descent and pedigree, or as to those persons from whom they originally
          proceeded. So it is to be understood, Mat. 1:1, “This is the book of
          the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the son of Abraham;”
          that is, this is the book that gives an account of his pedigree. And
          this meaning, viz. those who are of the same race and descent, must be
          given to the word in the text. The righteous are often spoken of in
          Scripture as being a distinct generation, Psa. 14:5, “There were they
          in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.” Psa.
          24:6, “This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy
          face, O Jacob.” Psa. 73:15, “If I say, I will speak thus: behold, I
          should offend against the generation of thy children.”
        </p>
        <p>
          That the godly are a distinct race appears evident, since they are
          descended from God. They are a heavenly race, and they are derived
          from above. The heathen were wont to feign that their heroes and great
          men were descended from the gods, but God’s people are descended from
          the true and living God, without any fiction, Psa. 22:30, “A seed
          shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.”
          That is, a seed, a posterity, shall serve him, and it shall be
          accounted to the Lord for his posterity or offspring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the people of God may be considered as descending from God, and as
          being his posterity, either remotely or immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They are remotely descended from God. The church is a distinct race
          that originally came from God. Other men are of the earth, they are of
          earthly derivation, they are the posterity of men, but the church is
          the posterity of God. Thus it is said, Gen. 6:2, “That the sons of God
          saw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took them
          wives of all which they chose.” The sons of God were the children of
          the church, of the posterity of Seth. The daughters of men were those
          that were born out of the church, and of the posterity of Cain, and
          those that adhered to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was God that set up the church in the world, and those who were the
          first founders of the church were of God, and were called specially
          the sons of God. Seth was the seed that God appointed, Gen. 4:25, “And
          Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name
          Seth. For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of
          Abel, whom Cain slew.” Adam, in Luke’s genealogy of Christ (Luke 3:38,
          “Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the
          son of Adam, which was the son of God,”) is called the son of God,
          possibly, not only because he was immediately created by God, but also
          because he was from God, and was begotten by him. As he was a good
          man, and was the founder of the church of which Christ himself became
          a son. He was the first in line of the church, and as such he was from
          God. When the church was almost extinct God called Abraham out of Ur
          of the Chaldees, and afterwards out of Haran. Abraham was one
          immediately from God, and all God’s people in all succeeding ages are
          accounted as the children of Abraham. God promised Abraham that his
          seed should be as the stars of heaven, and as the sand on the
          seashore, meaning primarily not his posterity according to the flesh.
          John the Baptist said, God is able of the stones to raise up children
          unto Abraham. Those are the seed of Abraham, as we are taught in the
          New Testament, that are of the faith of Abraham. Christians, as well
          as Jews, are the seed of Abraham, Gal. 3:29, “And if ye be Christ’s,
          then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” So
          the church is the seed of Jacob, who is called God’s son, Hos. 11:1,
          “When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of
          Egypt.” All God’s people are called Israel, not only his posterity
          according to the flesh, but proselytes of old, and Gentile Christians
          now under the gospel. The sincerely godly, and they only, are the true
          Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the people of God are descended from God the Father originally, as
          they are descended from Christ the Son of God. Christians are called
          the seed of Christ, Gal. 3:29, “And if ye be Christ’s,” etc. They are,
          as it were, his posterity. Christ calls them his children, Heb. 2:13,
          “Behold I and the children which thou hast given me.” So that if we
          trace the pedigree of God’s people up to their original, they will be
          found to be descended from God: they are of heaven, they are not of
          this world. Other men are of the earth, and are earthly, but these are
          heavenly, and are of heaven. The wicked are called the men of this
          world, Psa. 17:14, “From men which are thy hand, O Lord, from men of
          the world which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou
          fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave
          the rest of their substance to their babes.” The first beginnings of
          the church were from God, the great founder of the church. Jesus
          Christ is the Son of God, and those men, who under him have been
          founders, were of God, were of him. God chose them, called them, and
          created them for this purpose. Since which, God’s people are descended
          one from another; the church is continued and propagated, as it were,
          by generation. If there were no ordinary and stated means made use of
          for the continuing and propagating the church, it would not be so. But
          God’s people are made the instruments of one another’s conversion, by
          begetting one another’s souls. The church is continued by itself
          instrumentally through all generations, the people of God are begotten
          through the education, instruction, and endeavors of those who were
          God’s people before. Therefore the church is represented in Scripture
          as being the mother of its members, Gal. 4:26, “But Jerusalem which is
          above is free, which is the mother of us all.” Believers are the
          children of the church, as they are often called, Isa. 49:20, “The
          children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shalt
          say again in thine ears, the place is too strait for me; give place to
          me, that I may dwell.” Isa. 54:1, “Sing, O barren, thou that didst not
          bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not
          travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the
          children of the married wife, saith the Lord.” And many other places.
        </p>
        <p>
          God’s people are often, through their education and instruction, the
          spiritual parents of those of whom they are the natural parents. The
          ministers of the Word and ordinances are spiritual fathers. The
          apostle tells the Christian Corinthians, that he had begotten them
          through the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God’s people are immediately begotten of God. When they become
          saints, they are born again, and they have a new nature given them.
          They have a new life begun, and they are renewed in the whole man by a
          new generation and birth wherein they are born of God, John 1:12, 13,
          “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons
          of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not of
          blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
          God.” They are born of the Spirit of God, John 3:8, “The wind bloweth
          where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not
          tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth: so is every one that is
          born of the Spirit.” God is said to have formed the church from the
          womb, Isa. 44:2, “Thus saith the Lord that made thee, and formed thee
          from the womb, which will help thee: Fear not, O Jacob my servant; and
          thou, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.”
        </p>
        <p>This truth also may suggest to us a few profitable reflections.</p>
        <p>
          (1.) Christians ought to bear with one another. It appears from what
          has been said that they are all of one kindred, that they have a
          relation to other Christians which they have not to the rest of the
          world, being of a distinct race from them, but of the same race one
          with another. They are descended all along from the same progenitors;
          they are the children of the same universal church of God; they are
          all the children of Abraham; they are the seed of Jesus Christ; they
          are the offspring of God. And they are yet much more alike, than their
          being of the same race originally argues them to be: they are also
          immediately the children of the same Father. God hath begotten all by
          the same Word and Spirit. They are all of one family, and should
          therefore love as brethren, 1 Pet. 3:8, “Finally, be ye all of one
          mind, having compassion one of another; love as brethren, be pitiful,
          be courteous.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very unbecoming those who are God’s offspring, to entertain a
          spirit of hatred and ill will one towards another. It is very
          unbecoming to be backward in helping and assisting one another, and
          supplying each other’s wants, much more, to contrive and seek one
          another’s hurt, to be revengeful one towards another.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Let Christians take heed so to walk that they may not dishonor
          their pedigree. You are of a very honorable race, more honorable by
          far than if you were the offspring of kings, and had royal blood in
          your veins. You are a heavenly offspring, the seed of Jesus Christ,
          the children of God. They that are of noble race are wont to value
          themselves highly upon the honor of their families, to dwell on their
          titles, their coats of arms, and their ensigns of honor, and to
          recount the exploits of their illustrious forefathers. How much more
          careful should you be of the honor of your descent: that you in
          nothing behave yourself unworthy of the great God, the eternal and
          omnipotent King of heaven and earth, whose offspring you are!
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many things that are very base, and too mean for such as
          you. Such are a giving way to earthly-mindedness, a groveling like
          moles in the earth, a suffering your soul to cleave to those earthly
          things which ought to be neglected and despised by those who are of
          heavenly descent, an indulgence of the lusts of the flesh, suffering
          the soul to be immersed in filth, being taken up with mean and
          unworthy delights common to the beasts, being intemperate in the
          gratification of any carnal appetite whatsoever, or a being much
          concerned about earthly honor. It is surely a disgrace to them, who
          are accounted to God for a generation, much to care whether they are
          accounted great upon this dunghill. So it is unworthy of your noble
          descent to be governed by your passions: you should be guided by
          higher principles of reason and virtue, and an universal respect to
          the glory and honor of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Christians should seek after those things which will be to the
          honor of their birth, after spiritual wisdom, and knowledge of the
          most worthy and noble truths. They should seek more and more an
          acquaintance with God, and to be assimilated to him, their great
          progenitor, and their immediate Father, that they may have the image
          of his excellent and divine perfections. They should endeavor to act
          like God, wherein they are capable of imitation of him. They should
          seek heavenly-mindedness: those noble appetites after heavenly and
          spiritual enjoyments, a noble ambition after heavenly glory, a
          contempt of the trifles and mean things of this world. They should
          seek after those delights and satisfactions that can be enjoyed by
          none but heavenly minds. They should exercise a spirit of true,
          universal, and disinterested love and confidence, and Christian
          charity. They should be much in devotion, and divine contemplation.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) We see here a reason why Christians are of so different a nature
          and temper from the rest of the world. The truly godly are very
          different in their disposition from others. They hate those things
          that the rest of the world love, and love those things for which the
          rest of the world have no relish, insomuch that others are ready to
          wonder that they should place any happiness in a strict observance of
          the self-denying duties of religion. They wonder what delight they can
          take in spending so much time in meditation and prayer, and that they
          do not place happiness in those things which themselves do, 1 Pet.
          4:4, “Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the
          same excess of riot; speaking evil of you.” But the reason is, they
          are of a different race, and so derive different dispositions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is ordinary to see those who are of different families, of a
          different temper. The natural temper of parents is commonly in some
          degree transmitted to their posterity. Indeed, all agree in many
          things, for all are of the same blood originally. All are descended
          from the same Adam, and the same Noah. But Christians are born again
          of another stock, different from all the rest of the world. Therefore
          they are of a temper by themselves, wherein none of the rest of the
          world agree with them, Rev. 1:6, “And hath made us kings and priests
          unto God, and his Father: to him be glory and dominion, for ever and
          ever.”
        </p>
        <p>II. True Christians are a royal priesthood.</p>
        <p>
          The two offices of king and priest were accounted very honorable both
          among Jews and heathens. But it was a thing not known under the law of
          Moses, that the same person should sustain both these offices in a
          stated manner. While Moses himself is said to have been king in
          Jeshurun, yet his brother Aaron was the high priest. Those who were
          kings by divine appointment in Israel were of another tribe from the
          priesthood, viz. the tribe of Judah. Before the giving the law we have
          an instance of one who was both king and priest, viz. Melchizedek,
          Gen. 14:18, “And Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and
          wine; and he was the priest of the most high God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, in some of the prophecies of Christ, it is spoken of as a
          remarkable thing of him, that he should be a priest after the order of
          Melchizedek, Psa. 110:4, “The Lord hath sworn and will not repent;
          thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.” The same
          again is prophesied of as a wonderful thing by Zechariah, that he
          should be a priest upon a throne, Zec. 6:13, “Even he shall build the
          temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and
          rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and
          the counsel of peace shall be between them both.” In this respect the
          gospel dispensation differs from the legal, that it reveals the
          compatibility of the two offices. One person, Jesus Christ, is
          antitype of both kings and priests, under the law. As it is the will
          of Christ, who became in all things like unto us, that his disciples
          should in many things become like unto him, so it is in this among
          others. As Christ is the Son of God, so those that are Christ’s are
          the children of God. As Christ is the heir of God, so as Christ
          liveth, it is his will that they should live also. As Christ rose from
          the dead, so it is the will of Christ that his saints should rise
          also. As Christ is in heaven in glory, so it is the will of Christ
          that they should be with him where he is. So as Christ is both King
          and Priest, so shall believers be made kings and priests. What is said
          in the text is either with respect to what they now are, or what they
          shall be hereafter. The apostle says, “ye are a royal priesthood;”
          that is, ye have those honors in reversion. Christians are kings here,
          as a king who is in his minority, who though the crown is his right,
          has not yet come actually to reign. They are indeed in an exalted
          state while here, but not as they will be hereafter. Christians while
          here are indeed priests, but not as they will be. Christians are
          called kings and priests here, in this world, Rev. 1:6, “And hath made
          us kings and priests unto God and his Father.” But in Rev. 5 the
          saints in heaven speak of this as the consequence of their glory and
          exaltation, Rev. 5:9, 10, “And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art
          worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; for thou wast
          slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred,
          and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God
          kings and priests; that we should reign on the earth.”
        </p>
        <p>First, Christians are kings.</p>

          When Christians are called kings, the Scriptures include both what
          they actually have in this world, and what they have in a future
          state. The reward which our Lord Jesus promised to his disciples was a
          kingdom, Luke 22:29, “And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father
          hath appointed unto me.” Christians, having this promise, are
          therefore heirs of a kingdom here, which they are hereafter to
          receive, Jam. 2:5, “Hearken, my beloved brethren; hath not God chosen
          the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which
          he hath promised to them that love him?”
        </p>
        <p>
          The reward of the saints is represented as a kingdom, because the
          possession of a kingdom is the height of human advancement in this
          world, and as it is the common opinion that those who have a kingdom
          have the greatest possible happiness. The happiness of a kingdom, or
          royal state, for which it is so much admired by mankind, consists in
          these things:
        </p>
        <p>1. The honor of a kingdom.</p>
        <p>2. The possessions of kings.</p>
        <p>3. The government or authority of kings.</p>
        <p>
          Now with respect to each of these, the happiness of the saints is far
          greater than that of the kings and greatest potentates in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. True Christians will be advanced to honors far above those of
          earthly kings. They will have a vastly higher dignity than any
          princes. If these are nobly descended, it is not so great an honor as
          to be the sons of God. If they are nobly educated, and have their
          minds formed for government, and have princely qualifications, these
          qualifications are not so honorable as those with which God endows his
          saints, whose minds he fills with divine knowledge, and gives them
          true and perfect holiness. Princes appear honorable from their outward
          enjoyment of honor and dignity, their royal robes, their stately
          palaces, and their splendid equipage. But these are not so honorable
          as those white robes, those inherent ornaments, with which the saints
          shall appear in heaven, with which they “shall shine forth as the sun
          in the kingdom of their Father.” What is a king’s palace to those
          mansions in heaven, that Christ prepares for his saints? The honor of
          the creature consists in likeness and nearness to the Creator in
          heaven. The saints shall be like him, for they shall see him as he is.
          They shall be most near to him, and shall be admitted to a most
          intimate fellowship.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The saints shall have greater and more extensive possessions than
          any earthly monarch. One reason for which the state of kings is
          admired is their wealth. They have the most precious things laid up in
          their treasures. We read of the peculiar treasure of kings, Ecc. 2:8,
          “I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of
          kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers,
          and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that
          of all sorts;” that is, the peculiar treasure of other kings. David
          conquered and subdued many kings, and spoiled their peculiar treasure,
          which fell to his son Solomon.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the precious treasures of kings are not to be compared to those
          precious things which Christ will give his saints in another world:
          the gold tried in the fire that Christ has purchased with his own
          blood, those precious jewels, those graces and joys of his Spirit, and
          that beauty of mind with which he will endow them. King’s possessions
          are very extensive, especially were they thus when kings were
          generally absolute, and their whole dominions, their subjects and
          their fortunes, were looked upon as their possessions. But these fall
          short of the extensive possessions of the saints, who possess all
          things. They are the heirs of God, and all that is God’s is theirs so
          far as it can contribute to their happiness, Rev. 21:7, “He that
          overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he
          shall be my son.” 1 Cor. 3:21, 22, “Therefore let no man glory in men,
          for all things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the
          world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all
          are yours.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The saints shall also be advanced to the authority of kings. Christ
          has appointed to them a kingdom, and in that kingdom they shall reign.
          It is promised concerning the saints, that they shall reign, Rev.
          5:10, “And hath made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall
          reign on the earth.” Rev. 22:5, “And there shall be no night there:
          and they need no candle, neither light of the sun, for the Lord God
          giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.” It is
          evident that they shall have a kingdom with respect to rule and
          government, as appears, Rev. 2:26, 27, “And he that overcometh, and
          keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over all
          nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of
          a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my
          Father.” But we must see that we rightly understand this. They shall
          not be appointed by God as sovereigns of the world, without any
          superior to direct them. Neither shall they be properly deputies or
          viceroys, as king Agrippa and some other kings were the deputies of
          the Roman emperors. But they shall reign in fellowship with Christ as
          joint heirs. They shall reign in the same kingdom with him, and shall
          have the happiness of having things done according to their will as
          much as if their own wills were paramount. Christ wills their will.
          All things will be disposed in the best manner for them, and to
          promote their happiness. “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit
          with me in my throne; even as I also overcame, and am set down with my
          Father in his throne.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The reigning of the saints will consist partly in judging. For the
          saints shall judge the world, angels and men with Christ, Mat. 19:28,
          “And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have
          followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the
          throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging
          the twelve tribes of Israel.” 1 Cor. 6:2, 3, “Do ye not know that the
          saints shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you,
          are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we
          shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life!”
          How earnestly do men seek a kingdom! What fatigues, what dangers, what
          bloodshed, will they not encounter! In seeking conversion, you seek a
          kingdom. You who are poor, you who are children, have opportunity to
          obtain a kingdom, to advance yourselves to higher dignity, to more
          substantial honors, to greater possessions, to more precious
          treasures, to be clothed in robes of richer splendor, and to fill a
          loftier throne, than those enjoyed by the greatest earthly monarchs.
          It is a crown that you are to run for, an incorruptible crown, to be
          given you by the Great King of heaven, and to be worn by you as long
          as his throne shall endure. What encouragement is here afforded to the
          saints under afflictions and reproaches. What are they, to the worth
          and honor of a heavenly kingdom? When you shall have a crown of glory
          placed on your head, and be seated on Christ’s throne, and shine forth
          as the light, and are seated at his royal banquet, then you will
          suffer no more forever. All trouble, all reproach, shall be driven
          away; you will be too high to be reached by the malice of men and
          devils, and shall soon forget all your sorrows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, true Christians are priests of God. The priesthood under the
          law was a very honorable and sacred office, Heb. 5:4, “And no man
          taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was
          Aaron.” It was on account of this honor that those proud men, Korah
          and his company, envied Aaron; and God asserted and vindicated Aaron’s
          right to it, by causing his rod to bud.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an honor which, before the giving of the law, when every
          particular family was wont to offer sacrifices for themselves, the
          firstborn used to claim, and therefore the birthright was so much
          esteemed and valued. Therefore Jacob had such a desire of having the
          birthright of his brother Esau, and Esau’s despising of it is spoken
          of as a great instance of his profaneness. A priest is said to be a
          chief man among his people, Lev. 21:4, “But he shall not defile
          himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.”
          Because the office of the priesthood was so honorable, it is noticed
          as a wicked contempt of it in several wicked kings, that they made of
          the meanest of the people priests. The office was so honorable, that a
          king, Uzziah, coveted the honor of it, and it is mentioned as an
          instance of his pride that he did so, 2 Chr. 26:16, “But when he was
          strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he
          transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the temple of the
          Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense.” And it was a very
          sacred office, and that above all other offices. Therefore those
          things were forbidden the priest that were lawful for all others, such
          as to be defiled for the dead, or to take to wife one that is put away
          from her husband, and the reason is given, Lev. 21:6, “They shall be
          holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God, for the
          offerings of the Lord made by fire, and the bread of their God, they
          do offer; therefore they shall be holy. They shall not take a wife
          that is a whore, or profane, neither shall they take a woman put away
          from her husband; for he is holy unto his God. Thou shalt sanctify him
          therefore, for he offereth the bread of thy God, he shall be holy unto
          thee: for I, the Lord, which sanctify you, am holy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ is the only proper priest that is to offer sacrifices,
          and make atonement for sin, under the New Testament. He was the priest
          of whom all the priests of old were typical. But yet all believers are
          herein in a measure conformed to their head, and assimilated to him.
          The priesthood now is no longer confined to one family, to Aaron and
          his sons, but all the true Israel are priests. Every true Christian
          has a work and office that is as sacred as that of the priests was
          under the law, and everyone is advanced to a like honor, and indeed to
          a greater. But how every true Christian is a priest of God will appear
          in the following things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Every true Christian is allowed as near an access to God, and as
          free a use of the sacred things, as the priests were of old. God under
          the law dwelt in the tabernacle and temple, that were the symbol of
          his presence, and those places were holy. The seed of Aaron might go
          into the holy place to minister before the Lord, but if any other came
          nigh, he was to be put to death, Num. 3:10, “And thou shalt appoint
          Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest’s office: and
          the stranger that cometh nigh, shall be put to death.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But now all are allowed to come nigh, we are all allowed a free access
          to God, to come with boldness and confidence. God’s people are not
          kept at such a distance now as they were under the law. The church
          then was in its minority, and the heir, while a child, differs nothing
          from a servant. The servant is not allowed the free access of a child,
          he is kept more at a distance with fear and dread. Agreeably to the
          nature of that dispensation, there were not those special discoveries
          of the grace and love of God that are now made, and which invite
          rather than forbid near access.
        </p>
        <p>
          When God was wont to appear to the children of Israel, it was more
          with terror and manifestations of awful majesty, and not so much with
          the discoveries of grace as now. When God appeared on mount Sinai, it
          was in flaming fire, and with thunder, and lightning, and earthquakes.
          But in how different a manner did he appear, when he appeared in the
          person of Christ, with mildness, and gentleness, and love! There is
          much the same difference between us and them with respect of the
          liberty of access to God, as there was between the liberty of access
          of the children of Israel at mount Sinai, and the liberty which
          Christ’s disciples had of approach to him when he was upon earth. At
          mount Sinai, only Moses and Aaron, and Nadab and Abihu, were allowed
          to come up into the mount, and none but Moses was to approach nigh,
          Exo. 24:1, “And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the Lord, thou and
          Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and
          worship ye afar off.” But if any other presumed to touch the mount,
          God would break forth upon him. But Christ’s disciples used daily to
          converse with him, as an intimate friend, Heb. 12:18, “For ye are not
          come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire,
          nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest.” Yea, Christians are
          now allowed as near an approach unto God, as the high priest himself,
          who was allowed a much nearer approach than any of the other priests.
          God’s dwelling place was the temple, but more especially was it in the
          holy of holies, in the mercy seat between the cherubim. There was a
          veil which separated that part of the temple from the rest, and no one
          might ever enter that veil but the high priest, and that but once a
          year, not oftener, upon pain of death, Lev. 16:2, “And the Lord said
          unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all
          times into the holy place, within the veil before the mercy-seat,
          which is upon the ark, that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud
          upon the mercy-seat.” The way into the holiest of all was not as yet
          made manifest, but now it is, Heb. 9:7, 8, “But into the second went
          the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he
          offered for himself, and for the errors of the people. The Holy Ghost
          thus signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made
          manifest, while as yet the first tabernacle was standing.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But now we are all allowed as near an access to God as the high priest
          only was under the law, and with more freedom, for he might approach
          but once a year. But Christians may approach boldly at all times
          through the blood of Christ, without any danger of dying, Heb. 4:16,
          “Let us, therefore, come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may
          obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.” The throne of
          grace and the mercy seat are the same thing. “Having, therefore,
          brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by
          a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the
          veil, that is to say, his flesh; and having a high priest over the
          house of God; let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of
          faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our
          bodies washed with pure water.” That access into the holiest of all
          was allowed to all under the gospel, and at any time. It is signified
          by the rending of the veil, upon the death of Christ, for then was
          that blood shed by which we have access, Mat. 27:50, 51, “Jesus, when
          he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And,
          behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
          bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But especially will the access of saints in another world be much more
          near and familiar than that of the high priest. They shall not only
          enter into the holy of holies, but shall dwell with God in it, for
          heaven is the holiest of all. They shall then dwell in God’s presence,
          they shall see his face, which no man can see and live.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this world, though there is greater liberty of access than there
          was of old, yet still Christians are kept at a great distance from God
          in comparison of what they will be in heaven, where they shall be
          admitted even to higher privileges than Moses in the mount, when he
          besought God to show him his glory. They shall then see with open
          face, and shall know as they are known.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Christians are a priesthood with respect to their offerings to God.
          The principal part of the work of the priests of old was to offer
          sacrifice, and to burn incense. As the priests of old offered
          sacrifice, so the work of Christians is to offer up spiritual
          sacrifices to God, 1 Pet. 2:5, “Ye also, as lively stones, are built
          up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
          sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.” And here,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Christians offer up their own hearts to God in sacrifice: they
          dedicate themselves to God, Rom. 6:13, “Neither yield ye your members
          as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto
          God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as
          instruments of righteousness unto God.” The Christian gives himself to
          God freely as of mere choice. He does it heartily; he desires to be
          God’s, and to belong to no other. He gives all the faculties of his
          soul to God. He gives God his heart, and it is offered to God as a
          sacrifice in two ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of these, the first is when the heart is broken for sin. A sacrifice,
          before it can be offered, must be wounded and slain. The heart of a
          true Christian is first wounded by a sense of sin, of the great evil
          and danger of it, and is slain with godly sorrow and true repentance.
          When the heart truly repents, it dies unto sin. Repentance is compared
          unto a death in the Word of God. Rom. 6:6-8, “Knowing this, that our
          old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be
          destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is
          dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that
          we shall also live with him. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be
          dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our
          Lord.” Gal. 2:20, “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live;
          yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in
          the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and
          gave himself for me.” As Christ, when he was offered, was offered
          broken upon the cross. So there is some likeness to this, when a soul
          is converted: the heart is offered to God slain and broken, Psa.
          51:17, “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
          contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The second way is when a Christian offers his heart to God, flaming
          with love. The sacrifice of old was not only to be slain, but to be
          burnt upon the altar. It was to ascend in flame and smoke, and so to
          be a sweet savor to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          That fire upon the altar was a type of two things: it was a type of
          the fire of the wrath of God, and it was also a type of the fire of
          the Spirit of God, or of divine love. The Holy Ghost is often compared
          to fire. With respect to the former, Christ alone is the sacrifice
          offered in the flame of God’s wrath. But with regard to the latter,
          the hearts of the children of men are offered in the flame of divine
          love, and ascend up to God in that flame. This divine love is fire
          from heaven, as the fire upon the altar of old was. When a soul is
          drawn to God in true conversion, fire comes down from God out of
          heaven, in which the heart is offered in sacrifice, and the soul is
          baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many of the sacrifices that were offered, only the fat about the
          inwards was burnt upon the altar, which fat of the inwards thus rising
          in flame, represented the offering of the soul. It is that which God
          looks at. It is that which must be offered in sacrifice to God.
          Especially hereafter, when the saints will be made priests in a more
          glorious manner than at present, will they offer up their hearts
          wholly to God in the flame of love. They shall, as it were, all be
          transformed into love, as burning oil is transformed into flame, and
          so, in that flame, shall they ascend up to God. Their souls will be as
          the angels, who are as a flame of fire not only for activity in God’s
          service, but for love too. They shall be a flame ever burning, which
          shall burn longer than the fire upon the altar in Israel, that never
          went out, from the time that fire came down out of heaven in the
          wilderness, till the carrying away into Babylon.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) This spiritual priesthood offers to God the sacrifice of praise.
          Many of their sacrifices under the law were sacrifices of peace
          offerings, which were mostly for thanksgiving and praise. But the
          spiritual sacrifice of the hearty and sincere praises of a saint, are
          more acceptable to God than all the bulls, and rams, and he-goats that
          they offered. The heartfelt praises of one true Christian are of more
          account with God than all those two and twenty thousand oxen, and a
          hundred and twenty thousand sheep, which Solomon offered to God at the
          dedication of the temple, as a sacrifice of peace offerings. Praise is
          called a sacrifice, Heb. 13:15, “By him, therefore, let us offer the
          sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our
          lips, giving thanks to his name.” Psa. 50:13, 14, “Will I eat the
          flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer unto God
          thanksgiving, and pay thy vows unto the Most High;” verse 23 “Whoso
          offereth praise, glorifieth me; and to him that ordereth his
          conversation aright, will I show the salvation of God;” Psa. 69:30,
          31, “I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him
          with thanksgiving. This also shall please the Lord better than an ox
          or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.” Praises are therefore in Hosea
          called calves of our lips, because they are like calves offered in
          sacrifice, Hos. 14:2, “Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say
          unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously; so will
          we render the calves of our lips.” Only true Christians offer those
          sacrifices. However hypocrites pretend to praise God, and to offer
          thanksgiving to him. Yet they, being insincere, offer not sacrifices
          with which God is well pleased. They offer not spiritual sacrifices,
          and therefore they are not of the spiritual priesthood. In heaven
          especially are the saints a holy priesthood upon this account, whose
          work it is forever to offer these sacrifices to God, who cease not day
          nor night to praise God and sing forth their ardent joyful
          hallelujahs. They sing a new song, a song that never will end, and
          never will grow old.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) The next sacrifice which is offered by this spiritual priesthood,
          is obedience, sincere obedience. The sacrifices under the law did not
          only represent Christ’s satisfying for sin by suffering, but they also
          represented Christ’s obeying in suffering. For the sacrifices under
          the law were not only for propitiation, but they were for purchasing
          benefits, and so typified not only the satisfaction, but merit, which
          was by obedience, Psa. 40:6-8, “Sacrifice and offering thou didst not
          desire: mine ears hast thou opened; burnt-offering and sin-offering
          hast thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the
          book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy
          law is within my heart.” And though the obedience of saints has no
          merit, yet it is pleasing and acceptable to God. It is as a
          sweet-smelling savor, and is compared to sacrifices, and preferred
          before them, 1 Sam 15:22, “And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great
          delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
          the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken
          than the fat of rams.” Christians, by offering obedience to God in
          their lives and conversation, do what the apostle calls offering their
          bodies to be a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, as their
          reasonable service (Rom. 12:1). They offer their bodies, that is they
          dedicate their bodies to holy uses and purposes. They yield their
          members as instruments of righteousness unto holiness. The soul, while
          here, acts externally by the body. And in this Christians serve God.
          They yield their eyes, their ears, their tongues, their hands, and
          feet, as servants to God, to be obedient to the dictates of his Word,
          and of his Holy Spirit in the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) Another sacrifice which we shall mention as offered by this
          spiritual priesthood is charity, or expressions of Christian love in
          gifts to others. If the gift flows from a spirit of Christian love
          although it be but a cup of cold water, it is an acceptable sacrifice
          to God. And indeed whatsoever is given for a pious use, if it be to
          promote religion, and uphold the public worship of God, or to benefit
          a particular person, if it be done from a good spirit, it is a
          Christian sacrifice, Heb. 13:16, “But to do good, and to communicate,
          forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But sacrifices of this kind may principally be ranked under two heads,
          of which the first is:
        </p>
        <p>
          Liberality to ministers of the gospel. The priests of old lived upon
          the sacrifices that were offered to God, and what is now offered to
          ministers for their comfortable and honorable support Christ looks
          upon as offered to himself. “He that receiveth you, receiveth me.”
          Mat. 10:40. Thus Paul says of those things that were sent him by his
          hearers, that it was a sacrifice acceptable and well pleasing to God,
          Phil. 4:14, etc. “Notwithstanding ye have well done that ye did
          communicate with my affliction. Now, ye Philippians, know also, that
          in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no
          church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye
          only. For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my
          necessity. Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may
          abound to your account. But I have all, and abound: I am full, having
          received of Epaphiroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor
          of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The second is bounty to the poor. Christ accepts what is done to them
          as being done to himself, Mat. 25:40, “And the King shall answer, and
          say unto them, Verity I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
          one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” This
          God prefers before the legal sacrifices. Hos. 6:6, “I desire mercy,
          and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than
          burnt-offerings.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) Another offering of this priesthood to God is the prayer of
          faith. Though this is rather compared to incense in Scripture than to
          a sacrifice, yet it is equally an evidence of their priesthood.
          Incense was that sweet confection which we read of, Exo. 30:34, “And
          the Lord said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and
          onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices, with pure frankincense; of
          each shall there be a like weight.” These they were wont to burn upon
          the censer as they offered it, which made a most fragrant smell. That
          incense is a type of the merits of Jesus Christ, and seems also to be
          a type of the prayers of God’s people in faith of the former. It was
          the custom, when the priest in the temple was burning incense, for the
          people to be praying without, Luke 1:10, “And the whole multitude of
          the people were praying without at the time of incense.” And gracious
          prayer is compared to incense, Psa. 141:2, “Let my prayer be set forth
          before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening
          sacrifice.” The prayer of faith is as a fragrant savor to God, through
          the merits of him towards whom that faith is exercised.
        </p>
        <p>Application</p>
        <p>
          1. Here are great motives for all earnestly to seek that they may
          become true Christians. It is a great honor to be priests of God. It
          was a great honor of old to be a priest under the law. It was a
          greater in some respects than to be a king, because they were nearer
          to God, and they in their work were more immediately concerned with
          him: it was a more holy and divine office. But more honorable is it to
          be of the spiritual priesthood. The access to God is nearer, and an
          infinitely greater privilege. Especially is the access to God which
          they will have in another world, where they shall see God, and shall
          converse with Christ as a man with his friend. If ever a king was
          ambitious of the honor of the legal priesthood, surely you may well
          desire the spiritual, which is an eternal priesthood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider that you are capable of receiving this priesthood. Of old,
          those who were not of the posterity of Aaron, were incapable of the
          priesthood. It was in vain for them to seek it, but it is not in vain
          for you to seek this spiritual priesthood. Consider also that you have
          a call to it, you have warrant sufficient. It would be a dreadful
          presumption for you to seek this honor if you had not a call to it,
          Heb. 5:4, “No man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is
          called of God, as was Aaron.” But you are called, and now it would be
          presumption and profane contempt in you to refuse it: to refuse such
          an honor as God offers you. Take heed, therefore, that there be not
          among you any profane person as Esau, who for a morsel of meat sold
          his birthright, and sold the priesthood that belonged to it. Take heed
          that you do not sell this spiritual priesthood for a morsel of meat,
          or for the trifles of this world, that you are not more concerned
          about a little worldly pelf or vain glory, than about that which is so
          sacred and honorable.
        </p>
        <p>
          For direction, that you may be one of this spiritual priesthood, seek
          of God his holy anointing, that is that God would pour out his Spirit
          in his sanctifying influences upon you. The priests of old were
          consecrated by the holy anointing oil, Exo. 29:7, “Then shalt thou
          take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him.”
          Exo. 30:30, “And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate
          them that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office.” If you
          are here separated for this holy station and service, you must have
          that holy anointing of the Spirit of God, typified by the oil that was
          poured upon Aaron’s head. The holy anointing oil of God must be upon
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Let all who profess themselves Christians take heed that they do
          not defile themselves and profane their sacred character. There was
          great strictness required of old of the priests, lest they should
          defile themselves and profane their office, and it was regarded as a
          dreadful thing to profane it. So holy a God hath threatened in the New
          Testament, that “if any man defile the temple of God, him will God
          destroy.” 1 Cor. 3:17. As Christians are here called the temple of
          God, so it is said, in the fifth verse , “Ye are a spiritual house, an
          holy priesthood.” Avoid the commission of all immoralities, or things
          that have a horrid filthiness in them, things that will dreadfully
          profane the sacred name by which you are called, and the sacred
          station wherein you are set.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take heed especially of lascivious impurities. Such things were looked
          upon as defiling the holy office of the priesthood of old, insomuch
          that if but a daughter of a priest was guilty of whoredom, she was to
          be burnt. Remember Hophni and Phineas, how sorely God dealt with them
          for profaning their office by their impurities, and with good Eli,
          that he was no more thorough to restrain them. God brought a curse
          upon the whole family which never was removed. God took away the
          priesthood from him, and took away the ark of the covenant from him
          and from Israel, and delivered it into captivity, and fulfilled his
          threatening, that there should not be an old man of his house forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take heed of every sin: an allowing any sin whatever is a dreadful
          presumption of your holy character.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. See that you well execute your office. Offer up your heart in
          sacrifice. Get and keep a near access to God. Come with boldness.
          Offer up a heart broken for sin; offer it up flaming with love to God;
          offer praise to God. Praise God for his glorious excellency, and for
          his love and mercy. Consider what great things you have to praise God
          for: the redemption of Jesus Christ, his sufferings, his obedience,
          and the gift of that holiness, which makes you like unto God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be ready to distribute, willing to communicate, and do good. Consider
          it is part of your office thus to do to which you are called and
          anointed, and as a sacrifice well-pleasing to God. Pity others in
          distress and be ready to help one another. God will have mercy and not
          sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          And be much in offering up your prayers to God, and see that all your
          offerings are offered upon the right altar, otherwise they will be
          abominable to God. Offer your hearts to God through Jesus Christ. In
          his name present the sacrifice of praise, obedience, charity, and of
          prayer on the golden altar perfumed with the incense of Christ’s
          merits. Your reward will be to have this honor in heaven, to be
          exalted to that glorious priesthood, to be made a priest unto God
          forever and ever.
