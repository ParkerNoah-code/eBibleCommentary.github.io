          Deuteronomy 15:7-11, “If there be among you a poor man of one of thy
          brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God
          giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand
          from thy poor brother: but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him,
          and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he
          wanteth. Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart,
          saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine
          eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and
          he cry unto the Lord against thee, and it be sin unto thee. Thou shalt
          surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest
          unto him: because that for this thing the Lord thy God shall bless
          thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.
          For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command
          thee, saying Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy
          poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.”
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>The words explained.</p>
        <p>
          Subject: ’Tis the most absolute and indispensable duty of a people of
          God to give bountifully and willingly for the supply of the wants of
          the needy.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE duty here enjoined, is giving to the poor. “If there be among you
          a poor man of one of thy brethren, thou shalt not harden thine heart,
          nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother: — Thou shalt surely give
          him.” Here by thy poor brother is to be understood the same as in
          other places is meant by neighbor. It is explained in Lev. 25:35 to
          mean not only those of their own nation, but even strangers and
          sojourners. “And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay
          with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger,
          or a sojourner.” The Pharisees indeed interpreted it to signify only
          one of their own nation. But Christ condemns this interpretation, Luke
          10:29, etc. and teaches, in contradiction to their opinion, that the
          rules of charity, in the law of Moses, are to be extended to the
          Samaritans, who were not of their nation, and between whom and the
          Jews there was the most bitter enmity, and who were a people very
          troublesome to the Jews.
        </p>
        <p>
          God gives us direction how we are to give in such a case, viz.
          bountifully, and willingly. We should give bountifully, and
          sufficiently for the supply of the poor’s need. Deu. 15:7, 8, “Thou
          shalt not shut up thine hand from thy poor brother; but thou shalt
          open thine hand wide unto him, and lend him sufficient for his need,
          in that which he wanteth.” And again, in verse 11, “Thou shalt open
          thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in
          thy land.” Again, we should give willingly and without grudging. Deu.
          15:7, “Thou shalt not harden thine heart from thy poor brother,” And
          verse 10, “And thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also observe how peremptorily this duty is here enjoined, and
          how much it is insisted on. It is repeated over and over again, and
          enjoined in the strongest terms. Deu. 15:7, “Thou shalt not harden
          thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother.” Verse 8, “But
          thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him.” Verse 10, “Thou shalt
          surely give him.” Verse 11, “I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open
          thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, God strictly warns against objections, Deu. 15:9, “Beware
          that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh
          year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against
          thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought, and he cry unto the Lord
          against thee, and it be sin unto thee.” The matter concerning the
          seventh year, or year of release, was thus: God had given Israel a
          law, that every seventh year should be a year of release; that if any
          man had lent anything to any of his poor neighbors, if the latter had
          not been able to repay it before that year, the former should release
          it, and should not exact it of his neighbor, but give it to him.
          Therefore God warns the children of Israel against making of this an
          objection to helping their poor neighbors, that the year of release
          was near at hand, and it was not likely that they would be able to
          refund it again before that time, and then they should lose it wholly,
          because then they would be obliged to release it. God foresaw that the
          wickedness of their hearts would be very ready to make such an
          objection. But very strictly warns them against it, that they should
          not be the more backward to supply the wants of the needy for that,
          but should be willing to give him. “Thou shalt be willing to lend,
          expecting nothing again.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Men are exceedingly apt to make objections against such duties, which
          God speaks of here as a manifestation of the wickedness of their
          hearts: “Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart,” etc.
          The warning is very strict. God doth not only say, Beware that thou do
          not actually refuse to give him, but, Beware that thou have not one
          objecting thought against it, arising from a backwardness to
          liberality. God warns against the beginnings of uncharitableness in
          the heart, and against whatever tends to a forbearance to give. “And
          thou give him nought, and he cry unto the Lord against thee, and it be
          sin unto thee.” God warns them, from the guilt which they would be
          liable to bring upon themselves hereby.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may observe here several enforcements of this duty. There is a
          reason of this duty implied in God’s calling him that is needy, our
          brother: “Thou shalt not shut thine hand from thy poor brother.” And
          Deu. 15:9, “Beware that thine eye be not evil against thy poor
          brother.” And verse 11, “Thou shalt open thine hand wide to thy
          brother.” We are to look upon ourselves as related to all mankind, but
          especially to those who are of the visible people of God. We are to
          look upon them as brethren, and to treat them accordingly. We shall be
          base indeed, if we be not willing to help a brother in want. — Another
          enforcement of this duty is the promise of God, that for this thing he
          will bless us in all our works, and in all that we put our hands unto;
          a promise that we shall not lose, but gain by it (Deu. 15:10). —
          Another is, that we shall never want proper objects of our charity and
          bounty. Verse 11, “For the poor shall never cease out of thy land.”
          This God saith to the Jewish church; and the like Christ saith to the
          Christian church, Mat. 26:11, “The poor ye have always with you.” This
          is to cut off an excuse that uncharitable persons would be ready to
          make for not giving, that they could find nobody to give to, that they
          saw none who needed. God cuts off such an excuse, by telling us, that
          he would so order it in his providence, that his people everywhere,
          and in all ages, shall have occasion for the exercise of that virtue.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this account the doctrine is obvious, that it is the absolute and
          indispensable duty of the people of God, to give bountifully and
          willingly for supplying the wants of the needy. — But more
          particularly,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. It is the duty of the people of God to give bountifully for the
          aforesaid purpose. It is commanded once and again in the text, “Thou
          shalt open thine hand wide unto thy poor brother.” Merely to give
          something is not sufficient. It answers not the rule, nor comes up to
          the holy command of God. But we must open our hand wide. What we give,
          considering our neighbor’s wants, and our ability, should be such as
          may be called a liberal gift. What is meant in the text by opening the
          hand wide, with respect to those that are able, is explained in Deu.
          15:8, “Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend
          him sufficient for his want, in that which he needeth.” By lending
          here, as is evident by the two following verses, and as we have just
          now shown, is not only meant lending to receive again; [for] the word
          lend in Scripture is sometimes used for giving; as in Luke 6:35, “Do
          good and lend, hoping for nothing again.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We are commanded, therefore, to give our poor neighbor what is
          sufficient for his need. There ought to be none suffered to live in
          pinching want, among a visible people of God, who are able, unless in
          case of idleness, or prodigality, or some such case which the Word of
          God excepts. — It is said that the children of Israel should lend to
          the poor, and in the year of release should release what they had
          lent, save when there should be no poor among them. It is rendered in
          the margin, to the end there be no poor among you; i.e. you should so
          supply the wants of the needy, that there may be none among you in
          pinching want. This translation seems the more likely to be the true
          one, because God says, Deu. 15:11, that there shall be no such time
          when there shall be no poor, who shall be proper objects of charity. —
          When persons give very sparingly, it is no manifestation of charity,
          but of a contrary spirit. 2 Cor. 9:5, “Therefore I thought it
          necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you,
          and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that
          the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of
          covetousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. It is the duty of the visible people of God to give for the supply
          of the needy, freely, and without grudging. It doth not at all answer
          the rule in the sight of God, if it be done with an inward grudging,
          or if the heart be grieved, and it inwardly hurt the man to give what
          he gives. “Thou shalt surely give,” says God, “and thine heart shall
          not be grieved.” God looks at the heart, and the hand is not accepted
          without it. 2 Cor. 9:7, “Every man according as he hath purposed in
          his heart, so let him give, not grudgingly, or of necessity; for God
          loveth a cheerful giver.”
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This is a duty to which God’s people are under very strict
          obligation. It is not merely a commendable thing for a man to be kind
          and bountiful to the poor, but our bounden duty, as much a duty as it
          is to pray, or to attend public worship, or anything else whatever.
          And the neglect of it brings great guilt upon any person.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>
          Of the obligation of Christians to perform the duty of charity to the
          poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS duty is absolutely commanded, and much insisted on, in the Word
          of God. Where have we any command in the Bible laid down in stronger
          terms, and in a more peremptory urgent manner, than the command of
          giving to the poor? We have the same law in a positive manner laid
          down in Lev. 25:35, etc. “And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen
          in decay with thee, then thou shalt relieve him; yea, though he be a
          stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with thee.” And at the
          conclusion of verse 38, God enforces it with saying, I am the Lord thy
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is mentioned in Scripture, not only as a duty, but a great duty.
          Indeed it is generally acknowledged to be a duty, to be kind to the
          needy. But by many it seems not to be looked upon as a duty of great
          importance. However, it is mentioned in Scripture as one of the
          greater and more essential duties of religion. Mic. 6:8, “He hath
          showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord thy God
          require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly
          with thy God?” Here to love mercy is mentioned as one of the three
          great things that are the sum of all religion. So it is mentioned by
          the apostle James, as one of the two things wherein pure and undefiled
          religion consists. Jam. 1:27, “Pure religion, and undefiled, before
          God and the Father, is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in
          their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So Christ tells us, it is one of the weightier matters of the law.
          Mat. 23:23, “Ye have omitted the weightier matters of the law,
          judgment, mercy, and faith.” The Scriptures again and again teach us
          that it is a more weighty and essential thing than the attendance on
          the outward ordinances of worship. Hos. 6:6, “I desired mercy, and not
          sacrifice;” Mat. 9:13 and 12:7. I know of scarce any duty which is so
          much insisted on, so pressed and urged upon us, both in the Old
          Testament and New, as this duty of charity to the poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason of the thing strongly obliges to it. It is not only very
          positively and frequently insisted on by God, but it most reasonable
          in itself. And so, on this account, there is reason why God should
          much insist upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. It is most reasonable, considering the general state and nature of
          mankind. This is such as renders it most reasonable that we should
          love our neighbor as ourselves; for men are made in the image of our
          God, and on this account are worthy of our love. Besides, we are all
          nearly allied one to another by nature. We have all the same nature,
          like faculties, like dispositions, like desires of good, like needs,
          like aversion to misery, and are made of one blood. And we are made to
          subsist by society and union one with another. Mankind in this respect
          are as the members of the natural body, one cannot subsist alone,
          without an union with and the help of the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this state of mankind shows how reasonable and suitable it is,
          that men should love their neighbors, and that we should not look
          everyone at his own things, but every man also at the things of
          others, Phil. 2:4. A selfish spirit is very unsuitable to the nature
          and state of mankind. He who is all for himself, and none for his
          neighbors, deserves to be cut off from the benefit of human society,
          and to be turned out among wild beasts, to subsist by himself as well
          as he can. A private niggardly spirit is more suitable for wolves, and
          other beasts of prey, than for human beings.
        </p>
        <p>
          To love our neighbor as ourselves is the sum of the moral law
          respecting our fellow creatures. And to help them, and to contribute
          to their relief is the most natural expression of this love. It is
          vain to pretend to a spirit of love to our neighbors, when it is
          grievous to us to part with anything for their help, when under
          calamity. They who love only in word, and in tongue, and not in deed,
          have no love in truth. Any profession without it is a vain pretense.
          To refuse to give to the needy, is unreasonable, because we therein do
          to others contrary to what we would have others to do to us in like
          circumstances. We are very sensible of our own calamities. And when we
          suffer, [we] are ready enough to think, that our state requires the
          compassion and help of others; and are ready enough to think it hard,
          if others will not deny themselves in order to help us when in
          straits.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. It is especially reasonable, considering our circumstances, under
          such a dispensation of grace as that of the gospel. Consider how much
          God hath done for us, how greatly he hath loved us, what he hath given
          us, when we were so unworthy, and when he could have no addition to
          his happiness by us. Consider that silver, and gold, and earthly
          crowns, were in his esteem but mean things to give us, and he hath
          therefore given us his own Son. Christ loved and pitied us, when we
          were poor, and he laid out himself to help, and even did shed his own
          blood for us without grudging. He did not think much to deny himself,
          and to be at great cost for us vile wretches, in order to make us
          rich, and to clothe us with kingly robes, when we were naked; to feast
          us at his own table with dainties infinitely costly, when we were
          starving; to advance us from the dunghill, and set us among princes,
          and make us to inherit the throne of his glory, and so to give us the
          enjoyment of the greatest wealth and plenty to all eternity. Agreeably
          to 2 Cor. 8:9, “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
          though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through
          his poverty might be rich.” Considering all these things, what a poor
          business will it be, that those who hope to share these benefits, yet
          cannot give something for the relief of a poor neighbor without
          grudging! That it should grieve them to part with a small matter, to
          help a fellow servant in calamity, when Christ did not grudge to shed
          his own blood for them!
        </p>
        <p>
          How unsuitable is it for us, who live only by kindness, to be unkind!
          What would have become of us, if Christ had been so saving of his
          blood, and loth to bestow it, as many men are of their money or goods?
          Or if he had been as ready to excuse himself from dying for us, as men
          commonly are to excuse themselves from charity to their neighbor? If
          Christ would have made objections of such things, as men commonly
          object to performing deeds of charity to their neighbor, he would have
          found enough of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, Christ, by his redemption, has brought us into a more near
          relations one to another, hath made us children of God, children in
          the same family. We are all brethren, having God for our common
          Father; which is much more than to be brethren in any other family. He
          hath made us all one body. Therefore we ought to be united, and
          subserve one another’s good, and bear one another’s burdens, as is the
          case with the members of the same natural body. If one of the members
          suffer, all the other members bear the burden with it, 1 Cor. 12:26.
          If one member be diseased or wounded, the other members of the body
          will minister to it, and help it. So surely it should be in the body
          of Christ. Gal. 6:2, “Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfill
          the law of Christ.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Apply these things to yourselves. And inquire whether you do not lie
          under guilt on account of the neglect of this duty, in withholding
          that charity which God requires of you towards the needy? You have
          often been put upon examining yourselves, whether you do not live in
          some way displeasing to God. Perhaps at such times it never came into
          your minds, whether you do not lie under guilt on this account. — But
          this neglect certainly brings guilt upon the soul in the sight of God,
          as is evident by the text. “Beware that thine eye be not evil against
          thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought, and he cry unto the Lord
          against thee, and it be sin unto thee,” Deu. 15:9. This is often
          mentioned as one of the sins of Judah and Jerusalem, for which God was
          about to bring such terrible judgments upon them. And it was one of
          the sins of Sodom, for which that city was destroyed, that she did not
          give to supply the poor and needy, Eze. 16:49, “This was the iniquity
          of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of
          idleness in her, and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the
          hand of the poor and needy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And have we not reason to fear, that much guilt lies upon this land on
          this very account? We have a high conceit of ourselves for religion.
          But do not many other countries shame us? Do not the papists shame us
          in this respect? So far as I can understand the tenor of the Christian
          religion, and the rules of the Word of God, the same are in no measure
          in this respect answered by the general practice of most people in
          this land. There are many who make a high profession of religion. But
          do not many of them need to be informed by the apostle James, what
          true religion is?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let everyone examine himself, whether he [does] not lie under guilt in
          this matter. Have you not forborne to give when you have seen your
          brother in want? Have you not forborne to deny yourselves a little for
          his relief? Or when you have given, have you not done it grudgingly?
          And has it not inwardly hurt and grieved you? You have looked upon
          what you have given, as lost. So that what you have given, has been,
          as the apostle expresses it, a matter of covetousness, rather than of
          bounty. Have not occasions of giving been unwelcome to you? Have you
          not been uneasy under them? Have you not felt a considerable
          backwardness to give? Have you not, from a grudging, backward spirit,
          been apt to raise objections against giving, and to excuse yourselves?
          Such things as these bring guilt upon the soul, and often bring down
          the curse of God upon the persons in whom these things are found, as
          we may show more fully hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>An exhortation to the duty of charity to the poor</p>
        <p>
          WE are professors of Christianity, we pretend to be the followers of
          Jesus, and to make the gospel our rule. We have the Bible in our
          houses. Let us not behave ourselves in this particular, as if we had
          never see the Bible, as if we were ignorant of Christianity, and knew
          not what kind of religion it is. What will it signify to pretend to be
          Christians, and at the same time to live in the neglect of those rules
          of Christianity which are mainly insisted on in it? But there are
          several things which I would here propose to your consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Consider that what you have is not your own; i.e. you have only a
          subordinate right. Your goods are only lent to you of God, to be
          improved by you in such ways as he directs. You yourselves are not
          your own. 1 Cor. 6:20, “Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a
          price; your body and your spirit are God’s.” And if you yourselves are
          not your own, so then neither are your possessions your own. Many of
          you have by covenant given up yourselves and all you have to God. You
          have disowned and renounced any right in yourselves or in anything
          that you have, and have given to God all the absolute right. And if
          you be true Christians, you have done it from the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your money and your goods are not your own. They are only committed to
          you as stewards, to be used for him who committed them to you. 1 Pet.
          4:9, 10, “Use hospitality one to another, as good stewards of the
          manifold grace of God.” A steward has no business with his master’s
          goods, to use them any otherwise than for the benefit of his master
          and his family, or according to his master’s direction. He hath no
          business to use them, as if he were the proprietor of them. He hath
          nothing to do with them, only as he is to use them for his master. He
          is to give everyone of his master’s family their portion of meat in
          due season.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if instead of that, he hoards up his master’s goods for himself,
          and withholds them from those of the household, so that some of the
          family are pinched for want of food and clothing. He is therein guilty
          of robbing his master and embezzling his substance. And would any
          householder endure such a steward? If he discovered him in such a
          practice, would he not take his goods out of his hands, and commit
          them to the care of some other steward, who should give everyone of
          his family his portion of meat in due season? Remember that all of us
          must give account of our stewardship, and how we have disposed of
          those goods which our Master has put into our hands. And if when our
          Master comes to reckon with us, it be found that we have denied some
          of his family their proper provision, while we have hoarded up for
          ourselves, as if we had been the proprietors of our Master’s goods,
          what account shall we give of this?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. God tells us, that he shall look upon what is done in charity to
          our neighbors in want, as done unto him; and what is denied unto them,
          as denied unto him. Pro. 19:17, “He that hath pity on the poor lendeth
          to the Lord.” God hath been pleased to make our needy neighbors his
          receivers. He in his infinite mercy hath so interested himself in
          their case, that he looks upon what is given in charity to them, as
          given to himself. And when we deny them what their circumstances
          require of us, he looks upon it that we therein rob him of his right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ teaches us, that we are to look upon our fellow Christians in
          this case as himself, and that our giving or withholding from them,
          shall be taken, as if we so behaved ourselves towards him; see Mat.
          25:40. There Christ says to the righteous on his right hand, who had
          supplied the wants of the needy, “In that ye have done it to one of
          the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” In like
          manner he says to the wicked who had not shown mercy to the poor,
          verse 45, “Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of the least of these,
          ye did it not to me.” — Now what stronger enforcement of this duty can
          be conceived, or is possible, than this, that Jesus Christ looks upon
          our kind and bountiful, or unkind and uncharitable, treatment of our
          needy neighbors, as such a treatment of himself?
        </p>
        <p>
          If Christ himself were upon earth, a dwelt among us in a frail body,
          as he once did, and were in calamitous and needy circumstances, should
          we not be willing to supply him? Should we be apt to excuse ourselves
          from helping him? Should we not be willing to supply him so, that he
          might live free from distressing poverty? And if we did otherwise,
          should we not bring great guilt upon ourselves? And might not our
          conduct justly be very highly resented by God? Christ was once here in
          a frail body, stood in need of the charity, and was maintained by it.
          Luke 8:2, 3, “And certain women which had been healed of evil spirits
          and infirmities, Mary called Magdalen, out of whom went seven devils,
          and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many
          others, which ministered unto him of their substance.” So he still, in
          many of his members, needs the charity of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Consider that there is an absolute necessity of our complying
          with the difficult duties of religion. To give to the poor in the
          manner and measure that the gospel prescribes is a difficult duty,
          i.e. it is very contrary to corrupt nature, to that covetousness and
          selfishness of which there is so much in the wicked heart of man. Man
          is naturally governed only by a principle of self-love. And it is a
          difficult thing to corrupt nature, for men to deny themselves of their
          present interest, trusting in God to make it up to them hereafter. —
          But how often hath Christ told us the necessity of doing difficult
          duties of religion, if we will be his disciples; that we must sell
          all, take up our cross daily, deny ourselves, renounce our worldly
          profits and interests, etc. And if this duty seem hard and difficult
          to you, let not that be an objection with you against doing it. For
          you have taken up quite a wrong notion of things if you expect to go
          to heaven without performing difficult duties; if you expect any other
          than to find the way to life a narrow way.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The Scripture teaches us that this very particular duty is
          necessary, Particularly,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the Scripture teaches that God will deal with us as we deal
          with our fellow creatures in this particular, and that with what
          measure we mete to others in this respect, God will measure to us
          again. This the Scripture asserts both ways. It asserts that if we be
          of a merciful spirit, God will be merciful to us. Mat. 5:7, “Blessed
          are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.” Psa. 18:25, “With the
          merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful.” On the other hand it tells
          us, that if we be not merciful, God will not be merciful to us; and
          that all our pretenses to faith and a work of conversion will not
          avail us, to obtain mercy, unless we be merciful to them that are in
          want. Jam. 2:13-16, “For he shall have judgment without mercy, that
          hath showed no mercy. — What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man
          say he hath faith, and have not works? Can faith save him? If a
          brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food; and one of
          you say unto them, Depart in peace, be you warmed, and filled;
          notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the
          body; what doth it profit?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, this very thing is often mentioned in Scripture as an
          essential part of the character of a godly man. Psa. 37:21, “The
          righteous showeth mercy, and giveth.” And again, verse 26, “He is ever
          merciful, and lendeth.” Psa. 112:5, “A good man showeth favour, and
          lendeth.” And verse 9, “He hath dispersed, and given to the poor.” So
          Pro. 14:31, “He that honoureth God, hath mercy on the poor.” Again,
          Pro. 21:26 and Isa. 57:1. A righteous man and a merciful man are used
          as synonymous terms: “The righteous perisheth, and merciful men are
          taken away,” etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is mentioned in the New Testament as a thing so essential, that the
          contrary cannot consist with a sincere love to God. 1 John 3:17-19,
          “But whoso hath this world’s goods, and seeth his brother have need,
          and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the
          love of God in him? My little children, let us not love in word,
          neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. And hereby we know that
          we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.” So the
          apostle Paul, when he writes to the Corinthians, and proposes their
          contributing for the supply of the poor saints, tells them what he
          doth it for, viz. A trial of their sincerity. See 2 Cor. 8:8, “I speak
          to prove the sincerity of your love.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, Christ teaches that judgment will be past at the great day
          according to men’s works in this respect. This is taught us by Christ
          in the most particular account of the proceedings of that day, that we
          have in the whole Bible. See Mat. 25:34, etc. It is evident that
          Christ thus represented the proceedings and determinations of this
          great day, as turning upon this one point, on purpose, and on design
          to lead us into this notion, and to fix it in us, that a charitable
          spirit and practice towards our brethren is necessary to salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Consider what abundant encouragement the Word of God gives, that
          you shall be no losers by your charity and bounty to them who are in
          want. As there is scarce any duty prescribed in the Word of God, which
          is so much insisted on as this; so there is scarce any to which there
          are so many promises of reward made. This virtue especially hath the
          promises of this life and that which is to come. If we believe the
          Scriptures, when a man charitably gives to his neighbor in want, the
          giver has the greatest advantage by it, even greater than the
          receiver. Acts 20:35, “I have showed you all things, how that so
          labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of
          the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to
          receive.” He that gives bountifully is a happier man than he that
          receives bountifully. Pro. 14:21, “He that hath mercy on the poor,
          happy is he.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Many persons are ready to look upon what is bestowed for charitable
          uses as lost. But we ought not to look upon it as lost, because it
          benefits those whom we ought to love as ourselves. And not only so,
          but it is not lost to us, if we give any credit to the Scriptures. See
          the advice that Solomon gives in Ecc. 11:1, “Cast thy bread upon the
          waters, for thou shalt find it after many days.” By casting our bread
          upon the waters, Solomon means giving it to the poor, as appears by
          the next words, “Give a portion to seven, and also to eight.” Waters
          are sometimes put for people and multitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
          What strange advice would this seem to many, to cast their bread upon
          the waters, which would seem to them like throwing it away! What more
          direct method to lose our bread, than to go and throw it into the sea?
          But the wise man tells us, No, it is not lost; you shall find it again
          after many days. It is not sunk, but you commit it to Providence. You
          commit it to the winds and waves. However it will come about to you,
          and you shall find it again after many days. Though it should be many
          days first, yet you shall find it at last, at a time when you most
          need it. He that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord. And God is
          not one of those who will not pay again what is lent to him. If you
          lend anything to God, you commit it into faithful hands. Pro. 19:17,
          “He that hath pity on the poor lendeth to the Lord, and that which he
          hath given will he pay him again.” God will not only pay you again,
          but he will pay you with great increase. Luke 6:38, “Give, and it
          shall be given you,” that is, in “good measure, pressed down, and
          shaken together, and running over.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Men do not account that lost, that is let out to use. but what is
          bestowed in charity is lent to the Lord, and he repays with great
          increase. Isa. 32:8, “The liberal deviseth liberal things, and by
          liberal things shall he stand.” Here I would particularly observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that if you give with a spirit of true charity, you shall be
          rewarded in what is infinitely more valuable than what you give, even
          eternal riches in heaven. Mat. 10:42, “Whosoever shall give to drink
          unto one of these little ones, a cup of cold water only, in the name
          of a disciple; verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his
          reward.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Giving to our needy brethren is in Scripture called laying up treasure
          in heaven, in bags that wax not old. Luke 12:33, “Sell what ye have
          and give alms, provide for yourselves bags that wax not old, a
          treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth,
          nor moth corrupteth.” Men, when they have laid up their money in their
          chests, do not suppose that they have thrown it away. But, on the
          contrary, that it is laid up safe. Much less is treasure thrown away,
          when it is laid up in heaven. What is laid up there is much safer than
          what is laid up in chests or cabinets.
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot lay up treasure on earth, but that it is liable to be
          stolen, or otherwise to fail. But there no thief approaches nor moth
          corrupts. It is committed to God’s care, and he will keep it safely
          for you. And when you die, you shall receive it with infinite
          increase. Instead of a part of your earthly substance thus bestowed,
          you shall receive heavenly riches, on which you may live in the
          greatest fullness, honor, and happiness, to all eternity; and shall
          never be in want of anything. After feeding with some of your bread
          those who cannot recompense you, you shall be rewarded at the
          resurrection, and eat bread in the kingdom of God. Luke 14:13-16,
          “When thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, and
          the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee:
          for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. And
          when one of them that sat at meat with him, heard these things, he
          said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of
          God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, if you give to the needy though but in the exercise of moral
          virtue, you will be in the way greatly to gain by it in your temporal
          interest. They who give in the exercise of a gracious charity, are in
          the way to be gainers both here and hereafter; and those that give in
          the exercise of a moral bounty and liberality, have many temporal
          promises made to them. We learn by the Word of God, that they are in
          the way to be prospered in their outward affairs. Ordinarily such do
          not lose by it, but such a blessing attends their concerns, that they
          are paid doubly for it. Pro. 11:24, 25, “There is that scattereth, and
          yet increaseth; there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it
          tendeth to poverty. The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that
          watereth, shall be watered also himself.” And Pro. 28:27, “He that
          giveth to the poor, shall not lack.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When men give to the needy, they do as it were sow seed for a crop.
          When men sow their seed, they seem to throw it away. Yet they do not
          look upon it as thrown away because, though they expect not the same
          again, yet they expect much more as the fruit of it. And if it be not
          certain that they shall have a crop, yet they are willing to run the
          venture of it; for that is the ordinary way wherein men obtain
          increase. So it is when persons give to the poor. Though the promises
          of gaining thereby, in our outward circumstances, perhaps are not
          absolute; yet it is as much the ordinary consequence of it, as
          increase is of sowing seed. Giving to the poor is in this respect
          compared to sowing seed, in Ecc. 11:6, “In the morning sow thy seed,
          and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not
          whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall
          be alike good.” By withholding the hand, the wise man means not giving
          to the poor (see verse 1, 2). It intimates, that giving to the poor is
          as likely a way to obtain prosperity and increase, as sowing seed in a
          field.
        </p>
        <p>
          The husbandman doth not look upon his seed as lost, but is glad that
          he has opportunity to sow it. It grieves him not that he has land to
          be sown, but he rejoices in it. For the like reason we should not be
          grieved that we find needy people to bestow our charity upon. For this
          is as much an opportunity to obtain increase as the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some may think this is strange doctrine; and it is to be feared, that
          not many will so far believe it as to give to the poor with as much
          cheerfulness as they sow their ground. However, it is the very
          doctrine of the Word of God, 2 Cor. 9:6, 7, 8, “But this I say, He
          which soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly: and he which soweth
          bountifully, shall reap also bountifully. Every man according as he
          purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of
          necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. And God is able to make
          all grace abound towards you; that ye always having all sufficiency in
          all things, may abound to every good work.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It is easy with God to make up to men what they give in charity. Many
          but little consider how their prosperity or ill success in their
          outward affairs depends upon Providence. There are a thousand turns of
          Providence, to which their affairs are liable, whereby God may either
          add to their outward substance, or diminish from it, a great deal more
          than they are ordinarily called to give to their neighbors. How easy
          is it with God to diminish what they possess by sickness in their
          families, by drought, or frost, or mildew, or vermin; by unfortunate
          accidents, by entanglements in their affairs, or disappointments in
          their business! And how easy is it with God to increase their
          substance, by suitable seasons, or by health and strength; by giving
          them fair opportunities for promoting their interest in their dealings
          with men; by conducting them in his providence, so that they attain
          their designs; and by innumerable other ways which might be mentioned!
          How often is it, that only one act of providence in a man’s affairs
          either adds to his estate, or diminishes from it, more than he would
          need to give to the poor in a whole year.
        </p>
        <p>
          God hath told us that this is the way to have his blessing attending
          our affairs. Thus, in the text, Deu. 15:10, “Thou shalt surely give
          him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him;
          because that for this thing the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all
          thy works, and all that thou puttest thine hand unto.” And Pro. 22:9,
          “He that hath a bountiful eye, shall be blessed.” It is a remarkable
          evidence how little many men realize the things of religion, whatever
          they pretend; how little they realize that the Scripture is the Word
          of God, or if it be, that he speaks true; that notwithstanding all the
          promises made in the Scripture to bounty to the poor, yet they are so
          backward to this duty, and are so afraid to trust God with a little of
          their estates. Observation may confirm the same thing which the Word
          of God teaches on this head. God, in his providence, generally smiles
          upon and prospers those men who are of a liberal, charitable,
          bountiful spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth, God hath threatened to follow with his curse those who are
          uncharitable to the poor; as Pro. 28:27, “He that giveth to the poor
          shall not lack; but he that hideth his eyes, shall have many a curse.”
          It is said, he that hideth his eyes, because this is the way of
          uncharitable men. They hide their eyes from seeing the wants of their
          neighbor. A charitable person, whose heart disposes him to bounty and
          liberality, will be quick-sighted to discern the needs of others. They
          will not be at any difficulty to find out who is in want. They will
          see objects enough of their charity, let them go whither they will.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, on the contrary, he that is of a niggardly spirit, so that it
          goes against the grain to give anything, he will be always at a loss
          for objects of his charity. Such men excuse themselves with this, that
          they find not anyone to give to. They hide their eyes, and will not
          see their neighbor’s wants. If a particular object is presented, they
          will not very readily see his circumstances. They are a long while in
          being convinced that he is an object of charity. They hide their eyes.
          And it is not an easy thing to make them sensible of the necessities
          and distresses of their neighbor, or at least to convince them, that
          his necessities are such that they ought to give him any great matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other men, who are of a bountiful spirit, can very easily see the
          objects of charity. But the uncharitable are very unapt both to see
          the proper objects of charity, and to see their obligations to this
          duty. The reason is, that they are of that sort spoken of here by the
          wise man, they hide their eyes. Men will readily see, where they are
          willing to see. But where they hate to see, they will hide their eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          God says, such as hides his eyes in this case shall have many a curse.
          Such an one is in the way to be cursed in soul and body, in both his
          spiritual and temporal affairs. We have shown already, how those that
          are charitable to the poor are in the way of being blessed. There are
          so many promises of the divine blessing, that we may look upon it as
          much the way to be blessed in our outward concerns, as sowing seed in
          a field is the way to have increase. And to be close and uncharitable,
          is as much the way to be followed with a curse, as to be charitable is
          the way to be followed with a blessing. To withhold more than is meet,
          tends as much to poverty, as scattering tends to increase, Pro. 11:24.
          Therefore, if you withhold more than is meet, you will cross your own
          disposition, and will frustrate your own end. What you seek by
          withholding from your neighbor, is your own temporal interest and
          outward estate. But if you believe the Scriptures to be the Word of
          God, you must believe that you cannot take a more direct course to
          lose, to be crossed and cursed in your temporal interest, than this of
          withholding from your indigent neighbor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventh, consider that you know not what calamitous and necessitous
          circumstances you yourselves or your children may be in. Perhaps you
          are ready to bless yourselves in your hearts, as though there were no
          danger of you being brought into calamitous and distressing
          circumstances. There is at present no prospect of it; and you hope you
          shall be able to provide well for your children. But you little
          consider what a shifting, changing, uncertain world you live in, and
          how often it hath so happened, that men have been reduced from the
          greatest prosperity to the greatest adversity, and how often the
          children of the rich have been reduced to pinching want.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agreeable to this is the advice that the wise man gives us, Ecc. 11:1,
          2, “Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many
          days. Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not
          what evil shall be upon earth.” Thou knowest not what calamitous
          circumstances thou mayest be in thyself, in this changeable uncertain
          world. You know not what circumstances you or your children may be
          brought into by captivity, or other unthought-of providences.
          Providence governs all things. Perhaps you may trust to your own
          wisdom to continue your prosperity. But you cannot alter what God
          determines and orders in providence, as in the words immediately
          following the fore-mentioned text in Ecclesiastes, “If the clouds be
          full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if the tree
          fall toward the south, or toward the north; in the place where the
          tree falleth, there it shall be;” i.e. you cannot alter the
          determinations of Providence. You may trust to your own wisdom for
          future prosperity. But if God have ordained adversity, it shall come.
          As the clouds when full of rain, empty themselves upon the earth, so
          what is in the womb of Providence shall surely come to pass. And as
          Providence casts the tree, whether towards the south, or towards the
          north, whether for prosperity or adversity, there it shall be, for all
          that you can do to alter it. Agreeably to what the wise man observes
          in Ecc. 7:13, “Consider the work of God; for who can make that
          straight which he hath made crooked?”
        </p>
        <p>
          This consideration, that you know not what calamity and necessity you
          may be in yourselves or your children, tends very powerfully to
          enforce this duty several ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This may put you upon considering how your hearts would be
          effected, if it should so be. If it should happen that you or some of
          your children should be brought into such circumstances as those of
          your neighbors, how grievous would it be to you! Now perhaps you say
          of this and the other poor neighbor, that they can do well enough. If
          they be pinched a little, they can live. Thus you can make light of
          their difficulties. But if Providence should so order it, that you or
          your children should be brought into the same circumstances, would you
          make light of them then? Would you not use another sort of language
          about it? Would you not think that your case was such as needed the
          kindness of your neighbors? Would you not think that they ought to be
          ready to help you? And would you not take it hardly, if you saw a
          contrary spirit in them, and saw that they made light of your
          difficulties?
        </p>
        <p>
          If one of your children should be brought to poverty by captivity, *1*
          or otherwise, how would your hearts be affected in such a case? If you
          should hear that some persons had taken pity on your child, and had
          been very bountiful to it, would you not think that they did well?
          Would you be at all apt to accuse them of folly or profuseness, that
          they should give so much to it?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If ever there should be such a time, your kindness to others now
          will be but a laying up against such a time. If you yourselves should
          be brought into calamity and necessity, then would you find what you
          have given in charity to others, lying ready in store for you. Cast
          thy bread upon the waters, and thou shalt find it after many days,
          says the wise man. But when shall we find it? He tells us in the next
          verse; “Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest
          now what evil shall be upon the earth.” Then is the time when you
          shall find it, when the day of evil cometh. You shall again find your
          bread which you have cast upon the waters, when you shall want it
          most, and stand in greatest necessity of it. God will keep it for you
          against such a time. When other bread shall fail, then God will bring
          to you the bread which you formerly cast upon the waters, so that you
          shall not famish. He that giveth to the poor shall not lack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Giving to the needy is like laying up against winter, or against a
          time of calamity. It is the best way of laying up for yourselves and
          for your children. Children in a time of need very often find their
          fathers’ bread, that bread which their fathers had cast upon the
          waters. Psa. 37:25, “I have been young and now am old, yet have I not
          seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.” Why? What is
          the reason of it? It follows in the next verse, “He is ever merciful
          and lendeth, and his seed is blessed.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether the time will ever come or not, that we or our children shall
          be in distressing want of bread; yet doubtless evil will be on the
          earth. We shall have our times of calamity, wherein we shall stand in
          great need of God’s pity and help, if not of that of our fellow
          creatures. And God hath promised that at such a time, he that hath
          been of a charitable spirit and practice, shall find help. Psa.
          41:1-4, “Blessed is he that considereth the poor; the Lord will
          deliver him in time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him, and keep
          him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the earth; and thou wilt not
          deliver him unto the will of his enemies. The Lord will strengthen him
          upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his
          sickness.” Such as have been merciful and liberal to others in their
          distress, God will not forget it, but will so order it, that they
          shall have help when they are in distress. Yea, their children shall
          reap the fruit of it in the day of trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. God hath threatened uncharitable persons, that if ever they come to
          be in calamity and distress they shall be left helpless. Pro. 21:13,
          “Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he shall cry himself
          and not be heard.”
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IV</p>
        <p>
          Objections which are sometimes made to the exercise of charity,
          answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          I PROCEED now to answer some OBJECTIONS which are sometimes made
          against this duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECT. I. I am in a natural condition, and if I should give to the
          poor, I should not do it with a right spirit, and so should get
          nothing by it. — To this I answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we have shown already that a temporal blessing is promised to a
          moral bounty and liberality. This is the way to be prospered. This is
          the way to increase. We find in Scripture many promises of temporal
          blessings to moral virtues; as to diligence in our business, to
          justice in our dealings, to faithfulness, to temperance. So there are
          many blessings promised to bounty and liberality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, you may as well make the same objection against any other duty
          of religion. You may as well object against keeping the Sabbath,
          against prayer, or public worship, or against doing anything at all in
          religion. For while in a natural condition, you do not any of these
          duties with a right spirit. If you say, you do these duties because
          God hath commanded or required them of you, and you shall sin greatly
          if you neglect them, you shall increase your guilt, and so expose
          yourselves to the greater damnation and punishment. The same may be
          said of the neglect of this duty; the neglect of it is as provoking to
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you say that you read, and pray, and attend public worship, because
          that is the appointed way for you to seek salvation, so is bounty to
          the poor, as much as those. — The appointed way for us to seek the
          favor of God and eternal life, is the way of the performance of all
          known duties, of which giving to the poor is one as much known, and as
          necessary, as reading the Scriptures, praying, or any other. Showing
          mercy to the poor does as much belong to the appointed way of seeking
          salvation, as any other duty whatever. Therefore this is the way in
          which Daniel directed Nebuchadnezzar to seek mercy, in Dan. 4:27,
          “Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and break
          off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy
          to the poor.”
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECT. II. If I be liberal and bountiful, I shall only make a
          righteousness of it, and so it will do me more hurt than good. To this
          I say,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the same answer may be made to this, as to the former
          objection, viz. that you may as well make the same objection against
          doing any religious or moral duty at all. If this be a sufficient
          objection against deeds of charity, then it is a sufficient objection
          to prayer. For nothing is more common than for persons to make a
          righteousness of their prayers. So it is a good objection against your
          keeping the Sabbath, or attending any public worship, or ever reading
          in the Bible. For of all these things you are in danger of making a
          righteousness. — Yea, of the objection be good against deeds of
          charity, then it is as good against acts of justice. And you may
          neglect to speak the truth, may neglect to pay your debts, may neglect
          acts of common humanity; for of all those things you are in danger of
          making a righteousness. So that if your objection be good, you may
          throw up all religion, and live like heathens or atheists, and may be
          thieves, robbers, fornicators, adulterers, murderers, and commit all
          the sins that you can think of, lest if you should do otherwise, you
          should make a righteousness of your conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, your objection carries it thus, that it is not best for you to
          do as God commands and counsels you to do. We find many commands in
          Scripture to be charitable to the poor. The Bible is full of them; and
          you are not excepted from those commands. God makes no exception of
          any particular kinds of persons that are especially in danger of
          making a righteousness of what they do. And God often directs and
          counsels persons to this duty. Now will you presume to say that God
          has not directed you to the best way? He has advised you to do thus,
          but you think it not best for you, but that it would do you more hurt
          than good, if you should do it. You think there is other counsel
          better than God’s, and that it is the best way for you to go contrary
          to God’s commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECT. III. I have in times past given to the poor, but never found
          myself the better for it. I have heard ministers preach, that giving
          to the poor was the way to prosper. But I perceive not that I am more
          prosperous than I was before. — Yea, I have met with many misfortunes,
          crosses, and disappointments in my affairs since. And it may be that
          some will say, That very year, or soon after the very time, I had been
          giving to the poor, hoping to be blessed for it, I met with great
          losses, and things went hardly with me; and therefore I do not find
          what I hear preached about giving to the poor, as being the way to be
          blessed and prosperous, agreeable to my experience.
        </p>
        <p>To this objection I shall answer several things:</p>
        <p>
          First, perhaps you looked out for the fulfillment of the promise too
          soon, before you had fulfilled the condition. As particularly, perhaps
          you have been so sparing and grudging in your kindness to the poor,
          that what you have done has been rather a discovery of a covetous,
          niggardly spirit, than of any bounty or liberality. The promises are
          not made to every many who gives anything at all to the poor, let it
          be ever so little, and after what manner soever given. You mistook the
          promises, if you understood them so. A man may give something to the
          poor, and yet be entitled to no promise, either temporal or spiritual.
          The promises are made to mercy and liberality. But a man may give
          something, and yet be so niggardly and grudging in it, that what he
          gives may be, as the apostle calls it, a matter of covetousness. What
          he does may be more a manifestation of his covetousness and closeness,
          than anything else. But there are no promises made to men’s expressing
          their covetousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps what you gave was not freely given, but as it were of
          necessity. It was grudgingly; your hearts were grieved when you gave.
          And if you gave once or twice what was considerable, yet that doth not
          answer the rule. It may be, for all that, that in the general course
          of your lives you have been far from being kind and liberal to your
          neighbors. Perhaps you thought that because you once or twice gave a
          few shillings to the poor, that then you stood entitled to the
          promises of being blessed in all your concerns, and of increasing and
          being established by liberal things, though in the general you have
          lived in a faulty neglect of the duty of charity. You raise objections
          from experience, before you have made trial. To give once, or twice,
          or thrice, is not to make trial, though you give considerably. You
          cannot make any trial unless you become a liberal person, or unless
          you become such that you may be truly said to be of a liberal and
          bountiful practice. Let one who is truly such, and has been such in
          the general course of his life, tell what he hath found by experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, if you have been liberal to the poor, and have met with
          calamities since, yet how can you tell how much greater calamities and
          losses you might have met with, if you had been otherwise? You say you
          have met with crosses, and disappointments, and frowns. If you
          expected to meet with no trouble in the world, because you gave to the
          poor, you mistook the matter. Though there be many and great promises
          made to the liberal, yet God hath no where promised, that they shall
          not find this world a world of trouble. It will be so to all. Man is
          born to sorrow, and must expect no other than to meet with sorrow
          here. But how can you tell how much greater sorrow you would have met
          with, if you had been close and unmerciful to the poor? How can you
          tell how much greater losses you would have met with? How much more
          vexation and trouble would have followed you? Have none ever met with
          greater frowns in their outward affairs, than you have?
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, how can you tell what blessings God hath yet in reserve for you
          if you do but continue in well-doing? Although God hath promised great
          blessings to liberality to the poor, yet he hath not limited himself
          as to the time of the bestowment. If you have not yet seen any evident
          fruit of your kindness to the poor, yet the time may come when you
          shall see it remarkably, and that at a time when you most stand in
          need of it. You cast your bread upon the waters, and looked for it,
          and expected to find it again presently. And sometimes it is so. But
          this is not promised. It is promised, “Thou shalt find it again after
          many days.” God knows how to choose a time for you, better than you
          yourselves. You should therefore wait his time. If you go on in
          well-doing, God may bring it to you when you stand most in need.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be that there is some winter a-coming, some day of trouble. And
          God keeps your bread for you against that time. And then God will give
          you good measure, and pressed down, and shaken together, and running
          over. We must trust in God’s Word for the bestowment of the promised
          reward, whether we can see in what manner it is done or no. Pertinent
          to the present purpose are those words of the wise man in Ecc. 11:4,
          “He that observeth the winds shall not sow; and he that regardeth the
          clouds shall not reap.” In this context the wise man in speaking of
          charity to the poor, and comparing it to sowing seed; and advises us
          to trust Providence for success in that, as we do in sowing seed. He
          that regardeth the winds and clouds, to prognosticate thence
          prosperity to seed, and will not trust Providence with it, is not like
          to sow, nor to have bread-corn. So he that will not trust Providence
          for the reward of his charity to the poor is [likely] to go without
          the blessing. After the words now quoted, follows his advice, Ecc.
          11:6, “In the morning sow thy seed, and the evening withhold not thine
          hand; for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that,
          or whether they both shall be alike good.” — Therefore (Gal. 6:9) “Let
          us not be weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we
          faint not.” You think you have not reaped yet. Whether you have or
          not, go on still in giving and doing good; and if you do so, you shall
          reap in due time. God only knows the due time, the best time, for you
          to reap.
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECT. IV. Some may object against charity to such or such particular
          persons, that they are not obliged to give them anything, for though
          they be needy, yet they are not in extremity. It is true they meet
          with difficulty, yet not so but that they can live, though they suffer
          some hardships. — But,
        </p>
        <p>
          It doth not answer the rules of Christian charity, to relieve those
          only who are reduced to extremity, as might be abundantly shown. I
          shall at this time mention but two things as evidences of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we are commanded to love and treat one another as brethren. 1
          Pet. 3:8, “Have compassion one of another; love as brethren; be
          pitiful.” Now is it the part of brethren to refuse to help one
          another, and to do anything for each other’s comfort, and for the
          relief of each other’s difficulties, only when they are in extremity?
          Doth it not become brothers and sisters to have a more friendly
          disposition one towards another, than this comes to? And to be ready
          to compassionate one another under difficulties, though they be not
          extreme?
        </p>
        <p>
          The rule of the gospel is that when we see our brother under any
          difficulty or burden, we should be ready to bear the burden with him.
          Gal. 6:2, “Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of
          Christ.” So we are commanded, “by love to serve one another,” Gal.
          5:13. The Christian spirit will make us apt to sympathize with our
          neighbor, when we see him under any difficulty. Rom. 12:15, “Rejoice
          with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.” When our
          neighbor is in difficulty, he is afflicted; and we ought to have such
          a spirit of love to him, as to be afflicted with him in his
          affliction. And if we ought to be afflicted with him, then it will
          follow that we ought to be ready to relieve him. Because if we are
          afflicted with him, in relieving him, we relieve ourselves. His relief
          is so far our own relief, as his affliction is our affliction.
          Christianity teaches us to be afflicted in our neighbor’s affliction.
          And nature teaches us to relieve ourselves when afflicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should behave ourselves one towards another as brethren that are
          fellow travelers. For we are pilgrims and strangers here on earth, and
          are on a journey. Now, if brethren be on a journey together, and one
          meet with difficulty in the way, doth it not become the rest to help
          him, not only in the extremity of broken bones, or the like, but as to
          provision for the journey if his own fall short? It becomes his fellow
          travelers to afford him a supply out of their stores, and not to be
          over nice, exact, and fearful lest they give him too much: for it is
          but provision for a journey. And all are supplied when they get to
          their journey’s end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, that we should relieve our neighbor only when in extremity, is
          not agreeable to the rule of loving our neighbor as ourselves. That
          rule implies that our love towards our neighbor should work in the
          same manner, and express itself in the same ways, as our love towards
          ourselves. We are very sensible of our own difficulties. We should
          also be readily sensible of theirs. From love to ourselves, when we
          are under difficulties, and suffer hardships, we are concerned for our
          relief, are wont to seek relief, and lay ourselves out for it. — And
          as we would love our neighbor as ourselves, we ought in like manner to
          be concerned when our neighbor is under difficulty, and to seek his
          relief. We are wont to be much concerned about our own difficulties,
          though we be not reduced to extremity, and are willing in those cases
          to lay ourselves out for our own relief. So, as we would love our
          neighbor as ourselves, we should in like manner lay out ourselves to
          obtain relief for him, though his difficulties be not extreme.
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECT. V. Some may object against charity to a particular object
          because he is an ill sort of person. He deserves not that people
          should be kind to him. He is of a very ill temper, of an ungrateful
          spirit, and particularly, because he hath not deserved well of them,
          but has treated them ill, has been injurious to them, and even now
          entertains an ill spirit against them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we are obliged to relieve persons in want, notwithstanding these
          things, both by the general and particular rules of God’s Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we are obliged to do so by the general rules of Scripture. I
          shall mention two.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That of loving our neighbor as ourselves. A man may be our
          neighbor, though he be an ill sort of man, and even our enemy, as
          Christ himself teaches us by his discourse with the lawyer, Luke
          10:25, etc. A certain lawyer came to Christ, and asked him, what he
          should do to inherit eternal life? Christ asked him, how it was
          written in the law? He answers, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
          all thy heart, and all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with
          all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.” Christ tells him, that if
          he shall do thus, he shall live. But then the lawyer asks him, who is
          his neighbor? Because it was received doctrine among the Pharisees,
          that no man was their neighbor, but their friends, and those of the
          same people and religion. — Christ answers him by a parable, or story
          of a certain man, who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell
          among thieves, who stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and
          departed from him, leaving him half dead. Soon after there came a
          priest that way, who saw the poor man that had been thus cruelly
          treated by the thieves; but passed by without affording him any
          relief. The same as done by a Levite. — But a certain Samaritan coming
          that way, as soon as he saw the half-dead man, had compassion on him,
          took him up, bound up his wounds, set him on his own beast, carried
          him to the inn, and took care of him, paying the innkeeper money for
          his past and future expense. And promising him still more, if he
          should find it necessary to be at more expense on behalf of the man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Christ asks the lawyer, which of these three, the priest, the
          Levite, or the Samaritan was neighbor to the man that fell among the
          thieves. Christ proposed this in such a manner, that the lawyer could
          not help owning, that the Samaritan did well in relieving the Jew,
          that he did the duty of a neighbor to him. Now, there was an
          inveterate enmity between the Jews and the Samaritans. They hated one
          another more than any other nation in the world. And the Samaritans
          were a people exceedingly troublesome to the Jews. Yet we see that
          Christ teaches that the Jews ought to do the part of neighbors to the
          Samaritans; i.e. to love them as themselves. For it was that of which
          Christ was speaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the consequence was plain. If the Samaritan was neighbor to the
          distressed Jew, then the Jews, by a parity of reason, were neighbors
          to the Samaritans. If the Samaritan did well, in relieving a Jew that
          was his enemy, then the Jews would do well in relieving the
          Samaritans, their enemies. — What I particularly observe is that
          Christ here plainly teaches that our enemies, those that abuse and
          injure us, are our neighbors, and therefore come under the rule of
          loving our neighbor as ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Another general rule that obliges us to the same thing is that
          wherein we are commanded to love one another, as Christ hath loved us.
          We have it John 13:34, “A new commandment I give unto you, that ye
          love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.”
          Christ calls it a new commandment, with respect to that old
          commandment of loving our neighbor as ourselves. This command of
          loving our neighbor as Christ hath loved us opens our duty to us in a
          new manner, and in a further degree than that did. We must not only
          love our neighbor as ourselves, but as Christ hath loved us. We have
          the same again, John 15:12, “This is my commandment, that ye love one
          another, as I have loved you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the meaning of this is not that we should love one another to the
          same degree that Christ loved us, though there ought to be a
          proportion, considering our nature and capacity, but that we should
          exercise our love one to another in like manner. As for instance,
          Christ hath loved us so as to be willing to deny himself, and to
          suffer greatly, in order to help us, so should we be willing to deny
          ourselves in order to help one another. Christ loved us and showed us
          great kindness though we were far below him so should we show kindness
          to those of our fellow men who are far below us. Christ denied himself
          to help us, though we are not able to recompense him, so should we be
          willing to lay out ourselves to help our neighbor, freely expecting
          nothing again. Christ loved us, was kind to us, and was willing to
          relieve us, though we were very evil and hateful, of an evil
          disposition, not deserving any good, but deserving only to be hated,
          and treated with indignation; so we should be willing to be kind to
          those who are of an ill disposition, and are very undeserving. Christ
          loved us, and laid himself out to relieve us, though we were his
          enemies, and had treated him ill. So we, as we would love one another
          as Christ hath loved us, should relieve those who are our enemies,
          hate us, have an ill spirit toward us, and have treated us ill.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, we are obliged to this duty by many particular rules. We are
          particularly required to be kind to the unthankful and to the evil.
          And therein to follow the example of our heavenly Father, who causes
          his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the
          just and on the unjust. We are obliged, not only to be kind to them
          that are so to us, but to them that hate, and that despitefully use
          us. I need not mention the particular places which speak to the
          effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not but that when persons are virtuous and pious, and of a grateful
          disposition, and are friendly disposed towards us, they are more the
          objects of our charity for it, and our obligation to kindness to them
          is the greater. Yet if things be otherwise, that doth not render them
          not fit objects of our charity, nor set us free from obligation to
          kindness towards them.
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECT. VI. Some may object from their own circumstances that they
          have nothing to spare; they have not more than enough for themselves.
          — I answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it must doubtless be allowed that in some cases persons, by
          reason of their own circumstances, are not obliged to give to others.
          — For instance, if there be a contribution for the poor, they are not
          obliged to join in the contribution, who are in as much need as those
          are for whom the contribution is made. It savors of ridiculous vanity
          in them to contribute with others for such as are not more needy than
          they. It savors of a proud desire to conceal their own circumstances
          and an affectation of having them accounted about what they in truth
          are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, there are scarcely any who may not make this objection, as
          they interpret it. There is no person who may not say, he has not more
          than enough for himself, as he may mean by enough. He may intend, that
          he has not more than he desires, or more than he can dispose of to his
          own advantage; or not so much, but that, if he had anything less, he
          should look upon himself in worse circumstances than he is in now. He
          will own, that he could live if he had less. But then he will say he
          could not live so well. Rich men may say they have not more than
          enough for themselves, as they may mean by it. They need it all, they
          may say, to support their honor and dignity, as is proper for the
          place and degree in which they stand. Those who are poor, to be sure,
          will say, they have not too much for themselves. Those who are of the
          middle sort will say, they have not too much for themselves. And the
          rich will say, they have not too much for themselves. Thus there will
          be none found to give to the poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third. in many cases, we may, by the rules of the gospel, be obliged
          to give to others, when we cannot do it without suffering ourselves.
          As if our neighbor’s difficulties and necessities be much greater than
          our own, and we see that he is not like to be otherwise relieved, we
          should be willing to suffer with him, and to take part of his burden
          on ourselves. Else how is that rule of bearing one another’s burdens
          fulfilled? If we be never obliged to relieve others’ burdens, but when
          we can do it without burdening ourselves, then how do we bear our
          neighbor’s burdens, when we bear no burden at all? Though we may not
          have a superfluity, yet we may be obliged to afford relief to others
          who are in much greater necessity. As appears by that rule, Luke 3:11,
          “He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he
          that hath meat, let him do likewise.” — Yea, they who are very poor
          may be obliged to give for the relief of others in much greater
          distress than they. If there be no other way of relief, those who have
          the lightest burden are obliged still to take some part of their
          neighbor’s burden, to make it the more supportable. A brother may be
          obliged to help a brother in extremity, though they are both very much
          in want. The apostle commends the Macedonian Christians, that they
          were liberal to their brethren, though they themselves were in deep
          poverty. 2 Cor. 8:1, 2, “Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the
          grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia: how in a great
          trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy, and their deep
          poverty, abounded unto the riches of their liberality.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, those who have not too much for themselves are willing to
          spare seed to sow, that they may have fruit hereafter. Perhaps they
          need that which they scatter in the field, and seem to throw away.
          They may need it for bread for their families. Yet they will spare
          seed to sow, that they may provide for the future, and may have
          increase. But we have already shown that giving to the poor is in
          Scripture compared to sowing seed, and is as much the way to increase
          as the sowing of seed is. It doth not tend to poverty, but the
          contrary. It is not the way to diminish our substance, but to increase
          it. All the difficulty in this matter is in trusting God with what we
          give, in trusting his promises. If men could but trust the
          faithfulness of God to his own promises, they would give freely.
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECT. VII. Some may object concerning a particular person that they
          do not certainly know whether he be an object of charity or not. They
          are not perfectly acquainted with his circumstances. Neither do they
          know what sort of man he is. They know not whether he be in want as he
          pretends. Or if they know this, they know not how he came to be in
          want, whether it were not by his own idleness, or prodigality. Thus
          they argue that they cannot be obliged, till they certainly know these
          things. — I reply,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, this is Nabal’s objection, for which he is greatly condemned in
          Scripture; see 1 Sam. 25. David in his exiled state came and begged
          relief of Nabal. Nabal objected, 1 Sam. 25:10, 11, “Who is David? And
          who is the son of Jesse? There be many servants now-a-days that break
          away every man from his master. Shall I then take my bread and my
          water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it
          unto men, whom I know not whence they be?” His objection was, that
          David was a stranger to him. He did not know who he was, nor what his
          circumstances were. He did not know but that he was a runaway. And he
          was not obliged to support and harbor a runaway. He objected, that he
          knew not that he was a proper object of charity; that he knew not but
          that he was very much the contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Abigail no way countenanced his behavior herein, but greatly
          condemned it. She calls him a man of Belial, and says that he was as
          his name was. Nabal was his name, and folly was with him. And her
          behavior was very contrary to his. And she is greatly commended for
          it. The Holy Ghost tells us in that chapter, 1 Sam. 25:3, that “she
          was a woman of a good understanding.” At the same time God exceedingly
          frowned on Nabal’s behavior on this occasion, as we are informed that
          about ten days after God smote Nabal that he died, verse 38.
        </p>
        <p>
          This story is doubtless told us partly for this end, to discountenance
          too great a scrupulosity as to the object on whom we bestow our
          charity, and the making of this merely an objection against charity to
          others, that we do not certainly know their circumstances. It is true,
          when we have opportunity to be certainly acquainted with their
          circumstances, it is well to embrace it. And to be influenced in a
          measure by probability in such cases, is not to be condemned. Yet it
          is better to give to several that are not objects of charity, than to
          send away empty one that is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, we are commanded to be kind to strangers whom we know not, nor
          their circumstances. This is commanded in many places. But I shall
          mention only one. Heb. 13:2, “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers;
          for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.” By strangers here
          the apostle means one whom we know not, and whose circumstances we
          know not; as is evident by these words, “for thereby some have
          entertained angels unawares.” Those who entertained angels unawares,
          did not know the persons whom they entertained, nor their
          circumstances. Else how could it be unawares?
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECT. VIII. Some may say they are not obliged to give to the poor
          till they ask. If any man is in necessity, let him come and make known
          his straits to me, and then it will be time enough for me to give him.
          Or if he need a public contribution, let him come and ask. I do not
          know that the congregation or church is obliged to relieve till they
          ask relief. — I answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it surely is the most charitable to relieve the needy in that
          way wherein we shall do them the greatest kindness. Now it is certain
          that we shall do them a greater kindness by inquiring into their
          circumstances, and relieving them, without putting them upon begging.
          There is none of us but who, if it were their case, would look upon it
          more kind in our neighbors, to inquire into our circumstances, and
          help us of their own accord. To put our neighbors upon begging in
          order to relief, is painful. It is more charitable, more brotherly,
          more becoming Christians and the disciples of Jesus, to do it without.
          I think this is self-evident, and needs no proof.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, this is not agreeable to the character of the liberal man
          given in Scripture; viz. that devises liberal things. Isa. 32:8. It is
          not to devise liberal things, if we neglect all liberality till the
          poor come a begging to us. But to inquire who stand in need of our
          charity, and to contrive to relieve them in the way that shall do them
          the greatest kindness; that is to devise liberal things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, we should not commend a man for doing so to his own brother. If
          a man had an own brother or sister in great straits, and he were well
          able to supply them, under the pretense that if he or she want
          anything, let them come and ask and I will give them, we should hardly
          think such an one behaved like a brother. Christians are commanded to
          love as brethren, to look upon one another as brethren in Christ, and
          to treat one another as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, we should commend others for taking a method contrary to that
          which is proposed by the objector. If we should hear or read of a
          people who were so charitable, who took such care of the poor, and
          were so concerned that none among them should suffer, who were proper
          objects of charity; that they were wont diligently to inquire into the
          circumstances of their neighbors, to find out who were needy, and
          liberally supplied them of their own accord; I say, if we should hear
          or read of such a people, would it not appear well to us? Should not
          we have the better thought of that people, on that account?
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECT. IX. He has brought himself to want by his own fault. — In
          reply, it must be considered what you mean by his fault.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, if you mean a want of a natural faculty to manage affairs to
          advantage, that is to be considered as his calamity. Such a faculty is
          a gift that God bestows on some, and not on others. And it is not
          owing to themselves. You ought to be thankful that God hath given you
          such a gift, which he hath denied to the person in question. And it
          will be a very suitable way for you to show your thankfulness, to help
          those to whom that gift is denied, and let them share the benefit of
          it with you. This is as reasonable as that he to whom Providence has
          imparted sight should be willing to help him to whom sight is denied,
          and that he should have the benefit of the sight of others, who has
          none of his own. Or, as that he to whom God hath given wisdom, should
          be willing that the ignorant should have the benefit of his knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, if they have been reduced to want by some oversight and are to
          be blamed that they did not consider for themselves better, yet that
          doth not free us from all obligation to charity towards them. If we
          should forever refuse to help men because of that, it would be for us
          to make their inconsiderateness and imprudent act, an unpardonable
          crime, quite contrary to the rules of the gospel, which insist so much
          upon forgiveness. — We should not be disposed so highly to resent such
          an oversight in any for whom we have a dear affection, as our
          children, or our friends. We should not refuse to help them in that
          necessity and distress, which they brought upon themselves by their
          own inconsiderateness. But we ought to have a dear affection and
          concern for the welfare of all our fellow Christians, whom we should,
          love as brethren, and as Christ hath loved us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, if they are come to want by a vicious idleness and prodigality,
          yet we are not thereby excused from all obligation to relieve them,
          unless they continue in those vices. If they continue not in those
          vices, the rules of the gospel direct us to forgive them. And if their
          fault be forgiven, then it will not remain to be a bar in the way of
          our charitably relieving them. If we do otherwise, we shall act in a
          manner very contrary to the rule of loving one another as Christ hath
          loved us. Now Christ hath loved us, pitied us, and greatly laid out
          himself to relieve us from that want and misery which we brought on
          ourselves by our own folly and wickedness. We foolishly and perversely
          threw away those riches with which we were provided, upon which we
          might have lived and been happy to all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, if they continue in the same courses still, yet that doth not
          excuse us from charity to their families that are innocent. If we
          cannot relieve those of their families without their having something
          of it, yet that ought not to be a bar in the way of our charity. And
          that because it is supposed that those of their families are proper
          objects of charity. And those that are so, we are bound to relieve.
          The command is positive and absolute. If we look upon that which the
          heads of the families have of what we give, to be entirely lost; yet
          we had better lose something of our estate, than suffer those who are
          really proper objects of charity to remain without relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECT. X. Some may object and say, Others do not their duty. If
          others did their duty, the poor would be sufficiently supplied. If
          others did as much as we in proportion to their ability and
          obligation, the poor would have enough to help them out of their
          straits. Or some may say, it belongs to others more than it does to
          us. They have relations that ought to help them. Or there are others
          to whom it more properly belongs than to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          ANS. We ought to relieve those who are in want though brought to it
          through others’ fault. If our neighbor be poor, though others be to
          blame that it is so, yet that excuses us not from helping him. If it
          belong to others more than to us, yet if those others will neglect
          their duty, and our neighbor therefore remains in want, we may be
          obliged to relieve him. If a man be brought into straits through the
          injustice of others, suppose by thieves or robbers, as the poor Jew
          whom the Samaritan relieved; yet we may be obliged to relieve him,
          though it be not through our fault that he is in want, but through
          that of other men. And whether that fault be a commission or a neglect
          alters not the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to the poor Jew that fell among thieves between Jerusalem and
          Jericho, it more properly belonged to those thieves who brought him
          into that distress to relieve him, than to any other person. Yet
          seeing they would not do it, others were not excused. And the
          Samaritan did no more than his duty, relieving him as he did, though
          it properly belonged to others. — Thus if a man have children or other
          relations, to whom it most properly belongs to relieve him, yet if
          they will not do it, the obligation to relieve him falls upon others.
          So for the same reason we should do the more for the relief of the
          poor, because others neglect to do their proportion, or what belongs
          to them. And that because by the neglect of others to do their
          proportion they need the more, their necessity is the greater.
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECT. XI. The law makes provision for the poor, and obliges the
          respective towns in which they live to provide for them. Therefore
          some argue that there is no occasion for particular persons to
          exercise any charity this way. They say, the case is not the same with
          us now as it was in the primitive church. For then Christians were
          under a heathen government. And however the charity of Christians in
          those times be much to be commended, yet now, by reason of our
          different circumstances, there is no occasion for private charity.
          Because, in the state in which Christians now are, provision is made
          for the poor otherwise. — This objection is built upon these two
          suppositions, both which I suppose are false.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that the towns are obliged by law to relieve everyone who
          otherwise would be an object of charity. This I suppose to be false,
          unless it be supposed that none are proper objects of charity, but
          those that have no estate left to live upon, which is very
          unreasonable, and what I have already shown to be false, in answer to
          the fourth objection, in showing that it doth not answer the rules of
          Christian charity, to relieve only those who are reduced to extremity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor do I suppose it was ever the design of the law, requiring the
          various towns to support their own poor, to cut off all occasion for
          Christian charity. Nor is it fit there should be such a law. It is fit
          that the law should make provision for those that have no estates of
          their own. It is not fit that persons who are reduced to that
          extremity should be left to so precarious a source of supply as a
          voluntary charity. They are in extreme necessity of relief, and
          therefore it is fit that there should be something sure for them to
          depend on. But a voluntary charity in this corrupt world is an
          uncertain thing. Therefore the wisdom of the legislature did not think
          fit to leave those who are so reduced upon such a precarious
          foundation for subsistence. But I suppose not that it was ever the
          design of the law to make such provision for all that are in want, as
          to leave no room for Christian charity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, this objection is built upon another supposition which is
          equally false, viz. that there are in fact none who are proper objects
          of charity, but those that are relieved by the town. Let the design of
          the law be what it will, yet if there are in fact persons who are so
          in want, as to stand in need of our charity, then that law doth not
          free us from obligation to relieve them by our charity. For as we have
          just now shown, in answer to the last objection, if it more properly
          belong to others to relieve them than us; yet if they do it not, we
          are not free. So that if it be true, that it belongs to the town to
          relieve all who are proper objects of charity; yet if the town in fact
          do it not, we are not excused.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one of our neighbors suffers through the fault of a particular
          person, of a thief or robber, or of a town, it alters not the case.
          But if he suffer and be without relief, it is an act of Christian
          charity in us to relieve him. Now it is too obvious to be denied, that
          there are in fact persons so in want that it would be a charitable act
          in us to help them, notwithstanding all that is done by the town. A
          man must hide his mental eyes, to think otherwise.
