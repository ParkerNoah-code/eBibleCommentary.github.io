        <h2>Temptation and Deliverance – Genesis 39:12</h2>
        <p class="title">Dated 1738.</p>
        <p>
          Genesis 39:12, “And he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got
          him out.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We have here, and in the context, an account of that remarkable
          behavior of Joseph in the house of Potiphar, which was the occasion
          both of his great affliction, and also of his high advancement and
          prosperity in the land of Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          We read in the beginning of the chapter, how Joseph, after he had been
          so cruelly treated by his brethren, and sold into Egypt for a slave,
          was advanced in the house of Potiphar, who had bought him. Joseph was
          one that feared God, and therefore God was with him; and so influenced
          the heart of Potiphar his master, that instead of keeping him as a
          mere slave, to which purpose he was sold, he made him his steward and
          overseer over his house, and all that he had was put into his hands;
          in so much, that we are told, verse 6, “That he left all that he had
          in his hand; and he knew not ought that he had, save the bread which
          he did eat.” — While Joseph was in these prosperous circumstances, he
          met with a great temptation in his master’s house. We are told that,
          he being a goodly person and well favored, his mistress cast her eyes
          upon and lusted after him, and used all her art to tempt him to commit
          uncleanness with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this temptation, and his behavior under it, many things are
          worthy to be noted. Particularly,
        </p>
        <p>
          We may observe how great the temptation was, that he was under. It is
          to be considered, that Joseph was now in his youth; a season of life,
          when persons are most liable to be overcome by temptations of this
          nature. And he was in a state of unexpected prosperity in Potiphar’s
          house; which has a tendency to lift persons up, especially young ones,
          whereby commonly they more easily fall before temptations.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, the superiority of the person that laid the temptation
          before him, rendered it much the greater. She was his mistress, and he
          a servant under her. And the manner of her tempting him. She did not
          only carry herself so towards Joseph, as to give him cause to suspect
          that he might be admitted to such criminal converse with her; but she
          directly proposed it to him; plainly manifesting her disposition to
          it. So that here was no such thing as suspicion of her unwillingness
          to deter him, but a manifestation of her desire to entice him to it.
          Yea, she appeared greatly engaged in the matter. And there was not
          only her desire manifested to entice him, but her authority over him
          to enforce the temptation. She was his mistress, and he might well
          imagine, that if he utterly refused a compliance, he should incur her
          displeasure. And she, being his master’s wife, had power to do much to
          his disadvantage, and to render his circumstances more uncomfortable
          in the family.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the temptation was the greater, in that she did not only tempt him
          once, but frequently, day by day, verse 10. And at last became more
          violent with him. She caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          His behavior was very remarkable under these temptations. He
          absolutely refused any compliance with them. He made no reply that
          manifested as though the temptation had gained at all upon him; so
          much as to hesitate about it, or at all deliberate upon it. He
          complied in no degree, either to the gross act she proposed, or
          anything tending towards it, or that should at all be gratifying to
          her wicked inclination. And he persisted resolute and unshaken under
          her continual solicitations, verse 10, “And it came to pass as she
          spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by
          her, or to be with her.” He, to his utmost, avoided so much as being
          where she was. And the motives and principles, from which he acted,
          manifested by his reply to her solicitations, are remarkable. — He
          first sets before her, how injuriously he should act against his
          master, if he should comply with her proposal. “Behold, my master —
          hath committed all that he hath to my hand; there is none greater in
          this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me, but
          thee, because thou art his wife.” But he then proceeded to inform her
          of that, which, above all things, deterred him from a compliance, viz.
          that it would be great wickedness, and sin against God. — ”How shall I
          do this, and sin against God?” He would not do any such thing, as he
          would not injure his master; but that which influenced more than all
          on this occasion, was the fear of sinning against God. On this account
          he persisted in his resolution to the last.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the text we have an account of his behavior under the last and
          greatest temptation that he had from her. This temptation was great,
          as it was at a time when there was nobody in the house but he and his
          mistress, verse 11. There was an opportunity to commit the fact with
          the greatest secrecy. And at this time it seems that she was more
          violent than ever before. She caught him by the garment, etc. She laid
          hold on him, as though she were resolute to attain her purpose of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under these circumstances he not only refused her, but fled from her,
          as he would have done from one that was going to assassinate him. He
          escaped, as for his life. He not only would not be guilty of such a
          fact, but neither would he by any means be in the house with her,
          where he should be in the way of her temptation. — This behavior of
          Joseph is doubtless recorded for the instruction of all. Therefore
          from the words I shall observe, that it is our duty, not only to avoid
          those things that are themselves sinful, but also, as far as may be,
          those things that lead and expose to sin.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>Why we should avoid what tends to sin.</p>
        <p>
          Thus did Joseph: he not only refused actually to commit uncleanness
          with his mistress, who enticed him; but refused to be there, where he
          should be in the way of temptation, verse 10. He refused to lie by
          her, or be with her. And in the text we are told, “he fled and got him
          out;” would by no means be in her company. Though it was no sin in
          itself, for Joseph to be in the house where his mistress was; but
          under these circumstances it would expose him to sin. Joseph was
          sensible [that] he had naturally a corrupt heart, that tended to
          betray him to sin. And therefore he would by no means be in the way of
          temptation, but with haste he fled, he ran from the dangerous place.
          Inasmuch as he was exposed to sin in that house, he fled out of it
          with as much haste as if it had been on fire; or full of enemies, who
          stood ready with drawn swords to stab him to the very heart. When she
          took him by the garment, he left his garment in her hands. He had
          rather lose his garment, than stay a moment there, where he was in
          such danger of losing his chastity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I said, that persons should avoid things that expose to sin, as far as
          may be; because it is possible that persons may be called to expose
          themselves to temptation; and when it is so, they may hope for divine
          strength and protection under temptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be a man’s indispensable duty to undertake an office, or a
          work, attended with a great deal of temptation. Thus ordinarily a man
          ought not to run into the temptation of being persecuted for the true
          religion; lest the temptation should be too hard for him; but should
          avoid it, as much as may be. Therefore Christ thus directs his
          disciples, Mat. 10:23, “When ye be persecuted in one city, flee to
          another.” Yet, the case may be so, that a man may be called not to
          flee from persecution; but to run the venture of such a trial,
          trusting in God to uphold him under it. Ministers and magistrates may
          be obliged to continue with their people in such circumstances; as
          Nehemiah says, Neh. 6:11, “Should such a man as I flee?” So the
          apostles. — Yea, they may be called to go into the midst of it; to
          those places where they cannot reasonably expect but to meet with such
          temptations. So Paul went up to Jerusalem, where he knew beforehand,
          that there bonds and affliction awaited him, Acts 20:23.
        </p>
        <p>
          So in some other cases, the necessity of affairs may call upon men to
          engage in some business that is peculiarly attended with temptations.
          But when it is so, the are indeed least exposed to sin; for they are
          always safest in the way of duty. Pro. 10:9, “He that walketh
          uprightly, walketh surely.” And though there be many things by which
          they may have extraordinary temptations, in the affairs they have
          undertaken, yet if they have a clear call, it is no presumption to
          hope for divine support and preservation in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for persons needlessly to expose themselves to temptation, and to
          do those things that tend to sin, is unwarrantable, and contrary to
          that excellent example set before us. And that we ought to avoid not
          only those things that are in themselves sinful, but also those things
          that lead and expose to sin, is manifest by the following arguments:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it is very evident that we ought to use our utmost endeavors to
          avoid sin; which is inconsistent with needlessly doing those things,
          that expose and lead to sin. And the greater any evil is, the greater
          care, and the more earnest endeavors, does it require to avoid it.
          Those evils that appear to us very great and dreadful, we use
          proportionably great care to avoid. And therefore the greatest evil of
          all, requires the greatest and utmost care to avoid it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sin is an infinite evil, because committed against an infinitely great
          and excellent Being, and so a violation of infinite obligation.
          Therefore however great our care be to avoid sin, it cannot be more
          than proportionable to the evil we would avoid. Our care and endeavor
          cannot be infinite, as the evil of sin is infinite. We ought to use
          every method that tends to the avoiding of sin. This is manifest to
          reason. — And not only so, but this is positively required of us in
          the Word of God. Jos. 22:5, “Take diligent heed to do the commandment
          and the law, which Moses the servant of the Lord charged you, to love
          the Lord your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his
          commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your
          soul.” Deu. 4:15, 16, “Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves,
          lest ye corrupt yourselves.” Chap. 12:30, “Take heed to thyself, that
          thou be not snared,” etc. Luke 12:15, “Take heed and beware of
          covetousness.” 1 Cor. 10:12, “Let him that thinketh he standeth take
          heed lest he fall.” Deu. 4:9. “Take heed to thyself, keep thy soul
          diligently.” These and many other texts of Scripture, plainly require
          of us the utmost possible diligence and caution to avoid sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how can he be said to use the utmost possible diligence and
          caution to avoid sin, that voluntarily does those things which
          naturally expose and lead to sin? How can he be said with the utmost
          possible caution to avoid an enemy, that voluntarily lays himself in
          his way? How can he be said to use the utmost possible caution to
          preserve the life of his child, that suffers it to go on the edge of
          precipices or pits; or to play on the borders of a deep gulf; or to
          wander in a wood, that is haunted by beasts of prey?
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, it is evident that we ought to avoid those things that expose
          and lead to sin; because a due sense of the evil of sin, and a just
          hatred of it, will necessarily have this effect upon us, to cause us
          so to do. — If we were duly sensible of the evil and dreadful nature
          of sin, we should have an exceeding dread of it upon our spirits. We
          should hate it worse than death, and should fear it worse than the
          devil himself; and dread it even as we dread damnation. But those
          things that men exceedingly dread, they naturally shun; and they avoid
          those things that they apprehend expose to them. As a child, that has
          been greatly terrified by the sight of any wild beast, will by no
          means be persuaded to go where it apprehends that it shall fall in its
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          As sin in its own nature is infinitely hateful, so in its natural
          tendency it is infinitely dreadful. It is the tendency of all sin,
          eternally to undo the soul. Every sin naturally carries hell in it!
          Therefore, all sin ought to be treated by us as we would treat a thing
          that is infinitely terrible. If any one sin, yea, the least sin,
          [does] not necessarily bring eternal ruin with it, this is owing to
          nothing but the free grace and mercy of God to us, and not to the
          nature and tendency of sin itself. But certainly, we ought not to take
          the less care to avoid sin, or all that tends to it, for the freeness
          and greatness of God’s mercy to us, through which there is hope of
          pardon; for that would be indeed a most ungrateful and vile abuse of
          mercy. Were it made known to us, that if we ever voluntarily committed
          any particular act of sin, we should be damned without any remedy or
          escape, should we not exceedingly dread the commission of such? Should
          we not be very watchful and careful to stand at the greatest distance
          from that sin; and from everything that might expose us to it; and
          that has any tendency to stir up our lusts, or to betray us to such an
          act of sin? Let us then consider, that though the next voluntary act
          of known sin shall not necessarily and unavoidably issue in certain
          damnation, yet it will certainly deserve it. We shall thereby really
          deserve to be cast off, without any remedy or hope. And it can only be
          owing to free grace, that it will not certainly and remedilessly be
          followed with such a punishment. And shall we be guilty of such a vile
          abuse of God’s mercy to us, as to take encouragement from it, the more
          boldly to expose ourselves to sin?
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, it is evident that we ought not only to avoid sin, but things
          that expose and lead to sin; because this is the way we act in things
          that pertain to our temporal interest. — Men avoid not only those
          things that are themselves the hurt or ruin of their temporal
          interest, but also the things that tend or expose to it. Because they
          love their temporal lives, they will not only actually avoid killing
          themselves, but they are very careful to avoid those things that bring
          their lives into danger; though they do not certainly know but they
          may escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are careful not to pass rivers and deep waters on rotten ice,
          though they do not certainly know that they shall fall through and be
          drowned. They will not only avoid those things that would be in
          themselves the ruin of their estates — as setting their own houses on
          fire, and burning them up with their substance; taking their money and
          throwing it into the sea, etc. — but they carefully avoid those things
          by which their estates are exposed. They have their eyes about them;
          are careful with whom they deal; are watchful, that they be not
          overreached in their bargains, and that they do not lay themselves
          open to knaves and fraudulent persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a man be sick of a dangerous distemper, he is careful to avoid
          everything that tends to increase the disorder; not only what he knows
          to be mortal, but other things that he fears may be prejudicial to
          him. Men are in this way wont to take care of their temporal interest.
          And therefore, if we are not as careful to avoid sin, as we are to
          avoid injury in our temporal interest, it will show a regardless
          disposition with respect to sin and duty; or that we do not much care
          though we do sin against God. God’s glory is surely of as much
          importance and concern as our temporal interest. Certainly we should
          be as careful not to be exposed to sin against the Majesty of heaven
          and earth, as men are wont to be of a few pounds; yea, the latter are
          but mere trifles, compared with the former.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, we are wont to do thus by our dear earthly friends. — We not
          only are careful of those things wherein the destruction of their
          lives, or their hurt and calamity in any respect, directly consist;
          but are careful to avoid those things that but remotely tend to it. We
          are careful to prevent all occasions of their loss; and are watchful
          against that which tends, in any wise, to deprive them of their
          comfort or good name. And the reason is, because they are very dear to
          us. In this manner, men are wont to be careful of the good of their
          own children, and dread the approaches of any mischief that they
          apprehend they are, or may be, exposed to. And we should take it hard
          if our friends did not do thus by us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And surely we ought to treat God as a dear friend. We ought to act
          towards him, as those that have a sincere love and unfeigned regard to
          him; and so ought to watch and be careful against all occasions of
          that which is contrary to his honor and glory. If we have not a temper
          and desire so to do, it will show that, whatever our pretenses are, we
          are not God’s sincere friends, and have no true love to him. — If we
          should be offended at any that have professed friendship to us, if
          they have treated us in this manner, and were no more careful of our
          interest; surely God may justly be offended, that we are no more
          careful of his glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, we would have God, in his providence towards us, not to order
          those things that tend to our hurt, or expose our interest; therefore
          certainly we ought to avoid those things that lead to sin against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          We desire and love to have God’s providence such towards us, as that
          our welfare may be well secured. No man loves to live exposed,
          uncertain and in dangerous circumstances. While he is so, he lives
          uncomfortably, in that he lives in continual fear. We desire that God
          would so order things concerning us, that we may be safe from fear of
          evil; and that no evil may come nigh our dwelling; and that because we
          dread calamity. So we do not love the appearance and approaches of it;
          and love to have it at a great distance from us. We desire to have God
          to be to us as a wall of fire round about us, to defend us; and that
          he would surround us as the mountains do the valleys, to guard us from
          every danger, or enemy; that so no evil may come nigh us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this plainly shows, that we ought, in our behavior towards God, to
          keep at a great distance from sin, and from all those exposes to it;
          as we desire God, in his providence to us, should keep calamity and
          misery at a great distance from us, and not to order those things that
          expose our welfare.

        <p>
          Sixth, seeing we are to pray we may not be led into temptation,
          certainly we ought not to run ourselves into it. — This is one request
          that Christ directs us to make to God in that form of prayer, which he
          taught his disciples — “Lead us not into temptation.” And how
          inconsistent shall we be with ourselves, if we pray to God, that we
          should not be led into temptations; and at the same time, we are not
          careful to avoid temptation; but bring ourselves into it, by doing
          those things that lead and expose to sin. What self-contradiction is
          it, for a man to pray to God that he may be kept from that, which he
          takes no care to avoid! By praying that we may be kept from
          temptation, we profess to God that being in temptation is a thing to
          be avoided; but by running into it we show that we choose the
          contrary, viz. not to avoid it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventh, the apostle directs us to avoid those things that are in
          themselves lawful, but tend to lead others into sin. Surely then we
          should avoid what tends to lead ourselves into sin. — The apostle
          directs, 1 Cor. 8:9, “Take heed lest — this liberty of yours become a
          stumbling-block to them that are weak.” Rom. 14:13, “That no man put a
          stumbling-block, or an occasion to fall, in his brother’s way.” Verse
          15, “But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not
          charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat.” Verse 20, 21, “For meat
          destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is
          evil for that man who eateth with offence. It is good neither to eat
          flesh nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth,
          or is offended, or is made weak.” — Now if this rule of the apostle be
          agreeable to the word of Christ, as we must suppose, or expunge what
          he says out of the canon of the Scripture; then a like rule obliges
          more strongly in those things that tend to lead ourselves into sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eighth, there are many precepts of Scripture, which directly and
          positively imply, that we ought to avoid those things that tend to
          sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          This very thing is commanded by Christ, Mat. 26:41, where he directs
          us to “watch lest we enter into temptation.” But certainly running
          ourselves into temptation, is the reverse of watching against it. — We
          are commanded to abstain from all appearance of evil; i.e. do by sin
          as a man does by a thing, the sight or appearance of which he hates;
          and therefore will avoid anything that looks like it; and will not
          come near or in sight of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, Christ commanded to separate from us those things that are
          stumbling-blocks, or occasions of sin, however dear they are to us.
          Mat. 5:29, “If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it
          from thee.” Verse 30, “And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off.”
          By the right hand offending us, is not meant its paining us; but the
          word in the original signifies, being a stumbling-block; if thy right
          hand prove a stumbling-block, or occasion to fall; i.e. an occasion to
          sin. Those things are called offenses or stumbling-blocks in the New
          Testament, which are the occasions of falling into sin. — Yea, Christ
          tells us, that we must avoid them, however dear they are to us, though
          as dear as our right hand or right eye. If there be any practice that
          naturally tends and exposes us to sin, we must have done with it;
          though we love it never so well, and are never so loth to part with
          it; though it be as contrary to our inclination, as to cut off our own
          right hand, or pluck out our own right eye; and that upon pain of
          damnation, for it is intimated that if we do not, we must go with two
          hands and two eyes into hell fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, God took great care to forbid the children of Israel those
          things that tended to lead them into sin. For this reason, he forbad
          them marrying strange wives. Deu. 7:3, 4, “Neither shalt thou make
          marriages with them, — for they will turn away thy sons from following
          me, that they may serve other gods.” For this reason they were
          commanded to destroy all those things, that the nations of Canaan had
          used in their idolatry; and if any were enticed over to idolatry, they
          were to be destroyed without mercy; though ever so near and dear
          friends. They were not only to be parted with, but stoned with stones;
          yea, they themselves were to fall upon them, and put them to death,
          though son or daughter, or their bosom friend. Deu. 13:6, etc. “If thy
          brother, — or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or
          thy friends, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying,
          Let us go and serve other gods, — thou shalt not consent unto him, —
          neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither
          shalt thou conceal him. But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand
          shall be first upon him to put him to death.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, The wise man warns us to avoid those things that tend and
          expose us to sin; especially the sin of uncleanness. Pro. 6:27, “Can a
          man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burnt? Can one go
          upon hot coals, and his feet not be burnt? — So, whosoever touches
          her, shall not be innocent.” This is the truth held forth; avoid those
          customs and practices that naturally tend to stir up lust. And there
          are many examples in Scripture, which have the force of precept; and
          recorded, as not only worthy, but demand our imitation. The conduct of
          Joseph is one; and that recorded of king David, is another. Psa. 39:1,
          2, “I said I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue;
          I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. I
          was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good” — even from
          good — that is, he was so watchful over his words, and kept at such a
          great distance from speaking what might in any way tend to sin; that
          he avoided, in certain circumstances, speaking what was in itself
          lawful; lest he should be betrayed into that which was sinful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ninth, a prudent sense of our own weakness, and exposedness to yield
          to temptation, obliges us to avoid that which leads or exposes to sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whoever knows himself, and is sensible how weak he is, and his
          constant exposedness to run into sin — how full of corruption his
          heart is, which, like fuel, is ready to catch fire, and bring
          destruction upon him — how much he has in him to incline him to sin,
          and how unable he is to stand of himself — who is sensible of this,
          and has any regard of his duty, will he not be very watchful against
          everything that may lead and expose to sin? On this account Christ
          directed us, Mat. 26:41, “To watch and pray, lest we enter into
          temptation.” The reason is added, the flesh is weak! He who, in
          confidence of his own strength, boldly runs the venture of sinning, by
          going into temptation, manifests great presumption, and a sottish
          insensibility of his own weakness. “He that trusteth in his own heart
          is a fool.” Pro. 28:26.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wisest and strongest, and some of the most holy men in the world,
          have been overthrown by such means. So was David; so was Solomon, —
          his wives turned away his heart. If such persons so eminent for
          holiness were this way led into sin, surely it should be a warning to
          us. “Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.”
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>What things lead and expose to sin.</p>
        <p>
          If anything be made out clearly, from reason and the Word of God, to
          be our duty, this would be enough with all Christians. Will a follower
          of Christ stand objecting and disputing against what is irrefragably
          proved and demonstrated to be his duty?
        </p>
        <p>
          But some may be ready to inquire, How shall we know what things do
          lead and expose to sin? Let a man do what he will, he cannot avoid
          sinning, as long as he has such a corrupt heart within him. And there
          is nothing a man can do, but he may find some temptation in it. And
          though it be true, that a man ought to avoid those things which have a
          special tendency to expose men to sin, are what we ought to shun, as
          much as in us lies — yet how shall we judge and determine what things
          have a natural tendency to sin, or do especially lead to it?
        </p>
        <p>
          I would answer in some particulars which are plain and easy; and which
          cannot be denied without the greatest absurdity.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that which borders on those sins, to which the lusts of men’s
          hearts strongly incline them, is of this sort. Men come into the world
          with many strong and violent lusts in their hearts, and are exceeding
          prone of themselves to transgress; even in the safest circumstances in
          which they can be placed. And surely so much the nearer they are to
          that sin, to which they are naturally inclined; so much the more are
          they exposed. If any of us who are parents should see our children
          near the brink of some deep pit, or close by the edge of the precipice
          of a high mountain; and not only so, but the ground upon which the
          child stood slippery, and steeply descending directly toward the
          precipice; should we not reckon a child exposed in such a case? Should
          we not be in haste to remove the child from its very dangerous
          situation?
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the manner among the Israelites, to build their houses with
          flat roofs, so that persons might walk on the tops of their houses.
          And therefore God took care to make it a law among them, that every
          man should have battlements upon the edges of their roofs; lest any
          person should fall off and be killed. Deu. 22:8, “When thou buildest a
          new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou
          bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence.” And
          certainly we ought to take the like care that we do not fall into sin;
          which carries in it eternal death. We should, as it were, fix a
          battlement, a guard, to keep us from the edge of the precipice. Much
          more ought we to take care, that we do not go upon a roof that is not
          only without battlements, but when it is steep, and we shall naturally
          incline to fall. — Men’s lusts are like strong enemies, endeavoring to
          draw them into sin. If a man stood upon a dangerous precipice, and had
          enemies about him, pulling and drawing him, endeavoring to throw him
          down; would he, in such a case, choose or dare to stand near the edge?
          Would he look upon himself safe, close on the brink? Would he not
          endeavor, for his own safety, to keep at a distance?
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, those things that tend to feed lusts in the imagination, are
          of this kind. — They lead and expose men to sin. Those things that
          have a natural tendency to excite in the mind the imagination of that
          which is the object of the lust, certainly tend to feed and promote
          that lust. What can be more evident, than that a presenting of the
          object tends to stir up the appetite? Reason and experience teach
          this. — Therefore, all things, whether words or actions, which have a
          tendency and expose to sin, tend also to raise in the mind
          imaginations of what the lust tends to. It is certainly wrong to feed
          a lust, even in the imagination. It is quite contrary to the holy
          rules of God’s words. Pro. 24:9, “The thought of foolishness is sin.”
          Mat. 5:28, “Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath
          committed adultery.” A man, by gratifying his lusts in his imagination
          and thoughts, may make his soul in the sight of God to be a hold of
          foul spirits, and like a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. And
          sinful imaginations tend to sinful actions, and outward behavior in
          the end. Lust is always first conceived in the imagination, and then
          brought forth in the outward practice. You may see the progress of it
          in Jam. 1:15, “Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.”
          — Such things are abominable in the sight of a pure and holy God. We
          are commanded to keep at a great distance from spiritual pollution;
          and to hate even the very “garment spotted with the flesh.” Jude 23.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, those things that the experience and observation of mankind
          show to be ordinarily attended or followed with sin, are of this sort.
          Experience is a good rule to determine by in things of this nature.
          How do we know the natural tendency of anything, but by observation
          and experience? Men observe and find, that some things are commonly
          attended and followed with other things; and hence mankind pronounce,
          that they have a natural tendency to them. We have no other way to
          know the tendency of anything. Thus men by observation and experience
          know that the warmth of the sun, and showers of rain, are attended
          with the growth of plants; and hence they learn, that they have a
          tendency to it. So they find by experience, that the bite of some
          kinds of serpents is commonly followed with illness, and often with
          death; and hence they learn, that the bite of such serpents has a
          natural tendency to bring disorder upon the body, and exposes to
          death. — And so, if experience and common observation shows, that any
          particular practice or custom is commonly attended with that which is
          very sinful, we may safely conclude that such a practice tends to sin;
          that it leads and exposes to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we may determine that tavern-haunting and gaming are things that
          tend to sin; because common experience and observation show, that
          those practices are attended with a great deal of sin, and wickedness.
          The observation of all ages and all nations, with one voice, declares
          it. It shows, where taverns are much frequented for drinking and the
          like, they are especially places of sin, of profaneness, and other
          wickedness; and it shows, that those towns, where is much of this, are
          places where no good generally prevails. And it also shows, that those
          persons that are given much to frequenting taverns are most commonly
          vicious persons. And so of gaming; as playing at cards, experience
          shows, that those persons that practice this, do generally fall into
          much sin. Hence these practices are become infamous among all sober
          virtuous persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, another way by which persons may determine of some things,
          that they lead and expose to sin, is by their own experience, or what
          they have found in themselves. — This surely is enough to convince
          them, that such things actually lead and expose to sin. For what will
          convince men, if their own experience will not? Thus if men have found
          by undeniable experience, that any practice or custom stirs up lust in
          them, and has betrayed them into foolish and sinful behavior, or
          sinful thoughts; they may determine that they lead to sin. If they,
          upon examining themselves, must own that a custom or practice has
          disposed them to the omission of known duty, such as secret or family
          prayer, and has indisposed them to reading and religious meditation —
          or if they find, since they have complied with such a custom, they are
          less watchful of their hearts, less disposed to anything that is
          serious; that the frame of their mind is more light, and their hearts
          less disposed on the things of another world, and more after vanity —
          these are sinful effects. And therefore if experience shows a custom
          or practice to be attended with these things, then experience shows
          that they lead and expose to sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, we may determine whether a thing be of an evil tendency or not,
          by the effect that an outpouring of the Spirit of God, and a general
          flourishing of religion, has with respect to it. If this puts a stop
          to any practice or custom, and roots it out; surely it argues, that
          that practice or custom is of no good tendency. For if there be no
          hurt in it, and it tends to no hurt, why should the Spirit of God
          destroy it? The Spirit of God has no tendency to destroy anything that
          is neither sinful, nor has any tendency to sin. Why should it? Why
          should we suppose, that he is an enemy to that which has no hurt in
          it; nor has any tendency to that which is hurtful?
        </p>
        <p>
          The flourishing of religion has no tendency to abolish or expel
          anything that is no way against religion. That which is not against
          religion, religion will not appear against. It is a rule that holds in
          all contraries and opposites. The opposition is equal on both sides.
          So contrary as light is to darkness, so contrary is darkness to light.
          So contrary as the flourishing of religion is to any custom, just so
          contrary is that custom to the flourishing of religion. That custom
          that religion tends to destroy, that custom, if it prevail, tends also
          to destroy religion. Therefore, if the flourishing of religion, and
          the outpouring of the Spirit of God, tends to overthrow any custom,
          that takes place or prevails, we may surely determine, that that
          custom is either in itself sinful, or tends and exposes to evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth, we may determine, by the effect that a general decay of
          religion has with respect to them, whether they be things of a sinful
          tendency or not. If they be things that come with a decay of religion,
          that creep in as that decays, we may determine they are things of no
          good tendency. The withdrawing of good does not let in good but evil.
          Evil, not good, comes in, as good gradually ceases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, if there be any decay of religion in the town, or in
          particular persons, and upon this, any certain customs or practices
          take place and are allowed, which were wholly abstained from and
          renounced, when religion was in a more flourishing state; we may
          safely conclude that such customs and practices are contrary to the
          nature of true religion; and therefore in themselves sinful, or
          tending to sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventh, we may in good things determine whether any custom be of a
          good tendency, by considering what the effect would be, if it was
          openly and universally owned and practiced. There are many things
          which persons practice somewhat secretly, and which they plead to be
          not hurtful; but which if they had suitable consideration to discern
          the consequence of everybody openly practicing the same, would soon
          show a most woeful state of things. If therefore there be any custom,
          that will not bear universal open practice and profession; we may
          determine that that custom is of an ill tendency. For if it is neither
          sinful in itself, nor tends to anything sinful, then it is no matter
          how open it is: for we need not be afraid of that custom being too
          prevalent and universal, that has no ill tendency in it.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>A serious warning to all, and especially young people.</p>
        <p>
          Thus I have mentioned some general rules, by which to determine and
          judge, what things are of a bad and sinful tendency. And these things
          are so plain, that for a person to deny them, would be absurd and
          ridiculous. — I would now, in the name of God, warn all persons to
          avoid such things, as appear by these rules to lead and expose to sin.
          And particularly, I would take occasion to warn young people, as they
          would approve themselves fearers of God, to avoid all such things in
          company, that being tired by these rules, will appear to have a
          tendency to sin. Avoid all such ways of talking and acting as have a
          tendency to this; and follow the example of Joseph. Not only gross
          acts of uncleanness, but all acts of lasciviousness, both in talking
          and acting, are strictly forbidden in Scripture; as what should not be
          so much as once named among saints or Christians. Gal. 5:9, “Now the
          works of the flesh are manifest, adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
          lasciviousness.” Eph. 5:3, 4, 5, “But fornication, and all
          uncleanness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
          neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not
          convenient; for this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person,
          hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, and of God.” We should
          hate even the garment spotted with the flesh, i.e. should hate and
          shun all that, in the least degree, approaches to any such thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I desire that certain customs, too common among young people, may
          be examined by those rules that have been mentioned. That custom in
          particular, of young people of different sexes reclining together —
          however little is made of it, and however ready people may be to laugh
          at its being condemned — if it be examined by the rules that have been
          mentioned, it will appear, past all contradiction, to be one of those
          that lead and expose to sin. And I believe experience and fact
          abundantly bear witness to it. It has been one main thing that has led
          to the growth of uncleanness in the land. And there are other customs
          and liberties, customarily used among young people in company, which
          they who use them know that they lead to sin. They know that they stir
          up their lusts; and this is the very end for which they do it, to
          gratify their lusts in some measure. Little do such persons consider,
          what a holy God they are soon to be judged by, who abominates the
          impurities of their hearts. — If therefore they do actually stir up
          and feed lust, then certainly tend to further degrees and more gross
          acts. That which stirs up lust, makes it more violent, and does
          therefore certainly the more expose persons to be overcome by it. How
          evident and undeniable are these things; and how strange that any
          should make a derision of them!
        </p>
        <p>
          Possibly you may be confident of your own strength; and may think with
          yourself, that you are not in danger, that there is no temptation in
          these things, but what you are able easily to overcome. But you should
          consider that the most self-confidant are most in danger. Peter was
          very confidant that he should not deny Christ, but how dreadfully
          otherwise was the event! If others that have fallen into gross sins,
          should declare how it was with them; doubtless they would say, that
          they at first thought there was no danger. They were far from the
          thought that ever they should commit such wickedness; but yet by
          venturing further and further, they fell at last into the foulest and
          grossest transgressions. Persons may long withstand temptation, and be
          suddenly be overcome at last. None so much in danger, as the most
          bold. They are most safe, who are most sensible of their own weakness;
          most distrustful of their own hearts; and most sensible of their
          continual need of restraining grace. Young persons, with respect to
          the sin of uncleanness, are dealt with by the devil, just as some give
          an account of serpents charming the birds and other animals down into
          their mouths. If the serpent takes them with his eyes, though they
          seem to be affrighted by it, yet they will not flee away, but will
          keep the serpent in sight, and approach nearer and nearer to him, till
          they fall a prey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another custom that I desire may be examined by the aforementioned
          rules, is that of young people of both sexes getting together in
          companies for mirth, and spending the time together till late in the
          night, in their jollity. I desire our young people to suffer their
          ears to be open to what I have to say upon this point; as I am the
          messenger of the Lord of hosts to them; and not determine that they
          will not hearken, before they have heard what I shall say. I hope
          there are but few persons among us so abandoned, as to determine that
          they will go on in a practice, whether they are convinced that it is
          unlawful or not; or though it should be proved to them to be unlawful
          by undeniable arguments. — Let us then examine this custom and
          practice by what has been said. It has been proved undeniably, that we
          ought not to go on in a practice that leads and exposes to sin; and
          rules have been laid down to judge what does thus expose and lead to
          it, which I think are plain and undeniable. Certainly a Christian will
          not be unwilling to have his practices examined and tried by the rules
          of reason and God’s word; but will rather rejoice in it. And I desire
          particularly that the practice may be tried by that sure touchstone of
          experience. This is one of the rules of trial that have been
          mentioned; that any custom which the experience and observation of
          mankind show to be ordinarily attended with sin, may be concluded to
          be unlawful. And if we look abroad in the country, I doubt not but
          these two things will be found.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that as to those places, where there is most of this carried on
          among young people (as there is more of it in some places than
          others), it will be found, as a thing that universally holds, that the
          young people there are commonly a loose, vain, and irreligious
          generation; little regarding God, heaven or hell, or anything but
          vanity. And that commonly in those towns where most frolicking is
          carried on, there are the most frequent breakings out of gross sins;
          fornication in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, if we go though the country, we shall for the most part find,
          that those persons who are most addicted to this practice, are the
          furthest from serious thought, and are the vainest and loosest upon
          other accounts. And whence should this be, if such a practice was not
          sinful, or had not a natural tendency to lead persons into sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I appeal to those who have made pretenses to serious religion and
          saving piety. You have formerly pretended to keep up religion in your
          closets, and in your own souls. Now seriously ask yourselves whether
          or no you have not found, that this practice has indisposed you to
          serious religion, and taken off your minds from it? Has it not tended
          to your neglect of secret prayer? And, if you have not wholly
          neglected it, have you not found, that you have been abundantly more
          ready to turn it off in any manner, and glad to have done with it?
          More backward to reading and serious meditation, and such things? And
          that your mind has been exceedingly diverted from religion, and that
          for some time? — I do not send you far off to find out whether this
          custom be not of bad tendency — not beyond the sea, but your own
          breast; there let the matter be determined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now try this custom by the effect which the outpouring of the
          Spirit of God on a people has with respect to it. This we are under
          great advantage to do; because there has lately been, in this place,
          the most remarkable outpouring of the Spirit of God, that has ever
          been in New England, and it may be in the world, since the apostles’
          days. And it is well known, that before then, the custom did prevail
          in the town; but after, the custom was altogether laid aside; and was
          so for several years. — No account can be given why the Spirit of God,
          and the flourishing of religion, should abolish such a custom, unless
          that custom be either in its nature or tendency an enemy to the Spirit
          of God, and to religion. — The fruits of the Spirit of God are good,
          and therefore it is good that this custom should be removed; for this
          is plainly one of the effects. And if so, it is because the custom is
          bad, either in its nature or tendency. Otherwise there would be no
          good in its being removed. The Spirit of God abolished this custom for
          this reason, because if it had been kept up in the town, it would have
          had a direct tendency to hinder that work which the Spirit was about
          to do amongst us. This was undeniably the reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supposing such a custom had been begun and set up, by the young people
          all over the town, in the midst of the time of the late outpouring of
          the Spirit, all of a sudden; would any wise persons, that have truly
          the cause of religion at heart, rejoiced at it? Would not everyone
          have concluded, without any hesitation, that there was great danger
          that it would take off people’s minds from religion, and make them
          vain; and so put an end to the flourishing of religion? Would not
          every considerate person have thought thus of it? And if such a custom
          would have had an ill tendency then, so it will now.
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECTION. The town is not in such circumstances now, as it was then,
          it might have done hurt then, by putting an end to the great concern.
          But now it may do no hurt; for there is now no such great concern to
          be interrupted by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          ANSWER. Though the town is not in such circumstances now as it was
          then, yet there ought to be as much engagedness of mind about
          religion, as much concern among sinners, and as much engagedness among
          the godly, as then. And it is to our shame that there is not. And if
          such a practice would have tended to destroy such a religious concern
          then, it certainly tends to prevent it now. It is a rule that will
          hold, that what has a tendency to destroy a thing when it is, tends to
          prevent when it is not. And are we not praying from Sabbath to
          Sabbath, and from day to day, for such a concern again? And do not
          those who pretend to be converted, and yet have lately set up this
          custom, pray for the same? Are you a convert, a saint, and yet not
          desire that there should be any more pouring out of the Spirit of God?
          The town has cause to be ashamed of such converts, if it has any such.
          And if ye do, why do you do what tends to prevent it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, Let this practice be tried by the effect that a general decay
          of religion has with respect to it. Now we have a trial. It is now a
          time that religion is greatly decayed amongst us; and the effect is,
          that this custom comes in with this decay. Young people begin again to
          set up their old custom of frolicking (as it is called), and spending
          a great part of the night in it, to the violation of family order.
          What is the reason, if this custom is not bad, either in its nature or
          tendency, that it did not come in before, when religion was lively?
          Why does it stay till it can take the advantage of the withdrawment of
          religion? This is a sign that it is a custom that shuns a spirit of
          lively religion, as darkness shuns the light, and never comes in till
          light withdraws.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here again, I would send persons to their own experience. How did
          this practice come in with you in particular; you, that two or three
          years ago seemed to be so engaged in religion? Did it not come in, did
          you not begin to practice it, as the sense of religion wore off? And
          what is the matter? Why did not you set up the practice then, when
          your heart was taken up about reading, meditation, and secret prayer
          to God? If this [does] not at all stand in the way of them, and is no
          hindrance to them, why [were] you not engaged in both together? What
          account can you give of it? Why did you leave off this practice and
          custom, or abstain from it? To what purpose is this changing? One
          while it must be avoided as evil, and another while practiced and
          pleaded for as good? The making of such an alteration does not look
          well, nor will it be for the honor of religion in the eye of the
          world. For whether the practice be lawful or not, yet such a thing
          will surely be improved to our disadvantage. For your avoiding it then
          has this appearance in the eye of the country, that then you condemned
          it. And therefore your now returning to it, will appear to them as
          backsliding in you. Such changelings are evermore, in the eye of the
          world, greatly to the dishonor of their profession, let it be what it
          will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, this customs, as it is practiced, does not only tend to sin,
          but is in itself very disorderly, sinful, and shameful. For it is
          attended late in the night, and in the dead of the night, to the
          neglect of family prayer, and violating all family order; which is
          disorder and profaneness. Is it lawful to rob God of his ordinary
          sacrifices, for the sake of your pleasure, diversion, and jollity? Are
          you of that mind, that it is a decent thing that the stated worship of
          the great God should give way to your mirth, and your diversions? Is
          this the way of God’s holy children? Those works that are commonly
          done in the dead of night, seem to have a black mark set upon them by
          the apostle, and Christians are exhorted to avoid them. Rom. 13:12,
          13, “Let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the
          armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting
          and drunkenness; not in chambering and wantonness.” The word here
          rendered rioting is of far different signification from the term, as
          used in our laws; for the forcible doing an unlawful thing, by three
          or more persons assembled together for that purpose. But the word here
          properly signifies, a disorderly convention of persons in order to
          spend their time together in pleasure and jollity. So the word is
          commonly used in Scripture. Pro. 23:20, “Be not amongst riotous eaters
          of flesh.” Pro. 28:7, “He that is a companion of riotous men, shameth
          his father.” Luke 15:13, “Wasted his substance with riotous living.” —
          Again, a black mark seems to be set on such in Scripture, as in 1
          Thes. 5:5-7, “Ye are all the children of light, and the children of
          the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us
          not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that
          sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the
          night.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of you that have lately set up this practice of frolicking and
          jollity, profess to be children of the light and of the day; and not
          to be the children of darkness. Therefore walk as in the day; and do
          not those works of darkness, that are commonly done at unseasonable
          hours of the night. Such things are not only condemned by the apostle,
          but are looked upon as infamous in all ages among sober people, as all
          past writings manifest. Therefore it is a thing of bad report, and so
          forbidden. Phil. 4:8, “Whatsoever things are of good report; if there
          be any virtue — any praise, think on these things.”
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECTION. But the wise man allows of this practice, when he says,
          Ecc. 3:4, “There is a time to mourn and a time to dance.”
        </p>
        <p>
          ANSWER. This is nothing to the purpose; for the utmost that any can
          pretend that it proves, is that it may be used under some
          circumstances; but not at all, that dancing and other things used by
          our young people in their frolics are lawful, in those circumstances:
          any more than what is said in the same chapter, verse 3. — “there is a
          time to kill,” proves that it is lawful for a man to commit murder. —
          To deny that dancing, under any circumstances, whatever, was lawful,
          would be absurd. For there was a religious dancing in the Jewish
          church, which was a way of expressing their spiritual mirth. So David
          danced before the Lord. And he calls upon others to praise God in the
          dance. So there may be other circumstances wherein dancing may not be
          unlawful. But all this makes nothing to the present purpose; to prove
          that this particular custom is not of a bad tendency. Besides, when
          the wise man says, “there is a time to dance” that does not prove,
          that the dead of the night is the time for it. The same wise man doth
          not justify carnal mirth, but condemns it. Ecc. 2:2, “I said of
          laughter, it is mad; and of mirth, what doth it?”
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECTION. If we avoid all such things, it will be the way for our
          young people to be ignorant how to behave themselves in company.
        </p>
        <p>
          ANSWER. But consider what this objection comes to. It certainly comes
          to this, viz. that the pouring out of the Spirit of God upon a people,
          tends to banish all good conduct, good breeding, and decent behavior
          from among them; and to sink them down into clownishness and
          barbarity! The Spirit of God did actually put an end to this practice
          among us. — But who is not ashamed to make such an objection? Will any
          of our young converts talk thus? Will you, that think you were
          converted by the late pouring out of the Spirit of God, and are made
          holy persons, heirs of eternal life, talk so blasphemously of it?
        </p>
        <p>
          If our young people are resolute still to go on notwithstanding all
          that has been said, I hope that those of them who call themselves
          converted, will first find out some rational, satisfying answer to the
          arguments that have been used against it. This at least may be
          reasonably expected of them, seeing they make such a profession. You
          have this day been partaking of the sacrament of the Lord’s supper,
          and therein solemnly renewed your profession. — If after such light
          set before you, and such mercy given, you will go on, be it known to
          you, that your eating now, and at other times, will prove only an
          eating and drinking judgment to yourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I desire heads of families, if they have any government over their
          children, or any command of their own houses, would not tolerate their
          children in such practices, nor suffer such conventions in their
          houses. — I do not desire that young people should be abridged of any
          lawful and proper liberties. But this custom can be of no benefit or
          service in the world. It tends only to mischief. — Satan doubtless
          would be glad to have such an interest amongst us as he used to have;
          and is therefore striving to steal in, while we are sleeping. But let
          us rouse up ourselves, in vigorously oppose his encroachments. I shall
          repeat those words of the apostle, Rom. 13:12-14, and leave them to
          the serious consideration of all persons, old and young. “The night is
          far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off the works of
          darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly
          as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and
          wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus
          Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts
          thereof.”
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>What things lead and expose to sin.</p>
        <p>
          If anything be made out clearly, from reason and the Word of God, to
          be our duty, this would be enough with all Christians. Will a follower
          of Christ stand objecting and disputing against what is irrefragably
          proved and demonstrated to be his duty?
        </p>
        <p>
          But some may be ready to inquire, How shall we know what things do
          lead and expose to sin? Let a man do what he will, he cannot avoid
          sinning, as long as he has such a corrupt heart within him. And there
          is nothing a man can do, but he may find some temptation in it. And
          though it be true, that a man ought to avoid those things which have a
          special tendency to expose men to sin, are what we ought to shun, as
          much as in us lies — yet how shall we judge and determine what things
          have a natural tendency to sin, or do especially lead to it?
        </p>
        <p>
          I would answer in some particulars which are plain and easy; and which
          cannot be denied without the greatest absurdity.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that which borders on those sins, to which the lusts of men’s
          hearts strongly incline them, is of this sort. Men come into the world
          with many strong and violent lusts in their hearts, and are exceeding
          prone of themselves to transgress; even in the safest circumstances in
          which they can be placed. And surely so much the nearer they are to
          that sin, to which they are naturally inclined; so much the more are
          they exposed. If any of us who are parents should see our children
          near the brink of some deep pit, or close by the edge of the precipice
          of a high mountain; and not only so, but the ground upon which the
          child stood slippery, and steeply descending directly toward the
          precipice; should we not reckon a child exposed in such a case? Should
          we not be in haste to remove the child from its very dangerous
          situation?
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the manner among the Israelites, to build their houses with
          flat roofs, so that persons might walk on the tops of their houses.
          And therefore God took care to make it a law among them, that every
          man should have battlements upon the edges of their roofs; lest any
          person should fall off and be killed. Deu. 22:8, “When thou buildest a
          new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou
          bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence.” And
          certainly we ought to take the like care that we do not fall into sin;
          which carries in it eternal death. We should, as it were, fix a
          battlement, a guard, to keep us from the edge of the precipice. Much
          more ought we to take care, that we do not go upon a roof that is not
          only without battlements, but when it is steep, and we shall naturally
          incline to fall. — Men’s lusts are like strong enemies, endeavoring to
          draw them into sin. If a man stood upon a dangerous precipice, and had
          enemies about him, pulling and drawing him, endeavoring to throw him
          down; would he, in such a case, choose or dare to stand near the edge?
          Would he look upon himself safe, close on the brink? Would he not
          endeavor, for his own safety, to keep at a distance?
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, those things that tend to feed lusts in the imagination, are
          of this kind. — They lead and expose men to sin. Those things that
          have a natural tendency to excite in the mind the imagination of that
          which is the object of the lust, certainly tend to feed and promote
          that lust. What can be more evident, than that a presenting of the
          object tends to stir up the appetite? Reason and experience teach
          this. — Therefore, all things, whether words or actions, which have a
          tendency and expose to sin, tend also to raise in the mind
          imaginations of what the lust tends to. It is certainly wrong to feed
          a lust, even in the imagination. It is quite contrary to the holy
          rules of God’s words. Pro. 24:9, “The thought of foolishness is sin.”
          Mat. 5:28, “Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath
          committed adultery.” A man, by gratifying his lusts in his imagination
          and thoughts, may make his soul in the sight of God to be a hold of
          foul spirits, and like a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. And
          sinful imaginations tend to sinful actions, and outward behavior in
          the end. Lust is always first conceived in the imagination, and then
          brought forth in the outward practice. You may see the progress of it
          in Jam. 1:15, “Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.”
          — Such things are abominable in the sight of a pure and holy God. We
          are commanded to keep at a great distance from spiritual pollution;
          and to hate even the very “garment spotted with the flesh.” Jude 23.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, those things that the experience and observation of mankind
          show to be ordinarily attended or followed with sin, are of this sort.
          Experience is a good rule to determine by in things of this nature.
          How do we know the natural tendency of anything, but by observation
          and experience? Men observe and find, that some things are commonly
          attended and followed with other things; and hence mankind pronounce,
          that they have a natural tendency to them. We have no other way to
          know the tendency of anything. Thus men by observation and experience
          know that the warmth of the sun, and showers of rain, are attended
          with the growth of plants; and hence they learn, that they have a
          tendency to it. So they find by experience, that the bite of some
          kinds of serpents is commonly followed with illness, and often with
          death; and hence they learn, that the bite of such serpents has a
          natural tendency to bring disorder upon the body, and exposes to
          death. — And so, if experience and common observation shows, that any
          particular practice or custom is commonly attended with that which is
          very sinful, we may safely conclude that such a practice tends to sin;
          that it leads and exposes to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we may determine that tavern-haunting and gaming are things that
          tend to sin; because common experience and observation show, that
          those practices are attended with a great deal of sin, and wickedness.
          The observation of all ages and all nations, with one voice, declares
          it. It shows, where taverns are much frequented for drinking and the
          like, they are especially places of sin, of profaneness, and other
          wickedness; and it shows, that those towns, where is much of this, are
          places where no good generally prevails. And it also shows, that those
          persons that are given much to frequenting taverns are most commonly
          vicious persons. And so of gaming; as playing at cards, experience
          shows, that those persons that practice this, do generally fall into
          much sin. Hence these practices are become infamous among all sober
          virtuous persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, another way by which persons may determine of some things,
          that they lead and expose to sin, is by their own experience, or what
          they have found in themselves. — This surely is enough to convince
          them, that such things actually lead and expose to sin. For what will
          convince men, if their own experience will not? Thus if men have found
          by undeniable experience, that any practice or custom stirs up lust in
          them, and has betrayed them into foolish and sinful behavior, or
          sinful thoughts; they may determine that they lead to sin. If they,
          upon examining themselves, must own that a custom or practice has
          disposed them to the omission of known duty, such as secret or family
          prayer, and has indisposed them to reading and religious meditation —
          or if they find, since they have complied with such a custom, they are
          less watchful of their hearts, less disposed to anything that is
          serious; that the frame of their mind is more light, and their hearts
          less disposed on the things of another world, and more after vanity —
          these are sinful effects. And therefore if experience shows a custom
          or practice to be attended with these things, then experience shows
          that they lead and expose to sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, we may determine whether a thing be of an evil tendency or not,
          by the effect that an outpouring of the Spirit of God, and a general
          flourishing of religion, has with respect to it. If this puts a stop
          to any practice or custom, and roots it out; surely it argues, that
          that practice or custom is of no good tendency. For if there be no
          hurt in it, and it tends to no hurt, why should the Spirit of God
          destroy it? The Spirit of God has no tendency to destroy anything that
          is neither sinful, nor has any tendency to sin. Why should it? Why
          should we suppose, that he is an enemy to that which has no hurt in
          it; nor has any tendency to that which is hurtful?
        </p>
        <p>
          The flourishing of religion has no tendency to abolish or expel
          anything that is no way against religion. That which is not against
          religion, religion will not appear against. It is a rule that holds in
          all contraries and opposites. The opposition is equal on both sides.
          So contrary as light is to darkness, so contrary is darkness to light.
          So contrary as the flourishing of religion is to any custom, just so
          contrary is that custom to the flourishing of religion. That custom
          that religion tends to destroy, that custom, if it prevail, tends also
          to destroy religion. Therefore, if the flourishing of religion, and
          the outpouring of the Spirit of God, tends to overthrow any custom,
          that takes place or prevails, we may surely determine, that that
          custom is either in itself sinful, or tends and exposes to evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixth, we may determine, by the effect that a general decay of
          religion has with respect to them, whether they be things of a sinful
          tendency or not. If they be things that come with a decay of religion,
          that creep in as that decays, we may determine they are things of no
          good tendency. The withdrawing of good does not let in good but evil.
          Evil, not good, comes in, as good gradually ceases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, if there be any decay of religion in the town, or in
          particular persons, and upon this, any certain customs or practices
          take place and are allowed, which were wholly abstained from and
          renounced, when religion was in a more flourishing state; we may
          safely conclude that such customs and practices are contrary to the
          nature of true religion; and therefore in themselves sinful, or
          tending to sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventh, we may in good things determine whether any custom be of a
          good tendency, by considering what the effect would be, if it was
          openly and universally owned and practiced. There are many things
          which persons practice somewhat secretly, and which they plead to be
          not hurtful; but which if they had suitable consideration to discern
          the consequence of everybody openly practicing the same, would soon
          show a most woeful state of things. If therefore there be any custom,
          that will not bear universal open practice and profession; we may
          determine that that custom is of an ill tendency. For if it is neither
          sinful in itself, nor tends to anything sinful, then it is no matter
          how open it is: for we need not be afraid of that custom being too
          prevalent and universal, that has no ill tendency in it.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>A serious warning to all, and especially young people.</p>
        <p>
          Thus I have mentioned some general rules, by which to determine and
          judge, what things are of a bad and sinful tendency. And these things
          are so plain, that for a person to deny them, would be absurd and
          ridiculous. — I would now, in the name of God, warn all persons to
          avoid such things, as appear by these rules to lead and expose to sin.
          And particularly, I would take occasion to warn young people, as they
          would approve themselves fearers of God, to avoid all such things in
          company, that being tired by these rules, will appear to have a
          tendency to sin. Avoid all such ways of talking and acting as have a
          tendency to this; and follow the example of Joseph. Not only gross
          acts of uncleanness, but all acts of lasciviousness, both in talking
          and acting, are strictly forbidden in Scripture; as what should not be
          so much as once named among saints or Christians. Gal. 5:9, “Now the
          works of the flesh are manifest, adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
          lasciviousness.” Eph. 5:3, 4, 5, “But fornication, and all
          uncleanness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
          neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not
          convenient; for this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person,
          hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, and of God.” We should
          hate even the garment spotted with the flesh, i.e. should hate and
          shun all that, in the least degree, approaches to any such thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I desire that certain customs, too common among young people, may
          be examined by those rules that have been mentioned. That custom in
          particular, of young people of different sexes reclining together —
          however little is made of it, and however ready people may be to laugh
          at its being condemned — if it be examined by the rules that have been
          mentioned, it will appear, past all contradiction, to be one of those
          that lead and expose to sin. And I believe experience and fact
          abundantly bear witness to it. It has been one main thing that has led
          to the growth of uncleanness in the land. And there are other customs
          and liberties, customarily used among young people in company, which
          they who use them know that they lead to sin. They know that they stir
          up their lusts; and this is the very end for which they do it, to
          gratify their lusts in some measure. Little do such persons consider,
          what a holy God they are soon to be judged by, who abominates the
          impurities of their hearts. — If therefore they do actually stir up
          and feed lust, then certainly tend to further degrees and more gross
          acts. That which stirs up lust, makes it more violent, and does
          therefore certainly the more expose persons to be overcome by it. How
          evident and undeniable are these things; and how strange that any
          should make a derision of them!
        </p>
        <p>
          Possibly you may be confident of your own strength; and may think with
          yourself, that you are not in danger, that there is no temptation in
          these things, but what you are able easily to overcome. But you should
          consider that the most self-confidant are most in danger. Peter was
          very confidant that he should not deny Christ, but how dreadfully
          otherwise was the event! If others that have fallen into gross sins,
          should declare how it was with them; doubtless they would say, that
          they at first thought there was no danger. They were far from the
          thought that ever they should commit such wickedness; but yet by
          venturing further and further, they fell at last into the foulest and
          grossest transgressions. Persons may long withstand temptation, and be
          suddenly be overcome at last. None so much in danger, as the most
          bold. They are most safe, who are most sensible of their own weakness;
          most distrustful of their own hearts; and most sensible of their
          continual need of restraining grace. Young persons, with respect to
          the sin of uncleanness, are dealt with by the devil, just as some give
          an account of serpents charming the birds and other animals down into
          their mouths. If the serpent takes them with his eyes, though they
          seem to be affrighted by it, yet they will not flee away, but will
          keep the serpent in sight, and approach nearer and nearer to him, till
          they fall a prey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another custom that I desire may be examined by the aforementioned
          rules, is that of young people of both sexes getting together in
          companies for mirth, and spending the time together till late in the
          night, in their jollity. I desire our young people to suffer their
          ears to be open to what I have to say upon this point; as I am the
          messenger of the Lord of hosts to them; and not determine that they
          will not hearken, before they have heard what I shall say. I hope
          there are but few persons among us so abandoned, as to determine that
          they will go on in a practice, whether they are convinced that it is
          unlawful or not; or though it should be proved to them to be unlawful
          by undeniable arguments. — Let us then examine this custom and
          practice by what has been said. It has been proved undeniably, that we
          ought not to go on in a practice that leads and exposes to sin; and
          rules have been laid down to judge what does thus expose and lead to
          it, which I think are plain and undeniable. Certainly a Christian will
          not be unwilling to have his practices examined and tried by the rules
          of reason and God’s word; but will rather rejoice in it. And I desire
          particularly that the practice may be tried by that sure touchstone of
          experience. This is one of the rules of trial that have been
          mentioned; that any custom which the experience and observation of
          mankind show to be ordinarily attended with sin, may be concluded to
          be unlawful. And if we look abroad in the country, I doubt not but
          these two things will be found.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that as to those places, where there is most of this carried on
          among young people (as there is more of it in some places than
          others), it will be found, as a thing that universally holds, that the
          young people there are commonly a loose, vain, and irreligious
          generation; little regarding God, heaven or hell, or anything but
          vanity. And that commonly in those towns where most frolicking is
          carried on, there are the most frequent breakings out of gross sins;
          fornication in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, if we go though the country, we shall for the most part find,
          that those persons who are most addicted to this practice, are the
          furthest from serious thought, and are the vainest and loosest upon
          other accounts. And whence should this be, if such a practice was not
          sinful, or had not a natural tendency to lead persons into sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I appeal to those who have made pretenses to serious religion and
          saving piety. You have formerly pretended to keep up religion in your
          closets, and in your own souls. Now seriously ask yourselves whether
          or no you have not found, that this practice has indisposed you to
          serious religion, and taken off your minds from it? Has it not tended
          to your neglect of secret prayer? And, if you have not wholly
          neglected it, have you not found, that you have been abundantly more
          ready to turn it off in any manner, and glad to have done with it?
          More backward to reading and serious meditation, and such things? And
          that your mind has been exceedingly diverted from religion, and that
          for some time? — I do not send you far off to find out whether this
          custom be not of bad tendency — not beyond the sea, but your own
          breast; there let the matter be determined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now try this custom by the effect which the outpouring of the
          Spirit of God on a people has with respect to it. This we are under
          great advantage to do; because there has lately been, in this place,
          the most remarkable outpouring of the Spirit of God, that has ever
          been in New England, and it may be in the world, since the apostles’
          days. And it is well known, that before then, the custom did prevail
          in the town; but after, the custom was altogether laid aside; and was
          so for several years. — No account can be given why the Spirit of God,
          and the flourishing of religion, should abolish such a custom, unless
          that custom be either in its nature or tendency an enemy to the Spirit
          of God, and to religion. — The fruits of the Spirit of God are good,
          and therefore it is good that this custom should be removed; for this
          is plainly one of the effects. And if so, it is because the custom is
          bad, either in its nature or tendency. Otherwise there would be no
          good in its being removed. The Spirit of God abolished this custom for
          this reason, because if it had been kept up in the town, it would have
          had a direct tendency to hinder that work which the Spirit was about
          to do amongst us. This was undeniably the reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supposing such a custom had been begun and set up, by the young people
          all over the town, in the midst of the time of the late outpouring of
          the Spirit, all of a sudden; would any wise persons, that have truly
          the cause of religion at heart, rejoiced at it? Would not everyone
          have concluded, without any hesitation, that there was great danger
          that it would take off people’s minds from religion, and make them
          vain; and so put an end to the flourishing of religion? Would not
          every considerate person have thought thus of it? And if such a custom
          would have had an ill tendency then, so it will now.
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECTION. The town is not in such circumstances now, as it was then,
          it might have done hurt then, by putting an end to the great concern.
          But now it may do no hurt; for there is now no such great concern to
          be interrupted by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          ANSWER. Though the town is not in such circumstances now as it was
          then, yet there ought to be as much engagedness of mind about
          religion, as much concern among sinners, and as much engagedness among
          the godly, as then. And it is to our shame that there is not. And if
          such a practice would have tended to destroy such a religious concern
          then, it certainly tends to prevent it now. It is a rule that will
          hold, that what has a tendency to destroy a thing when it is, tends to
          prevent when it is not. And are we not praying from Sabbath to
          Sabbath, and from day to day, for such a concern again? And do not
          those who pretend to be converted, and yet have lately set up this
          custom, pray for the same? Are you a convert, a saint, and yet not
          desire that there should be any more pouring out of the Spirit of God?
          The town has cause to be ashamed of such converts, if it has any such.
          And if ye do, why do you do what tends to prevent it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, Let this practice be tried by the effect that a general decay
          of religion has with respect to it. Now we have a trial. It is now a
          time that religion is greatly decayed amongst us; and the effect is,
          that this custom comes in with this decay. Young people begin again to
          set up their old custom of frolicking (as it is called), and spending
          a great part of the night in it, to the violation of family order.
          What is the reason, if this custom is not bad, either in its nature or
          tendency, that it did not come in before, when religion was lively?
          Why does it stay till it can take the advantage of the withdrawment of
          religion? This is a sign that it is a custom that shuns a spirit of
          lively religion, as darkness shuns the light, and never comes in till
          light withdraws.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here again, I would send persons to their own experience. How did
          this practice come in with you in particular; you, that two or three
          years ago seemed to be so engaged in religion? Did it not come in, did
          you not begin to practice it, as the sense of religion wore off? And
          what is the matter? Why did not you set up the practice then, when
          your heart was taken up about reading, meditation, and secret prayer
          to God? If this [does] not at all stand in the way of them, and is no
          hindrance to them, why [were] you not engaged in both together? What
          account can you give of it? Why did you leave off this practice and
          custom, or abstain from it? To what purpose is this changing? One
          while it must be avoided as evil, and another while practiced and
          pleaded for as good? The making of such an alteration does not look
          well, nor will it be for the honor of religion in the eye of the
          world. For whether the practice be lawful or not, yet such a thing
          will surely be improved to our disadvantage. For your avoiding it then
          has this appearance in the eye of the country, that then you condemned
          it. And therefore your now returning to it, will appear to them as
          backsliding in you. Such changelings are evermore, in the eye of the
          world, greatly to the dishonor of their profession, let it be what it
          will.

          Indeed, this customs, as it is practiced, does not only tend to sin,
          but is in itself very disorderly, sinful, and shameful. For it is
          attended late in the night, and in the dead of the night, to the
          neglect of family prayer, and violating all family order; which is
          disorder and profaneness. Is it lawful to rob God of his ordinary
          sacrifices, for the sake of your pleasure, diversion, and jollity? Are
          you of that mind, that it is a decent thing that the stated worship of
          the great God should give way to your mirth, and your diversions? Is
          this the way of God’s holy children? Those works that are commonly
          done in the dead of night, seem to have a black mark set upon them by
          the apostle, and Christians are exhorted to avoid them. Rom. 13:12,
          13, “Let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the
          armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting
          and drunkenness; not in chambering and wantonness.” The word here
          rendered rioting is of far different signification from the term, as
          used in our laws; for the forcible doing an unlawful thing, by three
          or more persons assembled together for that purpose. But the word here
          properly signifies, a disorderly convention of persons in order to
          spend their time together in pleasure and jollity. So the word is
          commonly used in Scripture. Pro. 23:20, “Be not amongst riotous eaters
          of flesh.” Pro. 28:7, “He that is a companion of riotous men, shameth
          his father.” Luke 15:13, “Wasted his substance with riotous living.” —
          Again, a black mark seems to be set on such in Scripture, as in 1
          Thes. 5:5-7, “Ye are all the children of light, and the children of
          the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us
          not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that
          sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the
          night.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of you that have lately set up this practice of frolicking and
          jollity, profess to be children of the light and of the day; and not
          to be the children of darkness. Therefore walk as in the day; and do
          not those works of darkness, that are commonly done at unseasonable
          hours of the night. Such things are not only condemned by the apostle,
          but are looked upon as infamous in all ages among sober people, as all
          past writings manifest. Therefore it is a thing of bad report, and so
          forbidden. Phil. 4:8, “Whatsoever things are of good report; if there
          be any virtue — any praise, think on these things.”
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECTION. But the wise man allows of this practice, when he says,
          Ecc. 3:4, “There is a time to mourn and a time to dance.”
        </p>
        <p>
          ANSWER. This is nothing to the purpose; for the utmost that any can
          pretend that it proves, is that it may be used under some
          circumstances; but not at all, that dancing and other things used by
          our young people in their frolics are lawful, in those circumstances:
          any more than what is said in the same chapter, verse 3. — “there is a
          time to kill,” proves that it is lawful for a man to commit murder. —
          To deny that dancing, under any circumstances, whatever, was lawful,
          would be absurd. For there was a religious dancing in the Jewish
          church, which was a way of expressing their spiritual mirth. So David
          danced before the Lord. And he calls upon others to praise God in the
          dance. So there may be other circumstances wherein dancing may not be
          unlawful. But all this makes nothing to the present purpose; to prove
          that this particular custom is not of a bad tendency. Besides, when
          the wise man says, “there is a time to dance” that does not prove,
          that the dead of the night is the time for it. The same wise man doth
          not justify carnal mirth, but condemns it. Ecc. 2:2, “I said of
          laughter, it is mad; and of mirth, what doth it?”
        </p>
        <p>
          OBJECTION. If we avoid all such things, it will be the way for our
          young people to be ignorant how to behave themselves in company.
        </p>
        <p>
          ANSWER. But consider what this objection comes to. It certainly comes
          to this, viz. that the pouring out of the Spirit of God upon a people,
          tends to banish all good conduct, good breeding, and decent behavior
          from among them; and to sink them down into clownishness and
          barbarity! The Spirit of God did actually put an end to this practice
          among us. — But who is not ashamed to make such an objection? Will any
          of our young converts talk thus? Will you, that think you were
          converted by the late pouring out of the Spirit of God, and are made
          holy persons, heirs of eternal life, talk so blasphemously of it?
        </p>
        <p>
          If our young people are resolute still to go on notwithstanding all
          that has been said, I hope that those of them who call themselves
          converted, will first find out some rational, satisfying answer to the
          arguments that have been used against it. This at least may be
          reasonably expected of them, seeing they make such a profession. You
          have this day been partaking of the sacrament of the Lord’s supper,
          and therein solemnly renewed your profession. — If after such light
          set before you, and such mercy given, you will go on, be it known to
          you, that your eating now, and at other times, will prove only an
          eating and drinking judgment to yourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I desire heads of families, if they have any government over their
          children, or any command of their own houses, would not tolerate their
          children in such practices, nor suffer such conventions in their
          houses. — I do not desire that young people should be abridged of any
          lawful and proper liberties. But this custom can be of no benefit or
          service in the world. It tends only to mischief. — Satan doubtless
          would be glad to have such an interest amongst us as he used to have;
          and is therefore striving to steal in, while we are sleeping. But let
          us rouse up ourselves, in vigorously oppose his encroachments. I shall
          repeat those words of the apostle, Rom. 13:12-14, and leave them to
          the serious consideration of all persons, old and young. “The night is
          far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off the works of
          darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly
          as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and
          wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus
          Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts
          thereof.”
