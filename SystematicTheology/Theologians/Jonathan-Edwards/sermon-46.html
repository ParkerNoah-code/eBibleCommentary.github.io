        <p>Ezekiel 19:12, “Her strong rods were broken and withered.”</p>
        <p>
          IN order to a right understanding and improvement of these words,
          these four things must be observed concerning them.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Who she is that is here represented as having had strong rods, viz.
          the Jewish community, who here, as often elsewhere, is called the
          people’s mother. She is here compared to a vine planted in a very
          fruitful soil, verse 10. The Jewish church and state is often
          elsewhere compared to a vine; as in Psa. 80:8, etc.; Isa. 5:2; Jer.
          2:21; Eze. 15, 17:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What is meant by her strong rods, viz. her wise, able, and well
          qualified magistrates or rulers. That the rulers or magistrates are
          intended is manifest by verse 11, “And she had strong rods for the
          scepters of them that bear rule.” And by rods that were strong, must
          be meant such rulers as were well qualified for magistracy, such as
          had great abilities and other qualifications fitting them for the
          business of rule. They were wont to choose a rod or staff of the
          strongest and hardest sort of wood that could be found, for the mace
          or scepter of a prince; such a one only being counted fit for that
          use; and this generally was overlaid with gold.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very remarkable that such a strong rod should grow out of a weak
          vine. But so it had been in Israel, through God’s extraordinary
          blessing, in times past. Though the nation is spoken of here, and
          frequently elsewhere, as weak and helpless in itself, and entirely
          dependent as a vine, the weakest of all trees, that cannot support
          itself by its own strength, and never stands but as it leans on or
          hangs by something else that is stronger than itself; yet God has
          caused many of her sons to be strong rods fit for scepters; he has
          raised up in Israel many able and excellent princes and magistrates,
          who had done worthily in their day.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It should be understood and observed what is meant by these strong
          rods being broken and withered, viz. these able and excellent rulers
          being removed by death. Men’s dying is often compared in Scripture to
          the withering of the growth of the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It should be observed after what manner the breaking and withering
          of these strong rods is here spoken of, viz. as a great and awful
          calamity, that God had brought upon that people. It is spoken of as
          one of the chief effects of God’s dreadful displeasure against them;
          “But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and
          the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and
          withered, the fire hath consumed them.” The great benefits she enjoyed
          while her strong rods remained, are represented in the preceding
          verse; “And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that bear
          rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches; and she
          appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.” And the
          terrible calamities that attended the breaking and withering of her
          strong rods, are represented in the two verses next following the
          text; “And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty
          ground. And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath
          devoured her fruit.” And in the conclusion in the next words, is very
          emphatically declared the worthiness of such a dispensation to be
          greatly lamented; “So that she hath no strong rod to be a scepter to
          rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.”
        </p>
        <p>
          That which I therefore observe from the words of the text, to be the
          subject of discourse at this time, is this, viz. When God by death
          removes from a people those in place of public authority and rule that
          have been as strong rods, it is an awful judgment of God on that
          people, and worthy of great lamentation.
        </p>
        <p>In discoursing on this proposition, I would:</p>
        <p>I. Show what kind of rulers may fitly be called strong rods.</p>
        <p>
          II. Show why the removal of such rulers from a people by death is to
          be looked upon as an awful judgment of God on that people, and is
          greatly to be lamented.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I would observe what qualifications of those who are in public
          authority and rule may properly give them the denomination of strong
          rods.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, one qualification of rulers whence they may properly be
          denominated strong rods, is a great ability for the management of
          public affairs. This is the case, when they who stand in a place of
          public authority are men of great natural abilities, men of uncommon
          strength of reason and largeness of understanding; especially when
          they have a remarkable genius for government, a peculiar turn of mind
          fitting them to gain an extraordinary understanding in things of that
          nature. They have ability, in an especial manner, for insight into the
          mysteries of government, and for discerning those things wherein the
          public welfare or calamity consists, and the proper means to avoid the
          one and promote the other. [It is] an extraordinary talent at
          distinguishing what is right and just, from that which is wrong and
          unequal, and to see through the false colors with which injustice is
          often disguised, and unravel the false and subtle arguments and
          cunning sophistry that is often made use of to defend iniquity. They
          have not only great natural abilities in these respects, but their
          abilities and talents have been improved by study, learning,
          observation, and experience. By these means, they have obtained great
          actual knowledge. They have acquired great skill in public affairs,
          and things requisite to be known in order to their wise, prudent, and
          effectual management. They have obtained a great understanding of men
          and things, a great knowledge of human nature, and of the way of
          accommodating themselves to it, so as most effectually to influence it
          to wise purposes. They have obtained a very extensive knowledge of men
          with whom they are concerned in the management of public affairs,
          either those who have a joint concern in government, or those who are
          to be governed; and they have also obtained a very full and particular
          understanding of the state and circumstances of the country or people
          of whom they have the care, and know well their laws and constitution,
          and what their circumstances require. Likewise, they have a great
          knowledge of the people of neighboring nations, states, or provinces,
          with whom they have occasion to be concerned in the management of
          public affairs committed to them. These things all contribute to
          render those who are in authority fit to be denominated “strong rods.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, when they have not only great understanding, but largeness of
          heart, and a greatness and nobleness of disposition, this is another
          qualification that belongs to the character of a “strong rod.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Those that are by Divine Providence set in a place of public authority
          and rule, are called “gods, and sons of the Most High,” Psa. 82:6. And
          therefore it is peculiarly unbecoming them to be of a mean spirit, a
          disposition that will admit of their doing those things that are
          sordid and vile; as when they are persons of a narrow, private spirit,
          that may be found in little tricks and intrigues to promote their
          private interest. Such will shamefully defile their hands to gain a
          few pounds, are not ashamed to grind the faces of the poor, and screw
          their neighbors; and will take advantage of their authority or
          commission to line their pockets with what is fraudulently taken or
          withheld from others. When a man in authority is of such a mean
          spirit, it weakens his authority, and makes him justly contemptible in
          the eyes of men, and is utterly inconsistent with his being a strong
          rod.
        </p>
        <p>
          But on the contrary, it greatly establishes his authority, and causes
          others to stand in awe of him, when they see him to be a man of
          greatness of mind, one that abhors those things that are mean and
          sordid, and not capable of a compliance with them: one that is of a
          public spirit, and not of a private narrow disposition; a man of
          honor, and not of mean artifice and clandestine management, for filthy
          lucre; one that abhors trifling and impertinence, or to waste away his
          time, that should be spent in the service of God, his king, and his
          country, in vain amusements and diversions, and in the pursuit of the
          gratifications of sensual appetites. God charges the rulers in Israel,
          that pretended to be their great and mighty men, with being mighty to
          drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink. There does not
          seem to be any reference to their being men of strong heads, and able
          to bear a great deal of strong drink, as some have supposed. There is
          a severe sarcasm in the words; for the prophet is speaking of the
          great men, princes, and judges in Israel (as appears by the verse next
          following), which should be mighty men, strong rods, men of eminent
          qualifications, excelling in nobleness of spirit, of glorious strength
          and fortitude of mind. But instead of that, they were mighty or
          eminent for nothing but gluttony and drunkenness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, when those that are in authority are endowed with much of a
          spirit of government, this is another thing that entitles them to the
          denomination of “strong rods.” They not only are men of great
          understanding and wisdom in affairs that appertain to government, but
          have also a peculiar talent at using their knowledge, and exerting
          themselves in this great and important business, according to their
          great understanding in it. They are men of eminent fortitude, are not
          afraid of the faces of men, and are not afraid to do the part that
          properly belongs to them as rulers, though they meet with great
          opposition, and the spirits of men are greatly irritated by it. They
          have a spirit of resolution and activity, so as to keep the wheels of
          government in proper motion, and to cause judgment and justice to run
          down as a mighty stream. They have not only a great knowledge of
          government, and the things that belong to it in theory, but it is, as
          it were, natural to them to apply the various powers and faculties
          with which God has endowed them, and the knowledge they have obtained
          by study and observation, to that business, so as to perform it most
          advantageously and effectually.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, stability and firmness of integrity, fidelity, and piety, in
          the exercise of authority, is another thing that greatly contributes
          to, and is very essential in, the character of a “strong rod.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He is not only a man of strong reason and great discerning to know
          what is just, but is a man of strict integrity and righteousness, firm
          and immovable in the execution of justice and judgment. He is not only
          a man of great ability to bear down vice and immorality, but has a
          disposition agreeable to such ability. He is one that has a strong
          aversion to wickedness, and is disposed to use the power God has put
          into his hands to suppress it. He is one that not only opposes vice by
          his authority, but by his example. He is one of inflexible fidelity,
          who will be faithful to God whose minister he is, to his people for
          good, and who is immovable in his regard to his supreme authority, his
          commands and his glory; and will be faithful to his king and country.
          He will not be induced by the many temptations that attend the
          business of men in public authority, basely to betray his trust; will
          not consent to do what he thinks not to be for the public good, for
          his own gain or advancement, or any private interest. He is well
          principled, and firm in acting agreeably to his principles, and will
          not be prevailed with to do otherwise through fear of favor, to follow
          a multitude, or to maintain his interest in any on whom he depends for
          the honor or profit of his place, whether it be prince or people; and
          is also one of that strength of mind, whereby he rules his own spirit.
          These things very eminently contribute to a ruler’s title to the
          denomination of a “strong rod.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, and lastly, it also contributes to that strength of a man in
          authority by which he may be denominated a “strong rod,” when he is in
          such circumstances as give him advantage for the exercise of his
          strength for the public good; as his being a person of honorable
          descent, of a distinguished education, a man of estate, one advanced
          in years, one that has long been in authority, so that it is become as
          it were natural for the people to pay him deference, to reverence him,
          to be influenced and governed by him, and to submit to his authority.
          And add to this, his being extensively known, and much honored and
          regarded abroad; his being one of a good presence, majesty of
          countenance, decency of behavior, becoming one of authority; of
          forcible speech, etc. These things add to his strength, and increase
          his ability and advantage to serve his generation in the place of a
          ruler, and therefore serve to render him one that is the more fitly
          and eminently called a “strong rod.” — I now proceed,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. To show that when such strong rods are broken and withered by
          death, it is an awful judgment of God on the people who are deprived
          of them, and worthy of great lamentation. — And that on two accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, by reason of the many positive benefits and blessings to a
          people that such rulers are the instrument of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost all the prosperity of a public society and civil community
          does, under God, depend on their rulers. They are like the main
          springs or wheels in a machine, that keep every part in its due
          motion, and are in the body politic, as the vitals in the body
          natural, and as the pillars and foundation in a building. Civil rules
          are called “the foundations of the earth.” Psa. 82, and 11:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prosperity of a people depends more on their rulers than is
          commonly imagined. As they have the public society under the care and
          power, so they have advantage to promote the public interest every
          way. And if they are such rulers as have been described, they are some
          of the greatest blessings to the public. Their influence has a
          tendency to promote wealth, and cause temporal possessions and
          blessings to abound; and to promote virtue amongst them, and so to
          unite them one to another in peace and mutual benevolence, and make
          them happy in society, each one the instrument of his neighbors’
          quietness, comfort, and prosperity; and by these means to advance
          their reputation and honor in the world; and which is much more, to
          promote their spiritual and eternal happiness. Therefore, the wise man
          says, Ecc. 10:17, “Blessed art thou, O land, when they king is the son
          of nobles.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a remarkable instance and evidence of the happy and great
          influence of such a strong rod as had been described, to promote the
          universal prosperity of a people, in the history of the reign of
          Solomon, though many of the people were uneasy under his government,
          and thought him too rigorous in his administrations, see 1 Kin. 12:4.
          “Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his
          fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.” 1 Kin.
          4:25. “And he made silver to be among them as stones for abundance.”
          Chap. 10:27. “And Judah and Israel were many, eating and drinking and
          making merry.” 1 Kin. 4:20. The queen of Sheba admired, and was
          greatly affected with, the happiness of the people, under the
          government of such a strong rod. 1 Kin. 10:8, 9, “Happy are the men
          (says she), happy are these thy servants which stand continually
          before thee, and that hear thy wisdom. Blessed be the Lord thy God
          which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel; because
          the Lord loved Israel forever, therefore made he thee king, to do
          judgment and justice.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The flourishing state of the kingdom of Judah, while they had strong
          rods for the scepters of them that bare rule, is taken notice of in
          our context; “her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and
          she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Such rulers are eminently the ministers of God to his people for good.
          They are great gifts of the Most High to a people, blessed tokens of
          his favor, and vehicles of his goodness to them; and therein are
          images of his own Son, the grand medium of all God’s goodness to
          fallen mankind. Therefore, all of them are called, sons of the Most
          High. All civil rulers, if they are as they ought to be, such strong
          rods as have been described, will be like the Son of the Most High,
          vehicles of good to mankind, and like him, will be as the light of the
          morning when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds, as the
          tender grass springing out of the earth, by clear shining after rain.
          And therefore, when a people are bereaved of them, they sustain an
          unspeakable loss, and are the subjects of a judgment of God that is
          greatly to be lamented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, on account of the great calamities such rulers are a defense
          from. Innumerable are the grievous and fatal calamities which public
          societies are exposed to in this evil world, from which they can have
          no defense without order and authority. If a people are without
          government, they are like a city broken down and without walls,
          encompassed on every side by enemies, and become unavoidably subject
          to all manner of confusion and misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Government is necessary to defend communities from miseries from
          within themselves; from the prevalence of intestine discord, mutual
          injustice, and violence. The members of the society continually making
          a prey one of another, without any defense from each other. Rulers are
          the heads of union in public societies, that hold the parts together;
          without which nothing else is to be expected than that the members of
          the society will be continually divided against themselves, everyone
          acting the part of an enemy to his neighbor, everyone’s hand against
          every man, and every man’s hand against him; going on in remediless
          and endless broils and jarring, until the society be utterly dissolved
          and broken in pieces, and life itself, in the neighborhood of our
          fellow-creatures, becomes miserable and intolerable.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may see the need of government in societies by what is visible in
          families, those lesser societies, of which all public societies are
          constituted. How miserable would these little societies be, if all
          were left to themselves, without any authority or superiority in one
          above another, or any head of union and influence among them? We may
          be convinced by what we see of the lamentable consequences of the want
          of a proper exercise of authority and maintenance of government in
          families, which yet are not absolutely without all authority. No less
          need is there of government in public societies, but much more, as
          they are larger. A very few may possibly, without any government, act
          by concert, so as to concur in what shall be for the welfare of the
          whole; but this is not to be expected among a multitude, constituted
          of many thousands, of a great variety of tempers and different
          interests.
        </p>

          As government is absolutely necessary, so there is a necessity of
          strong rods in order to it: the business being such as requires
          persons so qualified; no other being sufficient for, or well capable
          of, the government of public societies: and therefore, those public
          societies are miserable that have not such strong rods for scepters to
          rule, Ecc. 10:16, “Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As government, and strong rods for the exercise of it, are necessary
          to preserve public societies from dreadful and fatal calamities
          arising from among themselves; so no less requisite are they to defend
          the community from foreign enemies. As they are like the pillars of a
          building, so they are also like the walls and bulwarks of a city. They
          are, under God, the main strength of a people in the time of war, and
          the chief instruments of their preservation, safety, and rest. This is
          signified in a very lively manner in the words that are used by the
          Jewish community in her lamentations, to express the expectations she
          had from her princes, Lam. 4:20, “The breath of our nostrils, the
          anointed of the Lord, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under
          his shadow we shall live among the heathen.” In this respect also such
          strong rods are sons of the Most High, and images or resemblances of
          the Son of God, viz. as they are their saviors from their enemies; as
          the judges that God raised up of old in Israel are called, Neh. 9:27,
          “Therefore thou deliverest them into the hand of their enemies, who
          vexed them: and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto
          thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to they manifold
          mercies, thou gavest them saviors, who saved them out of the hand of
          their enemies.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus both the prosperity and safety of a people under God, depends on
          such rulers as are strong rods. While they enjoy such blessings, they
          are wont to be like a vine planted in a fruitful soil, with her
          stature exalted among the thick branches, appearing in her height with
          the multitude of her branches; but when they have no strong rod to be
          a scepter to rule, they are like a vine planted in a wilderness that
          is exposed to be plucked up, and cast down to the ground, to have her
          fruit dried up with the east wind, and to have fire coming out of her
          own branches to devour her fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          On these accounts, when a people’s strong rods are broken and
          withered, it is an awful judgment of God on that people, and worthy of
          great lamentation: as when king Josiah (who was doubtless one of the
          strong rods referred to in the text) was dead, the people made great
          lamentation for him. 2 Chr. 35:24, 25, “And they brought him to
          Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchers of his
          fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. And Jeremiah
          lamented for Josiah: and all the singing-men and the singing-women
          spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an
          ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the
          lamentations.”
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          I come now to apply these things to our own case, under the late awful
          frown of Divine Providence upon us, in removing by death that
          honorable person in public rule and authority, an inhabitant of his
          town, and belonging to this congregation and church, who died at
          Boston the last Lord’s day.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was eminently a strong rod in the forementioned respects. As to his
          natural abilities, strength of reason, greatness and clearness of
          discerning, and depth of penetration, he was one of the first rank. It
          may be doubted whether he has left his superior in these respects in
          these parts of the world. He was a man of a truly great genius, and
          his genius was peculiarly fitted for the understanding and managing of
          public affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as his natural capacity was great, so was the knowledge that he
          had acquired, his understanding being greatly improved by close
          application of mind to those things he was called to be concerned in,
          and by a very exact observation of them, and long experience in them.
          He had indeed a great insight into the nature of public societies, the
          mysteries of government, and the affairs of peace and war. He had a
          discernment that very few have of those things wherein the public weal
          consists, and what those things are that expose public societies; and
          of the proper means to avoid the latter, and promote the former. He
          was quick in his discerning, in that in most cases, especially such as
          belonged to his proper business, he at first sight would see further
          than most men when they had done their best. But yet he had a
          wonderful faculty of improving his own thoughts by meditation, and
          carrying his views a greater and greater length by long and close
          application of mind. He had an extraordinary ability to distinguish
          right and wrong, in the midst of intricacies, and circumstances that
          tended to perplex and darken the case. He was able to weigh things as
          it were in a balance, and to distinguish those things that were solid
          and weighty from those that had only a fair show without substance;
          which he evidently discovered in his accurate, clear, and plain way of
          stating and committing causes to a jury, from the bench, as by others
          hath been observed. He wonderfully distinguished truth from falsehood,
          and the most labored cases seemed always to lie clear in his mind, his
          ideas being properly ranged. And he had a talent of communicating them
          to everyone’s understanding, beyond almost anyone. If any were
          misguided, it was not because truth and falsehood, right and wrong,
          were not well distinguished.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was probably one of the ablest politicians that ever New England
          bred. He had a very uncommon insight into human nature, and a
          marvelous ability to penetrate into the particular tempers and
          dispositions of such as he had to deal with, and to discern the
          fittest way of treating them, so as most effectually to influence them
          to any good and wise purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          And never perhaps was there a person that had a more extensive and
          thorough knowledge of the state of his land, and its public affairs,
          and of persons that were jointly concerned with him in them. He knew
          this people, and their circumstances, and what their circumstances
          required. He discerned the diseases of this body, and what were the
          proper remedies, as an able and masterly physician. He had a great
          acquaintance with the neighboring colonies, and also the nations on
          this continent, with whom we are concerned in our public affairs. He
          had a far greater knowledge than any other person in the land, of the
          several nations of Indians in these northern parts of America, their
          tempers, manners, and the proper way of treating them. [He] was more
          extensively known by them than any other person in the country. And no
          other person in authority in this province had such an acquaintance
          with the people and country of Canada, the land of our enemies, as he
          had.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was exceeding far from a disposition and forwardness to intermeddle
          with other people’s business. But as to what belonged to his proper
          business, in the office he sustained, and the important affairs of
          which he had the care, he had a great understanding of what belonged
          to them. I have often been surprised at the length of his reach, and
          what I have seen of his ability to foresee and determine the
          consequences of things, even at a great distance, and quite beyond the
          sight of other men. He was not wavering and unsteady in his opinion.
          His manner was never to pass a judgment rashly, but was wont first
          thoroughly to deliberate and weigh an affair; and in this,
          notwithstanding his great abilities, he was glad to improve by the
          help of conversation and discourse with others (and often spake of the
          great advantage he found by it), but when, on mature consideration, he
          had settled his judgment, he was not easily turned from it by false
          colors, and plausible pretenses and appearances.
        </p>
        <p>
          And besides his knowledge of things belonging to his particular
          calling as a ruler, he had also a great degree of understanding in
          things belonging to his general calling as a Christian. He was no
          inconsiderable divine. He was a wise casuist, as I know by the great
          help I have found from time to time by his judgment and advice in
          cases of conscience, wherein I have consulted him. And indeed I scarce
          knew the divine that I ever found more able to help and enlighten the
          mind in such cases than he. And he had no small degree of knowledge in
          things pertaining to experimental religion. But was wont to discourse
          on such subjects, not only with accurate doctrinal distinctions, but
          as one intimately and feelingly acquainted with these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was not only great in speculative knowledge, but his knowledge was
          practical; such as tended to a wise conduct in the affairs, business,
          and duties of life; so as properly to have the denomination of wisdom,
          and so as properly and eminently to invest him with the character of a
          wise man. And he was not only eminently wise and prudent in his own
          conduct, but was one of the ablest and wisest counselors of others in
          any difficult affair.
        </p>
        <p>
          The greatness and honorableness of his disposition was answerable to
          the largeness of his understanding. He was naturally of a great mind;
          in this respect he was truly the son of nobles. He greatly abhorred
          things which were mean and sordid, and seemed to be incapable of a
          compliance with them. How far was he from trifling and impertinence in
          his conversation! How far from a busy, meddling disposition! How far
          from any sly and clandestine management to fill his pockets with what
          was fraudulently withheld, or violently squeezed, from the laborer,
          soldier, or inferior officer! How far from taking advantage from his
          commission or authority, or any superior power he had in his hands; or
          the ignorance, dependence, or necessities of others; to add to his own
          gains with what properly belonged to them, and with what they might
          justly expect as a proper reward for any of their services! How far
          was he from secretly taking bribes offered to induce him to favor any
          man in his cause, or by his power or interest to promote his being
          advanced to any place of public trust, honor, or profit! How greatly
          did he abhor lying and prevarication! And how immovably steadfast was
          he to exact truth! His hatred of those things that were mean and
          sordid was so apparent and well known, that it was evident that men
          dreaded to appear in anything of that nature in his presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was a man of a remarkably public spirit, a true lover of his
          country, and who greatly abhorred sacrificing the public welfare to
          private interest. — He was very eminently endowed with a spirit of
          government. The God of nature seemed to have formed him for
          government, as though he had been made on purpose, and cast into a
          mold, by which he should be every way fitted for the business of a man
          in public authority. Such a behavior and conduct was natural to him,
          as tended to maintain his authority, and possess others with awe and
          reverence, and to enforce and render effectual what he said and did in
          the exercise of his authority. He did not bear the sword in vain. He
          was truly a terror to evildoers. What I saw in him often put me in
          mind of that saying of the wise man. Pro. 20:8, “The king that sitteth
          in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.” He
          was one that was not afraid of the faces of men; and everyone knew
          that it was in vain to attempt to deter him from doing what, on mature
          consideration, he had determined he ought to do. — Everything in him
          was great, and becoming a man in his public station. Perhaps never was
          there a man that appeared in New England to whom the denomination of a
          great man did more properly belong.
        </p>
        <p>
          But though he was one that was great among men, exalted above others
          in abilities and greatness of mind, and in the place of rule, and
          feared not the faces of men, yet he feared God. He was strictly
          conscientious in his conduct, both in public and private. I never knew
          the man that seemed more steadfastly and immovably to act by
          principle, and according to rules and maxims, established and settled
          in his mind by the dictates of his judgment and conscience. He was a
          man of strict justice and fidelity. Faithfulness was eminently his
          character. Some of his greatest opponents that have been of the
          contrary party to him in public affairs, yet have openly acknowledged
          this of him, that he was a faithful man. He was remarkably faithful in
          his public trusts. He would not basely betray his trust, from fear or
          favor. It was in vain to expect it. However men might oppose him or
          neglect him, and how great soever they were: nor would he neglect the
          public interest committed to him, for the sake of his own ease, but
          diligently and laboriously watched and labored for it night and day.
          And he was faithful in private affairs as well as public. He was a
          most faithful friend; faithful to anyone that in any case asked his
          counsel. His fidelity might be depended upon in whatever affair he
          undertook for any of his neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was a noted instance of the virtue of temperance, unalterable in
          it, in all places, in all companies, and in the midst of all
          temptations. Though he was a man of great spirit, yet he had a
          remarkable government of his spirit; and excelled in the government of
          his tongue. In the midst of all provocations from multitudes he had to
          deal with, and the great multiplicity of perplexing affairs in which
          he was concerned, and all the opposition and reproaches of which he
          was at any time the subject; yet what was there that ever proceeded
          out of his mouth that his enemies could lay hold of? [He had] no
          profane language, no vain, rash, unseemly, and unchristian speeches.
          If at any time he expressed himself with great warmth and vigor, it
          seemed to be from principle and determination of judgment, rather than
          from passion. When he expressed himself strongly, and with vehemence,
          those that were acquainted with him, and well observed him from time
          to time, might evidently see it was done in consequence of thought and
          judgment, weighing the circumstances and consequences of things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The calmness and steadiness of his behavior in private, particularly
          in his family, appeared remarkable and exemplary to those who had most
          opportunity to observe. He was thoroughly established in those
          religious principles and doctrines of the first fathers of New
          England, usually called the doctrines of grace, and had a great
          detestation of the opposite errors of the present fashionable
          divinity, as very contrary to the Word of God, and the experience of
          every true Christian. And as he was a friend to truth, so he was a
          friend to vital piety and the power of godliness, and ever
          countenanced and favored it on all occasions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He abhorred profaneness, and was a person of a serious and decent
          spirit, and ever treated sacred things with reverence. He was
          exemplary for his decent attendance on the public worship of God. Who
          ever saw him irreverently and indecently lolling, and laying down his
          head to sleep, or gazing about the meetinghouse in time of divine
          service? And as he was able (as was before observed) to discourse very
          understandingly of experimental religion, so to some persons with whom
          he was very intimate, he gave intimations sufficiently plain, while
          conversing of these things, that they were matters of his own
          experience. And some serious persons in civil authority, who have
          ordinarily differed from him in matters of government, yet on some
          occasional close conversation with him on things of religion, have
          manifested a high opinion of him as to real experimental piety.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he was known to be a serious person, and an enemy to a profane or
          vain conversation, so he was feared on that account by great and
          small. When he was in the room, only his presence was sufficient to
          maintain decency; though many were there accounted great men, who
          otherwise were disposed to take a much greater freedom in their talk
          and behavior, than they dared to do in his presence. He was not
          unmindful of death, nor insensible of his own frailty, nor did death
          come unexpected to him. For some years past, he has spoken much to
          some persons of dying, and going into the eternal world, signifying
          that he did not expect to continue long here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Added to all these things, to render him eminently a strong rod, he
          was attended with many circumstances which tended to give him
          advantage for the exerting of his strength for the public good. He was
          honorably descended, was a man of considerable substance, had been
          long in authority, was extensively known and honored abroad, was high
          in the esteem of the many tribes of Indians in the neighborhood of the
          British colonies, and so had great influence upon them above any other
          man in New England. God had endowed him with a comely presence, and
          majesty of countenance, becoming the great qualities of his mind, and
          the place in which God had set him.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the exercise of these qualities and endowments, under these
          advantages, he has been as it were a father to this part of the land,
          on whom the whole country had, under God, its dependence in all its
          public affairs, and especially since the beginning of the present war.
          How much the weight of all the warlike concerns of the country (which
          above any part of the land lies exposed to the enemy) has lain on his
          shoulders, and how he has been the spring of all motion, and the doer
          of everything that has been done, and how wisely and faithfully he has
          conducted these affairs, I need not inform this congregation. You well
          know that he took care of the country as a father of a family of
          children, not neglecting men’s lives, and making light of their blood;
          but with great diligence, vigilance, and prudence, applying himself
          continually to the proper means of our safety and welfare. And
          especially has this, his native town, where he has dwelt from his
          infancy, reaped the benefit of his happy influence. His wisdom has
          been, under God, very much our guide, and his authority our support
          and strength, and he has been a great honor to Northampton, and
          ornament to our church. He continued in full capacity of usefulness
          while he lived. He was indeed considerably advanced in years, but his
          powers of mind were not sensibly abated, and his strength of body was
          not so impaired, but that he was able to go long journeys, in extreme
          heat and cold, and in a short time.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now this “strong rod is broken and withered,” and surely the
          judgment of God therein is very awful, and the dispensation that which
          may well be for a lamentation. Probably we shall be more sensible of
          the worth and importance of such a strong rod by the want of it. The
          awful voice of God in this providence is worthy to be attended to by
          this whole province, and especially by the people of this county, but
          in a more peculiar manner by us of this town. We have now this
          testimony of the divine displeasure, added to all the other dark
          clouds God has lately brought over us, and his awful frowns upon us.
          It is a dispensation, on many accounts, greatly calling for our
          humiliation and fear before God; an awful manifestation of his
          supreme, universal, and absolute dominion, calling us to adore the
          divine sovereignty, and tremble at the presence of this great God. And
          it is a lively instance of human frailty and mortality. We see how
          that none are out of the reach of death, that no greatness, no
          authority, no wisdom and sagacity, no honorableness of person or
          station, no degree of valuableness and importance, exempts from the
          stroke of death. This is therefore a loud and solemn warning to all
          sorts to prepare for their departure hence.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the memory of this person who is now gone, who was made so great a
          blessing while he lived, should engage us to show respect and kindness
          to his family. This we should do both out of respect to him and to his
          father, your former eminent pastor, who in his day was in a remarkable
          manner a father to this part of the land in spirituals, and especially
          to this town, as this his son has been in temporals. God greatly
          resented it, when the children of Israel did not show kindness to the
          house of Jerubbaal that had been made an instrument of so much good to
          them. Jdg. 8:35, “Neither showed they kindness to the house of
          Jerubbaal, according to all the good which he had showed unto Israel.”
