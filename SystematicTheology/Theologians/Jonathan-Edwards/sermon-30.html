        <h2>Men Naturally Are God’s Enemies – Romans 5:10</h2>
        <p class="title">Dated August, 1736.</p>
        <p>
          Romans 5:10, “For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
          by the death of his Son.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THE apostle, from the beginning of the epistle, to the beginning of
          this chapter, had insisted on the doctrine of justification by faith
          alone. In this chapter he goes on to consider the benefits that are
          consequent on justification, viz. Peace with God, present happiness,
          and hope of glory. Peace with God is mentioned in the first verse,
          “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through
          our Lord Jesus Christ.” In the following verses he speaks of present
          blessedness, and hope of glory, “By whom also we have access by faith
          into this grace, wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of
          God.” — And concerning this benefit, the hope of glory, the apostle
          particularly takes notice of two things, viz. the blessed nature of
          this hope, and the sure ground of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. He insists on the blessed nature of this hope, in that in enables
          us to glory in tribulations. This excellent nature of true Christian
          hope is described in the following words (verses 3-5), “And not only
          so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation
          worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope; and
          hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our
          hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.” As if he had said,
          through hope of a blessed reward, that will abundantly more than make
          up for all tribulation, we are enabled to bear tribulation with
          patience; patiently bearing, and patiently waiting for the reward. And
          patience works experience; for when we thus bear tribulation with
          patient waiting for the reward, this brings experience of the earnest
          of the reward, viz. the earnest of the Spirit, in our feeling the love
          of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. So that our hope
          does not make us ashamed: it is not disappointed; for in the midst of
          our tribulation, we experience those blessed incomes of the Spirit in
          our souls, that make even a time of tribulation sweet to us; and is
          such an earnest abundantly confirms our hope; and so experience works
          hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The apostle takes notice of the sure ground there is for this
          hope; or the abundant evidence we have, that we shall obtain the glory
          hoped for, in that peace we have with God, by our justification
          through Christ’s blood. For while we were without strength, in due
          time Christ died for us; even while we were ungodly and sinners,
          enemies to God and Christ (See verses 6-10). The apostle’s argument is
          exceeding clear and strong. If God has done already so great a thing
          for us, as to give us Christ to die and shed his precious blood for
          us, which was vastly the greatest thing, we need not doubt but that he
          will bestow life upon us. It is but a small thing for God actually to
          bestow eternal life, after it is purchased; to what it is for him to
          give his own Son to die, in order to purchase it. The giving Christ to
          purchase it, was virtually all. It included the whole grace of God in
          salvation. When Christ had purchased salvation at such a dear rate,
          all the difficulty was got through, all was virtually over and done.
          It is a small thing, in comparison, for God to bestow salvation, after
          it has been thus purchased at a full price. Sinners who are justified
          by the death of Christ, are already virtually saved. The thing is, as
          it were, done. What remains is no more than the necessary consequence
          of what is done. Christ when he died made an end of sin. And when he
          rose from the dead, he did virtually rise with the elect. He brought
          them up from death with him, and ascended into heaven with them. And
          therefore, when this is already done, and we are thus reconciled to
          God through the death of his Son, we need not fear but that we shall
          be saved by his life. The love of God appears much more in his giving
          his Son to die for sinners, that in giving eternal life after Christ’s
          death.
        </p>
        <p>
          The giving of Christ to die for us is here spoken of as a much greater
          thing, than the actual bestowment of life; because this is all that
          has any difficulty in it. — When God did this for us, he did it for us
          as sinners and enemies. But in actually bestowing salvation on us
          after we are justified, we are not looked upon as sinners, but as
          perfectly righteous persons. He beholds no iniquity in us. We are no
          more enemies, but reconciled. When God gave Christ to die for the
          elect, he looked on them as they are in themselves; but in actually
          bestowing eternal life, he looks on them as they are in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three epithets used in the text and context, as appertaining
          to sinners as they are in themselves, verse 6-8.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are without strength, they cannot help themselves. — They are
          ungodly or sinners, — and they are enemies. As in the text. — NATURAL
          MEN ARE GOD’S ENEMIES.
        </p>
        <p>
          God, though the Creator of all things, yet has some enemies in the
          world. — Men in general will own that they are sinners. There are few,
          if any, whose consciences are so blinded as not to be sensible [that]
          they have been guilty of sin. And most sinners will own that they have
          bad hearts. They will own that they do not love God so much as they
          should do; that they are not so thankful as they ought to be for
          mercies; and that in many things they fail. And yet few of them are
          sensible that they are God’s enemies. They do not see how they can be
          truly so called; for they are not sensible that they wish God any
          hurt, or endeavor to do him any.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we see that the Scripture speaks of them as enemies to God. So in
          our text, and elsewhere, “And you that were sometime alienated, and
          enemies in your minds by wicked works,” Col. 1:21. “The carnal mind is
          enmity against God,” Rom. 8:7. — And that all natural or unregenerate
          men are indeed such, is what I shall endeavor now particularly to
          show. Which I propose to do in the following method. Particularly — In
          what respects they are enemies to God — To how great a degree they are
          enemies — And why they are enemies. Then I shall answer some
          objections.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>In what respects natural men are God’s enemies.</p>
        <p>
          1. THEIR enmity appears in their judgments, their natural relish,
          their wills, affections, and practice. They have a very mean esteem of
          God. Men are ready to entertain a good esteem of those with whom they
          are friends. They are apt to think highly of their qualities, to give
          them their due praises; and if there be defects, to cover them. But of
          those to whom they are enemies, they are disposed to have mean
          thoughts. They are apt to entertain a dishonorable opinion of them.
          They will be ready to look contemptibly upon anything that is
          praiseworthy in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it is with natural men towards God. They entertain very low and
          contemptible thoughts of God. Whatever honor and respect they may
          pretend, and make a show of towards God, if their practice be
          examined, it will show, that they certainly look upon him as a Being
          that is but little to be regarded. The language of their hearts is,
          “Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice?” Exo. 5:2. “What is
          the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have
          if we pray unto him?” Job 21:15. They count him worthy neither to be
          loved nor feared. They dare not behave with that slight and disregard
          towards one of their fellow-creatures, when a little raised above them
          in power and authority, as they dare, and do, towards God. They value
          one of their equals much more than God, and are ten times more afraid
          of offending such, than of displeasing the God that made them. They
          cast such exceeding contempt on God, as to prefer every vile lust
          before him. And every worldly enjoyment is set higher in their esteem
          than God. A morsel of meat, or a few pence of worldly gain, is
          preferred before him. God is set last and lowest in the esteem of
          natural men.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They are enemies in the natural relish of their souls. They have an
          inbred distaste and disrelish of God’s perfections. God is not such a
          being as they would have. Though they are ignorant of God; yet from
          what they hear they of him, and from what is manifest by the light of
          nature, they do not like him. By his being endowed with such
          attributes as he is, they have an aversion to him. They hear God is an
          infinitely holy, pure, and righteous Being, and they do not like him
          upon this account; they have no relish of such qualifications. They
          take no delight in contemplating them. It would be a mere task, a
          bondage to a natural man, to be obliged to set himself to contemplate
          those attributes of God. They see no manner of beauty or loveliness,
          nor taste any sweetness, in them. And on account of their distaste of
          these perfections, they dislike all his other attributes. They have
          greater aversion to him because he is omniscient and knows all things;
          and because his omniscience is a holy omniscience. They are not
          pleased that he is omnipotent, and can do whatever he pleases; because
          it is a holy omnipotence. They are enemies even to his mercy, because
          it is a holy mercy. They do not like his immutability, because by this
          he never will be otherwise than he is, an infinitely holy God.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is from this disrelish that natural men have of the attributes of
          God, that they do not love to have much to do with God. The natural
          tendency of the heart of man is to fly from God, and keep at a
          distance from him, as far off as possible. — A natural man is averse
          to communion with God, and is naturally disinclined to those exercises
          of religion, wherein he has immediately to do with him. It is said of
          wicked men, Psa. 10:4, “God is not in all their thoughts.” It is
          evident, that the mind of man is naturally averse to thinking about
          God. And hence if any thoughts of him be suggested to the mind, they
          soon go away. Such thoughts are not apt to rest in the minds of
          natural men. If anything is said to them of God, they are apt to
          forget it. It is like seed that falls upon the hard path, the fowls of
          the air soon take it away: or like seed that falls upon a rock. Other
          things will stick; but divine things rebound. And if they were cast
          into the mind, they meet with that there which soon thrusts them out
          again. They meet with no suitable entertainment, but are soon chased
          away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence also it is, that natural men are with difficulty persuaded to be
          constant in the duty of secret prayer. They would not be so averse to
          spending a quarter of an hour, night and morning, in some bodily
          labor; but it is because they are averse to a work, wherein they have
          so immediately to do with God; and they naturally love to keep at a
          distance from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Their wills are contrary to his will. God’s will and theirs are
          exceeding cross the one to the other. God wills those things that they
          hate, and are most averse to; and they will those things that God
          hates. Hence they oppose God in their wills. There is a dreadful,
          violent, and obstinate opposition, of the will of natural men to the
          will of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are very opposite to the commands of God. It is from the enmity
          of the will (Rom. 8:7), that “the carnal mind is not subject to the
          law of God, neither indeed can be.” Hence natural men are enemies to
          God’s government. They are not loyal subjects, but enemies to God,
          considered as Lord of the world. They are entire enemies to God’s
          authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. They are enemies to God in their affections. There is in every
          natural man a seed of malice against God. And it often dreadfully
          breaks forth. Though it may in great measure lie hid in secure times,
          when God lets men alone, and they meet with no great disturbance of
          body or mind; yet, if God does but touch men in their consciences, by
          manifesting to them a little of his wrath for their sins, this
          oftentimes brings out the principle of malice against him. This is
          exercised in dreadful heart-risings, inward wranglings and
          quarrelings, and blasphemous thoughts; wherein the heart is like a
          viper, hissing and spitting poison at God. And however free from it
          the heart may seem to be, when let alone and secure, yet a very little
          thing will set it in a rage. Temptations will show what is in the
          heart. The alteration of a man’s circumstances will often discover the
          heart. Pharaoh had no more natural enmity against God than other men;
          and if other natural men had been in Pharaoh’s circumstances, the same
          corruptions would have put forth themselves in as dreadful a manner.
          The scribes and Pharisees had naturally no more malice in their hearts
          against Christ than other men, and other natural men would, in their
          case, and having as little restraint, exercise as much malice against
          Christ as they did. When wicked men come to be cast into hell, then
          their malice against God will appear. Then their hearts will appear as
          full of malice, as hell is full of fire. But when wicked men come to
          be in hell, there will be no new corruptions put into their heart; but
          only old ones will then break forth without restraint. That is all the
          difference between a wicked man on earth, and a wicked man in hell,
          that in hell there will be more to stir up the exercise of corruption,
          and less to restrain it, than on earth. But there will be no new
          corruption put in. A wicked man will have no principle of corruption
          in hell, but what he carried to hell with him. There are now the seeds
          of all the malice that will be exercised then. The malice of damned
          spirits is but a branch of the root that is in the hearts of natural
          men now. A natural man has a heart like the heart of a devil; only
          corruption is more under restraint in man than in devils.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. They are enemies in their practice. They walk contrary to him. In
          their enmity against God, they are exceeding active. They are engaged
          in war against God. Indeed they cannot injure God [for] he is so much
          above them; but yet they do what they can. They oppose themselves to
          his honor and glory. They oppose themselves to the interest of his
          kingdom in the world. They oppose themselves to the will and command
          of God. And [they] oppose him in his government. They oppose God in
          his works, and in his declared designs; while he is doing one work,
          they are doing the contrary. God seeks one thing, and they seek
          directly the contrary. They list under Satan’s banner, and are his
          willing soldiers in opposing the kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>The degree of men’s natural enmity to God.</p>
        <p>
          I NOW proceed to say something with respect to the degree of this
          enmity: tending in some measure to show, how great enemies to God are
          natural men.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They have no love to God; their enmity is mere enmity without any
          mixture of love. A natural man is wholly destitute of any principle of
          love to God, and therefore never had the least exercise of this love.
          Some natural men have better tempers than others; and some are better
          educated than others; and some live a great deal more soberly than
          others. But one has no more love to God than another; for none have
          the least spark of that. The heart of a natural man is as destitute of
          love to God, as a dead, stiff, cold corpse is of vital heat. John
          5:42, “I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Every faculty and principle of action is wholly under the dominion
          of enmity against God. The nature of man is wholly infected with this
          enmity against God. He is tainted with it throughout, in all his
          faculties and principles. And not only so, but every faculty is
          entirely and perfectly subdued under it, and enslaved to it. This
          enmity against God, has the absolute possession of the man. The
          apostle Paul, speaking of what he was naturally, says, Rom. 7:14, “I
          am carnal, sold under sin.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The understanding is under the reigning power of this enmity against
          God, so that it is entirely darkened and blinded with regard to the
          glory and excellency of God. The will is wholly under the reigning
          power of it. All the affections are governed by enmity against God.
          There is not one affection, nor one desire, that a natural man has, or
          that he is ever stirred up to act from, but what contains in it enmity
          against God. A natural man is as full of enmity against God, as any
          viper, or any venomous beast, is full of poison.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The power of the enmity of natural men against God, is so great,
          that it is insuperable by any finite power. It has too great and
          strong a possession of the heart, to be overcome by any created power.
          Indeed, a natural man never sincerely strives to root out his enmity
          against God. His endeavors are hypocritical. He delights in his
          enmity, and chooses it. Neither can others do it, though they
          sincerely, and to their utmost, endeavor to overcome this enmity. If
          godly friends and neighbors labor to persuade them to cast away their
          enmity, and become friends to God, they cannot persuade them to it.
          Though ministers use never so many arguments and entreaties, and set
          forth the loveliness of God; tell them of the goodness of God to them,
          hold forth God’s own gracious invitations, and entreat them never so
          earnestly to cast off their opposition, and be reconciled; yet they
          cannot overcome it. Still they will be as bad enemies to God, as ever
          they were. — The tongue of men or of angels cannot persuade them to
          relinquish their opposition to God. Miracles will not do it. — How
          many miracles did the children of Israel see in the wilderness! Yet
          their enmity against God remained; as appeared by their often
          murmuring. And how often did Christ use miracles to this end without
          effect, but the Jews obstinately stood out. Mat. 23:37, “O Jerusalem,
          Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are
          sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together,
          even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would
          not.” And how great did the enmity of these people appear to be after
          all; how spiteful and venomous were their hearts towards Christ, as
          appears by their cruel treatment of him, in his last sufferings!
        </p>
        <p>
          4.. They are mortal enemies to God; i.e. they have that enmity in
          their hearts, that strikes at the life of God. A man maybe no friend
          to another, and may have an ill spirit towards him; and yet not be his
          mortal enemy. His enmity will be satisfied with something short of the
          death of the person. But it is not so with natural men, with respect
          to God. They are mortal enemies. Their imbecility is no argument that
          this is not the tendency of the principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Natural men are enemies to the dominion of God; and their nature shows
          their good-will to dethrone him if they could! Yea, they are enemies
          to the being of God, and would be glad if there was no God. And
          therefore it necessarily follows, that they would cause that there
          should be none, if they could. Psa. 14:1, “The fool hath said in his
          heart, There is no God.” This implies, not only an aptness to question
          the being of God; but, that he inclines it should be so. His heart
          says, i.e. his inclination says. The words in the original are, “The
          fool hath said in his heart, No God.” That is, I would have none, I do
          not desire any, I wish there was none; that would suit my inclination
          best. Let the world be emptied of a God, he stands in my way. And
          hence he is an atheist in his heart.

          The viper’s poison is deadly poison; and when he bites he seeks the
          precious life. And men are in this respect a generation of vipers.
          Their poison, which is enmity against God, seeks the life of God. Mat.
          3:7, “O generation of vipers.” Psa. 58:3-4, “The wicked are estranged
          from the womb — Their poison is like the poison of a serpent.” Deu.
          32:32-33, “For their vine is the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
          Gomorrah: their grapes are the grapes of gall, their clusters are
          bitter. Their vine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
          asps.” The divine nature being immortal, and infinitely out of our
          reach, there is no other trial possible, whether the enmity that is
          naturally in the heart against God, be mortal or no, but only for God
          to take on him the human nature, and become man; so as to come within
          man’s reach. There can be no other experiment. And what has been the
          event? Why, when once God became man, and came down to dwell here,
          among such vipers as fallen men, they hated and persecuted him; and
          never desisted till they had imbrued their hands in his blood. There
          was a multitude of them that appeared combined in this design. Nothing
          would do, but he must be put to death. All cry out, Crucify him,
          crucify him. Away with him. They had rather Barabbas who greatly
          deserved death, should live, than he should not die. Nothing would
          restrain them from it; even all his preaching, and all his miracles.
          But they would kill him. And it was not the ordinary kind of execution
          that would satisfy them; but it must be the most cruel and most
          ignominious they possibly could invent. And they aggravated it as much
          as they could, by mocking him, and spitting on him, and scourging him.
          This shows what the nature and tendency of man’s enmity against God
          is; here it appeared in its true colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Natural men are greater enemies to God than they are to any other
          being whatsoever. Natural men may be very great enemies to their
          fellow-creatures; but not so great as they are to God. There is no
          other being that so much stands in sinners’ way, in those things that
          they chiefly set their hearts upon, as God. Men are wont to hate their
          enemies in proportion to two things, viz. their opposition to what
          they look upon to be their interest, — and their power and ability. A
          great and powerful enemy will be more hated, than one who is weak and
          impotent. But none is so powerful as God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Man’s enmity to others may be got over. Time may wear it out, and they
          may be reconciled. But natural men, without a mighty work of God to
          change their hearts, will never get over their enmity against God.
          They are greater enemies to God than they are to the devil. Yea, they
          treat the devil as their friend and master, and join with him against
          God. John 8:44, “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of
          your father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning.”
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>On what account men are enemies to God.</p>
        <p>
          THE general reason is, that God is opposite to them in the worship of
          their idols. The apostasy of man summarily consists in departing from
          the true God, to idols; forsaking his Creator, and setting up other
          things in his room. When God at first created man, he was united to
          his Creator; the God that made him was his God. The true God was the
          object of his highest respect, and had the possession of his heart.
          Love to God was the principle in his heart, that rules over all other
          principles; and every thing in the soul was wholly in subjection to
          it. But when man fell, he departed from the true God, and the union
          that was between his heart and his Creator was broken. He wholly lost
          his principle of love to God. And henceforward man clave to other
          gods. He gave that respect to the creature, which is due to the
          Creator. — When God ceased to be the object of his supreme love and
          respect, other things of course became the objects of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Man will necessarily have something that he respects as his god. If
          man [does] not give his highest respect to the God that made him,
          there will be something else that has the possession of it. Men will
          either worship the true God, or some idol. It is impossible it should
          be otherwise. Something will have the heart of man. And that which a
          man gives his heart to, may be called his god. And therefore when man
          by the fall extinguished all love to the true God, he set up the
          creature in his room. For having lost his esteem and love of the true
          God, and set up other gods in his room, and in opposition to him; and
          God still demanding their worship, and opposing them; enmity
          necessarily follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          That which a man chooses for his god, he sets his heart mainly upon.
          And nothing will so soon excite enmity, as opposition in that which is
          dearest. A man will be the greatest enemy to him who opposes him in
          what he chooses for his god. He will look on none as standing so much
          in his way, as he that would deprive him of his god. Jdg. 18:24, “Ye
          have taken away my gods; and what have I more?” A man, in this
          respect, cannot serve two masters that stand in competition for his
          service. And not only, if he serves one, he cannot serve the other;
          but if he cleaves to one, he will necessarily hate the other. Mat.
          6:24, “No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one,
          and love the other, or else he will hold to the one, and despise the
          other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.” And this is the very reason
          that men hate God. In this case it is, as when two kings set up in one
          kingdom, in opposition one to the other; and they both challenge the
          same throne, and are competitors for the same crown. They who are
          loyal, hearty subjects to the one, will necessarily be enemies to the
          other. As that which is a man’s god, is the object of his highest
          love; so that God who chiefly opposes him in it, must be the object of
          his greatest hatred.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gods which a natural man worships, instead of the God that made
          him, are himself and the world. He has withdrawn his esteem and honor
          from God, and proudly exalts himself. As Satan was not willing to be
          in subjection; and therefore rebelled, and set up himself; so a
          natural man, in the proud and high thoughts he has of himself, sets up
          himself upon God’s throne. He gives his heart to the world, worldly
          riches, worldly pleasures, and worldly honors. They have the
          possession of that regard which is due to God. The apostle sums up all
          the idolatry of wicked men in their love of the world. 1 John 2:15-16,
          “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any
          man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that
          is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the
          pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.” And the
          apostle James observes ,that a man must necessarily be the enemy of
          the true God, if he be a friend of the world. “Whosoever therefore
          will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God,” Jam. 4:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the sin that men commit, is what they do in the service of their
          idols. There is no one act of sin, but what is an act of service to
          some false god. And therefore wherein soever God opposes sin in them,
          he is opposite to their worship of their idols. On which account they
          are his enemies. God opposes them in their service of their idols, in
          the following respects:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He manifests his utter abhorrence of their attachment to their
          idols. Their idols are what they love above all things: they would by
          no means part with them. This wickedness is sweet unto them. Job
          20:12. If you take them away, what have they more? If they lose their
          idols, they lose their all. — To rend away their idols from them,
          would be more grievous to them, than to rend body and soul asunder. It
          is like rending their heart in twain. They love their idolatry. But
          God does not approve of it, but exceedingly hates it. He will by no
          means be reconciled to it; and therefore they hate him. God declares
          an infinite hatred of every act they do, in the service of their false
          gods. He declares himself to be a holy and a jealous God; a God who is
          very jealous of his own honor; and that greatly abhors giving that
          honor to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He utterly forbids their cleaving to those idols, and all the
          service that they do to them. He not only shows that he dislikes it,
          but he utterly forbids it; and demands that they should worship him;
          serve him only, and give their hearts wholly to him: without
          tolerating any competitor. He allows them to serve their idols in no
          degree; but requires them to cast them away utterly and pay no more
          worship to them, at any time. He requires a final parting with their
          idols. Not only that they should refrain from them for a while, but
          cast them away forever; and never gratify their idolatrous respect to
          them any more. This is so exceeding contrary to them, and what they
          are so averse to, that they are enemies to God for it. They cannot
          endure God’s commands, because they forbid all that in which their
          hearts are so engaged. And as they hate God’s commands, so they hate
          Him whose commands they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. He threatens them with everlasting damnation for their service of
          their idols. He threatens them for their past idolatry. He threatens
          them with his eternal wrath, for their having departed from him, and
          their having chosen to themselves other gods. He threatens them for
          that disposition they have in their hearts to cleave to other gods. He
          threatens the least degrees of that respect which they have in their
          hearts to their idols. He manifests that he will not tolerate any
          regard to them, but has fixed eternal death, as the wages of every
          degree of it. And he will not release them from their guilt; he holds
          them to their obligations; and he will accept of no atonement that
          they can make. He will not forgive them for whatever they do in
          religion; whatever pains they take; whatever tears they shed. He will
          accept of no money or price that they have to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he threatens every future act of their idolatry. He not only
          forbids them ever to be guilty of the least act, but forbids them on
          pain of eternal damnation. So strictly does God prohibit them from the
          service of their beloved idols! He threatens them with everlasting
          wrath for all exercises of inordinate love of worldly profit; for all
          manifestations of inordinate regard to worldly pleasures, or worldly
          honors. He threatens them with everlasting torments for their
          self-exaltations. He requires them to deny and renounce themselves,
          and to abase themselves at his feet, on pain of bearing his wrath to
          all eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strictness of God’s law is a principal cause of man’s enmity
          against God. If God were one that did not so much hate sin; if he
          would allow them in the gratification of their lusts in some degree,
          and his threatenings were not so awful against all criminal
          indulgence; if his threatenings were not so absolute; if his
          displeasure could be appeased by a few tears, a little reformation, or
          the like; they would not be so great enemies, nor hate him so much as
          they do. But God shows himself to be an implacable enemy to their
          idols, and has threatened everlasting wrath, infinite calamity, for
          all that they do in the service of their lusts. And this makes them
          irreconcilable enemies to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason, the scribes and Pharisees were such bitter enemies to
          Christ; because he showed himself to be such an enemy to their pride,
          conceit of their own wisdom, self-righteousness, and inordinate
          affectation of their own honor, which was their god. Natural men are
          enemies to God, because he is so opposite to them, in that in which
          they place their all. If you go to take away that which is very dear
          to a man, nothing will provoke him more. God is infinitely opposite to
          that in which natural men place all their delight, and all their
          happiness. He is an enemy to that which natural men value as their
          greatest honor and highest dignity; and to which they wholly trust;
          viz. their own righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence natural men are greater enemies to God than they are to any
          other being. Some of their fellow-creatures may stand very much in
          their way, with regard to some things on which they set their hearts;
          but God opposes them with respect to ALL their idols, and his
          opposition to them is infinitely great. None of our fellow-creatures
          ever oppose us in any of our interests so much as God opposes wicked
          men in their idolatry. His infinite opposition is manifested by his
          threatening an infinite punishment, viz. his dreadful wrath to all
          eternity, misery without end. Hence we need not wonder that natural
          men are enemies to God.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IV</p>
        <p>
          The objection, that men are not conscious of this enmity, answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          NATURAL men do not generally conceive themselves to be so bad; they
          have not this notion of themselves, that they are enemies to God. And
          therefore when they hear such doctrine as this taught them, they stand
          ready to make objections. Some may be ready to say, “I do not know, I
          am not sensible, that I hate God, and have a mortal enmity against
          him. I feel no such thing in my self, and if I have such enmity, why
          do not I feel it? If I am a mortal enemy, why should not I know it
          better than any body else? How can others see what is in my heart
          better than I myself? If I hate one of my fellow-creatures, I can feel
          it inwardly working.” To such an objection I would answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. If you do but observe yourself, and search your own heart, unless
          you are strangely blinded, you may be sensible of those things,
          wherein enmity does fundamentally consist. Particularly, you may be
          sensible that you have at least had a low and contemptible estimation
          of God. And that, in your esteem, you set the trifles and vanities of
          this world far above him; so as to regard the enjoyment of these
          things far before the enjoyment of God, and to value these things
          better than his love. — And you may be sensible that you despise the
          authority of God, and value his commands and his honor but very
          little. Or if by some means you have blinded yourself, so as to think
          you do regard them now, doubtless you can look back and see that you
          have not regarded them. You may be sensible that you have had a
          disrelish and aversion towards God; an opposition to thinking of him;
          so that it would have been a very uncomfortable task to have been
          confined to that exercise for any time. The vanities of the world, at
          the same time, have been very pleasing to you; and you have been all
          swallowed up by them, while you have been averse to the things of
          religion. If you look into your heart, it is there plain to be seen,
          that there is an enmity in your will, that it is contrary to God’s
          will, for you have been opposing the will of God all your life long. —
          These things are plain; it is nothing but some great delusion that can
          hide them from you. These are the foundation of all enmity. And if
          these things be in you, all the rest that we have spoken of will
          follow of course.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. One reason why you have not more sensibly felt the exercises of
          malice against God, is that your enmity is now exercised partly in
          your unbelief of God’s being; and this prevents its appearing in other
          ways. Man has naturally a principle of atheism in him; an
          indisposition to realize God’s being, and a disposition to doubt of
          it. The being of God does not ordinarily seem real to natural men. All
          the discoveries that there are of God’s being in his works, will not
          overcome the principle of atheism in the heart. And though they seem
          in some measure to be rationally convinced, yet it does not appear
          real; the conviction is faint. There is no strong conviction impressed
          on the mind that there is a God. And oftentimes they are ready to
          think that there is none. Now this will prevent the exercise of this
          enmity, which otherwise would be felt; particularly, it may be an
          occasion of there not being sensible exercises of hatred.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may in some measure be thus illustrated. If you had a rooted malice
          against another man, a principle that had been long established there,
          and if you should hear that he was dead, the sensible workings of your
          malice would not be felt, as when you realized it that he was alive.
          But if you should afterward hear the news contradicted, and perceive
          that your enemy was still alive; you would feel the same workings of
          hatred that you did before. And thus your not realizing the fact that
          God has a being, may prevent those sensible workings of hatred that
          otherwise you would have. If wicked men in this world were sensible of
          the reality of God’s being, as the wicked are in another, they would
          feel more of that hatred which men in another world do. The exercise
          of corruption in one way, may, and often does, prevent it working in
          other ways. As covetousness may prevent the exercise of pride, so
          atheism may prevent malice; and yet it may be no argument of there
          being any less enmity in the heart; for it is the same enmity, working
          in another way. The same enmity that in this world works by atheism,
          will in another world, where there will be no room for atheism, work
          by malice and blasphemy. The same mortal enmity which, if you saw
          there was a God, might make you to wish there were none, may now
          dispose and incline you to think there is none. Men are very often apt
          to think things are as they would have them to be. The same principle
          disposes you to think God has no existence, which, if you knew he had,
          would dispose you, if it were possible, to dispossess him of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If you think that here is a God, yet you do not realize it, that he
          is such a God as he really is. You do not realize it, that he is so
          holy as he is; that he has such a hatred of sin as indeed he has; that
          he is so just a God as he is, who will by no means clear the guilty.
          But that in the Psalms is applicable to you: “these things hast thou
          done, and I kept silence: thou thoughtest that I was altogether such
          an one as thyself,” Psa. 50:21. So that your atheism appears in this,
          as well as in thinking there is no God. So that your objection arises
          from this, that you do not find such a sensible hatred against that
          god which you have formed, to suit yourself; a god that you like
          better than the true God. But this is no argument that you have not
          bitter enmity against the true God; for it was your enmity against the
          true God, and your not liking him, that has put you upon forming up
          another in your imagination, that you like better. It is your enmity
          against those attributes of God’s holiness and justice, and the like,
          that has put you upon conceiting another, who is not so holy as he is,
          and does not hate sin so much, and will not be so strictly just in
          punishing it; and whose wrath against sin is not so terrible.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you were sensible of the vanity of your own conceits, and that
          God was not such an one as you have imagined; but that he is, as he is
          indeed, an infinitely holy, just, sin hating and sin revenging God,
          who will not tolerate nor endure the worship of idols, you would be
          much more liable to feel the sensible exercises of enmity against him
          than you are now. And this experience confirms. For we see that when
          men come to be under convictions, and to be made sensible that God is
          not as they have heretofore imagined; but that he is such a jealous,
          sin hating God, and whose wrath against sin is so dreadful, they are
          much more apt to have sensible exercises of enmity against him than
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Your having always been taught that God is infinitely above you,
          and out of your reach, has prevented your enmity being exercised in
          those ways, that otherwise it would have been. And hence your enmity
          has not been exercised in revengeful thoughts; because revenge has
          never found any room here; it has never found any handle to take hold
          of: there has been no conception of any such thing, and hence it has
          lain still. A serpent will not bite, or spit poison, at that which it
          sees at a great distance; which if it saw near, would do it
          immediately. Opportunity often shows what men are, whether friends or
          enemies. Opportunity to do puts men in mind of doing; wakens up such
          principles as lay dormant before. Opportunity stirs up desire to do,
          where there was before a disposition, that without opportunity would
          have lain still. If a man has had an old grudge against another, and
          has a fair opportunity to be revenged, this will revive his malice,
          and waken up a desire of revenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a great and sovereign prince injures a poor man, and what he does
          is looked upon as very cruel, that will not ordinarily stir up
          passionate revenge, because he is so much above him, and out of his
          reach. Many a man has appeared calm and meek, when he has had no power
          in his hands, and has not appeared, either to himself or others, to
          have any disposition to cruel acts; yet afterwards, when he came to
          have opportunity by unexpected advancement, or otherwise, has appeared
          like a ravenous wolf, or devouring lion. So it was with Hazael. “And
          Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the
          evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds
          wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the
          sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with
          child. And Hazael said, But what is thy servant a dog, that he should
          do this great thing! And Elisha answered, the Lord hath showed me that
          thou shalt be king over Syria,” 2 Kings 8:12, 13. Hazael was then a
          servant; he had no power in his hands to do as he pleased; and so his
          cruel disposition had lain hid, and he did not himself imagine that it
          was there. But afterwards, when he became king of Syria, and was
          absolute, having none to control him; then it broke out and appeared,
          and he did as the prophet had foretold. He committed those very acts
          of cruelty, that he thought it was not in his heart to do. It was want
          of opportunity that made the difference. It was all in his heart
          before. He was such a dog then as to do this thing, but only had not
          opportunity. And therefore when he seems surprised that the prophet
          should say so of him, all the reason the prophet gives is, “The Lord
          hath showed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Some natural men are such “dogs” as to do things, if they had
          opportunity, which they do not imagine it is in their hearts to do.
          You object against your having a moral hatred against God; that you
          never felt any desire to dethrone him. But one reason has been, that
          it has always been conceived so impossible by you. But if the throne
          of God were within your reach, and you knew it, it would not be safe
          one hour. Who knows what thoughts would presently arise in your heart
          by such an opportunity, and what disposition would be raised up in
          your heart. Who would trust your heart, that there would not presently
          be such thoughts as these, though they are enough to make one tremble
          to mention them? “Now I have opportunity to set my self at liberty —
          that I need not be kept in continual slavery by the strict law of God.
          — Then I may take my liberty to walk in that way I like best, and need
          not be continually in such slavish fear of God’s displeasure. And God
          has not done well by me in many instances. He has done most unjustly
          by me, in holding me bound to destruction for unbelief, and other
          things which I cannot help. — He has shown mercy to others, and not to
          me. I have now an opportunity to deliver myself, and there can be no
          danger of my being hurt for it. There will be nothing for us to be
          terrified about, and so keep us in slavery.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Who would trust your heart, that such thoughts would not arise? Or
          others much more horrid and too dreadful to be mentioned? And
          therefore I forbear. Those natural men are foolishly insensible of
          what is in their own hearts, who think there would be no danger of any
          such workings of heart, if they knew they had opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. You little consider how much your having no more of the sensible
          exercises of hatred to God is owing to a being restrained by fear. You
          have always been taught what a dreadful thing it is to hate God, and
          how terrible his displeasure; that God sees the heart and knows all
          the thoughts; and that you are in his hands, and he can make you as
          miserable as he pleases, and as soon as he pleases. And these things
          have restrained you. And the fear that has risen from them, has kept
          you from appearing what you are; it has kept down your enmity, and
          made that serpent afraid to show its head, as otherwise it would do.
          If a wrathful man were wholly under the power of an enemy, he would be
          afraid to exercise his hatred in outward acts, unless it were with
          great disguise. And if it be supposed that such an enemy, in whose
          power he was, could see his heart, and know all his thoughts; and
          apprehended that he would put him to a terrible death, if he saw the
          workings of malice there, how greatly would this restrain! He would be
          afraid so much as to believe himself, that he hated his enemy. But
          there would be all manner of disguise and hypocrisy, and feigning even
          of thoughts and affections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus your enmity has been kept under restraint; and thus it has been
          from your infancy. You have grown up in it, so that it is become an
          habitual restraint. You dare not so much as think you hate God. If you
          do exercise hatred, you have a disguise for it, whereby you endeavor
          even to hide it from your own conscience; and so have all along
          deceived yourself. Your deceit is very old and habitual. There has
          been only restraint; not mortification. There has been an enmity
          against God in its full strength. It has been only restrained, like an
          enemy that durst not rise up and show himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.. One reason why you have not felt more sensible hatred to God may
          be because you have not had much trial of what is in your heart. It
          may be God has hitherto, in a great measure, let you alone. The enmity
          that is in men’s hearts against God, is like a serpent, which, if it
          be let alone lies still. But if anybody disturbs it, will soon hiss,
          and be enraged, and show its serpentine spiteful nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the good opinion you have of yourself, yet a little
          trial would show you to be a viper, and your heart would be set all on
          rage against God. One thing that restrains you now is your hope. You
          hope to receive many things from God. Your own interest is concerned.
          So that both hope and fear operate together, to restrain your enmity
          from sensible exercises. But if once hope were gone, you would soon
          show what you were; you would feel your enmity against God in a rage.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. If you pretend that you do not feel enmity against God, and yet act
          as an enemy, you may certainly conclude that it is not because you are
          no enemy, but because you do not know your own heart. Actions are the
          best interpreters of the disposition. They show, better than anything
          else, what the heart is. It must be because you do not observe your
          own behavior that you question whether you are an enemy to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          What other account can you give of your own carriage, but only your
          being God’s enemy? What other account can be given of your opposing
          God in your ways; walking so exceeding contrary to him, contrary to
          his counsels, contrary to his commands, and contrary to his glory?
          What other account can be given of your casting so much contempt upon
          God; your setting him so low; your acting so much against his
          authority, and against his kingdom and interest in the world? What
          other account can be given of your so setting your will in opposition
          to God’s will, and that so obstinately, for so long a time, against so
          many warnings as you have had? What other account can be given of your
          joining so much with Satan, in the opposition he is making to the
          kingdom of God in the world? And that you will join with him against
          God, though it be so much against your own interest, and though you
          expose yourself by it to everlasting misery?
        </p>
        <p>
          Such like behavior in one man towards another, would be sufficient
          evidence of enmity. If he should be seen to behave thus, and that it
          was his constant manner, none would want better evidence that he was
          an enemy to his neighbor. If you yourself had a servant that carried
          it towards you, as you do towards God, you would not think there was
          need of any greater evidence of his being your enemy. Suppose your
          servant should manifest much contempt of you; and disregard your
          commands as much as you do the commands of God; should go directly
          contrary, and in many ways act the very reverse of your commands;
          should seem to set himself in ways that were contrary to your will
          obstinately and incorrigibly, without any amendment from your repeated
          calls, warnings, and threatenings; and should act so cross to you day
          and night, as you do to God; would he not be justly deemed your enemy?
          Suppose, further, when you sought one thing, he would seek the
          contrary; when you did any work, he would, as much as in him lay, undo
          and destroy that work; and suppose he should continually drive at such
          ends, as tended to overthrow the ends you aimed at. When you sought to
          bring to pass any design, he would endeavor to overthrow your design;
          and set himself as much against your interest, as you do yourself
          against God’s honor. And suppose you should moreover see him, from
          time to time, with those who were your declared mortal enemies; making
          them his counselors, and hearkening to their counsels, as much as you
          do to Satan’s temptations; should you not think you had sufficient
          evidence that he was your enemy? — Therefore consider seriously your
          own ways, and weigh your own behavior. “How canst thou say, I am not
          polluted? — see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done,” Jer.
          2:23.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION V</p>
        <p>
          The objections, that they show respect to God, and experience some
          religious affections, answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          NATURAL men may be ready to object, the respect they show to God, from
          time to time. This makes many to think that they are far from being
          such enemies to God. They pray to him in secret, and attend on public
          worship, and take a great deal of pains to do it in a decent manner.
          It seems to them that they show God a great deal of respect. They use
          many very respectful terms in their prayer. They are respectful in
          their manner of speaking, their voice, gestures, and the like. — But
          to this I answer, that all this is done in mere hypocrisy. All this
          seeming respect is feigned, there is no sincerity in it. There is
          external respect, but none in the heart. There is a show, and nothing
          else. You only cover your enmity with a painted veil. You put on the
          disguise of a friend, but in your heart you are a mortal enemy. There
          is external honor, but inward contempt; there is a show of friendship
          and regard, but inward hatred. You do but deceive yourself with your
          show of respect; and endeavor to deceive God; not considering that God
          looks not on the outward appearance, but on the heart. — Here consider
          particularly,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That much of that seeming respect which natural men show to God, is
          owing to their education. They have been taught from their infancy
          that they ought to show great respect to God. They have been taught to
          use respectful language when speaking about God, and to behave with
          solemnity, when attending on those exercises of religion, wherein they
          have to do with him. From their childhood, they have seen that this is
          the manner of others, when they pray to God, to use reverential
          expressions. and a reverential behavior before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who are brought up in places where they have, commonly from
          their infancy, heard men take the name of God in vain, and swear and
          curse, and blaspheme; they learn to do the same; and it becomes
          habitual to them. And it is the same way, and no other, that you have
          learned to behave respectfully towards God. [It is] not that you have
          any more respect to God than they; but they have been brought up one
          way, and you another. In some parts of the world, men are brought up
          in the worship of idols of silver, and gold, and wood, and stone, made
          in the shape of men and beast. “They say of them, Let the men that
          sacrifice, kiss the calf,” Hos. 13:2. In some parts of the world, they
          are brought up to worship serpents, and are taught from their infancy
          to show great respect to them. And in some places, they are brought up
          in worshipping the devil, who appears to them in a bodily shape; and
          to behave with a show of great reverence and honor towards him. And
          what respect you show to God has no better foundation; it comes the
          same way, and is worth no more.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That show of respect which you make is forced. You come to God, and
          make a great show of respect to him, and use very respectful terms,
          with a reverential tone and manner of speaking; and your countenance
          is grave and solemn. You put on an humble aspect; and use humble,
          respectful postures, out of fear. You are afraid that God will execute
          his wrath upon you, and so you feign a great deal of respect, that he
          may not be angry with you. “Through the greatness of thy power shall
          thine enemies submit themselves unto thee,” Psa. 66:3. In the original
          it is, shall thine enemies lie to thee. It is rendered therefore in
          the margin, shall yield feigned obedience to thee. All that you do in
          religion is forced and feigned. Through the greatness of God’s power,
          you yield feigned obedience. You are in God’s power, and he is able to
          destroy you. And so you feign a great deal of respect to him, that he
          might not destroy you. As one might do towards an enemy that had taken
          him captive, though he at the same time would gladly make his escape,
          if he could, by taking away the life of him who had taken him captive.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is not real respect that moves you to behave so towards God. You
          do it because you hope you shall get by it. It is respect to yourself,
          and not respect to God that moves you. You hope to move God by it to
          bestow the rewards of his children. You are like the Jews who followed
          Christ, and called him Rabbi, and would make him a king. Not that they
          honored him so much in their hearts, as to think him worthy of the
          honor of a king; or that they had the respect of sincere subjects; but
          they did it for the sake of the loaves. “Jesus perceived that they
          would come and make him a king. And when they had found him on the
          other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, how camest thou
          hither? Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily, verily I say unto
          you, Ye seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because ye did
          eat of the loaves, and were filled,” John 6:15, 25, 26.
        </p>
        <p>
          These things do not argue but that you are implacable enemies to God.
          If you examine your prayers and other duties, your own consciences
          will tell you, that the seeming respect which you have shown to God in
          them, has been only in hypocrisy. Oftentimes you have set forth in
          your prayers, that God was a great, a glorious, and an infinitely holy
          God, as if you greatly honored him on the account of these attributes;
          and, at the same time, you had no sense in your heart of the greatness
          and glory of God, or of any excellency in his holiness. Your own
          consciences will tell you, that you have often pretended to be
          thankful; you have told God, that you thanked him you was alive, and
          thanked him for various mercies, when you have not found the least jot
          of thankfulness in your heart. And so you have told God of your own
          unworthiness, and set forth what a vile creature you [were]; when you
          have had no humble sense of your own unworthiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          If these forementioned restraints were thrown off, you would soon
          throw off all your show of respect. Take away fear, and a regard to
          your own interest, and there would soon be an end to all those
          appearances of love, honor, and reverence, which now you make. All
          these things are not at all inconsistent with the most implacable
          enmity. The devil himself made a show of respect to Christ, when he
          was afraid that he was going to torment him; and when he hoped to
          persuade Christ to spare him longer. “When he saw Jesus, he cried out,
          and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to
          do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee,
          torment me not,” Luke 8:28.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some may perhaps object against this doctrine of their being God’s
          enemies, the religious affections they have sometimes experienced.
          They may be ready to say that when they have come before God in
          prayer, they have not only used respectful terms and gestures, but
          they have prayed with affection; their prayers have been attended with
          tears, which they are ready to think showed something in the heart. —
          But to this it is answered, that these affections have risen from
          other causes, and not from any true respect to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) They have risen from self-love, and not love to God. If you have
          wept before God, from the consideration of your own pitiful case; that
          has been because you loved yourself, and not because you had any
          respect to God. If your tears have been from sorrow for your sins; you
          have mourned for your sins, because you have sinned against yourself,
          and not because you have sinned against God. “When ye fasted and
          mourned, did ye at all fast unto me, even unto me?” Zec. 7:5.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Pride, and a good thought of themselves, very commonly has a
          great hand in the affections of natural men. They have a good opinion
          of what they are doing when they are praying; and the reflection on
          that affects them. They are affected with their own goodness. Men’s
          self-righteousness often occasions tears. A high opinion of themselves
          before God, and an imagination of their being persons of great account
          with him, has affected them in their transactions with God. There is
          commonly abundance of pride in the midst of tears; and often pride is
          in a great measure the source of them. And then they are so far from
          being an argument that you are not an enemy to God, that on the
          contrary, they are an argument, that you are. In your very tears, you
          are, in a vain conceit of yourself, exalting yourself against God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) The affections of natural men often arise from wrong notions they
          have of God. They conceived of God after the manner they do of men, as
          though he were a being liable to be wrought upon in his affections.
          They conceive of him as one whose heart could be drawn, whose
          affections can be overcome, by what he sees in them. They conceive of
          him as being taken with them, and their performances; and this works
          on their affections; and thus one tear draws another, and their
          affections increase by reflection. And oftentimes they conceived of
          God as one that loves them, and is a friend to them. And such a
          mistake may work much on their affections. But such affections that
          arise towards God, as they conceit him to be, is no argument that they
          have not the same implacable hatred towards God, considered as he
          really is. There is no concluding that men are not enemies, because
          they are affected and shed tears in their prayers, and the like. Saul
          was very much affected when David expostulated with him about pursuing
          after him, and seeking to kill him. David’s words wrought exceedingly
          upon Saul’s affections. “And it came to pass when David had made an
          end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy
          voice, my son David? and Saul lift up his voice and wept,” 1 Sam.
          24:16, chap 26:1, 10. He was so affected that he wept aloud, and
          called David his son, though he was but just before seeking his life.
          But this affection of Saul was no argument that he did not still
          continue in his enmity against David. He was David’s mortal enemy
          before, and sought his life; and so he did afterwards. It was but a
          pang. His enmity was not mortified or done away. The next news we hear
          of Saul is that he was pursuing David, and seeking his life again.

        <p>SECTION VI</p>
        <p>Restraining grace a great privilege.</p>
        <p>
          IF natural men are God’s enemies, then hence we may learn, how much we
          are indebted to God for his restraining grace. If all natural men are
          God’s enemies, what would they not do, if they were not restrained!
          For what has one that is an enemy in his disposition, to restrain him
          from acting against him to whom he is an enemy? Hatred will not
          restrain a man from acting anything against him that is hated. Nothing
          is too bad for hatred, if it be mere hatred and no love. Hatred shows
          no kindness either in doing, or forbearing. It will never make a man
          forbear to act against God; for the very nature of hatred is to seek
          evil. But wicked men, as has been shown, are mere enemies to God. They
          have hatred, without any love at all. And hence natural men have
          nothing within them, in their own nature, to restrain them from
          anything that is bad. And therefore their restraint must not be owing
          to nature, but to restraining grace. And therefore whatever wickedness
          we have been kept from, it is not because we have not been bad enough
          to commit it; but it is God has restrained us, and kept us back from
          sin. There can be no worse principle, than a principle of hatred to
          God. And there can be no principle that will go further in wickedness
          than this, if it be neither mortified nor restrained. But it is not
          mortified in natural men; and therefore all that keeps them from any
          degree of wickedness, is restrained. If we have seen others do things
          that we never did; and if they have done worse than we, this is owing
          to restraining grace. If we have not done as bad as Pharaoh, it is
          owing to divine restraints. If we have not done as bad as Judas, or as
          the scribes and Pharisees, or as bad as Herod, or Simon Magus, it is
          because God has restrained our corruption. If we have ever heard or
          read of any that have done worse than we; if we have not gone the
          length in sinning, that the most wicked pirates or carnal persecutors
          have gone, this is owing to restraining grace. For we are all
          naturally the enemies of God as much as they. If we have not committed
          the unpardonable sin, it is owing to restraining grace. There is no
          worse principle in exercise in that sin, than enmity against God.
          There is the entire fountain, and all the foundation of the sin
          against the Holy Ghost, in that enmity against God that naturally
          reigns in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not we that restrain ourselves from the commission of the
          greatest imaginable wickedness; for enmity against God reigns in us
          and over us; we are under its power and dominion, and are sold under
          it. We do not restrain that which reigns over us. A slave, as long as
          he continues a mere slave, cannot control his master. “He that
          committeth sin, is the servant of sin,” John 8:34. So that the
          restraint of this our cruel tyrant, is owing to God, and not to us.
          What does a poor, impotent subject do to restrain the absolute Lord,
          that has him wholly under his power? How much will it appear that the
          world is indebted to the restraining grace of God, if we consider that
          the world is full of enemies to God. The world is full of inhabitants;
          and almost all are God’s enemies, his implacable and mortal enemies.
          What therefore would they not do, what work would they not make, if
          God did not restrain them?
        </p>
        <p>
          God’s work in the restraint that he exercises over a wicked world, is
          a glorious work. God’s holding the reins upon the corruptions of a
          wicked world, and setting bounds to their wickedness, is a more
          glorious work, than his ruling the raging of the sea, and setting
          bounds to its proud waves, and saying, hitherto shalt thou come, and
          no further. In hell, God lets the wickedness of wicked spirits have
          the reins, to rage without restraint; and it would be in a great
          measure upon earth as it is in hell, did not God restrain the
          wickedness of the world. But in order to the better understanding how
          it is owing to the restraining grace of God, that we are kept and
          withheld from the highest acts of sin, I would here observe several
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Whenever men are withheld from sinning by the common influence of
          God’s Spirit, they are withheld by restraining grace. If sinners are
          awakened, and are made sensible of the great guilt that sin brings,
          and that it exposes to a dreadful punishment; under such circumstances
          they dare not allow themselves in willful sin; God restrains them by
          the convictions of his Spirit; and therein their being kept from sin,
          is owing to restraining grace. And unawakened sinners that live under
          the gospel, who are in a great measure secure, commonly have some
          degrees of the influence of God’s Spirit, with his ordinances
          influencing natural conscience. And though they be not sufficient
          thoroughly to rouse them out of security, or make them reform; yet
          they keep them from going such lengths in sin, as otherwise they might
          do. And this is restraining grace. They are indeed very stupid and
          sottish. Yet they would be a great deal more so, if God should let
          them wholly alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. All the restraints that men are under from the word and ordinances
          is from grace. The word and ordinances of God might have some degree
          of influence on men’s natural principles of self-love, to restrain
          them from sin, without any degree of the influence of God’s Spirit.
          But this would be the restraining grace of God; for God’s goodness and
          mercy to a sinful world appears in his giving his word to be a
          restraint on the wickedness of the world. When men are restrained by
          fear of those punishments that the Word of God threatens; or by the
          warnings, the offers, and promises of it; when the Word of God works
          upon hope, or fear, or natural conscience, to restrain men from sin,
          this is the restraining grace of God, and is owing to his mercy. It is
          an instance of God’s mercy that he has revealed hell, to restrain
          men’s wickedness; and that he has revealed a way of salvation, and a
          possibility of eternal life. This which has great influence on men to
          keep them from sin, is the restraining grace of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. When men are restrained from sin, by the light of nature, this also
          is of grace. If men are destitute of the light of God’s Word, yet the
          light of natural conscience teaches that sin brings guilt, and exposes
          to punishment. The light of nature teaches that there is a God who
          governs the world, and will reward the good and punish the evil. God
          is the author of the light of nature, as well as the light of
          revelation. He in mercy to mankind makes known many things by natural
          light to work upon men’s fear and self-love, in order to restrain
          their corruptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. When God restrains men’s corruptions by his providence, this is
          from grace. And that whether it be his general providence in ordering
          the state of mankind; or his providential disposals towards them in
          particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) God greatly restrains the corruption of the world, by ordering
          the state of mankind. He hath set them here in a mortal state, and in
          a state of probation for eternity; and that is a great restraint to
          corruption. God hath so ordered the state of mankind, that ordinarily
          many kinds of sin and wickedness are disgraceful, and what tend to the
          hurt of a man’s character and reputation amongst his fellowmen; and
          that is a great restraint. He hath so disposed the world, that many
          kinds of wickedness are many ways very contrary to men’s temporal
          interest; and mankind [is] led to prohibit many kinds of wickedness by
          human laws; and that is a great restraint. God hath set up a church in
          the world, made up of those who, if they are answerable to their
          profession, have the fear and love of God in their hearts; and they by
          holding forth revealed light, by keeping up the ordinances of God, and
          by warning others, are a great restraint to the wickedness of the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all these things, the restraining grace of God appears. — It is
          God’s mercy to mankind, that he has so ordered their state, that they
          should have so many things, by fear and a regard to their own
          interest, to restrain their corruptions. It is God’s mercy to the
          world, that the state of mankind here differs from the state of the
          damned in hell; where men will have none of these things to restrain
          them. The wisdom of God, as well as the attributes of his grace,
          greatly appear in thus disposing things for the restraining of the
          wickedness of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) God greatly restrains the corruptions of men by his providence
          towards particular persons; by placing men in such circumstances as to
          lay them under restraints. And to this it is often owing that some
          natural men never go such lengths in sinning, or are never guilty of
          such atrocious wickedness, as some others, that Providence has placed
          them in different circumstances. If it were not for this, many
          thousands of natural men, who now live sober and orderly lives, would
          do as Pharaoh did. The reason why they do not, is, that Providence has
          placed them in different circumstances. If they were in the same
          circumstances as Pharaoh was in, they would do as he did. And so, if
          in the same circumstances as Manassah, as Judas, or Nero. But
          Providence restrains their corruptions, by putting them in such
          circumstances, as not to open such a door or outlet for their
          corruption, as he did to them. So some do not perpetrate such horrid
          things, they do not live such horribly vicious lives, as some others,
          because Providence has restrained them, by ordering that they should
          have a better education than others. Providence has ordered that they
          should be the children of pious parents, it may be, or should live
          where they should enjoy many means of grace; and so Providence has
          laid them under restraints. Now this is restraining grace; or the
          attribute of God’s grace exercised in thus restraining persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          And oftentimes God restrains men’s corruptions by particular events of
          providence. By particular afflictions they are brought under, or by
          particular occurrences, whereby God does, as it were, block up men’s
          way in their course of sin, or in some wickedness that they has
          devised, and that otherwise they would perpetrate. Or something
          happens unexpected to hold men back from that which they were about to
          commit. Thus God restrained David by his providence from shedding
          blood, as he intended to do. “Now therefore, my lord, as the Lord
          liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the Lord hath withholden thee
          from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own
          hand,” — 1 Sam 25:26. God withheld him from it no otherwise, than by
          ordering it so in his providence that Abigail should come, and by her
          wisdom should cool, pacify, and persuade him to alter his purpose. See
          verse 32, 33, 34.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Godly persons are greatly indebted to restraining grace, in keeping
          them from dreadful acts of sin. So it was in that instance of David,
          just mentioned. Even godly persons, when God has left, and has not
          restrained them, have fallen into dreadful acts of sin. So did David,
          in the case of Uriah; and Lot, and Peter. And when other godly persons
          are kept from falling into such sins, or much worse sins than these,
          it is owing to the restraining grace of God. Merely having a principle
          of grace in their hearts, or merely their being godly persons, without
          God’s presence to restrain them, will not keep them from great acts of
          sin. That the godly do not fall into the most horrid sins that can be
          conceived of, is owing not so much to any inconsistency between their
          falling into such sins, and the having a principle of grace in the
          heart, as it is owing to the covenant mercy of God, whereby he has
          promised never to leave nor forsake his people; and that he will not
          suffer them to be tempted above what they are able; but with the
          temptation will make a way for them to escape. If saving grace
          restrains men from great acts of sin, that is owing to God who gives
          such exercises of grace at that time when the temptation comes, that
          they are restrained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let not the godly therefore be insensible of their obligations to the
          restraining grace of God. Though they cannot be said to be enemies to
          God, because a principle of enmity does not reign; yet they have the
          very same principle and seed of enmity in them, though it be
          mortified. Though it be not in reigning power, yet it has great
          strength; and is too strong for them, without God’s almighty power to
          help them against it. Though they be not enemies to God, because they
          have a principle of love; yet their old man, the body of sin and death
          that yet remains in them, is a mortal enemy to God. Corruption in the
          godly, is not better than it is in the wicked; but is of as bad a
          nature every whit, as that which is in a mortal enemy to God. And
          though it be not in reigning power; yet it would dreadfully rage, were
          it not for God’s restraining grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          God give his restraining grace to both natural and godly men. But
          there is this difference; he gives his restraining grace to his
          children in the way of covenant mercy; it is part of the mercy
          promised in his covenant. God is faithful, and will not leave them to
          sin in like manner as wicked men do; otherwise they would do every
          whit as bad. — Let not therefore the godly attribute it to themselves,
          or merely to their own goodness, that they are not guilty of such
          horrid crimes as they hear of in others; let them consider it as not
          owing to them, but to God’s restraints. — Thus, all, both godly and
          ungodly, may learn from this doctrine, their great obligations to the
          restraining grace of God.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION VII</p>
        <p>
          Why natural men are not willing to come to Christ, and their dreadful
          condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          HENCE we may learn the reason why natural men will not come to Christ.
          They do not come because they will not come. “Ye will not come to me,
          that ye might have life,” John 5:40. When we say that natural men are
          not willing to come to Christ, it is not meant that they are not
          willing to be delivered from hell; for without doubt, no natural man
          is willing to go to hell. Nor is it meant, that they are not willing
          that Christ should keep them from going to hell. Without doubt,
          natural men under awakenings often greatly desire this. But this does
          not argue that they are willing to come to Christ. For,
          notwithstanding their desire to be delivered from hell, their hearts
          do not close with Christ, but are averse to him. They see nothing in
          Christ wherefore they should desire him; no beauty nor comeliness to
          draw their hearts to him. And they are not willing to take Christ as
          he is; they would fain divide him. There are some things in him that
          they like, and others that they greatly dislike. But consider him as
          he is, and as he is offered to them in the gospel, and they are not
          willing to accept of Christ; for in doing so, they must of necessity
          part with all their sins; they must sell the world, and part with
          their own righteousness. But they had rather, for the present, run the
          venture of going to hell, than do that.
        </p>
        <p>
          When men are truly willing to come to Christ, they are freely willing.
          It is not what they are forced and driven to by threatenings; but they
          are willing to come, and choose to come without being driven. But
          natural men have no such free willingness. But on the contrary have an
          aversion. And the ground of it is that which we have heard, viz. that
          they are enemies to God. Their having such a reigning enmity against
          God, makes them obstinately refuse to come to Christ. If a man is an
          enemy to God, he will necessarily be an enemy to Christ too; for
          Christ is the Son of God; he is infinitely near to God, yea, has the
          nature of God, as well as the nature of man. He is a Savior appointed
          of God. He anointed him, and sent him into the world. And in
          performing the work of redemption, he wrought the works of God; always
          did those things that pleased him; and all that he does as a Savior,
          is to his glory. And one great thing he aimed at in redemption, was to
          deliver them from their idols, and bring them to God. The case being
          so, and sinners being enemies to God, they will necessarily be
          opposite to coming to Christ; for Christ is of God, and as a Savior
          seeks them to bring them to God only. But natural men are not of God,
          but are averse to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence we see, how dreadful is the condition of natural men. Their
          state is a state of enmity with God. If we consider what God is, and
          what men are, it will be easy for us to conclude that such men as are
          God’s enemies, must be miserable. Consider, ye that are enemies to
          God, how great he is. He is the eternal God who fills heaven and
          earth, and whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain. He is the God
          that made you; in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your
          ways; the God in whom you live, and move, and have your being; who has
          your soul and body in his hands every moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          You would look on yourself as in very unhappy circumstances, if your
          neighbors were all your enemies, and none of your fellow-creatures
          were your friends. If everybody were set against you, and all despised
          and hated you, you would be ready to think, you had better be out of
          the world than in it. But if it be such a calamity to have enmity
          maintained between you and your fellow-creatures, what is it, when you
          and the almighty God are enemies? What avails either the friendship or
          enmity of your neighbors, poor worms of the dust, in comparison of the
          friendship or enmity of the great God of heaven and earth? — Consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. If you continue in your enmity a little longer, there will be a
          mutual enmity between God and you to all eternity. God will appear to
          be your dreadful and irreconcilable enemy. If you should die an enemy
          to God, there will be no such thing as any reconciliation after death.
          God will then appear to you in hatred, without any love, any pity, and
          any mercy at all. As you hate God, he will hate you. And that will be
          verified of you. “My soul loathed them, and their soul abhorred me,”
          Zec. 11:8. And then God will be your enemy forever. If you be not
          reconciled so as to become his friend in this life, God never will
          become your friend after death. If you continue an enemy to God till
          death, God will continue an enemy to you to all eternity. You will
          have no mediator offered you, there will be no day’s-man betwixt you.
          So that it becomes you to consider what it will be to have God your
          enemy to all eternity, without any possibility of being reconciled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider, what will it be to have this enmity to be mutual, and
          maintained forever on both sides? For as God will forever continue an
          enemy to you, so you will forever continue an enemy to God. If you
          continue God’s enemy until death, you will always be his enemy. And
          after death your enmity will have no restraint, but it will break out
          and rage without control. When you come to be a fire-brand hell, you
          will be so in two respects, viz. as you will be full of the fire of
          God’s wrath; and as you will be on a blaze with spite and malice
          towards God. You will be as full of the fire of malice, as you will
          with the fire of divine vengeance, and both will make you full of
          torment. Then you will appear as you are, a viper indeed. You are now
          under great disguise; a wolf in sheep’s clothing. But then your mask
          will be pulled off. You shall loose your garments, and walk naked.
          Rev. 16:15. Then will you vent your rage and malice in fearful
          blasphemies. That same tongue, to cool which you will wish for a drop
          of water, will be eternally employed in cursing and blaspheming God
          and Christ. And that not from any new corruption being put into your
          heart; but only from God’s withdrawing his hand from restraining your
          old corruption. And what a miserable way will this be of spending your
          eternity!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Consider, what will be the consequence of a mutual enmity between
          God and you, if it be continued? Though hitherto you have met with no
          very great changes, yet they will come. After a little while, dying
          time will come; and then what will be the consequence of this enmity?
          God, whose enemy you are, has the frame of your body in his hands.
          Your times are in his hand; and he it is that appoints your bounds.
          And when he sends death to arrest you, to change your countenance, to
          dissolve your frame, and to take you away from all your earthly
          friends, and from all that is dear and pleasant to you in the world;
          what will be the issue? Will not you then stand in need of God’s help?
          Would not he be the best friend in such a case, worth more than ten
          thousand earthly friends? If God be your enemy, then to whom will you
          betake yourself for a friend? When you launch forth into the boundless
          gulf of eternity, then you will need some friend to take care of you,
          but if God be your enemy, where will you betake yourself? Your soul
          must go naked into another world, in eternal separation from all
          worldly things; and your soul will not be in its own power, to defend
          or dispose of itself. Will you not then need to have God for a friend,
          into whose hands you may commend your spirit? But how dreadful will it
          be, to have God your enemy!
        </p>
        <p>
          The time is coming when the frame of this world shall be dissolved.
          Christ shall descend in the clouds of heaven, in the glory of his
          Father; and you, with all the rest of mankind, must stand before his
          judgment-seat. Then what will be the consequence of this mutual enmity
          between God and you? If God be your enemy, who will stand your friend?
          Now, it may be, it does not appear to be very terrible to have God for
          your enemy. But when such changes as these are brought to pass, it
          will greatly alter the appearance of things. Then God’s favor will
          appear to you of infinite worth. They, and they only, will then appear
          happy, who have the love of God. And then you will know that God’s
          enemies are miserable. — But under this head, consider more
          particularly several things.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) What God can do to his enemies. Or rather, what can he not do?
          How miserable can he who is almighty make his enemies! Consider, you
          that are enemies to God, whether or not you shall be able to make your
          part good with him. “Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we
          stronger than he?” 1 Cor. 10:22. Have you such a conceit of your own
          strength, as that you think to try it out with God? Do you intend to
          run the risk of an encounter with him? Do you imagine that your hands
          can be strong, or your heart can endure? Do you think you shall be
          well able to defend yourself, or to escape out of his hand? Do you
          think that you shall be able to uphold your spirits, when God acts as
          an enemy towards you? If so, then gird up your loins, and see what the
          event will be. Therefore thus will I do unto thee — “and because I
          will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God.” — Amos 4:12. Is it
          not in vain to set the briers and thorns in battle array against
          devouring flames; which though they seemed to be armed with natural
          weapons ,yet the fire will pass through them, and burn them together?
          See Isa. 27:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if you endeavor to support yourself under God’s wrath, cannot God
          lay you under such misery, as to cause your spirit quite to fail; so
          that you shall find no strength to resist him, or to uphold yourself?
          Why should a worm think of supporting himself against an omnipotent
          adversary? Consider, God has made your soul; and he can fill it with
          misery. He made your body, and can bring what torments he will upon
          it. God who made you, has given you a capacity to bear torment; and he
          has that capacity in his hands. How dreadful must it be to fall into
          the hands of such an enemy! Surely, “it is a fearful thing to fall
          into the hands of the living God,” Heb. 10:31.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) If God be your enemy, you may rationally conclude that he will
          act as such in his dealings with you. We have already observed that
          you have enmity without any love or true respect. So, if you continue
          to be so, God will appear to be your mere enemy; and will be so
          forever, without being reconciled. But if it be so, he will doubtless
          act as such. If he eternally hates you, he will act in his dealings
          with you, as one that hates you without any love or pity. The proper
          tendency and aim of hatred is the misery of the object hated; so that
          you may expect God will make you miserable, and that you will not be
          spared. — Now, God does not act as your mere enemy. If he corrects
          you, it is in measure. He now exercises abundance of mercy to you. He
          threatens you now; but it is in a way of warning, and so in a merciful
          way. He now calls, invites, and strives with you, and waits to be
          gracious to you. But hereafter there will be an end to all these
          things. In another world God will cease to show you mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) If you will continue God’s enemy, you may rationally conclude
          that God will deal with you so as to make it appear how dreadful it is
          to have God for an enemy. It is very dreadful to have a mighty prince
          for an enemy. “The wrath of a king is as the roaring of a lion,” Pro.
          19:12. But if the wrath of a man, a fellow-worm, be so terrible, what
          is the wrath of God! And God will doubtless show it to be immensely
          more dreadful. If you will be an enemy, God will act so as to glorify
          those attributes which he exercises as an enemy; which are his
          majesty, his power, and justice. His great majesty, his awful justice,
          and mighty power, shall be showed upon you. “What if God, willing to
          show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much
          long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction,” Rom. 9:22.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) Consider, what God has said he will do to his enemies. He has
          declared that they shall not escape; but that he will surely punish
          them. “Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies, thy right hand
          shall find out all those that hate thee,” Psa. 21:8. “And repayeth
          them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be
          slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face,” Deu.
          7:10. “The Lord shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy
          scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses,” Psa. 68:21.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yea, God hath sworn that he will be avenged on them; and that in a
          most awful and dreadful manner. “For I lift up my hand to heaven, and
          say, I live forever. If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take
          hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and I will
          reward them that hate me. I will make mine arrows drunk with blood
          (and my sword shall devour flesh), and that with the blood of the
          slain — from the beginning of revenges on the enemy,” Deu. 32:40, 41,
          42. The terribleness of the threatened destruction is here variously
          set forth. God “whets his glittering sword,” as one that prepares
          himself to do some great execution. “His hands take hold on judgment,”
          to signify that he will surely reward them as they deserve. “He will
          render vengeance to his enemies, and reward them that hate him.” i.e.
          He will render their full reward. “I will make mine arrows drunk with
          blood.” This signifies the greatness of the destruction. It shall not
          be a little of their blood that shall satisfy; but his arrows shall be
          glutted with their blood. “And his sword shall devour flesh.” That is,
          it shall make dreadful waste of it. This is the terrible manner in
          which God will one day rise up and execute vengeance on his enemies!
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the completeness of their destruction is represented in the
          following words: “The wicked shall perish, the enemies of the Lord
          shall be as the fat of lambs, they shall consume: into smoke shall
          they consume away,” Psa. 37:20. The fat of lambs, when it is burnt in
          the fire, burns all up; there is not so much as a cinder left; it all
          consumes into smoke. This represents the perfect destruction of God’s
          enemies in his wrath. So God hath promised Christ; that he would make
          his enemies his footstool, Psa. 110:1. i.e. He would pour the greatest
          contempt upon them, and as it were tread them under foot. Consider,
          that all these things will be executed on you, if you continue God’s
          enemies.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION VIII</p>
        <p>God may justly withhold mercy</p>
        <p>
          IF natural men are God’s enemies, hence we may learn, how justly God
          may refuse to show you mercy. For is God obliged to show mercy to his
          enemies? Is God bound to set his love on them that have no love to
          him; but hate him with perfect hatred? Is he bound to come and dwell
          with them that have an aversion to him, and choose to keep at a
          distance from him, and fly from him as one that is hateful to them?
          Even should you desire the salvation of your soul, is God bound to
          comply with your desires, when you always resist and oppose his will?
          Is God bound to put honor upon you, and to advance you to such dignity
          as to be a child of the King of kings, and the heir of glory, while at
          the same time you set him too low to have even the lowest place in
          your heart?
        </p>
        <p>
          This doctrine affords a strong argument for the absolute sovereignty
          of God, with respect to the salvation of sinners. If God is pleased to
          show mercy to his haters, it is certainly fit that he should do it in
          a sovereign way, without acting as any way obliged. God will show
          mercy to his mortal enemies; but then he will not be bound, he will
          have his liberty to choose the objects of his mercy; to show mercy to
          what enemy he pleases, and to punish and destroy which of his haters
          he pleases. And certainly this is a fit and reasonable thing. It is
          fit that God should distribute saving blessings in this way, and in no
          other, viz. in a sovereign and arbitrary way. And that ever anybody
          thought of or devised any other way for God to show mercy, than to
          have mercy on whom he will have mercy, must arise from ignorance of
          their own hearts, whereby they were insensible what enemies they
          naturally are to God. But consider here the following things:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How causelessly you are enemies to God. You have no manner of
          reason for it, either from what God is, or from what he has done. You
          have no reason for this from what he is. For he is an infinitely
          lovely and glorious Being. The fountain of all excellency, all that is
          amiable and lovely in the universe, is originally and eminently in
          him. Nothing can possibly be conceived of that could be lovely in God,
          that is not in him, and that in the greatest possible degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you have no reason for this, from what God has done. For he has
          been a good and bountiful God to you. He has exercised abundance of
          kindness to you; has carried you from the womb, preserved your life,
          taken care of you, and provided for you, all your life long. He has
          exercised great patience and long-suffering towards you. If it had not
          been for the kindness of God to you, what would have become of you?
          What would have become of your body? And what, before this time, would
          have become of your soul? And you are now, every day and hour,
          maintained by the goodness and bounty of God. Every new breath you
          draw, is a new gift of his to you. How causelessly then are you such
          dreadful enemies to God! And how justly might he for it eternally
          deprive you of all mercy, seeing you do thus requite God for his mercy
          and kindness to you!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Consider, how you would resent it, if others were such enemies to
          you, as you are to God. If they had their hearts so full of enmity to
          you; if they treated you with such contempt, and opposed you, as you
          do God; how would you resent it! Do you not find that you are apt
          greatly to resent it, when any oppose you, and show an ill spirit
          towards you? And though you excuse your own enmity against God from
          your corrupt nature that you brought into the world with you, which
          you could not help. Yet you do not excuse others for being enemies to
          you from their corrupt nature that they brought into the world, which
          they could not help; but are ready bitterly to resent it
          notwithstanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider therefore, if you, a poor, unworthy, unlovely creature, do so
          resent it, when you are hated, how may God justly resent it when you
          are enemies to him, an infinitely glorious Being; and a Being from
          whom you have received so much kindness!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. How unreasonable is it for you to imagine that you can oblige God
          to have respect to you by anything that you can do, continuing still
          to be his enemy. If you think you have prayed, and read, and done
          something considerable for God; yet who cares for the seeming kindness
          of an enemy? What value would you yourself set upon a man making a
          show of friendship, when you knew at the same time, that he was
          inwardly your mortal enemy? Would you look upon yourself obliged for
          such respect and kindness? Would you not rather abhor it? Would you
          count such respect to be valued, as Joab’s towards Amasa, who took him
          by the beard, and kissed him, and said, Art thou in health, my
          brother? And smote him at the same time under the fifth rib, and
          killed him! What if you do pray to God? Is he obliged to hear the
          prayers of an enemy? What if you have taken a great deal of pains? Is
          God obliged to give heaven for the prayers of an enemy? He may justly
          abhor your prayers, and all that you do in religion, as the flattery
          of a mortal enemy.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IX</p>
        <p>Practical Improvement</p>
        <p>HENCE we may learn,</p>
        <p>
          1. How wonderful is the love that is manifested in giving Christ to
          die for us. For this is love to enemies. “While we were enemies, we
          were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.” How wonderful was the
          love of God the Father, in giving such a gift to those who not only
          could not be profitable to him, but were his enemies, and to so great
          a degree! They had great enmity against him; yet so did he love them,
          that he gave his own Son to lay down his life, in order to save their
          lives. Though they had enmity that sought to pull God down from his
          throne; yet he so loved them, that he sent down Christ from heaven,
          from his throne there, to be in the form of a servant; and instead of
          a throne of glory, gave him to be nailed to the cross, and to be laid
          in the grave, that so we might be brought to a throne of glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          How wonderful was the love of Christ, in thus exercising dying love
          towards his enemies! He loved those that hated him, with hatred that
          sought to take away his life, so as voluntarily to lay down his life,
          that they might have life through him. “Herein is love; not that we
          loved him, but that he loved us, and laid down his life for us.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If we are all naturally God’s enemies, hence we may learn what a
          spirit it becomes us as Christians to possess towards our enemies.
          Though we are enemies to God, yet we hope that God has loved us, that
          Christ has died for us, that God has forgiven or will forgive us; and
          will do us good, and bestow infinite mercies and blessings upon us, so
          as to make us happy . All this mercy we hope has been, or will be,
          exercised towards us forever
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly then, it will not become us to be bitter in our spirits
          against those that are enemies to us, and have injured and ill treated
          us; and though they have yet an ill spirit towards us. Seeing we
          depend so much on God’s forgiving us, though enemies, we should
          exercise a spirit of forgiveness towards our enemies. And therefore
          our Savior inserted it in that prayer, which he dictated as a general
          directory to all; “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,”
          to enforce the duty upon us, and to show us how reasonable it is. And
          we ought to love them even while enemies; for so we hope God hath done
          to us. We should be the children of our Father, who is kind to the
          unthankful and evil. Luke 6:35.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we refuse thus to do, and are of another spirit, we may justly
          expect that God will deny us his mercy, as he had threatened! “If ye
          forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive
          you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
          Father forgive your trespasses,” Mat. 6:14, 15. The same we have in
          the parable of the man, who owed his lord ten thousand talents. Mat.
          18:23-35.
