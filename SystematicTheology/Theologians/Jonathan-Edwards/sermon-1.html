          The End of the Wicked Contemplated by the Righteous<br />
          by Jonathan Edwards
        </p>
        <p>Introduction</p>
        <p>
          IN this chapter we have a very particular account of the fall of
          Babylon, or the antichristian church, and of the vengeance of God
          executed upon her. Here it is proclaimed that Babylon the great is
          fallen, and become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every
          foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird; that her
          sins had reached unto heaven, and that God had remembered her iniquity
          that God gave commandment to reward her, as she had rewarded others,
          to double unto her double according to her works; in the cup she had
          filled, to fill to her double, and how much she had glorified herself,
          and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow to give her. And it
          is declared, that these plagues are come upon her in one day, death,
          mourning, and famine; and that she should be utterly burnt with fire;
          because strong is the Lord who judgeth her.
        </p>
        <p>
          These things have respect partly to the overthrow of the antichristian
          church this world, and partly to the vengeance of God upon her in the
          world to come. There is no necessity to suppose, that such extreme
          torments as are here mentioned will ever be executed upon papists, or
          upon the antichristian church, in this world. There will indeed be a
          dreadful and visible overthrow of that idolatrous church in this
          world. But we are not to understand the plagues here mentioned as
          exclusive of the vengeance which God will execute on the wicked
          upholders and promoters of antichristianism, and on the cruel
          antichristian persecutors, in another world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is evident by ver. 3, of the next chapter, where, with reference
          to the same destruction of antichrist which is spoken of in this
          chapter, it is said, “Her smoke rose up forever and ever;” in which
          words the eternal punishment of antichrist is evidently spoken of.
          Antichrist is here represented as being cast into hell, and there
          remaining forever after; he hath no place anywhere else but in hell.
          This is evident by ver. 20 of the next chapter, where, concerning the
          destruction of antichrist, it is said, “And the beast was taken, and
          with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with
          which he deceived them that received the mark of the beast, and them
          that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of
          fire burning with brimstone.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Not but that the wicked antichristians have in all ages gone to hell
          as they died, and not merely at the fall of antichrist; but then the
          wrath of God against antichrist, of which damnation is the fruit, will
          be made eminently visible here on earth, by many remarkable tokens.
          Then antichrist will be confined to hell, and will have no more place
          here on earth; much after the same manner as the devil is said at the
          beginning of Christ’s thousand years’ reign on earth, to be cast into
          the bottomless pit, as you may see in the beginning of the twentieth
          chapter. Not but that he had his place in the bottomless pit before;
          he was cast down to hell when he fell at first: 2 Peter 2:4, “Cast
          them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness.” But
          now, when he shall be suffered to deceive the nations no more, his
          kingdom will be confined to hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this text is contained part of what John heard uttered upon this
          occasion; and in these words we may observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. To whom this voice is directed, viz., to the holy prophets and
          apostles and the rest of the inhabitants of the heavenly world. When
          God shall pour out his wrath upon the antichristian church, it will he
          seen, and taken notice of, by all the inhabitants of heaven, even by
          holy prophets and apostles. Neither will they see as unconcerned
          spectators.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What they are called upon by the voice to do, viz. to rejoice over
          Babylon now destroyed, and lying under the wrath of God. They are not
          directed to rejoice over her in prosperity, but in flames, and
          beholding the smoke of her burning ascending up for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. A reason given: for God hath avenged YOU ON HER; i.e., God hath
          executed just vengeance upon her, for shedding your blood, and cruelly
          persecuting you. For thus the matter is represented, that antichrist
          had been guilty of shedding the blood of the holy prophets and
          apostles, as in chap. 16:6, “For they have shed the blood of saints
          and of prophets.” And in ver. 24 of this context, “In her was found
          the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all them that were slain
          on the earth.” Not that antichrist had literally shed the blood, of
          the prophets and apostles; but he had shed the blood of those who were
          their followers, who were of the same spirit, and of the same church,
          and same mystical body. The prophets and apostles in heaven are nearly
          related and united to the saints on earth; they live, as it were, in
          true Christians in all ages. So that by slaying these, persecutors
          show that they would slay the prophets and apostles, if they could;
          and they indeed do it as much as in them lies.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the same account, Christ says of the Jews in his time, Luke 11:50,
          “That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the
          foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; from the
          blood of Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the
          altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, it shall be required of
          this generation.” So Christ himself is said to have been crucified in
          the antichristian church, chap. 11:8: “And their dead; bodies shall
          lie in the street of the great City, which spiritually is called Sodom
          and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.” So all the inhabitants
          of heaven, all the saints from the beginning of the world, and the
          angels also, are called upon to rejoice over Babylon, because of God’s
          vengeance upon her, wherein he avenges them: they all of them had in
          effect been injured and persecuted by antichrist. Indeed they are not
          called upon to rejoice in having their revenge glutted, but in seeing
          justice executed, and in seeing the love and tenderness of God towards
          them, manifested in his severity towards their enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION 1.<br />
          When the saints in glory shall see the wrath of God executed on
          ungodly men, it will be no occasion of grief to them, but of
          rejoicing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not only the sight of God’s wrath executed on those wicked men
          who are of the antichristian church, which will be occasion of
          rejoicing to the saints in glory; but also the sight of the
          destruction of all God’s enemies: whether they have been the followers
          of antichrist or not, that alters not the case, if they have been the
          enemies of God, and of Jesus Christ. All wicked men will at last be
          destroyed together, as being united in the same cause and interest, as
          being all of Satan’s army. They will all stand together at the day of
          judgment, as being all of the same company.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if we understand the text to have respect only to a temporal
          execution of God’s wrath on his enemies, that will not alter the case.
          The thing they are called upon to rejoice at, is the execution of
          God’s wrath upon his and their enemies. And if it be matter of
          rejoicing to them to see justice executed in part upon them, or to see
          the beginning of the execution of it in this world; for the same
          reason will they rejoice with greater joy, in beholding it fully
          executed. For the thing here mentioned as the foundation of their joy,
          is the execution of just vengeance: Rejoice, for God hath avenged you
          on her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. I. The glorified saints will see the wrath of God executed upon
          ungodly men. This the Scriptures plainly teach us, that the righteous
          and the wicked in the other world see each other’s state. Thus the
          rich man in hell, and Lazarus and Abraham in heaven, are represented
          as seeing each other’s opposite states, in the 16th chap. of Luke. The
          wicked in their misery will see the saints in the kingdom of heaven.
          Luke 13:28, 29, “There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye
          shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the
          kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.”<br />
          So the saints in glory will see the misery of the wicked under the
          wrath of God. Isa. 64:24, “And they shall go forth and look on the
          carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm
          shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched.” And Rev. 14:. 9,
          10, “If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark
          in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of
          the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of
          his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, in
          the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.” The
          saints are not here mentioned, being included in Christ, as his
          members. The church is the fulness of Christ, and is called Christ, I
          Cor. 12:12+ So in the 19th chapter, ver. 2, 3, the smoke of Babylon’s
          torment is represented as rising up forever and ever, in the sight of
          the heavenly inhabitants.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the day of judgment, the saints in glory at Christ’s right hand,
          will see the wicked at the left hand in their amazement and horror,
          will hear the judge pronounce sentence upon them, saying, ” Depart, ye
          cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels;”
          and will see them go away into everlasting punishment. But the
          Scripture seems to hold forth to us, that the saints will not only see
          the misery of the wicked at the day of judgment, but the forementioned
          texts imply, that the state of the damned in hell will be in the view
          of the heavenly inhabitants; that the two worlds of happiness and
          misery will be in view of each other. Though we know not by what
          means, nor after what manner, it will be; yet the Scriptures certainly
          lead us to think, that they will some way or other have a direct and
          immediate apprehension of each other’s state. The saints in glory will
          see how the damned are tormented; they will see God’s threatenings
          fulfilled, and his wrath executed upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. II. When they shall see it, it will be no occasion of grief to
          them. The miseries of the damned in hell will be inconceivably great.
          When they shall come to bear the wrath of the Almighty poured out upon
          them without mixture, and executed upon them without pity or
          restraint, or any mitigation; it will doubtless cause anguish, and
          horror, and amazement vastly beyond all the sufferings and torments
          that ever any man endured in this world; yea, beyond all extent of our
          words or thoughts. For God in executing wrath upon ungodly men will
          act like an Almighty God. The Scripture calls this wrath, God’s and
          the fierceness of his wrath; and we are told that this is to show
          God’s wrath, and to make his power known; or to make known how
          dreadful his wrath is, and how great his power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The saints in glory will see this, and be far more sensible of it than
          now we can possibly be. They will be far more sensible how dreadful
          the wrath of God is, and will better understand how terrible the
          sufferings of the damned are; yet this will be no occasion of grief to
          them. They will not be sorry for the damned; it will cause no
          uneasiness or dissatisfaction to them; but on the contrary, when they
          have this sight, it will excite them to joyful praises.-These two
          things are evidences of it:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the seeing of the wrath of God executed upon the damned,
          should cause grief in the saints in glory, is inconsistent with that
          state of perfect happiness in which they are. There can no such thing
          as grief enter, to be an alloy to the happiness and joy of that world
          of blessedness. Grief is an utter stranger in that world. God hath
          promised that he will wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there
          shall he no more sorrow. Rev. 20:4, and chap. 7:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The saints in heaven possess all things as their own, and therefore
          all things contribute to their joy and happiness. The Scriptures teach
          that the saints in glory inherit all things. This God said in John’s
          hearing, when he had the vision of the New Jerusalem, Rev. 21:7. And
          the Scriptures teach us to understand this absolutely of all the works
          of creation and providence. 1, Cor. 3:21, 22, “All things are yours,
          whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death,
          or things present, or things to come; all are yours. Here the apostle
          teaches, that all things in the world to come, or in the future and
          eternal world, are the saints; not only life, but death; men, and
          angels, and devils, heaven and hell, are theirs, to contribute to
          their joy and happiness. Therefore the damned and their misery, their
          sufferings and the wrath of God poured out upon them, will be an
          occasion of joy to them. If there were any thing whatsoever that did
          not contribute to their joy, but caused grief, then there would be
          something which would not be theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the torments of the damned are no matter of grief, but of joy, to
          the inhabitants of heaven, is very clearly expressed in several
          passages of this book of Revelation; particularly by chap. 16:57, and
          chap. 19 at the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION II.<br />
          (Why the sufferings of the wicked will not be cause of grief to the
          righteous, but the contrary.)
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Negatively; it will not be because the saints in heaven are the
          subjects of any ill disposition; but on the contrary, this rejoicing
          of theirs will be the fruit of an amiable and excellent disposition:
          it will be the fruit of a perfect holiness and conformity to Christ,
          the holy Lamb of God. The devil delights in the misery of men from
          cruelty, and from envy and revenge, and because he delights in misery,
          for its own sake, from a malicious disposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be from exceedingly different principles, and for quite other
          reasons, that the just damnation of the wicked will be an occasion of
          rejoicing to the saints in glory. It will not be because they delight
          in seeing the misery of others absolutely considered. The damned
          suffering divine vengeance will be no occasion of joy to the saints
          merely as it is the misery of others, or because it is pleasant to
          them to behold the misery of others merely for its own sake. The
          rejoicing of the saints on this occasion is no argument, that they are
          not of a most amiable and excellent spirit, or that there is any
          defect on that account, that there is any thing wanting, which would
          render them of a more amiable disposition. It is no argument that they
          have not a spirit of goodness and love reigning in them in absolute
          perfection, or that herein they do not excel the greatest instances of
          it on earth, as much as the stars are higher than the earth, or the
          sun brighter than a glowworm.
        </p>
        <p>
          And whereas the heavenly inhabitants are in the text called upon to
          rejoice over Babylon, because God had avenged them on her; it is not
          to be understood that they are to rejoice in having their revenge
          glutted, but to rejoice, in seeing the justice of God executed, and in
          seeing his love to them in executing it on his enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Positively; the sufferings of the damned will be no occasion of
          grief to the heavenly inhabitants, as they will have no love nor pity
          to the damned as such. It will be no argument of want of a spirit of
          love in them, that they do not love the damned; for the heavenly
          inhabitants will know that it is not fit that they should love them,
          because they will know then, that God has no love to them, nor pity
          for them; but that they are the objects of God’s eternal hatred. And
          they will then be perfectly conformed to God in their wills and
          affections. They will love what God loves, and that only. However the
          saints in heaven may have loved the damned while here, especially
          those of them who were near and dear to them in this world, they will
          have no love to them hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be an occasion of their rejoicing, as the glory of God will
          appear in it. The glory of God appears in all his works: and therefore
          there is no work of God which the saints in glory shall behold and
          contemplate but what will be an occasion of rejoicing to them. God
          glorifies himself in the eternal damnation of the ungodly men. God
          glorifies himself in all that he doth; but he glorifies himself
          principally in, his eternal disposal of his intelligent creatures,
          some are appointed to everlasting life, and others left to everlasting
          death.
        </p>
        <p>
          The saints in heaven will be perfect in their love to God: their
          hearts will be all a flame of love to God, and therefore they will
          greatly value the glory of God, and will exceedingly delight in seeing
          him glorified. The saints highly value the glory of God here in this,
          but how much more will they so do in the world to come They will
          therefore greatly rejoice in all that contributes to that glory. The
          glory of God will in their esteem be of greater consequence, than the
          welfare of thousands and millions of souls.-Particularly,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) They will rejoice in seeing the justice of God glorified in the
          sufferings of the damned. The misery of the damned, dreadful as it is,
          is but what justice requires. They in heaven will see and know it much
          more clearly, than any of us do here. They will see how perfectly just
          and righteous their punishment is, and therefore how properly
          inflicted by the supreme Governor of the world. They will greatly
          rejoice to see justice take place, to see that all the sin and
          wickedness that have been committed in the world is remembered of God,
          and has its due punishment. The sight of this strict and immutable
          justice of God will render him amiable and adorable in their eyes.
          They will rejoice when they see him who is their Father and eternal
          portion so glorious in his justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there will be no remaining difficulties about the justice of God,
          about the absolute decrees of God, or any thing pertaining to the
          dispensations of God towards men. But divine justice in the
          destruction of the wicked will then appear as light without darkness,
          and will shine as the sun without clouds, and on this account will
          they sing joyful songs of praise to God, as we see the saints and
          angels do, when God pours the vials of his wrath upon antichrist; Rev.
          16:57 They sing joyfully to God on this account, that true and
          righteous are his judgments, Rev. 19:16. They seeing God so strictly
          just will make them value his love the more. Mercy and grace are more
          valuable on this account. The more they shall see of the justice of
          God the more will they prize and rejoice in his love.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) They will rejoice in it, as it will be a glorious manifestation
          of the power and majesty of God. God will show his own greatness in
          executing vengeance on ungodly men. This is mentioned as one end of
          the destruction the ungodly: “What if God, willing to show his wrath,
          and make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels
          of wrath fitted to destruction ?” God will hereby show how much he is
          above his enemies. There are many now in the world, who proudly lift
          up themselves against God. There are many open opposers of the cause
          and interest of Christ. “They set their mouth against the heavens, and
          their tongue walketh through the earth.” Then God will show his
          glorious power in destroying these enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The power of God is sometimes spoken of as very glorious, as appearing
          in the temporal destruction of his enemies: Exod. 15:6, “Thy right
          hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power; thy right hand, O Lord,
          hath dashed in pieces the enemy.” But how much more glorious will it
          appear in his triumphing over, and dashing in pieces at once, all his
          enemies, wicked men and devils together, all his haughty foes! The
          power of God will gloriously appear in dashing to pieces his enemies
          as a potter’s vessel. Moses rejoiced and sang when he saw God glorify
          his power in the destruction of Pharaoh and his host at the Red Sea.
          But how much more will the saints in glory rejoice when they shall see
          God gloriously triumphing over all his enemies in their eternal ruin!
          Then it will appear how dreadful God is, and how dreadful a thing it
          is to disobey and condemn him. It is often mentioned as a part of the
          glory of God, that he is a terrible God. To see the majesty, and
          greatness, and terribleness of God, appearing in the destruction of
          his enemies, will cause the saints to rejoice; and when they shall see
          how great and terrible a being God is, how will they prize his favor!
          How will they rejoice that they are the objects of his love! How will
          they praise him the more joyfully, that he should choose them to be
          his children, and to live in the enjoyment of him!
        </p>
        <p>
          It will occasion rejoicing in them, as they will have the greater
          sense their own happiness, by seeing the contrary misery. It is the
          nature of pleasure and pain, of happiness and misery, greatly to
          heighten the sense of each other. Thus the seeing of the happiness of
          others tends to make men more sensible of their own calamities; and
          the seeing of the calamities of others tends to heighten the sense of
          our own enjoyments.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the saints in glory, therefore, shall see the doleful state of
          the damned, how will this heighten their sense of the blessedness of
          their own state, so exceedingly different from it! When they shall see
          how miserable others of their fellowcreatures are, who were naturally
          in the same circumstances with themselves; when they shall see the
          smoke of their torment, and the raging of the flames of their burning,
          and hear their dolorous shrieks and cries, and consider that they in
          the mean time are in the most blissful state, and shall surely be in
          it to all eternity ; how will they rejoice!
        </p>
        <p>
          This will give them a joyful sense of the grace and love of God to
          them; because hereby they will see how great a benefit they have by
          it. When they, shall see the dreadful miseries of the damned, and
          consider that they deserved, the same misery, and that it was
          sovereign grace, and nothing else, which made them so much to differ
          from the damned, that, if it had not been for that, they would have
          been in the same condition; but that God from all eternity was pleased
          to set his love upon them, that Christ hath laid down his life for
          them, and hath made them thus gloriously happy forever, O how will
          they admire that dying love of Christ, which has redeemed them from so
          great a misery, and purchased for them so great happiness, and has so
          distinguished them from others of their fellowcreatures! How joyfully
          will they sing to God and the Lamb, when they behold this!
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION III.<br />
          An objection answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objection is, “If we are apprehensive of the damnation of others
          now, it in no wise becomes us to rejoice at it, but to lament it. If
          we see others in imminent danger of going to hell, it is accounted a
          very sorrowful thing, and it is looked upon as an argument of a
          senseless and wicked spirit, to look upon it otherwise. When it is a
          very dead time with respect to religion, and a very degenerate and
          corrupt time among a people, it is accounted a thing greatly to be
          lamented; and on this account, that at such times there are but few
          converted and saved, and many perish. Paul tells us, that he had great
          heaviness and continual sorrow in his heart, because so many of the
          Jews were in a perishing state: Rom. 9:1, 2, 3, “I say the truth in
          Christ, I lie not, my conscience so bearing me witness in the Holy
          Ghost, that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
          For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ, for my
          brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.” And if a neighbor die,
          and his death be attended with circumstances which look darkly as to
          the state of his soul, we account it a sorrowful thing, because he has
          left us no more comfortable grounds to hope for his salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is it not then an unbecoming thing in the saints in glory to
          rejoice when they see the damnation of the ungodly ?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ans. 1. It is now our duty to love all men, though they are wicked;
          but it will not be a duty to love wicked men hereafter. Christ, by
          many precepts in his word, hath made it our duty to love all men. We
          are commanded to love wicked men, and our enemies and persecutors. But
          this command doth not extend to the saints in glory, with respect to
          the damned in hell. Nor is there the same reason that it should. We
          ought now to love all, and even wicked men; we know not but that God
          loves them. However wicked any man is, yet we know not but that he is
          one whom God loved from eternity, we know not but that Christ loved
          him with a dying love, had his name upon his heart before the world
          was, and had respect to him when he endured those bitter agonies on
          the cross. We know not but that he is to be our companion in glory to
          all eternity.<br />
          But this is not the case in another world. The saints in glory will
          know, concerning the damned in hell, that God never loved them, but
          that he hates them, and will be forever hated of God. This hatred of
          God will be fully declared to them; they will see it, and will see the
          fruits of it in their misery. Therefore, when God has thus declared
          his hatred of the damned, and the saints see it, it will be no way
          becoming in the saints to love them, nor to mourn over them. It
          becomes the saints fully and perfectly to consent to what God doth,
          without any reluctance or opposition of spirit; yea, it becomes them
          to rejoice in every thing that God sees meet to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ans 2. We ought now to seek and be concerned for the salvation of
          wicked men, because now they are capable subjects of it. Wicked men,
          though they may be very wicked, yet are capable subjects of mercy. It
          is yet a day of grace with them, and they have the offers of
          salvation. Christ is as yet seeking their salvation; he is calling
          upon them, inviting and wooing them, he stands at the door and knocks.
          He is using many means with them, is calling them, saying, Turn ye,
          turn ye, why will ye die? The day of his patience is yet continued to
          them; and if Christ is seeking their salvation, surely we ought to
          seek it.<br />
          God is wont now to make men the means of one another’s salvation; yea,
          it is his ordinary way so to do. He makes the concern and endeavors of
          his people the means of bringing home many to Christ. Therefore they
          ought to be concerned for and endeavor it. But it will not be so in
          another world; there wicked men will be no longer capable subjects of
          mercy. The saints will know, that it is the will of God the wicked
          should he miserable to all eternity. It will therefore cease to be
          their duty any more to seek their salvation, or to concerned about
          their misery. On the other hand, it will be their duty to rejoice in
          the will and glory of God. It is not our duty to be sorry that God
          hath executed just vengeance on the devils, concerning whom the will
          of God in their eternal state is already known to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ans. 3. Rejoicing at the calamities of others now, rests not on the
          same grounds as that of the saints in glory. The evil of rejoicing at
          others’ calamity now, consists in our envy, or revenge, or some such
          disposition is gratified therein: and not that God is glorified, that
          the majesty and justice of God gloriously shine forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ans. 4. The different circumstances of our nature now, from what will
          be hereafter, make that a virtue now which will be no virtue then. For
          instance, if a man be of a virtuous disposition, the circumstances of
          our nature now are such, that it will necessarily, show itself by
          natural affection, and to be without natural affection is a very
          vicious disposition; and is so mentioned in Rom. i. 31. But natural
          affection is no virtue in the saints in glory. Their virtue will
          exercise itself in a higher manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ans. 5. The vengeance inflicted on many of the wicked will be a
          manifestation of God’s love to the saints. One way whereby God shows
          his love to the saints, is by destroying their enemies. God hath said,
          “He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye.” And it is
          often mentioned in Scripture, as instance of the great love of God to
          his people, that his wrath is so awakened, when they are wronged and
          injured. Thus Christ hath promised that God will avenge his own elect,
          Luke 18:. 7, and hath said, that “if any man offend one of his little
          ones, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
          neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea,” Matt. 18:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the saints in glory will see the great love of God to them, in the
          dreadful vengeance which he shall inflict on those who have injured
          and persecuted them; and the view of this love of God to them will be
          just cause of their rejoicing. Thus, in the text, heaven and the holy
          apostles and prophets are called to rejoice over their enemies,
          because God hath avenged them of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION IV.<br />
          The ungodly warned.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall apply this subject only in one use, viz., of warning to
          ungodly men. And in order to this, I desire such to consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How destitute of any comforting consideration your condition will
          be, if you perish at last. You will have none to pity you. Look which
          way you will, before or behind, on the right hand or left, look up to
          heaven, or look about you in hell, and you will see none to condole
          your case, or to exercise any pity towards you, in your dreadful
          condition. You must bear these flames, you must bear that torment and
          amazement, day and night, forever, and never have the comfort of
          considering, that there is so much as one that pities your case; there
          never will one tear be dropped for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) You have now been taught that you will have no pity from the
          created inhabitants of heaven. If you shall look to them, you will see
          them all rejoicing at the sight of the glory of God’s justice, power,
          and terrible majesty, manifested in your torment. You will see them in
          a blissful and glorious state: you will see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
          and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God; you will see many come
          from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the
          south, and sit down in that glorious kingdom; and, will see them all
          with one voice, and with united joy, praising God for glorifying
          himself in your destruction. You will wail and gnash your teeth under
          your own torments, and with envy of their happiness; but they will
          rejoice and sing: Isa. 65:13, 14, “Therefore thus saith the Lord,
          Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my
          servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants
          shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed: behold, my servants shall sing
          for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl
          for vexation of spirit.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) God will exercise no pity towards you. If you might have his pity
          in any degree, that would be of more worth to you than thousands of
          worlds. That would make your case to be not without comfort and hope.
          But God will exercise no pity towards you. He hath often said
          concerning wicked men, that his eye shall not spare, neither will he
          have pity, Ezek. 5:11, and 7:4, 9, and 8:18. He will cast upon you,
          and not spare; you will see nothing in God, and receive nothing from
          him, but perfect hatred, and the fierceness of his wrath; nothing but
          the mighty falls or outpourings of wrath upon you every moment; and no
          cries will avail to move God to any pity, or in the least to move him
          to lighten his hand, or assuage the fierceness and abate the power of
          your torments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ, the Redeemer, will have no pity on you. Though he had so
          much love to sinners, as to be willing to lay down his life for them,
          and offers you the benefits of his blood, while you are in this world,
          and often calls upon you to accept them; yet then he will have no pity
          upon you. You never will hear any more instructions from him; he will
          utterly refuse to be your instructor: on the contrary, he will be your
          judge, to pronounce sentence against you.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. You will find none that will pity you in hell. The devils will not
          pity you, but will be your tormentors, as roaring lions or hellhounds
          to tear you in pieces continually. And other wicked men who shall be
          there will be like devils; they will have no pity on you, but will
          hate, and curse, and torment you. And you yourselves will be like
          devils; you will be like devils to yourselves, and will be your own
          tormentors.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Consider what an aggravation what you have heard under this
          doctrine will be to your misery. Consider how it will be at the day of
          judgment, when you shall see Christ coming in the clouds of heaven,
          when you shall begin to wail and cry, as knowing that you are those
          who are to be condemned; and perhaps you will be ready to fly to some
          of your godly friends; but you will obtain no help from them: you will
          see them unconcerned for you, with joyful countenances ascending to
          meet the Lord, and not the less joyful for the horror in which they
          see you. And when you shall stand before the tribunal at the left
          hand, among devils, trembling and astonished, and shall have the
          dreadful sentence passed upon you, you will at the same time see the
          blessed company of saints and angels at the right hand rejoicing, and
          shall hear them shout forth the praises of God, while they hear your
          sentence pronounced. You will then see those godly people, with whom
          you shall have been acquainted, and who shall have been your
          neighbors, and with whom you now often converse, rejoicing at the
          pronunciation and execution of your sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps there are now some godly people, to whom you are near and
          dear, who are tenderly concerned for you, are ready to pity you under
          all calamities, and willing to help you; and particularly are tenderly
          concerned for your poor soul, and have put up many fervent prayers for
          you. How will you bear to hear these singing for joy of heart, while
          you are crying for sorrow of heart and howling for vexation of spirit,
          and even singing the more joyful for the glorious justice of God which
          they behold in your eternal condemnation!
        </p>
        <p>
          You that have godly parents, who in this world have tenderly loved
          you, who were wont to look upon your welfare as their own, and were
          wont to be grieved for you when any thing calamitous befell you in
          this world, and especially were greatly concerned for the good of your
          souls, industriously sought, and earnestly prayed for their salvation;
          how will you bear to see them in the kingdom of God, crowned with
          glory? Or how will you bear to see them receiving the blessed
          sentence, and going up with shouts and songs, to enter with Christ
          into the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world,
          while you are amongst a company of devils, and are turned away with
          the most bitter cries, to enter into everlasting burnings, prepared
          for the devil and his angels? How will you bear to see your parents,
          who in this life had so dear an affection for you, now without any
          love to you, approving the sentence of condemnation, when Christ shall
          with indignation bid you depart, wretched, cursed creatures, into
          eternal burnings ? How will you bear to see and hear them praising the
          Judge, for his justice exercised in pronouncing this sentence, and
          hearing it with holy joy in their countenances, and shouting forth the
          praises and hallelujahs of God and Christ on that account?
        </p>
        <p>
          When they shall see what manifestations of amazement there will be in
          you, at the hearing of this dreadful sentence, and that every syllable
          of it pierces you like a thunderbolt, and sinks you into the lowest
          depths of horror and despair; when they shall behold you with a
          frightened, amazed countenance, trembling and astonished, and shall
          hear you groan and gnash your teeth; these things will not move them
          at all to pity you, but you will see them with a holy joyfulness in
          their countenances, and with songs in their mouths. When they shall
          see you turned away and beginning to enter into the great furnace, and
          shall see how you shrink at it, and hear how you shriek and cry out;
          yet they will not be at all grieved for you, but at the same time you
          will hear from them renewed praises and hallelujahs for the true and
          righteous judgments of God, in so dealing with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then you will doubtless remember how those your glorified parents
          seemed to be concerned for your salvation, while you were here in this
          world; you will remember how they were wont to counsel and warn you,
          and how little you regarded their counsels, and how they seemed to be
          concerned and grieved, that there appeared no more effect of their
          endeavors for the good of your souls. You will then see them praising
          God for executing just vengeance on you, for setting so light by their
          counsels and reproofs. However here they loved you, and were concerned
          for you, now they will rise up in judgment against you, and will
          declare how your sins are aggravated by the endeavors which they to no
          purpose used with you, to bring you to forsake sin and practice
          virtue, and to seek and serve God; but you were obstinate under all,
          and would not hearken to them. They will declare how inexcusable you
          are upon this account. And the Judge shall execute the more terrible
          wrath upon you on this account, that you have made no better
          improvement of your parents’ instructions, they will joyfully praise
          God for it. After they shall have seen you lie in hell thousands of
          years, and your torment shall yet continue without any rest, day or
          night; they will not begin to pity you then; they will praise God,
          that his justice appears in the eternity of your misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          You that have godly husbands, or wives, or brethren, or sisters, with
          whom you have been wont to dwell under the same roof, and to eat at
          the same table, consider how it will be with you, when you shall come
          to part with them, when they shall be taken and you left: Luke 17:34,
          35, 36, “I tell you, in that night, there shall be two men in one bed;
          the one shall be taken and the other left. Two women shall be grinding
          together the one shall be taken and the other left. Two men shall be
          in the field; the one shall be taken and the other left.” However you
          may wail and lament, when you see them parted from you, they being
          taken and you left, you will see in them no signs of sorrow, that you
          are not taken with them; that you ascend not with them to meet the
          Lord in the air, but are left below to be consumed with the world,
          which is reserved unto fire, against the day of the perdition of
          ungodly men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those wicked men, who shall go to hell from under the labors of pious
          and faithful ministers, will see those ministers rejoicing and
          praising God upon the occasion of their destruction. Consider, ye that
          have long lived under Mr. Stoddard’s ministry, and are yet in a
          natural condition, how dreadful it will be to you to see him who was
          so tenderly concerned for the good of your souls while he was here,
          and so earnestly sought your salvation, to see him rising up in
          judgment against you, declaring your inexcusableness, declaring how
          often he warned you; how plainly he set your danger before you, and
          told you of the opportunity that you had; how fully he set forth the
          miserable condition in which you were, and the necessity there was
          that you should obtain an interest in Christ; how movingly and
          earnestly he exhorted you to get into a better state, and how
          regardless you were; how little you minded all that he said to you;
          how you went on still in your trespasses, hardened your necks, and
          made your hearts as an adamant, and refused to return! How dreadful
          will it be to you to hear him declaring how inexcusable you are upon
          these accounts! How will you be cut to the heart, when you shall see
          him approving the sentence of condemnation, which the Judge shall
          pronounce against you, and judging and sentencing you with Christ, as
          an assessor in judgment; for the saints shall judge the world (1 Cor.
          6:2); and when you shall see him rejoicing in the execution of justice
          upon you for all your unprofitableness under his ministry!
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Consider what a happy opportunity you have in your hands now. Now
          your case is very different from the case of wicked men in another
          world, of which you have now heard; and particularly in the following
          respects.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) God makes it the duty of all the godly now to be concerned for
          your salvation. As to those who are damned in hell, the saints in
          glory are not concerned for their welfare, and have no love nor pity
          towards them; and if you perish hereafter, it will be an occasion of
          joy to all the godly. But now God makes it the duty of all the godly,
          to love you with a sincere good-will and earnest affection. God doth
          not excuse men from loving you, nor your ill qualities: though you are
          wicked and undeserving, yet God makes it the duty of all sincerely to
          wish well to you; and it is a heinous sin in the sight of God for any
          to hate you. He requires all to be concerned for your salvation, and
          by all means to seek it. It is their duty now to lament your danger,
          and to pray for mercy to you, that you may be converted and brought
          home to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the godly who know you, desire your salvation, and are ready to
          seek, and pray for it. If you be now in distress about the condition
          of your souls, you are not in such a forsaken, helpless condition, as
          those that are damned; but you may find many to pray for you, many who
          are willing to assist you by their advice and counsels, and all with a
          tender concern, and with hearty wishes that your souls may prosper.
          Now some of you have godly friends who are near and dear to you; you
          are beloved of those who have a great interest in heaven, and who have
          power with God by their prayer’s: you have the blessing of living
          under the same roof with them. Some of you have godly parents to pray
          for you, and to counsel and instruct you, who you may be sure will do
          it with sincere love and concern for you. And there is not only the
          command of God, God hath not only made it the duty of others to seek
          your salvation, but hath given encouragement to others to seek it. He
          gives encouragement that they may obtain help for you by their
          prayers, and that they may be instrumental of your spiritual good. God
          reveals it to be his manner, to make our sincere endeavors a mean of
          each other’s good. How different is the case with you from what it is
          with those that are already damned! And how happy an opportunity have
          you in your hands, if you would but improve it!
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Now you live where there is a certain order of men appointed to
          make it the business of their lives to seek your salvation. Now you
          have ministers, not to rise up in judgment against you; but in
          Christ’s stead, to beseech you to be reconciled to God, 2 Cor. 5:20.
          God hath not only made it the duty of all to wish well to your souls,
          and occasionally to endeavor to promote your spiritual interests, but
          he hath set apart certain persons, to make it their whole work, in
          which they should spend their days and their strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Christ himself is now seeking your salvation. He seeks it by the
          forementioned means, by appointing men to make it their business to
          seek it; he seeks it by them; they are his instruments, and they
          beseech you in Christ’s stead, to be reconciled to God. He seeks it in
          commanding our neighbors to seek it. Christ is represented in
          Scripture, as wooing the souls of sinner’s. He uses means to persuade
          them to choose and accept of their own salvation. He often invites
          them to come to him that they may have life, that they may find rest
          to their souls; to come and take of the water of life freely. He
          stands at the door and knocks; and ceases not, although sinners for a
          long time refuse him. He bears repeated repulses from them, and yet
          mercifully continues knocking, Saying, “Open to me, that I may come in
          and sup with you, and you with me.” At the doors of many sinners he
          stands thus knocking for many years together. Christ is become a most
          importunate suitor to sinners, that he may become their sovereign. He
          is often setting before them the need they have of him, the miserable
          condition in which they are, and the great provision that is made for
          the good of their souls and he invites them to accept of this
          provision, and promises it shall be theirs upon their mere acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus how earnestly did Christ seek the salvation of Jerusalem, and he
          wept over it when they refused: Luke 19:41, 42, “And when he was come
          near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, saying, If thou hadst
          known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong
          unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.” And Matt.
          23:37, “0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
          stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered
          thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
          wings, and ye would not!” Thus Christ is now seeking your salvation;
          such an opportunity have you now in your hands. Consider therefore how
          many means Christ is using with you, to bring you to salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides those things which have been now mentioned, some of you have a
          degree of the inward strivings and influences of the Spirit, which
          makes your opportunity much greater. You have Christ’s internal calls
          and knockings. All the persons of the Trinity are now seeking your
          salvation. God the Father hath sent his Son, who hath made way for
          your salvation, and removed all difficulties, except those which are
          with your own heart. And he is waiting to be gracious to you; the door
          of his mercy stands open to you; he hath set a fountain open for you
          to wash in from sin and uncleanness. Christ is calling, inviting, and
          wooing you; and the Holy Ghost is striving with you by his internal
          motions and influences.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If you now repent, before it be too late, the saints and angels in
          glory will rejoice at your repentance. If you repent not till it is
          too late, they will, as you have heard, rejoice in seeing justice
          executed upon you. But if you now repent, they will rejoice at your
          welfare, that you who were lost, are found; that you who were dead,
          are alive again. They will rejoice that you are come to so happy a
          state already, and that you are in due time to inherit eternal
          happiness, Luke 15:10. So that if now you will improve your
          opportunity, there will be a very different occasion of joy in heaven
          concerning you, than that of which the doctrine speaks; not a
          rejoicing on occasion of your misery, but on occasion of your
          unspeakable blessedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. If you repent before it is too late, you yourselves shall be of
          that joyful company. They will be so far from rejoicing on occasion of
          your ruin, that you yourselves will be of that glorious company, who
          will rejoice in all the works of God, who will have all tears wiped
          away from their eyes, to whom there will be no more death, nor sorrow,
          nor crying, and from whom sorrow and sighing shall flee away. You
          yourselves will be of those who will rejoice at the glorious display
          of God’s majesty and justice in his wrath on his enemies. You will be
          of those that shall sing for joy of heart at the day of judgment,
          while others mourn for sorrow of heart, and bowl for vexation of
          spirit; and you will enter into the joy of your Lord, and there shall
          never be any end or abatement of our joy.
