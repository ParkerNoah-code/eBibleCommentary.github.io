          The Final Judgment<br />
          Or<br />
          The World Judged Righteously by Jesus Christ
        </p>
        <p>
          Acts 17:31, “Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will
          judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained.”
        </p>
        <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
        <p>
          Subject: God hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in
          righteousness by Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          THESE words are a part of the speech which Paul made in Mars’ hill, a
          place of concourse of the judges and learned men of Athens. Athens was
          the principal city of that part of Greece which was formerly a common
          wealth by itself, and was the most noted place in the whole world for
          learning, philosophy, and human wisdom, And it continued so for many
          ages, till at length the Romans having conquered Greece, its renown
          from that time began to diminish. And Rome having borrowed learning of
          it, began to rival it in science, and in the polite and civil arts.
          However, it was still very famous in the days of Christ and the
          apostles, and was a place of concourse for wise and learned men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, when Paul came thither, and began to preach concerning
          Jesus Christ, a man who had lately been crucified at Jerusalem (as in
          Acts 17:18), the philosophers thronged about him, to hear what he had
          to say. The strangeness of his doctrine excited their curiosity, for
          they spent their time in endeavoring to find out new things, and
          valued themselves greatly upon their being the authors of new
          discoveries, as we are informed in Acts 17:21. They despised his
          doctrine in their hearts, and esteemed it very ridiculous, calling the
          apostle a babbler. For the preaching of Christ crucified was to the
          Greeks foolishness, 1 Cor. 1:23, yet the Epicurean and Stoic
          philosophers, two different sects, had a mind to hear what the babbler
          had to say.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon this Paul rises up in the midst of them, and makes a speech. And
          as he speaks to philosophers and men of learning, he speaks quite
          differently from his common mode of address. There is evidently, in
          his discourse, a greater depth of thought, more philosophical
          reasoning, and a more elevated style, than are to be found in his
          ordinary discourses to common men. His speech is such as was likely to
          draw the attention and gain the assent of philosophers. He shows
          himself to be no babbler, but a man who could offer such reason, as
          they, however they valued themselves upon their wisdom, were not able
          to gainsay. His practice here is agreeable to what he saith of
          himself, 1 Cor. 9:22, “that he became all things to all men, that he
          might by all means save some.” He not only to the weak became as weak,
          that he might gain the weak, but to the wise he became as wise, that
          he might gain the wise.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, he reasons with them concerning their worship of
          idols. He declares to them the true God, and points out how
          unreasonable it is to suppose, that he delights in such superstitious
          worship. He begins with this, because they were most likely to hearken
          to it, as being so evidently agreeable to the natural light of human
          reason, and also agreeable to what some of their own poets and
          philosophers had said (Acts 17:28). He begins not immediately to tell
          them about Jesus Christ, his dying for sinners, and his resurrection
          from the dead. But first draws their attention with that to which they
          were more likely to hearken. And then, having thus introduced himself,
          he proceeds to speak concerning Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          He tells them, the times of this ignorance concerning the true God, in
          which they had hitherto been, God winked at. He suffered the world to
          lie in heathenish darkness. But now the appointed time was come, when
          he expected men should everywhere repent, “because he had appointed a
          day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man
          whom he hath ordained.” As an enforcement to the duty of turning to
          God from their ignorance, superstition, and idolatry, the apostle
          brings in this, that God had appointed such a day of judgment. And as
          a proof of this he brings the resurrection Christ from the dead.
        </p>
        <p>Concerning the words of the text, we may observe,</p>
        <p>
          That in them the apostle speaks of the general judgment: He will judge
          the WORLD. — The time when this shall be, on the appointed day: He
          hath appointed a day. — How the world is to be judged: In
          righteousness. — The man by whom it is to be judged: Christ Jesus whom
          God raised from the dead.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          There is a day coming in which there will be a general righteous
          judgment of the whole world by Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          In speaking upon this subject, I shall show, That God is the Supreme
          Judge of the world. That there is a time coming, when God will, in the
          most public and solemn manner, judge the whole world. That the person
          by whom he will judge it is Jesus Christ. That the transactions of
          that day will be greatly interesting and truly awful. That all shall
          be done in righteousness. And finally, I shall take notice of those
          things which shall be immediately consequent upon the judgment.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>God is the supreme judge of the world.</p>
        <p>
          I. God is so by right. He is by right the supreme and absolute ruler
          and disposer of all things, both in the natural and moral world. The
          rational understanding part of the creation is indeed subject to a
          different sort of government from that to which irrational creatures
          are subject. God governs the sun, moon, and stars. He governs even the
          motes of dust which fly in the air. Not a hair of our heads falleth to
          the ground without our heavenly Father. God also governs the brute
          creatures. By his providence, he orders, according to his own decrees,
          all events concerning those creatures. And rational creatures are
          subject to the same sort of government. All their actions, *1* and all
          events relating to them, being ordered by superior providence,
          according to absolute decrees so that no event that relates to them
          ever happens without the disposal of God, according to his own
          decrees. The rule of this government is God’s wise decree, and nothing
          else.
        </p>
        <p>
          But rational creatures, because they are intelligent and voluntary
          agents, are the subjects of another kind of government. They are so
          only with respect to those of their actions, in which they are causes
          by counsel, or with respect to their voluntary actions. The government
          of which I now speak is called moral government, and consists in two
          things, in giving laws, and in judging.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is, with respect to this sort of government, by right the
          sovereign ruler of the world. He is possessed of this right by reason
          of his infinite greatness and excellency, by which he merits, and is
          perfectly and solely fit for, the office of supreme ruler. He that is
          so excellent as to be infinitely worthy of the highest respect of the
          creature, has thereby a right to that respect. He deserves it by a
          merit of condignity, so that it is injustice to deny it to him. And he
          that is perfectly wise and true, and is only so regarded, has a right
          in everything to be regarded, and to have his determinations attended
          to and obeyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          God has also a right to the character of supreme ruler, by reason of
          the absolute dependence of every creature on him. All creatures, and
          rational creatures no less than other, are wholly derived from him,
          and every moment are wholly dependent upon him for being, and for all
          good, so that they are properly his possession. And as, by virtue of
          this, he has a right to give his creatures whatever rules of conduct
          he pleases, or whatever rules are agreeable to his own wisdom. So the
          mind and will of the creature ought to be entirely conformed to the
          nature and will of the Creator, and to the rules he gives, that are
          expressive of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the same reason, he has a right to judge their actions and
          conduct, and to fulfill the sanction of his law. He who has an
          absolute and independent right to give laws, has evermore the same
          right to judge those to whom the laws are given. It is absolutely
          necessary that there should be a judge of reasonable creatures. And
          sanctions, or rewards and punishments, annexed to rules of conduct are
          necessary to the being of laws. A person may instruct another without
          sanctions, but not give laws. However, these sanctions themselves are
          vain, are as good as none, without a judge to determine the execution
          of them. As God has a right to be judge, so has he a right to be the
          supreme judge. And none has a right to reverse his judgments, to
          receive appeals from him, or to say to him, Why judgest thou thus?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. God is, in fact the supreme judge of the world. He has power
          sufficient to vindicate his own right. As he has a right which cannot
          be disputed, so he has power which cannot be controlled. He is
          possessed of omnipotence, wherewith to maintain his dominion over the
          world. And he does maintain his dominion in the moral as well as the
          natural world. Men may refuse subjection to God as a lawgiver. They
          may shake off the yoke of his laws by rebellion. Yet they cannot
          withdraw themselves from his judgment. Although they will not have God
          for their lawgiver, yet they shall have him for their judge. The
          strongest of creatures can do nothing to control God, or to avoid him
          while acting in his judicial capacity. He is able to bring them to his
          judgment-seat, and is also able to execute the sentence which he shall
          pronounce.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was once a notable attempt made by opposition of power entirely
          to shake off the yoke of the moral government of God, both as
          lawgiver, and as judge. This attempt was made by the angels, the most
          mighty of creatures. But they miserably failed in it. God
          notwithstanding acted as their judge in casting those proud spirits
          out of heaven, and binding them in chains of darkness unto a further
          judgment, and a further execution. “God is wise in heart and mighty in
          strength; who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?”
          Job 9:4. Wherein the enemies of God deal proudly, he is above them. He
          ever has acted as judge in bestowing what rewards, and inflicting what
          punishments, he pleased on the children of men. And so he does still.
          He is daily fulfilling the promises and threatenings of the law, in
          disposing of the souls of the children of men, and so be evermore will
          act.
        </p>
        <p>God acts as judge towards the children of men more especially,</p>
        <p>
          First, in man’s particular judgment at death. Then the sentence is
          executed, and the reward bestowed in part; which is not done without a
          judgment. The soul, when it departs from the body, appears before God
          to be disposed of by him, according to his law. But by this appearing
          before God, to be judged at death, we need understand no more than
          this, that the soul is made immediately sensible of the presence of
          God, God manifesting himself immediately to the soul, with the glory
          and majesty of a judge, that the sins of the wicked and the
          righteousness of the saints are brought by God to the view of their
          consciences, so that they know the reason of the sentence given, and
          their consciences are made to testify to the justice of it. And that
          thus the will of God for the fulfillment of the law, in their reward
          or punishment, is made known to them and executed. This is undoubtedly
          done at every man’s death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, in the great and general judgment, when all men shall together
          appear before the judgment-seat to be judged, and which judgment will
          be much more solemn, and the sanctions of the law will to a further
          degree be fulfilled. — But this brings me to another branch of the
          subject.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>
          That there is a time coming when God will, in the most public and
          solemn manner, judge the whole world of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of a general judgment is not sufficiently discoverable by
          the light of nature. Indeed some of the heathens had some obscure
          notions concerning a future judgment. But the light of nature, or mere
          unassisted reason, was not sufficient to instruct the world of fallen
          men in this doctrine. It is one of the peculiar doctrines of
          revelation, a doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There were
          indeed some hints of it in the Old Testament, as in Psa. 96:13, “The
          Lord cometh to judge the world with righteousness, and his people with
          his truth.” And Ecc. 12:14, “For God will bring every work into
          judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it
          be evil.” And in some other such like passages. But this doctrine is
          with abundantly the greatest clearness revealed in the New Testament.
          There we have it frequently and particularly declared and described
          with its circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, although it be a doctrine of revelation, and be brought to
          light by the gospel, the brightest and most glorious revelation that
          God has given to the world; yet it is a doctrine which is entirely
          agreeable to reason, and of which reason gives great confirmation.
          That there will be a time before the dissolution of the world, when
          the inhabitants of it shall stand before God and give an account of
          their conduct; and that God will in a public manner, by a general and
          just judgment, set all things to rights respecting their moral
          behavior, is a doctrine entirely agreeable to reason. Which I shall
          now endeavor to make appear. But I would premise that what we would
          inquire into is not whether all mankind shall be judged by God. For
          that is a thing that the light of nature clearly teaches, and we have
          already spoken something of it. But whether it be rational to think
          that there will be a public judgment of all mankind together. This I
          think will appear very rational from the following considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Such a judgment will be a more glorious display of God’s majesty
          and dominion. It will be more glorious because it will be more open,
          public, and solemn. — Although God now actually exercises the most
          sovereign dominion over the earth, although he reigns and does all
          things according to his own will, ordering all events as seemeth to
          himself good, and although he is actually judge in the earth,
          continually disposing of men’s souls according to their works; yet he
          rules after a more hidden and secret manner, insomuch that it is
          common among the proud sons of men to refuse acknowledging his
          dominion. Wicked men question the very existence of a God, who taketh
          care of the world, who ordereth the affairs of it, and judgeth in it.
          And therefore they cast off the fear of him. Many of the kings and
          great men of the earth do not suitably acknowledge the God who is
          above them, but seem to look upon themselves as supreme, and therefore
          tyrannize over mankind, as if they were in no wise accountable for
          their conduct. There have been, and now are, many atheistical persons,
          who acknowledge not God’s moral dominion over mankind. And therefore
          they throw off the yoke of his laws and government. And how great a
          part of the world is there now, and has there always been, that has
          not acknowledged that the government of the world belongs to the God
          of Israel, or to the God of Christians, but has paid homage to other
          imaginary deities, as though they were their sovereign lords and
          supreme judges. Over how great a part of the world has Satan usurped
          the dominion, and set up himself for God, in opposition to the true
          God!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, how agreeable to reason is it, that God, in the winding up of
          things, when the present state of mankind shall come to a conclusion,
          should in the most open and public manner, manifest his dominion over
          the inhabitants of the earth, by bringing them all, high and low, rich
          and poor, kings and subjects, together before him to be judged with
          respect to all that they ever did in the world! That he should thus
          openly discover his dominion in this world, where his authority has
          been so much questioned, denied, and proudly opposed! That however God
          be not now visibly present upon earth, disposing and judging in that
          visible manner that earthly kings do. Yet at the conclusion of the
          world he should make his dominion visible to all, and with respect to
          all mankind, so that every eye shall see him, and even they who have
          denied him shall find, that God is supreme Lord of them, and of the
          whole world!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The end of judgment will be more fully answered by a public and
          general, than only by a particular and private, judgment. The end for
          which there is any judgment at all is to display and glorify the
          righteousness of God; which end is more fully accomplished by calling
          men to an account, bringing their actions to the trial, and
          determining their state according to them, the whole world, both
          angels and men, being present to behold, than if the same things
          should be done in a more private way. At the day of judgment there
          will be the most glorious display of the justice of God that ever was
          made. Then God will appear to be entirely righteous towards everyone.
          The justice of all his moral government will on that day be at once
          discovered. Then all objections will be removed. The conscience of
          every man shall be satisfied. The blasphemies of the ungodly will be
          forever put to silence, and argument will be given for the saints and
          angels to praise God forever: Rev. 19:1, 2, “And after these things I
          heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia;
          salvation, and glory, and honour, and power be to the Lord our God:
          for true and righteous are his judgments.”
        </p>
        <p>
          III. It is very agreeable to reason, that the irregularities which are
          so open and manifest in the world, should, when the world comes to an
          end, be publicly rectified by the supreme governor. The infinitely
          wise God, who made this world to be a habitation for men, and placed
          mankind to dwell here, and has appointed man his end and work, must
          take care of the order and good government for the world, which he has
          thus made. He is not regardless how things proceed here on earth. It
          would be a reproach to his wisdom, and to the perfect rectitude of his
          nature, to suppose so. This world is a world for confusion. It has
          been filled with irregularity and confusion ever since the fall. And
          the irregularities of it are not only private, relating to the actions
          of particular persons, but states, kingdoms, nations, churches,
          cities, and all societies of men in all ages, have been full of public
          irregularities. The affairs of the world, so far as they are in the
          hands of men, are carried on in the most irregular and confused
          manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though justice sometimes takes place, yet how often do injustice,
          cruelty, and oppression prevail! How often are the righteous
          condemned, and the wicked acquitted and rewarded! How common is it for
          the virtuous and pious to be depressed, and the wicked to be advanced!
          How many thousands of the best men have suffered intolerable
          cruelties, merely for their virtue and piety, and in this world have
          had no help, no refuge to fly to! The world is very much ruled by the
          pride, covetousness, and passions of men. Solomon takes much notice of
          such like irregularities in the present state (in his book of
          Ecclesiastes), hereby he shows the vanity of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, how reasonable is it to suppose, that God, when he shall come and
          put an end to the present state of mankind, will in an open, public
          manner, the whole world being present, rectify all these disorders!
          And that he will bring all things to a trial by a general judgment, in
          order that those who have been oppressed may be delivered; that the
          righteous cause may be pleaded and vindicated, and wickedness, which
          has been approved, honored, and rewarded, may receive its due disgrace
          and punishment; that the proceedings of kings and earthly judges may
          be inquired into by him, whose eyes are as a flame of fire; and that
          the public actions of men may be publicly examined and recompensed
          according to their desert! How agreeable is it to divine wisdom thus
          to order things, and how worthy of the supreme governor of the world!
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. By a public and general judgment, God more fully accomplishes the
          reward he designs for the godly, and punishment he designs for the
          wicked. One part of the reward which God intends for his saints, is
          the honor which he intends to bestow upon them. He will honor them in
          the most public and open manner, before the angels, before all
          mankind, and before them that hated them. And it is most suitable that
          it should be so. It is suitable that those holy, humble souls, that
          have been hated by wicked men, have been cruelly treated and put to
          shame by them, and who have been haughtily domineered over, should be
          openly acquitted, commended, and crowned, before all the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          So one part of the punishment of the ungodly will be the open shame
          and disgrace which they shall suffer. Although many of them have
          proudly lifted up their heads in this world, have had a very high
          thought of themselves, and have obtained outward honor among men; yet
          God will put them to open shame, by showing all their wickedness and
          moral filthiness before the whole assembly of angels and men, by
          manifesting his abhorrence of them, in placing them upon his left
          hand, among devils and foul spirits, and by turning them away into the
          most loathsome, as well as most dreadful, pit of hell, to dwell there
          forever. — Which ends may be much more fully accomplished in a
          general, than in a particular judgment.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>The world will be judged by Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>
          The person by whom God will judge the world is Jesus Christ, God-man.
          The second person in the Trinity, that same person of whom we read in
          our Bibles, who was born of the Virgin Mary, lived in Galilee and
          Judea, and was at last crucified without the gates of Jerusalem, will
          come to judge the world both in his divine and human nature, in the
          same human body that was crucified, and rose again, and ascended up
          into heaven. Acts 1:11, “This same Jesus that is taken up from you
          into heaven, shall come in like manner, as ye have seen him go into
          heaven.” It will be his human nature which will then be seen by the
          bodily eyes of men. However, his divine nature, which is united to the
          human, will then also be present. And it will be by the wisdom of that
          divine nature that Christ will see and judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here naturally arises an inquiry, Why is Christ appointed to judge the
          world rather than the Father or the Holy Ghost? We cannot pretend to
          know all the reasons of the divine dispensations. God is not obliged
          to give us an account of them. But so much may we learn by divine
          revelation, as to discover marvelous wisdom in what he determines and
          orders with respect to this matter. We learn,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That God seeth fit, that he who is in the human nature, should be
          the judge of those who are of the human nature. John 5:27, “And hath
          given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of
          man.” Seeing there is one of the persons of the Trinity united to the
          human nature, God chooses, in all his transactions with mankind, to
          transact by him. He did so of old, in his discoveries of himself to
          the patriarchs, in giving the law, in leading the children of Israel
          through the wilderness, and in the manifestations he made of himself
          in the tabernacle and temple. When, although Christ was not actually
          incarnate, yet he was so in design, it was ordained and agreed in the
          covenant of redemption, that he should become incarnate. And since the
          incarnation of Christ, God governs both the church and the world by
          Christ. So he will also at the end judge the world by him. All men
          shall be judged by God, and yet at the same time by one invested with
          their own nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          God seeth fit, that those who have bodies, as all mankind will have at
          the day of judgment, should see their judge with their bodily eyes,
          and hear him with their bodily ears. If one of the other persons of
          the Trinity had been appointed to be judge, there must have been some
          extraordinary outward appearance made on purpose to be a token of the
          divine presence, as it was of old, before Christ was incarnate. But
          now there is no necessity of that. Now one of the persons of the
          Trinity is actually incarnate, so that God by him may appear to bodily
          eyes without any miraculous visionary appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Christ has this honor of being the judge of the world given him,
          as a suitable reward for his sufferings. This is a part of Christ’s
          exaltation. The exaltation of Christ is given him in reward for his
          humiliation and sufferings. This was stipulated in the covenant of
          redemption. And we are expressly told, it was given him in reward for
          his sufferings, Phil. 2:8-12, “And being found in fashion as a man, he
          humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
          cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
          name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee
          should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under
          the earth; and that every tongue should confess, that Jesus Christ is
          Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”
        </p>
        <p>
          God seeth meet, that he who appeared in such a low estate amongst
          mankind, without form or comeliness, having his divine glory veiled,
          should appear amongst men a second time, in his own proper majesty and
          glory, without a veil. To the end that those who saw him here at the
          first, as a poor, frail man, not having where to lay his head, subject
          to much hardship and affliction, may see him the second time in power
          and great glory, invested with the glory and dignity of the absolute
          Lord of heaven and earth. And that he who once tabernacled with men,
          and was despised and rejected of them, may have the honor of
          arraigning all men before his throne, and judging them with respect to
          their eternal state! John 5:21-24.
        </p>
        <p>
          God seeth meet that he who was once arraigned before the judgment-seat
          of men, and was there most vilely treated, being mocked, spitted upon,
          and condemned, and who was at last crucified, should be rewarded, by
          having those very persons brought to his tribunal, that they may see
          him in glory, and be confounded. And that he may have the disposal of
          them for all eternity. As Christ said to the high priest while
          arraigned before him, Mat. 26:64, “Hereafter ye shall see the Son of
          man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
          heaven.”
        </p>
        <p>
          III. It is needful that Christ should be the judge of the world, in
          order that he may finish the work of redemption. It is the will of
          God, that he who is the redeemer of the world should be a complete
          redeemer; and that therefore he should have the whole work of
          redemption left in his hands. Now, the redemption of fallen man
          consists not merely in the impetration of redemption, by obeying the
          divine law, and making atonement for sinners, or in preparing the way
          for their salvation, but it consists in a great measure, and is
          actually fulfilled, in converting sinners to the knowledge and love of
          the truth, in carrying them on in the way of grace and true holiness
          through life, and in finally raising their bodies to life, in
          glorifying them, in pronouncing the blessed sentence upon them, in
          crowning them with honor and glory in the sight of men and angels, and
          in completing and perfecting their reward. Now, it is necessary that
          Christ should do this, in order to his finishing the work which he has
          begun. Raising the saints from the dead, judging them, and fulfilling
          the sentence is part of their salvation. And therefore it was
          necessary that Christ should be appointed judge of the world, in order
          that he might finish his work (John 6:39, 40, chap. 5:25-31). The
          redemption of the bodies of the saints is part of the work of
          redemption; the resurrection to life is called a redemption of their
          bodies (Rom. 8:23).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the will of God, that Christ himself should have the fulfilling
          of that for which he died, and for which he suffered so much. Now, the
          end for which he suffered and died was the complete salvation of his
          people. And this shall be obtained at the last judgment, and not
          before. Therefore it was necessary that Christ be appointed judge, in
          order that he himself might fully accomplish the end for which he had
          both suffered and died. When Christ had finished his appointed
          sufferings, God did, as it were, put the purchased inheritance into
          his hands, to be kept for believers, and be bestowed upon them at the
          day of judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. It was proper that he who is appointed king of the church should
          rule till he should have put all his enemies under his feet. In order
          to which, he must be the judge of his enemies, as well as of his
          people. One of the offices of Christ, as redeemer, is that of a king.
          He is appointed king of the church and head over all things to the
          church. And in order that his kingdom be complete, and design of his
          reign be accomplished, he must conquer all his enemies, and then he
          will deliver up the kingdom to the Father. 1 Cor. 15:24, 25, “Then
          cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God,
          even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule, and all
          authority and power. For he must reign till he hath put all enemies
          under his feet.” Now, when Christ shall have brought his enemies, who
          had denied, opposed, and rebelled against him, to his judgment-seat,
          and shall have passed and executed sentence upon them, this will be a
          final and complete victory over them, a victory which shall put an end
          to the war. And it is proper that he who at present reigns and is
          carrying on the war against those who are of the opposite kingdom,
          should have the honor of obtaining the victory, and finishing the war.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. It is for the abundant comfort of the saints that Christ is
          appointed to be their judge. The covenant of grace, with all its
          circumstances, and all those events to which it has relation, is every
          way so contrived of God, as to give strong consolation to believers:
          for God designed the gospel for a glorious manifestation of his grace
          to them. And therefore everything in it is so ordered, as to manifest
          the most grace and mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it is for the abundant consolation of the saints, that their own
          Redeemer is appointed to be their judge. That the same person who
          spilled his blood for them has the determination of their state left
          with him, so that they need not doubt but that they shall have what he
          was at so much cost to procure.
        </p>
        <p>
          What matter of joy to them will it be at the last day, to lift up
          their eyes, and behold the person in whom they have trusted for
          salvation, to whom they have fled for refuge, upon whom they have
          built as their foundation for eternity, and whose voice they have
          often heard, inviting them to himself for protection and safety,
          coming to judge them.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. That Christ is appointed to be the judge of the world will be for
          the more abundant conviction of the ungodly. It will be for their
          conviction that they are judged and condemned by that very person whom
          they have rejected, by whom they might have been saved, who shed his
          blood to give them an opportunity to be saved, who was wont to offer
          his righteousness to them, when they were in their state of trial, and
          who many a time called and invited them to come to him, that they
          might be saved. How justly will they be condemned by him whose
          salvation they have rejected, whose blood they have despised, whose
          many calls they have refused, and whom they have pierced by their
          sins!
        </p>
        <p>
          How much will it be for their conviction, when they shall hear the
          sentence of condemnation pronounced, to reflect with themselves, how
          often has this same person, who now passes sentence of condemnation
          upon me, called me, in his word, and by his messengers, to accept of
          him, and to give myself to him! How often has he knocked at the door
          of my heart! and had it not been for my own folly and obstinacy, how
          might I have had him for my Savior, who is now my incensed Judge!
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IV</p>
        <p>
          Christ’s coming, the resurrection, the judgment prepared, the books
          opened, the sentence pronounced and executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. CHRIST Jesus will, in a most magnificent manner, descend from
          heaven with all the holy angels. The man Christ Jesus is now in the
          heaven of heavens, or, as the apostle expresses it, far above all
          heavens, Eph. 4:10. And there he has been ever since his ascension,
          being there enthroned in glory, in the midst of millions of angels and
          blessed spirits. But when the time appointed for the day of judgment
          shall have come, notice of it will be given in those happy regions,
          and Christ will descend to the earth, attended with all those heavenly
          hosts, in a most solemn, awful, and glorious manner. Christ will come
          with divine majesty, he will come in the glory of the Father, Mat.
          16:27, “For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with
          his angels..”
        </p>
        <p>
          We can now conceive but little of the holy and awful magnificence in
          which Christ will appear, as he shall come in the clouds of heaven, or
          of the glory of his retinue. How mean and despicable, in comparison
          with it, is the most splendid appearance that earthly princes can
          make! A glorious visible light will shine round about him, and the
          earth, with all nature, will tremble at his presence. How vast and
          innumerable will that host be which will appear with him! Heaven will
          be for the time deserted of its inhabitants.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may argue the glory of Christ’s appearance, from his appearance at
          other times. When he appeared in transfiguration, his face did shine
          as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. The apostle Peter
          long after spoke of this appearance in magnificent terms, 2 Pet. 1:16,
          17, “We were eye-witnesses of his majesty; for he received from God
          the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from
          the excellent glory.” And his appearance to St. Paul at his
          conversion, and to St. John, as related in Rev. 1:13 etc. were very
          grand and magnificent. But we may conclude, that his appearance at the
          day of judgment will be vastly more so than either of these, as the
          occasion will be so much greater. We have good reason to think, that
          our nature, in the present frail state, could not bear the appearance
          of the majesty in which he will then be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may argue the glory of his appearance, from the appearances of some
          of the angels to men, as of the angel that appeared at Christ’s
          sepulcher, after his resurrection, Mat. 28:3, “His countenance was
          like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.” The angels will
          doubtless all of them make as glorious an appearance at the of
          judgment, as ever any of them have made on former occasions. How
          glorious, then, will be the retinue of Christ, made up of so many
          thousands of such angels! And how much more glorious will Christ, the
          judge himself, appear, than those his attendants! Doubtless their God
          will appear immensely more glorious than they.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ will thus descend into our air, to such a distance from the
          surface of the earth, that everyone, when all shall be gathered
          together, shall see him, Rev. 1:7, “Behold, he cometh with clouds, and
          every eye shall see him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ will make this appearance suddenly, and to the great surprise
          of the inhabitants of the earth. It is therefore compared to a cry at
          midnight, by which men are wakened in a great surprise.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. At the sound of the last trumpet, the dead shall rise, and the
          living shall be changed. As soon as Christ is descended, the last
          trumpet shall sound, as a notification to all mankind to appear. At
          which mighty sound shall the dead be immediately raised, and the
          living changed. 1 Cor. 15:52, “For the trumpet shall sound, and the
          dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.” Mat.
          24:31, “And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet.”
          1 Thes. 4:16, “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a
          shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God.”
          There will be some great and remarkable signal given for the rising of
          the dead, which it seems will be some mighty sound, caused by the
          angels of God, who shall attend on Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon this all the dead shall rise from their graves. All, both small
          and great, who shall have lived upon earth since the foundation of the
          world, those who died before the flood, and those who were drowned in
          the flood, all that have died since that time, and that shall die to
          the end of the world. There will be a great moving upon the face of
          the earth, and in the water, in bringing bone to his bone, in opening
          graves, and bringing together all the scattered particles of dead
          bodies. The earth shall give up the dead that are in it, and the sea
          shall give up the dead that are in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          However the parts of the bodies of many are divided and scattered;
          however many have been burnt, and their bodies have been turned to
          ashes and smoke, and driven to the four winds; however many have been
          eaten of wild beasts, of the fowls of heaven, and the fishes of the
          sea; however many have consumed away upon the face of the earth, and
          great part of their bodies have ascended in exhalations; yet the
          all-wise and all-powerful God can immediately bring every part to his
          part again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of this vast multitude some shall rise to life, and others to
          condemnation. John 5:28, 29, “All that are in the graves shall hear
          his voice, and shall come forth, they that have done good, unto the
          resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
          resurrection of damnation.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When the bodies are prepared, the departed souls shall again enter
          into their bodies, and be re-united to them, never more to be
          separated. The souls of the wicked shall be brought up out of hell,
          though not out of misery, and shall very unwillingly enter into their
          bodies, which will be but eternal prisons to them. Rev. 20:13, “And
          death and hell delivered up the dead that were in them.” They shall
          lift their eyes full of the utmost amazement and horror to see their
          awful Judge. And perhaps the bodies with which they shall be raised
          will be most filthy and loathsome, thus properly corresponding to the
          inward, moral turpitude of their souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          The souls of the righteous shall descend from heaven together with
          Christ and his angels: 1 Thes. 4:14, “Them also which sleep in Jesus
          will God bring with him.” They also shall be re-united to their
          bodies, that they may be glorified with them. They shall receive their
          bodies prepared by God to be mansions of pleasure to all eternity.
          They shall be every way fitted for the uses, the exercises, and
          delights of perfectly holy and glorified souls. They shall be clothed
          with a superlative beauty, similar to that of Christ’s glorious body.
          Phil. 3:21, “Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned
          like unto his glorious body.” Their bodies shall rise incorruptible,
          no more liable to pain or disease, and with an extraordinary vigor and
          vivacity, like that of those spirits that are as a flame of fire. 1
          Cor. 15:43, 44, “It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory: it is
          sown in weakness, it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body, it
          is raised a spiritual body.” With what joy will the souls and bodies
          of the saints meet, and with what joy will they lift their heads out
          of their graves to behold the glorious sight of the appearing of
          Christ! And it will be a glorious sight to see those saints arising
          out of their graves, putting off their corruption, and putting on
          incorruption and glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, those that shall then be alive upon the earth shall
          be changed. Their bodies shall pass through a great change, in a
          moment, in the twinkling of an eye. 1 Cor. 15:51, 52, “Behold, I show
          you a great mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
          changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump.”
          The bodies of the wicked then living will be changed into such hideous
          things, as shall be answerable to the loathsome souls that dwell in
          them, and such as shall be prepared to receive and administer eternal
          torments without dissolution. But the bodies of the righteous shall be
          changed into the same glorious and immortal form in which those that
          shall be raised will appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. They shall all be brought to appear before Christ, the godly
          being placed on the right hand, the wicked on the left; Mat. 25:31,
          32, 33. The wicked, however unwilling, however full of fear and
          horror, shall be brought or driven before the judgment-seat. However
          they may try to hide themselves, and for this purpose creep into dens
          caves of the mountains, and cry to the mountains to fall on them, and
          hide them from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from
          the wrath of the Lamb. Yet there shall not one escape. To the judge
          they must come, and stand on the left hand with devils. On the
          contrary, the righteous will be joyfully conducted to Jesus Christ,
          probably by the angels. Their joy will, as it were, give them wings to
          carry them thither. They will with ecstasies and raptures of delight
          meet their friend and Savior, come into his presence, and stand at his
          right hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides the one standing on the right hand and the other on the left,
          there seems to be this difference between them that when the dead in
          Christ shall be raised, they will all be caught up into the air, where
          Christ shall be, and shall be there at his right hand during the
          judgment, never more to set their feet on this earth. Whereas the
          wicked shall be left standing on the earth, there to abide the
          judgment. 1 Thes. 4:16, 17, “The dead in Christ shall rise first; then
          we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them
          in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be
          with the Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And what a vast congregation will there be of all the men, women, and
          children that shall have lived upon earth from the beginning to the
          end of the world! Rev. 20:12, “And I saw the dead, small and great,
          stand before God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The next thing will be that the books shall be opened. Rev. 20:12,
          “I saw the dead, great and small, stand before God; and the books were
          opened.” Which books seem to be these two, the book of God’s
          remembrance, and the book of Scripture. The former as the evidence of
          their deeds which are to be judged, the latter as the rule of
          judgment. The works both of the righteous and of the wicked will be
          brought forth that they may be judged according to them, and those
          works will be tried according to the appointed and written rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the works of both righteous and wicked will be rehearsed. The
          book of God’s remembrance will be first opened. The various works of
          the children of men are, as it were, written by God in a book of
          remembrance. Mal. 3:16, “A book of remembrance was written before
          him.” However ready ungodly men may be to make light of their own
          sins, and to forget them; yet God never forgets any of them. Neither
          does God forget any of the good works of the saints. If they give but
          a cup of cold water with a spirit of charity, God remembers it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evil works of the wicked shall then be brought forth to light.
          They must then hear of all their profaneness, their impenitence, their
          obstinate unbelief, their abuse of ordinances, and various other sins.
          The various aggravations of their sins will also be brought to view,
          as how this man sinned after such and such warnings, that after the
          receipt of such and such mercies; one after being so and so favored
          with outward light, another after having been the subject of inward
          conviction, excited by the immediate agency of God. Concerning these
          sins, they shall be called to account to see what answer they can make
          for themselves. Mat. 12:36, “But I say unto you, that every idle word
          that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of
          judgment.” Rom 14:12, “So then every one of us shall give account of
          himself to God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The good works of the saints will also be brought forth as evidences
          of their sincerity, and of their interest in the righteousness of
          Christ. As to their evil works, they will not be brought forth against
          them on that day. For the guilt of them will not lie upon them, they
          being clothed with the righteousness of Jesus Christ. The Judge
          himself will have taken the guilt of their sins upon him. Therefore
          their sins will not stand against them in the book of God’s
          remembrance. The account of them will appear to have been canceled
          before that time. The account that will be found in God’s book will
          not be of debt, but of credit. God cancels their debts, and sets down
          their good works, and is pleased, as it were, to make himself a debtor
          for them, by his own gracious act.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both good and bad will be judged according to their works. Rev. 20:12,
          “And the dead were judged out of those things that were found written
          in the books, according to their works.” And verse 13, “And they were
          judged every man according to their works.” Though the righteous are
          justified by faith, and not by their works, yet they shall be judged
          according to their works. then works shall be brought forth as the
          evidence of their of their faith. Their faith on that great day shall
          be tried by its fruits. If the works of any man shall have been bad,
          if his life shall appear to have been unchristian, that will condemn
          him, without any further inquiry. But if his works, when they shall be
          examined, prove good and of the right sort, he shall surely be
          justified. They will be declared as a sure evidence of his having
          believed in Jesus Christ, and of his being clothed with his
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But by works we are to understand all voluntary exercises of the
          faculties of the soul. As for instance, the words and conversation of
          men, as well as what is done with their hands. Mat. 12:37, “By thy
          words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be
          condemned.” Nor are we to understand only outward acts, or the
          thoughts outwardly expressed, but also the thoughts themselves, and
          all the inward workings of the heart. Man judgeth according to the
          outward appearance, but God judgeth the heart. Rev. 2:23, “I am he
          that searcheth the heart and the reins, and I will give unto every one
          of you according to his works.” Nor will only positive sins be brought
          into judgment, but also omissions of duty, as is manifest by Mat.
          25:42, etc. “For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat; I was
          thirsty, and ye gave me no drink,” etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          On that day secret and hidden wickedness will be brought to light. All
          the uncleanness, injustice, and violence, of which men have been
          guilty in secret, shall be manifest both to angels and men. Then it
          will be made to appear, how this and that man have indulged themselves
          in wicked imaginations, in lascivious, covetous, malicious, or impious
          desires and wishes. And how others have harbored in their hearts
          enmity against God and his law; also impenitency and unbelief,
          notwithstanding all the means used with them, and motives set before
          them, to induce them to repent, return, and live.
        </p>
        <p>
          The good works of the saints also, which were done in secret, shall
          then be made public, and even the pious and benevolent affections and
          designs of their hearts, so that the real and secret characters of
          both saints and sinners shall then be most clearly and publicly
          displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the book of Scripture will be opened, and the works of men
          will be tried by that touchstone. Their works will be compared with
          the Word of God. That which God gave men for the rule of their action
          while in this life, shall then be made the rule of their judgment. God
          has told us beforehand, what will be the rule of judgment. We are told
          in the Scriptures upon what terms we shall be justified, and upon what
          terms we shall be condemned. That which God has given us to be our
          rule in our lives, he will make his own rule in judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rule of judgment will be twofold. The primary rule of judgment
          will be the law. The law ever has stood, and ever will stand in force,
          as a rule of judgment, for those to whom the law was given. Mat. 5:18,
          “For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one
          tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” The
          law will so far be made the rule of judgment, that not one person at
          that day shall by any means be justified or condemned, in a way
          inconsistent with that which is established by the law. As to the
          wicked, the law will be so far the rule of judgment respecting them,
          that the sentence denounced against them will be the sentence of the
          law. The righteous will be so far judged by the law, that although
          their sentence will not be the sentence of the law, yet it will by no
          means be such a sentence as shall be inconsistent with the law, but
          such as it allows. For it will be by the righteousness of the law that
          they shall be justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be inquired concerning everyone, both righteous and wicked,
          whether the law stands against him, or whether he has a fulfillment of
          the law to show. As to the righteous, they will have fulfillment to
          show. They will have it to plead, that the judge himself has fulfilled
          the law for them. That he has both satisfied for their sins, and
          fulfilled the righteousness of the law for them. Rom. 10:4, “Christ is
          the end of the law for the righteousness to every one that believeth.”
          But as to the wicked, when it shall be found, by the book of God’s
          remembrance, that they have broken the law, and have no fulfillment of
          it to plead, the sentence of the law shall be pronounced upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A secondary rule of judgment will be the gospel, or the covenant of
          grace, wherein it is said, “He that believeth shall be saved, and he
          that believeth not shall be damned:” Rom. 2:16, “In the day when God
          shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my
          gospel.” By the gospel, of covenant of grace, eternal blessedness will
          be adjudged to believers. When it shall be found that the law hinders
          not, and that the curse and condemnation of the law stands not against
          them, the reward of eternal life shall be given them, according to the
          glorious gospel of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The sentence will be pronounced. Christ will say to the wicked on
          the left hand, “Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for
          the devil and his angels.” How dreadful will these words of the judge
          be to the poor, miserable, despairing wretches on the left hand! How
          amazing will every syllable of them be! How will they pierce them to
          the soul! These words show the greatest wrath and abhorrence. Christ
          will bid them depart. He will send them away from his presence, will
          remove them forever far out of his sight, into an everlasting
          separation from God, as being most loathsome, and unfit to dwell in
          his presence, and enjoy communion with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ will call them cursed. Depart, ye cursed, to whom everlasting
          wrath and ruin belong, who are by your own wickedness prepared for
          nothing else, but to be firebrands of hell, who are the fit objects
          and vessels of the vengeance and fury of the Almighty. Into fire. He
          will not send them away merely into a loathsome prison, the receptacle
          of the filth and rubbish of the universe. But into a furnace of fire.
          That must be their dwelling-place, there they must be tormented with
          the most racking pain and anguish. It is everlasting fire. There is
          eternity in the sentence, which infinitely aggravates the doom, and
          will make every word of it immensely more dreadful, sinking, and
          amazing to the souls that receive it. Prepared for the devil and his
          angels. This sets forth the greatness and intenseness of the torments,
          as the preceding part of the sentence does the duration. It shows the
          dreadfulness of that fire to which they shall be condemned, that it is
          the same that is prepared for the devils, those foul spirits and great
          enemies of God. Their condition will be the same as that of the
          devils, in many respects; particularly as they must burn in the fire
          forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          This sentence will doubtless be pronounced in such an awful manner as
          shall be a terrible manifestation of the wrath of the judge. There
          will be divine, holy, and almighty wrath manifested in the countenance
          and voice of the judge. And we know not what other manifestations of
          anger will accompany the sentence. Perhaps it will be accompanied with
          thunders and lightnings, far more dreadful than were on mount Sinai at
          the giving of the law. Correspondent to these exhibitions of divine
          wrath, will be the appearances of terror and most horrible amazement
          in the condemned. How will all their faces look pale! How will death
          sit upon their countenances, when those words shall be heard! What
          dolorous cries, shrieks, and groans! What trembling, and wringing of
          hands, and gnashing of teeth, will there then be!
        </p>
        <p>
          But with the most benign aspect, in the most endearing manner, and
          with the sweetest expressions of love, will Christ invite his saints
          on his right hand to glory; saying, “Come, ye blessed of my Father,
          inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
          world.” He will not bid them to go from him, but to come with him; to
          go where he goes; to dwell where he dwells; to enjoy him, and to
          partake with him. He will call them blessed, blessed of his Father,
          blessed by him whose blessing is infinitely the most desirable,
          namely, GOD. Inherit the kingdom. They are not only invited to go with
          Christ, and to dwell with him, but to inherit a kingdom with him, to
          sit down with him on his throne, and to receive the honor and
          happiness of a heavenly kingdom. “Prepared for you from the foundation
          of the world.” This denotes the sovereign and eternal love of God, as
          the source of their blessedness. He puts them in mind, that God was
          pleased to set his love upon them, long before they had a being, even
          from eternity. That therefore God made heaven on purpose for them, and
          fitted it for their delight and happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Immediately after this, the sentence will be executed, as we are
          informed, Mat. 25:46, “These shall go away into everlasting
          punishment; but the righteous into life eternal.” When the words of
          the sentence shall have once proceeded out of the mouth of the judge,
          then that vast and innumerable throng of ungodly men shall go away,
          shall be driven away, shall be necessitated to go away with devils,
          and shall with dismal cries and shrieks be cast into the great furnace
          of fire prepared for the punishment of devils, the perpetual thunders
          and lightnings of the wrath of God following them. Into this furnace
          they must in both soul and body enter, never more to come out. Here
          they must spend eternal ages in wrestling with the most excruciating
          torments, and in crying out in the midst of the most dreadful flames,
          and under the most insupportable wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the righteous shall ascend to heaven with their
          glorified bodies, in company with Christ, his angels, and all that
          host which descended with him. They shall ascend in the most joyful
          and triumphant manner, and shall enter with Christ into that glorious
          and blessed world, which had for the time been empty of its creature
          inhabitants. Christ having given his church that perfect beauty, and
          crowned it with that glory, honor, and happiness, which were
          stipulated in the covenant of redemption before the world was, and
          which he died to procure for them; and having made it a truly glorious
          church, every way complete, will present it before the Father, without
          spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. Thus shall the saints be instated
          in everlasting glory, to dwell there with Christ, who shall feed them,
          and lead them to living fountains of water, to the full enjoyment of
          God, and to an eternity of the most holy, glorious, and joyful
          employments.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION V</p>
        <p>All will be done in righteousness.</p>
        <p>
          CHRIST will give to every man his due, according to most righteous
          rule. Those who shall be condemned, will be most justly condemned,
          will be condemned to that punishment which they shall most justly
          deserve, and the justice of God in condemning them will be made most
          evident. Now the justice of God in punishing wicked men, and
          especially in the degree of their punishment, is often blasphemously
          called in question. But it will be made clear and apparent to all.
          Their own consciences will tell them that the sentence is just, and
          all cavils will be put to silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          So those that shall be justified, shall be most justly adjudged to
          eternal life. Although they also were great sinners, and deserved
          eternal death; yet it will not be against justice or the law, to
          justify them, they will be in Christ. But the acquitting of them will
          be but giving the reward merited by Christ’s righteousness, Rom. 3:26,
          “That God may be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in
          Jesus.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ will judge the world in righteousness, particularly as he will
          give to everyone a due proportion either of reward or punishment,
          according to the various characters of those who shall be judged. The
          punishments shall be duly proportioned to the number and aggravations
          of the sins of the wicked. And the rewards of the righteous shall be
          duly proportioned to the number of their holy acts and affections, and
          also to the degree of virtue implied in them. — I would observe
          further,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That Christ cannot fail of being just in judging through mistake.
          He cannot take some to be sincere and godly, who are not so, nor
          others to be hypocrites, who are really sincere. His eyes are as a
          flame of fire, and he searcheth the hearts and trieth the reins of the
          children of men. He can never err in determining what is justice in
          particular cases, as human judges often do. Nor can he be blinded by
          prejudices, as human judges are very liable to be. Deu. 10:17, “He
          regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.” It is impossible he should
          be deceived by the excuse, and false colors, and pleas of the wicked,
          as human judges very commonly are. It is equally impossible that he
          should err, in assigning to everyone his proper proportion of reward
          or punishment, according to his wickedness or good works. His
          knowledge being infinite, will effectually guard him against all
          these, and other such errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. He cannot fail of judging righteously through an unrighteous
          disposition. For he is infinitely just and holy in his nature. Deu.
          32:4, “He is the rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are
          judgment: a God of truth, and without iniquity, just and right is he.”
          It is not possible that an infinitely powerful, self-sufficient being
          should be under any temptation to injustice. Nor is it possible that
          an infinitely wise being, who knoweth all things, should not choose
          justice. For he who perfectly knows all things perfectly knows how
          much more amiable justice is than injustice. And therefore must choose
          it.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION VI</p>
        <p>Those things which will immediately follow the day of judgment.</p>
        <p>
          I. AFTER the sentence shall have been pronounced, and the saints shall
          have ascended with Christ into glory, this world will be dissolved by
          fire. The conflagration will immediately succeed the judgment. When an
          end shall have been put to the present state of mankind, this world,
          which was the place of their habitation during that state, will be
          destroyed, there being no further use for it. This earth which had
          been the stage upon which so many scenes had been acted, upon which
          there had been so many great and famous kingdoms and large cities,
          where there had been so many wars, so much trade and business carried
          on for so many ages, shall then be destroyed. These continents, these
          islands, these seas and rivers, theses mountains and valleys, shall be
          seen no more at all. All shall be destroyed by devouring flames. This
          we are plainly taught in the Word of God. 2 Pet. 3:7, “But the heavens
          and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store,
          reserved unto fire against the day of judgment, and perdition of
          ungodly men.” Verse 10, “But the day of the Lord will come as a thief
          in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great
          noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also
          and the works that are therein shall be burnt up.” 2 Pet. 3:12,
          “Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein
          the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall
          melt with fervent heat.”
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Both the misery of the wicked and the happiness of the saints will
          be increased beyond what shall be before the judgment. The misery of
          the wicked will be increased, as they will be tormented not only in
          their souls, but also in their bodies, which will be prepared both to
          receive and administer torment to their souls. There will doubtless
          then be the like connection between soul and body, as there is now.
          And therefore the pains and torments of the one will affect the other.
          And why may we not suppose that their torments will be increased as
          well as those of the devils? Concerning them we are informed (Jam.
          2:19) that they believe there is one God, and tremble in the belief;
          expecting no doubt that he will inflict upon them, in due time more
          severe torments than even those which they now suffer. We are also
          informed that they are bound “in chains of darkness, to be reserved
          unto judgment; and unto the judgment of the great day,” (2 Pet. 2:4,
          and Jude 6) which implies that their full punishment is not yet
          executed upon them, but that they are now reserved as prisoners in
          hell, to receive their just recompense on the day of judgment. Hence
          it was that they thought Christ was come to torment them before the
          time. Mat. 8:29. Thus the punishment neither of wicked men nor devils
          will be complete before the final judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          No more will the happiness of the saints be complete before that time.
          Therefore we are in the New Testament so often encouraged with
          promises of the resurrection of the dead, and of the day when Christ
          shall come the second time. These things are spoken of as the great
          objects of the expectation and hope of Christians. A state of
          separation of soul and body is to men an unnatural state Therefore
          when the bodies of the saints shall be raised from the dead, and their
          souls shall be again united to them, as their state will be more
          natural, so doubtless it will be more happy. Their bodies will be
          glorious bodies, and prepared to administer as much to their
          happiness, as the bodies of the wicked will be to administer to their
          misery.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may with good reason suppose the accession of happiness to the
          souls of the saints will be great, since the occasion is represented
          as the marriage of the church, and the Lamb. Rev. 19:7, “The marriage
          of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.” Their joy
          will then be increased because they will have new arguments of joy.
          The body of Christ will then be perfect, the church will be complete.
          All the parts of it will have come into existence, which will not be
          the case before the end of the world. No parts of it will be under sin
          of affliction. All the members of it will be in a perfect state. And
          they shall all be together by themselves, none being mixed with
          ungodly men. Then the church will be as a bride adorned for her
          husband, and therefore she will exceedingly rejoice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then also the Mediator will have fully accomplished his work. He will
          then have destroyed, and will triumph over, all his enemies. Then
          Christ will have fully obtained his reward, and fully accomplished the
          design which was in his heart from all eternity. For these reasons
          Christ himself will greatly rejoice with him. Then God will have
          obtained the end of all the great works which he has been doing from
          the beginning of the world. All the designs of God will be unfolded in
          their events. Then his marvelous contrivance in his hidden, intricate,
          and inexplicable works will appear, the ends being obtained. Then the
          works of God being perfected, the divine glory will more abundantly
          appear. These things will cause a great accession of happiness to the
          saints, who shall behold them. Then God will have fully glorified
          himself, his Son, and his elect. Then he will see that all is very
          good, and will entirely rejoice in his own works. At the same time the
          saints also, viewing the works of God brought thus to perfection, will
          rejoice in the view, and receive from it a large accession of
          happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then God will make more abundant manifestations of his glory, and of
          the glory of his Son. Then he will more plentifully pour out his
          Spirit, and make answerable additions to the glory of the saints, and
          by means of all these will so increase the happiness of the saints, as
          shall be suitable to the commencement of the ultimate and most perfect
          state of things, and to such a joyful occasion, the completion of all
          things. In this glory and happiness will the saints remain forever and
          ever.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION VII</p>
        <p>The uses to which this doctrine is applicable.</p>
        <p>
          I. THE first use proper to be made of this doctrine is of instruction.
          Hence many of the mysteries of Divine Providence may be unfolded.
          There are many things in the dealings of God towards the children of
          men, which appear very mysterious, if we view them without having an
          eye to this last judgment, which yet, if we consider this judgment,
          have no difficulty in them. As,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that God suffers the wicked to live and prosper in the world.
          The infinitely holy and wise Creator and Governor of the world must
          necessarily hate wickedness. Yet we see many wicked men spreading
          themselves as a green bay-tree. They live with impunity; things seem
          to go well with them, and the world smiles upon them. Many who have
          not been fit to live, who have held God and religion in the greatest
          contempt, who have been open enemies to all that is good, who by their
          wickedness have been the pests of mankind. Many cruel tyrants, whose
          barbarities have been such as would even fill one with horror to hear
          or read of them; yet have lived in great wealth and outward glory,
          have reigned over great and mighty kingdoms and empires, and have been
          honored as a sort of earthly gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it is very mysterious, that the holy and righteous Governor of
          the world, whose eye beholds all the children of men, should suffer it
          so to be, unless we look forward to the day of judgment. And then the
          mystery is unraveled. For although God for the present keeps silence,
          and seems to let them alone; yet then he will give suitable
          manifestations of his displeasure against their wickedness. They shall
          then receive condign punishment. The saints under the Old Testament
          were much stumbled at these dispensations of Providence, as you may
          see in Job 21, and Psa. 73, and Jer. 12. The difficulty to them was so
          great, because then a future state and a day of judgment were not
          revealed with that clearness with which they are now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, God sometimes suffers some of the best of men to be in great
          affliction, poverty, and persecution. The wicked rule, while they are
          subject. The wicked are the head, and they are the tail. The wicked
          domineer, while they serve, and are oppressed, yea are trampled under
          their feet, as the mire of the streets. These things are very common,
          yet they seem to imply great confusion. When the wicked are exalted to
          power and authority, and the godly are oppressed by them, things are
          quite out of joint. Pro. 25:26, “A righteous man falling down before
          the wicked, is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.”
          Sometimes one wicked man makes many hundreds, yea thousands, of
          precious saints a sacrifice to his lust and cruelty, or to his enmity
          against virtue and the truth, and puts them to death for no other
          reason but that for which they are especially to be esteemed and
          commended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if we look no further than the present state, these things appear
          strange and unaccountable. But we ought not to confine our views
          within such narrow limits. When God shall have put an end to the
          present state, these things shall all be brought to rights. Though God
          suffers things to be so for the present, yet they shall not proceed in
          this course always. Comparatively speaking, the present state of
          things is but for a moment. When all shall be settled and fixed by a
          divine judgment, the righteous shall be exalted, honored, and
          rewarded, and the wicked shall be depressed and put under their feet.
          However the wicked now prevail against the righteous, yet the
          righteous shall at last have the ascendant, shall come off conquerors,
          and shall see the just vengeance of God executed upon those who now
          hate and persecute them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, it is another mystery of providence, that God suffers so much
          public injustice to take place in the world. There are not only
          private wrongs, which in this state pass unsettled, but many public
          wrongs, wrongs done by men acting in a public character, and wrongs
          which affect nations, kingdoms, and other public bodies of men. Many
          suffer by men in public offices, from whom there is no refuge, from
          whose decisions there is no appeal. Now it seems a mystery that these
          things are tolerated, when he that is rightfully the Supreme Judge and
          Governor of the world is perfectly just. But at the final judgment all
          these wrongs shall be adjusted, as well as those of a more private
          nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Our second use of this subject shall be to apply it to the
          awakening of sinners. You that have not the fear of God before your
          eyes, that are not afraid to sin against him, consider seriously what
          you have heard concerning the day of judgment. Although these things
          be now future and unseen, yet they are real and certain. If you now be
          left to yourselves, if God keep silence, and judgment be not speedily
          executed, it is not because God is regardless how you live, and how
          you behave yourselves. Now indeed God is invisible to you, and his
          wrath is invisible. But at the day of judgment, you yourselves shall
          see him with your bodily eyes. You shall not then be able to keep out
          of his sight, or to avoid seeing him. Rev. 1:7, “Behold he cometh with
          clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him:
          and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.” You shall
          see him coming in the clouds of heaven. Your ears shall hear the last
          trumpet, that dreadful sound, the voice of the archangel. Your eyes
          shall see your judge sitting on the throne, they shall see those
          manifestations of wrath which there will be in his countenance. Your
          ears shall hear him pronounce the sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seriously consider, if you live in the ways of sin, and appear at that
          day with the guilt of it upon you, how you will be able to endure the
          sight or the hearing of these things, and whether horror and amazement
          will not be likely to seize you, when you shall see the judge
          descending, and hear the trump of God. What account will you be able
          to give, when it shall be inquired of you, why you led such a sinful,
          wicked life? What will you be able to say for yourselves, when it
          shall be asked, why you neglected such and such particular duties, as
          the duty of secret prayer, for instance? Or why you have habitually
          practiced such and such particular sins or lusts? Although you be so
          careless of your conduct and manner of life, make so light of sin, and
          proceed in it so freely, with little or no dread or remorse; yet you
          must give an account of every sin that you commit, of every idle word
          that you speak, and of every sinful thought of your hearts. Every time
          you deviate from the rules of justice, of temperance, or of charity;
          every time you indulge any lust, whether secretly or openly, you must
          give an account of it. It will never be forgotten, it stands written
          in that book which will be opened on that day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the rule you will be judged by. It is the perfect rule of the
          divine law, which is exceeding strict, and exceeding broad. And how
          will you ever be able to answer the demands of this law? — Consider
          also,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that the judge will be your supreme judge. You will have no
          opportunity to appeal from his decision. This is often the case in
          this world. When we are dissatisfied with the decisions of a judge, we
          often may appeal to a higher, a more knowing, or a more just
          judicatory. But no such appeal can be made from our Divine Judge. No
          such indulgence will be allowed. Or if it were allowed, there is no
          superior judge to whom the appeal should be made. By his decision,
          therefore, you must abide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the judge will be omnipotent. Were he a mere man, like
          yourselves, however he might judge and determine, you might resist,
          and by the help of others, if not by your own strength, prevent or
          elude the execution of the judgment. But the judge being omnipotent,
          this is utterly impossible. In vain is all resistance, either by
          yourselves, or by whatever help you can obtain. “Though hand join in
          hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished,” Pro. 11:21. As well might
          you “set the briers and thorns in battle against God,” Isa. 27:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, the judge will be inexorable. Human judges may be prevailed
          upon to reverse their sentence, or at least to remit something of its
          severity. But in vain will be all your entreaties, all your cries and
          tears to this effect, with the great Judge of the world. Now indeed he
          inclines his ear, and is ready to hear the prayers, cries, and
          entreaties of all mankind. But then the day of grace will be past, and
          the door of mercy be shut. Then although ye spread forth your hands,
          yet the judge will hide his eyes from you. Yea, though ye make many
          prayers, he will not hear. Isa. 1:15. Then the judge will deal in
          fury. His eye shall not spare, neither will he have pity. And though
          ye cry in his ears with a loud voice, yet will he not hear you. Eze.
          8:18. And you will find no place of repentance in God, though you seek
          it carefully with tears.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, the judge at that day will not mix mercy with justice. The
          time for mercy to be shown to sinners will then be past. Christ will
          then appear in another character than that of the merciful Savior.
          Having laid aside the inviting attributes of grace and mercy, he will
          clothe himself with justice and vengeance. He will not only, in
          general, exact of sinners the demands of the law, but he will exact
          the whole, without any abatement. He will exact the very uttermost
          farthing, Mat. 5:26. Then Christ will come to fulfill that in Rev.
          14:10, “The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
          poured out without mixture, into the cup of his indignation.” The
          punishment threatened to ungodly men is without any pity. See Eze.
          5:11, “Neither shall mine eye spare; neither will I have any pity.”
          Here all judgments have a mixture of mercy. But the wrath of God will
          be poured out upon the wicked without mixture, and vengeance will have
          its full weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I shall apply myself, thirdly, to several different characters of
          men.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, to those who live in secret wickedness. Let such consider that
          for all these things God will bring them into judgment. Secrecy is
          your temptation. Promising yourselves this, you practice many things,
          you indulge many lusts, under the covert of darkness, and in secret
          corners, which you would be ashamed to do in the light of the sun, and
          before the world. But this temptation is entirely groundless. All your
          secret abominations are even now perfectly known to God, and will also
          hereafter be made known both to angels and men. Luke 12:2, 3, “For
          there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid,
          that shall not be known. Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in
          darkness, shall be heard in the light: and that which ye have spoken
          in the ear in closets, shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Before human judges are brought only those things which are known. But
          before this judge shall be brought the most “hidden things of
          darkness, and even the counsels of the heart,” 1 Cor. 4:5. All your
          secret uncleanness, all your secret fraud and injustice, all your
          lascivious desires, wishes, and designs, all your inward covetousness,
          which is idolatry, all your malicious, envious, and revengeful
          thoughts and purposes, whether brought forth into practice or not,
          shall then be made manifest, and you shall be judged according to
          them. Of these things, however secret, there will be need of no other
          evidence than the testimony of God and of your own consciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, to such as are not just and upright in their dealings with
          their fellow-men. Consider, that all your dealings with men must be
          tried, must be brought forth into judgment, and there compared with
          the rules of the Word of God. All your actions must be judged
          according to those things which are found written in the book of the
          Word of God. If your ways of dealing with men shall not agree with
          those rules of righteousness, they will be condemned. Now, the Word of
          God directs us to practice entire justice. “That which is altogether
          just shalt thou follow,” Deu. 16:20, and to do to others as we would
          they would do to us. But how many are there, whose dealings with their
          fellow-men, if strictly tried by these rules, would not stand the
          test!
        </p>
        <p>
          God has, in his word, forbidden all deceit and fraud in our dealings
          one with another, Lev. 11:13. He has forbidden us to oppress one
          another, Lev. 25:14. But how frequent are practices contrary to those
          rules, and which will not bear to be tried by them! How common are
          fraud and trickishness in trade! How will men endeavor to lead on
          those with whom they trade in the dark, that so they may make their
          advantage! Yea, lying in trading is too common a thing among us. How
          common are such things as that mentioned, Pro. 20:14, “It is nought,
          it is nought, saith the buyer; but when he is gone his way, then he
          boasteth.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Many men will take the advantage of another’s ignorance to advance
          their own gain, to his wrong. Yea, they seem not to scruple such
          practices. Beside downright lying, men have many ways of blinding and
          deceiving one another in trade, which are by no means right in the
          sight of God, and will appear to be very unjust, when they shall be
          tried by the rule of God’s Word at the day of judgment. And how common
          a thing is oppression or extortion, in taking any advantage that men
          can by any means obtain, to get the utmost possible of their neighbor
          for what they have to dispose of, and their neighbor needs!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let such consider, that there is a God in heaven, who beholds them,
          and sees how they conduct themselves in their daily traffic with one
          another, and that he will try their works another day. Justice shall
          assuredly take place at last. The righteous Governor of the world will
          not suffer injustice without control. He will control and rectify it
          by returning the injury upon the head of the injurer. Mat. 7:2, “With
          what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, to those who plead for the lawfulness of practices generally
          condemned by God’s people. You who do this, consider that your
          practices must be tried at the day of judgment. Consider, whether or
          no they are likely to be approved by the most holy Judge at that day.
          Pro. 5:21, “The ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord; and he
          pondereth all his goings.” However, by your carnal reasonings, you may
          deceive your own hearts, yet you will not be able to deceive the
          judge, he will not hearken to your excuses, but will try your ways by
          the rule. He will know whether they be straight or crooked.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you plead for these and those liberties which you take, let it be
          considered, whether they be likely to be allowed of by the judge at
          the last great day. Will they bear to be tried by his eyes, which are
          purer than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity?
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, to those who are wont to excuse their wickedness. Will the
          excuses which you make for yourselves be accepted at the day of
          judgment? If you excuse yourselves to your own consciences, by saying
          that you were under such and such temptations which you could not
          withstand, that corrupt nature prevailed, and you could not overcome
          it, that it would have been so and so to your damage if you had done
          otherwise, that if you had done such a duty, you would have brought
          yourselves into difficulty, would have incurred the displeasure of
          such and such friends, or would have been despised and laughed at. Or
          if you say, you did no more than it was the common custom to do, no
          more than many godly men have done, no more than certain persons of
          good reputation now practice, that if you had done otherwise, you
          would have been singular. If these be your excuses for the sins which
          you commit, or for the duties which you neglect, let me ask you, will
          they appear sufficient when they shall be examined at the day of
          judgment?
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifth, to those who live in impenitence and unbelief. There are some
          persons who live in no open vice, and perhaps conscientiously avoid
          secret immorality, who yet live in impenitence and unbelief. They are
          indeed called upon to repent and believe the gospel, to forsake their
          evil ways and thoughts, and to return to God, that he may have mercy
          on them; to come unto Christ, laboring, and heavy-laden with sin, that
          they may obtain rest of him; and are assured, that if they believe,
          they shall be saved; and that if they believe not, they shall be
          damned; and all the most powerful motives are set before them, to
          induce them to comply with these exhortations, especially those drawn
          from the eternal world. Yet they persist in sin, they remain
          impenitent and unhumbled. They will not come unto Christ that they may
          have life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now such men shall be brought into judgment for their conduct, as well
          as more gross sinners. Nor will they be any more able to stand in the
          judgment than the other. They resist the most powerful means of grace,
          go on in sin against the clear light of the gospel, refuse to hearken
          to the kindest calls and invitations, reject the most amiable Savior,
          the judge himself, and despise the free offers of eternal life, glory,
          and felicity. And how will they be able to answer for these things at
          the tribunal of Christ?
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. If there be a day of judgment appointed, then let all be very
          strict in trying their own sincerity. God on that day will discover
          the secrets of all hearts. The judgment of that day will be like the
          fire, which burns up whatsoever is not true gold. Wood, hay, stubble,
          and dross, shall be all consumed by the scorching fire of that day.
          The judge will be like a refiner’s fire, and fuller’s soap, which will
          cleanse away all filthiness, however it may be colored over. Mal. 3:2,
          “Who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he
          appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap.”
          And Mal. 4:1, “For behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven,
          and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble,
          and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts.”
        </p>
        <p>
          There are multitudes of men that wear the guise of saints, appear like
          saints, and their state, both in their own eyes and in the eyes of
          their neighbors, is good. They have sheep’s clothing. But no disguise
          can hide them from the eyes of the judge of the world. His eyes are as
          a flame of fire. They search the hearts and try the reins of the
          children of men. He will see whether they be sound at heart. He will
          see from what principles they have acted. A fair show will in no
          degree deceive him, as it does men in the present state. It will
          signify nothing to say, “Lord, we have eaten and drunk in thy
          presence; and in thy name have we cast out devils, and in thy name
          have done many wonderful works.” It will signify nothing to pretend to
          a great deal of comfort and joy, and to the experience of great
          religious affections, and to your having done many things in religion
          and morality, unless you have some greater evidences of sincerity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherefore let everyone take heed that he be not deceived concerning
          himself. And that he depend not on that which will not bear
          examination at the day of judgment. Be not contented with this, that
          you have the judgment of men, the judgment of godly men, or that of
          ministers, in your favor. Consider that they are not to be your judges
          at last. Take occasion frequently to compare your hearts with the Word
          of God. That is the rule by which you are to be finally tried and
          judged. And try yourselves by your works, by which also you must be
          tried at last. Inquire whether you lead holy Christian lives, whether
          you perform universal and unconditional obedience to all God’s
          commands, and whether you do it from a truly gracious respect to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also frequently beg of God, the judge, that he would search you, try
          you now, and discover you to yourselves, that you may see if you be
          insincere in religion. And that he would lead you in the way
          everlasting. Beg of God, that if you be not upon a good foundation, he
          would unsettle you, and fix you upon the sure foundation. The example
          of the psalmist in this is worthy of imitation. Psa. 26:1, 2, “Judge
          me, O Lord, examine me, and prove me; try my reins and mine heart.”
          And Psa. 139:23, 24, “Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and
          know my thoughts. And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead
          me in the way everlasting.” God will search us hereafter, and discover
          what we are, both to ourselves and to all the world. Let us pray that
          he would search us, and discover our hearts to us now. We have need of
          divine help in this matter; for the heart is deceitful above all
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. If God has appointed a day to judge the world, let us judge and
          condemn ourselves for our sins. This we must do, if we would not be
          judged and condemned for them on that day. If we would escape
          condemnation, we must see that we justly may be condemned. We must be
          so sensible of our vileness and guilt, as to see that we deserve all
          that condemnation and punishment which are threatened. And that we are
          in the hands of God, who is the sovereign disposer of us, and will do
          with us as seemeth to himself good. Let us therefore often reflect on
          our sins, confess them before God, condemn and abhor ourselves, be
          truly humbled, and repent in dust and ashes.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. If these things be so, let us by no means be forward to judge
          others. Some are forward to judge others, to judge their hearts both
          in general and upon particular occasions, to determine as to the
          principles, motives, and ends of their actions. But this is to assume
          the province of God, and to set up ourselves as lords and judges. Rom.
          14:4, “Who art thou, that thou judgest another man’s servant?” Jam.
          4:11, “Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil
          of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and
          judgeth the law.” To be thus disposed to judge and act censoriously
          towards others, is the way to be judged and condemned ourselves. Mat.
          7:1, 2, “Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye
          judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be
          measured to you again.”
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. This doctrine affords matter of great consolation to the godly.
          This day of judgment, which is so terrible to ungodly men, affords no
          ground of terror to you, but abundant ground of joy and satisfaction.
          For though you now meet with more affliction and trouble than most
          wicked men, yet on that day you shall be delivered from all
          afflictions, and from all trouble. If you be unjustly treated by
          wicked men, and abused by them, what a comfort is it to the injured,
          that they may appeal to God, who judgeth righteously. The psalmist
          used often to comfort himself with this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon these accounts the saints have reason to love the appearing of
          Jesus Christ. 2 Tim. 4:8, “Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown
          of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me
          at that day: and not to me only, but to all those that love his
          appearing.” This is to the saints a blessed hope. Tit. 2:13, “Looking
          for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God,
          and our Saviour Jesus Christ. This day may well be the object of their
          eager desire, and when they hear of Christ’s coming to judgment, they
          may well say, “Even so come, Lord Jesus,” Rev. 22:20. It will be the
          most glorious day that ever the saints saw. It will be so both to
          those who shall die, and whose souls shall go to heaven, and to those
          who shall then be found alive on earth. It will be the wedding-day of
          the church. Surely then in the consideration of the approach of this
          day, there is ground of great consolation to the saints.
