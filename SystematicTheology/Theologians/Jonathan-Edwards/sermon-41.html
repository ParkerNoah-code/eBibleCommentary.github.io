        <h2>The Nature and End of Excommunication – 1 Corinthians 5:11</h2>
        <p class="title">
          Preached on the occasion of the excommunication of John Bridgman’s
          wife. June, 1749
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Corinthians 5:11, “But now I have written unto you not to keep
          company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or
          covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an
          extortioner; with such a one no not to eat.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THE apostle reproves the church at Corinth for not excommunicating an
          offending person; and directs them speedily to cast him out from among
          them; thus delivering him to Satan. He orders them to purge out such
          scandalous persons, as the Jews were wont to purge leaven out of their
          houses when they kept the Passover. In the text and two foregoing
          verses, he more particularly explains their duty with respect to such
          vicious persons, and enjoins it on them not to keep company with such.
          But then shows the difference they ought to observe in their carriage
          towards those who were vicious among the heathen, who had never joined
          with the church, and towards those of the same vicious character who
          had been their professed brethren; see verses 9-12. “I wrote unto you,
          not to company with fornicators. Yet not altogether with the
          fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or
          with idolaters, for then must ye needs go out of the world. But now I
          have written unto you, not to keep company, if any man that is called
          a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer,
          or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no not to eat.”
        </p>
        <p>In the words of the text we may observe:</p>
        <p>
          1. The duty enjoined: including the behavior required, negatively
          expressed, not to keep company, and the manner or degree, no not to
          eat.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The object: a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer,
          or a drunkard, or an extortioner. We are not to understand merely
          these particular vices, but also any other gross sins, or visible
          wickedness. It is evident, that the apostle here and in the context,
          intends that we should exclude out of our company all those who are
          visibly wicked men. For in the foregoing verses he expresses his
          meaning by this, that we should purge out the old leaven. And
          explaining what he means by leaven, he includes all visible
          wickedness; as in verse 8. “Therefore let us keep the feast, not with
          old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with
          the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing by which the object of this behavior or dealing is
          characterized, is that he be one that is called a brother, or one that
          hath been a professed Christian, and a member of the church.
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          Those members of the visible Christian church who are become visibly
          wicked, ought not to be tolerated in the church, but should be
          excommunicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          In handling this subject, I shall speak, (1.) Of the nature of
          excommunication; (2.) Of the subject; and (3.) Of the ends of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I shall say something of the nature of excommunication. It is a
          punishment executed in the name and according to the will of Christ,
          whereby a person who hath heretofore enjoyed the privileges of a
          member of the visible church of Christ is cast out of the church and
          delivered unto Satan. It is a punishment inflicted; it is expressly
          called a punishment by the apostle in 2 Cor. 2:6. Speaking of the
          excommunicated Corinthian, he says, “Sufficient to such a man is this
          punishment.” For though it be not designed by man for the destruction
          of the person, but for his correction, and so is of the nature of a
          castigatory punishment, at least so far as it is inflicted by men; yet
          it is in itself a great and dreadful calamity, and the most severe
          punishment that Christ hath appointed in the visible church. Although
          in it the church is to seek only the good of the person and his
          recovery from sin — there appearing, upon proper trial, no reason to
          hope for his recovery by gentler means — yet it is at God’s sovereign
          disposal, whether it shall issue in his humiliation and repentance, or
          in his dreadful and eternal destruction; as it always doth issue in
          the one or the other. — In the definition of excommunication now
          given, two things are chiefly worthy of consideration; viz. Wherein
          this punishment consists, and by whom it is inflicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I would show wherein this punishment consists; and it is
          observable that there is in it something privative, and something
          positive.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. There is something privative in excommunication, which consists in
          being deprived of a benefit heretofore enjoyed. This part of the
          punishment, in the Jewish church, was called putting out of the
          synagogue, John 16:2. The word synagogue is of the same signification
          as the word church. So this punishment in the Christian church is
          called casting out of the church. The apostle John, blaming Diotrephes
          for inflicting this punishment without cause, says in 3 John 10. “He
          casteth them out of the church.” It is sometimes expressed by the
          church’s withdrawing from a member, 2 Thes. 3:6. “Now we command you,
          brethren, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw
          yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The privative part of excommunication consists in being cut off from
          the enjoyment of the privileges of God’s visible people. The whole
          world of mankind is divided into these two sorts: those that are God’s
          visible people and those that are of the visible kingdom of Satan. Now
          it is a great privilege to be within the visible church of Christ. On
          the other hand, it is very doleful to be without this visible kingdom,
          to be cut off from its privileges, treated as belonging to the visible
          kingdom of Satan. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) They are cut off from being the objects of that charity of God’s
          people which is due to Christian brethren. They are not indeed cut off
          from all the charity of God’s people, for all men ought to be the
          objects of their love. But I speak of the brotherly charity due to
          visible saints. — Charity, as the apostle represents it, is the bond
          by which the several members of the church of Christ are united
          together: and therefore he calls it the bond of perfectness; Col.
          3:14. “Put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.” But when a
          person is justly excommunicated, it is like a physician’s cutting off
          a diseased member from the body; and then the bond which before united
          it to the body is cut or broken. — A scandal is the same as a
          stumbling-block. And therefore while the scandal remains, it obstructs
          the charity of others. And if it finally remain after proper endeavors
          to remove it, then it breaks their charity, and so the offender is cut
          off from the charitable opinion and esteem of the church. It cannot
          any longer look upon him as a Christian, and so rejects him. Therefore
          excommunication is called a rejection, Tit. 3:10. “A man that is a
          heretic, after the first and second admonition, reject.” This implies
          that the church disapproves the person as a Christian. It cannot any
          longer charitably look upon him as a saint, or fellow-worshipper of
          God, and can do no other than, on the contrary, esteem him an enemy of
          God. And so [it] doth openly withdraw its charity from him, ceasing to
          acknowledge him as a fellow-Christian, any more than the heathens. He
          is also cut off from that honor which is due to brethren and
          fellow-Christians. To be a visible Christian is an honorable
          character; but excommunicated persons forfeit this honor. Christians
          ought not to pay that honor and respect to them which they pay to
          others; but should treat them as unworthy of such honor, that they may
          be ashamed. Christ tells us, they should “be unto us as heathen men
          and publicans,” (Mat. 18:17) which implies a withdrawing from them
          that common respect which we pay to others. We ought to treat them so
          as to let them plainly see that we do not count them worthy of it, to
          put them to shame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much love and complacency is due to those whom we are obliged in
          charity to receive as saints, because they are visible Christians. But
          this complacency excommunicated persons forfeit. We should still wish
          well to them, and seek their good. Excommunication itself is to be
          performed as an act of benevolence. We should seek their good by it;
          and it is to be used as a means of their eternal salvation. But
          complacency and delight in them as visible Christians is to be
          withdrawn. And on the contrary, they are to be the objects of
          displacency, as visibly and apparently wicked. We are to cast them out
          as an unclean thing which defiles the church of God. — In this sense
          the psalmist professes a hatred of those who were the visible enemies
          of God. Psa. 139:21, 22. “Do I not hate them, O lord, that hate thee?
          And am I not grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them
          with perfect hatred.” Not that he hated them with a hatred of malice
          or ill-will, but with displacency and abhorrence of their wickedness.
          In this respect we ought to be the children of our Father who is in
          heaven, who, though he loves many wicked men with a love of
          benevolence, yet cannot love them with a love of complacency. Thus
          excommunicated persons are cut off from the charity of the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) They are cut off also from the society which Christians have
          together as brethren. Thus we are commanded to withdraw from such; 2
          Thes. 3:6. To avoid them; Rom. 16:17. To have no company with them; 2
          Thes. 3:14. And to treat them as heathens and publicans; Mat. 18:17.
          The people of God are, as much as may be, to withdraw from them as to
          that common society which is proper to subsist among Christians. — Not
          that they should avoid speaking to them on any occasion. All manner
          and all degrees of society are not forbidden; but all unnecessary
          society, or such as is wont to be among those who delight in the
          company of each other. We should not associate ourselves with them so
          as to make them our companions. Yea, there ought to be such an
          avoiding of their company as may show great dislike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particularly, we are forbidden such a degree of associating ourselves
          with them, as there is in making them our guests at our tables, or in
          being their guests at their tables; as is manifest in the text, where
          we are commanded to have no company with them, no not to eat. That
          this respects not eating with them at the Lord’s supper, but a common
          eating, is evident by the words, that the eating here forbidden, is
          one of the lowest degrees of keeping company, which are forbidden.
          Keep no company with such a one, saith the apostle, no not to eat — as
          much as to say, no not in so low a degree as to eat with him. But
          eating with him at the Lord’s supper, is the very highest degree of
          visible Christian communion. Who can suppose that the apostle meant
          this: Take heed and have no company with a man, no not so much as in
          the highest degree of communion that you can have? Besides, the
          apostle mentions this eating as a way of keeping company which,
          however, they might hold with the heathen. He tells them, not to keep
          company with fornicators. Then he informs them, he means not with
          fornicators of this world, that is, the heathens; but, saith he, “if
          any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, etc. with such a one
          keep no company, no not to eat.” This makes it most apparent, that the
          apostle doth not mean eating at the Lord’s table; for so, they might
          not keep company with the heathens, any more than with an
          excommunicated person. Here naturally arise two questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUEST. I. How far are the church to treat excommunicated persons as
          they would those who never have been of the visible church? I answer,
          they are to treat them as heathens, excepting in these two things, in
          which there is a difference to be observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. They are to have a greater concern for their welfare still, than if
          they never had been brethren, and therefore ought to take more pains,
          by admonitions and otherwise, to reclaim and save them, than they are
          obliged to take towards those who have been always heathens. This
          seems manifest by that of the apostle, 2 Thes. 3:14, 15. “And if any
          man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no
          company with him, that he may be ashamed. Yet count him not as an
          enemy, but admonish him as a brother.” The consideration that he hath
          been a brother heretofore, and that we have not finally cast him off
          from that relation, but that we are still hoping and using means for
          his recovery, obliges us to concern ourselves more for the good of his
          soul than for those with whom we never had any such connection; and so
          to pray for him, and to take pains by admonishing him. — The very
          reason of the thing shows the same. For this very ordinance of
          excommunication is used for this end, that we may thereby obtain the
          good of the person excommunicated. And surely we should be more
          concerned for the good of those who have been our brethren, and who
          are now under the operation of means used by us for their good, than
          for those with whom we never had any special connection. Thus, there
          should be more of the love of benevolence exercised towards persons
          excommunicated, than towards those who never were members of the
          church. — But then,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. On the other hand, as to what relates to the love of complacence,
          they ought to be treated with greater displacency and disrespect than
          the heathen. This is plain by the text and context. For the apostle
          plainly doth not require of us to avoid the company of the heathen, or
          the fornicators of the world, but expressly requires us to avoid the
          company of any brother who shall be guilty of any of the vices pointed
          out in the text, or any other like them. — This is also plain by the
          reason of the thing. For those who have once been visible Christians
          and have apostatized and cast off that visibility, deserve to be
          treated with more abhorrence than those who have never made any
          pretensions to Christianity. The sin of such, in apostatizing from
          their profession, is more aggravated, than the sin of those who never
          made any profession. They far more dishonor religion, and are much
          more abhorred of God. Therefore when Christ says, Mat. 18:17. “Let him
          be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican,” it is not meant that
          we should treat an excommunicated brother as Christians ought to treat
          heathens and publicans; for they might eat with them, as Christ
          himself did; and the apostle gives leave to eat with such, 1 Cor.
          10:27, and in the context gives leave to keep company with such; yet
          forbids to eat with an excommunicated person. — Christ’s meaning must
          be, that we should treat an excommunicated person as the Jews were
          wont to treat the heathens and publicans; and as the disciples had
          been always taught among the Jews, and brought up, and used to treat
          them. They would by no means eat with publicans and sinners. They
          would not eat with the Gentiles, or with the Samaritans. Therefore
          Peter [dare] not eat with the Gentiles when the Jews were present;
          Gal. 2:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUEST. II. What kindness and respect may and ought to be shown to such
          persons? — I answer, There are some things by which the members of the
          church are obliged to show kindness to them; and these things are
          chiefly, to pray for them, and to admonish them. — And the common
          duties and offices of humanity ought to be performed towards them;
          such as relieving them when they are sick, or under any other
          distress; allowing them those benefits of human society, and that
          help, which are needful for the support and defense of their lives and
          property. — The duties of natural and civil relations are still to be
          performed towards them. Excommunication doth not release children from
          the obligation of duty to their parents, nor parents from parental
          affection and care toward their children. Nor are husbands and wives
          released from the duties proper to their relation. And so of all other
          less relations, whether natural, domestic, or civil.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They are cut off from the fellowship of the Christian church. The
          true notion of the visible church of Christ, is that part of mankind,
          which, as his people, is united in upholding his appointed worship.
          And the notion of a particular visible church of Christ, is a
          particular society of worshippers, or of visible saints, united for
          the social worship of God according to his institutions or ordinances.
          One great and main privilege then, which the members of such a church
          enjoy, is fellowship in the worship which God hath appointed in his
          church. But they that are excommunicated are cut off from this
          privilege, they have no fellowship, no communion with the people of
          God in any part of their worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          He who is the mouth of the worshipping congregation in offering up
          public prayers, is the mouth only of the worshipping society. But the
          excommunicated are cast out of that society. The church may and ought
          to pray for such. But they cannot have fellowship with such in prayer.
          The minister, when speaking in prayer, doth not speak in their name;
          he speaks only in the name of the united society of visible saints or
          worshippers. If the people of God were to put up prayers in their
          name, it would imply a receiving of them into charity, or that they
          charitably looked upon them as the servants or worshippers of God.
          But, as was observed before, excommunicated persons are in this
          respect cast out of the charity of the church, and it looks upon them
          as wicked men and enemies of God, and treats them as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when a congregation of visible saints joins in singing the praises
          of God, as the psalmist says, Psa. 34:3. “Let us extol his name
          together;” they do it only as joining with those who are, in their
          charitable estimation, fellow-servants and fellow-worshippers of God.
          They do it not as joining with heathens; nor do the people of God say
          to the open enemies of God, remaining such, “Come let us extol his
          name together;” but they say it to their brethren in God’s service. If
          we ought not to join with excommunicated persons in familiar society,
          much less ought we to hold fellowship with them in solemn worship,
          though they may be present.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. There are privileges of a more internal nature, which those who are
          members of the visible church enjoy, from which excommunicated persons
          are cut off. They being God’s covenant-people, are in the way of
          covenant-blessings; and therefore have more encouragement to come to
          God by prayer for any mercy they need. The visible church is the
          people among whom God hath set his tabernacle, and among whom he is
          wont to bestow his blessings. But the excommunicated are, in a sense,
          cast out of God’s sight, into a land of banishment, as Cain was,
          though not debarred from common means. Gen. 4:14, 16. They are not in
          the way of those smiles of providence, those tokens of God’s favor,
          and that light of God’s countenance, like those who are within. Nor,
          as they are cast out from among God’s covenant people, have they the
          divine covenant to plead, as the members of the church have. — Thus
          far I have considered the privative part of the punishment of
          excommunication. — I now proceed,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. To the positive part, which is expressed by being delivered to
          Satan, in verse 5. By which two things seem to be signified:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) A being delivered over to the calamities to which they are
          subject, who belong to the visible kingdom of the devil. As they who
          are excommunicated are thrust out from among the visible people of
          God; so they are to be looked upon, in most respects at least, as
          being in the miserable, deplorable circumstances in which those are
          who are under the visible tyranny of the devil, as the heathens are.
          And in many respects, they doubtless suffer the cruel tyranny of the
          devil, in a manner agreeable to their condition, being cast out into
          his visible kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) It is reasonable to suppose that God is wont to make the devil the
          instrument of those peculiar, severe chastisements which their
          apostasy deserves. As they deserve more severe chastisement than the
          heathens, and are delivered to Satan, for the destruction of the
          flesh. So we may well suppose, either that God is wont to let Satan
          loose, sorely to molest them outwardly or inwardly, and by such severe
          means to destroy the flesh, and to humble them; or that he suffers the
          devil to take possession of them dreadfully to harden them, and so to
          destroy them for ever. For although what men are to aim at, is only
          the destruction of the flesh, yet whether it shall prove the
          destruction of the flesh, or the eternal and more dreadful destruction
          of themselves, is as God’s sovereign disposal. — So much for the
          nature of excommunication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I come to show by whom the punishment is to be inflicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. When it is regularly and duly inflicted, it is to be looked upon as
          done by Christ himself. That is imported in the definition, that it is
          according to his will, and to the directions of his word. And
          therefore he is to be looked upon as principal in it, and we ought to
          esteem it as really and truly from him, as if he were on earth
          personally inflicting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As it is inflicted by men, it is only done ministerially. They do
          not act of themselves in this, any more than in preaching the Word.
          When the Word is preached, it is the word of Christ which is spoken,
          as the preacher speaks in the name of Christ, as his ambassador. So
          when a church excommunicates a member, the church acts in the name of
          Christ, and by his authority, not by its own. It is governed by his
          will, not by its own. Indeed it is only a particular application of
          the word of Christ. — Therefore it is promised, that when it is duly
          done, it shall be confirmed in heaven; i.e. Christ will confirm it, by
          acknowledging it to be his own act. And he will, in his future
          providence, have regard to what is done thus as done by himself. He
          will look on the person, and treat him as cast out and delivered to
          Satan by himself; and if he repent not, will for ever reject him: Mat.
          18:18. “Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth,
          shall be bound in heaven.” John 20:23. “Whose soever sins ye retain,
          they are retained.” — I shall now, as was proposed,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Endeavor to show who are the proper subjects of excommunication.
          They are those members of the church who are now become visibly
          wicked; for the very name and nature of the visible church show, that
          it is a society of visible saints, or visibly holy persons. When any
          of these visible saints become visibly wicked men, they ought to be
          cast out of the church. Now, the members of the church become visibly
          wicked by these two things:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, by gross sin. Saints may be guilty of other sins, and very
          often are, without throwing any just stumbling-block in the way of
          public charity, or of the charity of their Christian brethren. The
          common failures of humanity, and the daily short-comings of the best
          of men, do not ordinarily obstruct the charity of their brethren. But
          when they fall into any gross sin, this effect follows; for we
          naturally argue, that he who hath committed some gross sin hath
          doubtless much more practiced less and more secret sins; and so we
          doubt concerning the soundness and sincerity of his heart. Therefore
          all those who commit any gross sin, as they obstruct the charity of
          their brethren, are proper subjects of discipline. And unless they
          confess their sin, and manifest their repentance, are proper subjects
          of excommunication. — This leads me to say,
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, that the members of the church do especially become visibly
          wicked, when they remain impenitent in their sins, after proper means
          used to reclaim them. Merely being guilty of any gross sin, is a
          stumbling-block to charity, unless repentance immediately succeed; but
          especially when the guilty person remains obstinate and contumacious.
          In such a case he is most clearly a visible wicked person, and
          therefore to be dealt with as such; to be cast out into the wicked
          world, the kingdom of Satan, where he appears to belong. — Nor is
          contumacy in gross sins only a sufficient ground of excommunication.
          In the text the apostle commands us to inflict this censure, not only
          on those who are guilty of the gross sins of fornication, idolatry,
          and drunkenness, but also on those who are guilty of covetousness,
          railing, and extortion, which, at least in some degrees of them, are
          too generally esteemed no very heinous crimes. And in Rom. 16:17, the
          same apostle commands the church to excommunicate “them who cause
          divisions and offenses, contrary to the doctrine they had learned;”
          and in 2 Thes. 3:14, to excommunicate everyone who should “not obey
          his word by that epistle.” Now, according to these precepts, everyone
          who doth not observe the doctrine of the apostles, and their word
          contained in their epistles, and so, by parity of reason, the divine
          instructions contained in the other parts of Scripture, is to be
          excommunicated, provided he continue impenitent and contumacious. So
          that contumacy and impenitence in any real and manifest sin
          whatsoever, deserve excommunication.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I come to speak of the ends of this ecclesiastical ensure. The
          special ends of it are these three:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, that the church may be kept pure, and the ordinances of God not
          be defiled. This end is mentioned in the context, verse 6, etc. “Know
          ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? Purge out
          therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are
          unleavened. Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven,
          neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the
          unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.” — When the ordinances of God
          are defiled by the toleration of wicked men in the church, God the
          Father, Jesus Christ the head and founder of the church, the religion
          of the gospel, and the church itself, are dishonored and exposed to
          contempt. — And that the other members themselves may not be defiled,
          it is necessary that they bear a testimony against sin, by censuring
          it whenever it appears among them, especially in the grosser acts of
          wickedness. If they neglect so to do, they contract guilt by the very
          neglect. And not only so, but they expose themselves to learn the same
          vices which they tolerate in others; for “a little leaven leaveneth
          the whole lump.” Hence that earnest caution of the apostle, Heb.
          12:15. “Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest
          any root of bitterness springing up, trouble you, and thereby many be
          defiled.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, that others may be deterred from wickedness. As the neglect of
          proper censure, with respect to visibly wicked church-members, tends
          to lead and encourage others to commit the same wickedness. So the
          infliction of proper censure tends to restrain others, not only from
          the same wickedness, but from sin in general. This therefore is
          repeatedly mentioned as one end of the punishments appointed to be
          inflicted by the law of Moses, Deu. 13:11. “And all Israel shall hear,
          and fear, and shall do no more such wickedness as this is among you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, that the persons themselves may be reclaimed, and that their
          souls may be saved. When other more gentle means have been used in
          vain, then it is the duty of the church to use this, which is more
          severe, in order to bring them to conviction, shame, and humiliation.
          And that, by being rejected and avoided by the church, and treated
          with disrespect, they may be convinced how they deserve to be for ever
          disowned of God; that by being delivered unto Satan, they may learn
          how they deserve forever to be delivered up to him; that by his being
          made the instrument of their chastisement, they may learn how they
          deserve to be tormented by him, without any rest day or night, forever
          and ever. — This, with the counsels and admonitions by which it is to
          be followed, is the last mean that the church is to use, in order to
          reclaim those members which are become visibly wicked. If this be
          ineffectual, what is next to be expected is destruction without
          remedy.
        </p>
        <p>APPLICATION</p>
        <p>
          I shall apply this subject in a brief use of exhortation to this
          church, to maintain strictly the proper discipline of the gospel in
          general, and particularly that part of it which consists in
          excommunication. To this end I shall just suggest to you the following
          motives.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That if you tolerate visible wickedness in your members, you will
          greatly dishonor God, our Lord Jesus Christ, the religion which you
          profess, the church in general, and yourselves in particular. As those
          members of the church who practice wickedness, bring dishonor upon the
          whole body, so do those who tolerate them in it. The language of it
          is, that God doth not require holiness in his servants; that Christ
          doth not require it in his disciples; that the religion of the gospel
          is not a holy religion; that the church is not a body of holy servants
          of God; and that this church, in particular, hath no regard to
          holiness or true virtue.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Your own good loudly calls you to the same thing. From what hath
          been already said, you see how liable you, as individuals, will be to
          catch the contagion, which is easily communicated by reason of the
          natural depravity, in a degree at least, remaining in the best of men.
          — Beside, if strict discipline be maintained among you, it will not
          only tend to prevent the spread of wickedness, but to make you more
          fruitful in holiness. If you know that the eyes of your brethren
          observe all your conduct, it will not only make you more guarded
          against sin, but more careful “to maintain good works,” and to abound
          in “the fruits of the Spirit.” Thus you will have more abundant joy
          and peace in believing.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The good of those who are without should be another motive. What
          the apostle saith with reference to another subject, 1 Cor. 14:24, 25,
          is perfectly applicable to the case before us: “But if all prophesy,
          and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is
          convinced of all, he is judged of all; and thus are the secrets of his
          heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face, he will worship
          God, and report that God is in you of a truth.” If strict discipline,
          and thereby strict morals, were maintained in the church, it would in
          all probability be one of the most powerful means of conviction and
          conversion towards those who are without.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Benevolence towards your offending brethren themselves, calls upon
          you to maintain discipline in all its parts. Surely, if we love our
          brethren, it will grieve us to see them wandering from the path of
          truth and duty; and in proportion as our compassion is moved, shall we
          be disposed to use all proper means to reclaim and bring them back to
          the right way. Now, the rules of discipline contained in the gospel
          are the most proper, and best adapted to this end, that infinite
          wisdom itself could devise. Even excommunication is instituted for
          this very end, the destruction of the flesh, and the salvation of the
          spirit. If, therefore, we have any love of benevolence to our
          offending and erring brethren, it becomes us to manifest it, in
          executing strictly the rules of gospel-discipline, and even
          excommunication itself, whenever it is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. But the absolute authority of Christ ought to be sufficient in this
          case, if there were no other motive. Our text is only one of many
          passages in the Scripture, wherein strict discipline is expressly
          commanded, and peremptorily enjoined. Now, how can you be the true
          disciples of Christ, if you live in the neglect of these plain
          positive commands? “If ye love me,” saith Christ, “keep my
          commandments;” and, “Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I have
          commanded you.” But, “he that loveth me not, keepeth not my sayings.”
          “And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?” If
          you strictly follow the rules of discipline instituted by Christ, you
          have reason to hope for his blessing; for he is wont to bless his own
          institutions, and to smile upon the means of grace which he hath
          appointed.
