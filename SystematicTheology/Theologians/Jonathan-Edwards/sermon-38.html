        <h2>A Divine and Supernatural Light – Matthew 16:17</h2>
        <p class="title">Preached in Northampton, 1734.</p>
        <p>
          Immediately Imparted to the Soul, by the Spirit of God, Show to be
          Both a Scriptural and Rational Doctrine
        </p>
        <p>
          Matthew 16:17, “And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art
          thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto
          thee, but my Father which is in heaven.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ addresses these words to Peter upon occasion of his professing
          his faith in him as the Son of God. Our Lord was inquiring of his
          disciples, whom men said that he was: not that he needed to be
          informed, but only to introduce and give occasion to what follows.
          They answer, that some said he was John the Baptist, and some Elias,
          and others Jeremias, or one of the Prophets. When they had thus given
          an account who others said that he was, Christ asks them, whom they
          said he was? Simon Peter, whom we find always zealous and forward, was
          the first to answer. He readily replied to the question, Thou art
          Christ, the Son of the living God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon this occasion, Christ says as he does to him, and of him in the
          text: in which we may observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That Peter is pronounced blessed on this account. — Blessed art
          thou — “Thou art a happy man, that thou art not ignorant of this, that
          I am Christ, the Son of the living God. Thou art distinguishingly
          happy. Others are blinded and have dark and deluded apprehensions, as
          you have now given an account, some thinking that I am Elias, and some
          that I am Jeremias, and some one thing, and some another, but none of
          them thinking right, all of them misled. Happy art thou, that art so
          distinguished as to know the truth in this matter.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The evidence of this his happiness declared; viz., that God, and he
          only, had revealed it to him. This is an evidence of his being
          blessed,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, as it shows how peculiarly favored he was of God above others:
          q. d. “How highly favored art thou, that others, wise and great men,
          the scribes, Pharisees, and Rulers, and the nation in general, are
          left in darkness, to follow their own misguided apprehensions; and
          that thou shouldst be singled out, as it were, by name, that my
          heavenly Father should thus set his love, on thee, Simon Barjona. —
          This argues thee blessed, that thou shouldst thus be the object of
          God’s distinguishing love.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, it evidences his blessedness also, as it intimates that this
          knowledge is above any that flesh and blood can reveal. “This is such
          knowledge as only my Father which is in heaven can give: it is too
          high and excellent to be communicated by such means as other knowledge
          is. Thou art blessed, that thou knowest that which God alone can teach
          thee.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The original of this knowledge is here declared, both negatively and
          positively. Positively, as God is here declared the author of it.
          Negatively, as it is declared, that flesh and blood had not revealed
          it. God is the author of all knowledge and understanding whatsoever.
          He is the author of all moral prudence, and of the skill that men have
          in their secular business. Thus it is said of all in Israel that were
          wise-hearted, and skillful in embroidering, that God had filled them
          with the spirit of wisdom, Exo. 28:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is the author of such knowledge, yet so that flesh and blood
          reveals it. Mortal men are capable of imparting the knowledge of human
          arts and sciences, and skill in temporal affairs. God is the author of
          such knowledge by those means: flesh and blood is employed as the
          mediate or second cause of it. He conveys it by the power and
          influence of natural means. But this spiritual knowledge spoken of in
          the text, is what God is the author of, and none else. He reveals it,
          and flesh and blood reveals it not. He imparts this knowledge
          immediately, not making use of any intermediate natural causes, as he
          does in other knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          What had passed in the preceding discourse naturally occasioned Christ
          to observe this, because the disciples had been telling how others did
          not know him, but were generally mistaken about him, and divided and
          confounded in their opinions of him. But Peter had declared his
          assured faith, that he was the Son of God. Now it was natural to
          observe, how it was not flesh and blood that had revealed it to him,
          but God. For if this knowledge were dependent on natural causes or
          means, how came it to pass that they, a company of poor fishermen,
          illiterate men, and persons of low education, attained to the
          knowledge of the truth, while the scribes and Pharisees, men of vastly
          higher advantages, and greater knowledge and sagacity in other
          matters, remained in ignorance? This could be owing only to the
          gracious distinguishing influence and revelation of the Spirit of God.
          Hence, what I would make the subject of my present discourse from
          these words, is this
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          That there is such a thing as a spiritual and divine light,
          immediately imparted to the soul by God, of a different nature from
          any that is obtained by natural means. — And on this subject I would,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Show what this divine light is.<br />
          II. How it is given immediately by God, and not obtained by natural
          means.<br />
          III. Show the truth of the doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>And then conclude with a brief improvement.</p>
        <p>
          I. I would show what this spiritual and divine light is. And in order
          to it, would show,
        </p>
        <p>First, in a few things, what it is not. And here,</p>
        <p>
          1. Those convictions that natural men may have of their sin and
          misery, is not this spiritual and divine light. Men in a natural
          condition may have convictions of the guilt that lies upon them, and
          of the anger of God, and their danger of divine vengeance. Such
          convictions are from light of truth. That some sinners have a greater
          conviction of their guilt and misery than others, is because some have
          more light, or more of an apprehension of truth, than others. And this
          light and conviction may be from the Spirit of God. The Spirit
          convinces men of sin, but yet nature is much more concerned in it than
          in the communication of that spiritual and divine light that is spoken
          of in the doctrine. It is from the Spirit of God only as assisting
          natural principles, and not as infusing any new principles. Common
          grace differs from special, in that it influences only by assisting of
          nature, and not by imparting grace, or bestowing anything above
          nature. The light that is obtained is wholly natural, or of no
          superior kind to what mere nature attains to, though more of that kind
          be obtained than would be obtained if men were left wholly to
          themselves. Or, in other words, common grace only assists the
          faculties of the soul to do that more fully which they do by nature,
          as natural conscience or reason will by mere nature make a man
          sensible of guilt, and will accuse and condemn him when he has done
          amiss. Conscience is a principle natural to men, and the work that it
          does naturally, or of itself, is to give an apprehension of right and
          wrong, and to suggest to the mind the relation that there is between
          right and wrong, and a retribution. The Spirit of God, in those
          convictions which unregenerate men sometimes have, assists conscience
          to do this work in a further degree than it would do if they were left
          to themselves. He helps it against those things that tend to stupefy
          it, and obstruct its exercise. But in the renewing and sanctifying
          work of the Holy Ghost, those things are wrought in the soul that are
          above nature, and of which there is nothing of the like kind in the
          soul by nature. They are caused to exist in the soul habitually, and
          according to such a stated constitution or law that lays such a
          foundation for exercises in a continued course, as is called a
          principle of nature. Not only are remaining principles assisted to do
          their work more freely and fully, but those principles are restored
          that were utterly destroyed by the fall. The mind thenceforward
          habitually exerts those acts that the dominion of sin had made it as
          wholly destitute of, as a dead body is of vital acts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Spirit of God acts in a very different manner in the one case,
          from what he does in the other. He may indeed act upon the mind of a
          natural man, but he acts in the mind of a saint as an indwelling vital
          principle. He acts upon the mind of an unregenerate person as an
          extrinsic, occasional agent, for in acting upon them, he does not
          unite himself to them. For notwithstanding all his influences that
          they may possess, they are still sensual, having not the Spirit, Jude
          19. But he unites himself with the mind of a saint, takes him for his
          temple, actuates and influences him as a new supernatural principle of
          life and action. There is this difference, that the Spirit of God, in
          acting in the soul of a godly man, exerts and communicates himself
          there in his own proper nature. Holiness is the proper nature of the
          Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit operates in the minds of the godly, by
          uniting himself to them, and living in them, and exerting his own
          nature in the exercise of their faculties. The Spirit of God may act
          upon a creature, and yet not in acting communicate himself. The Spirit
          of God may act upon inanimate creatures, as the Spirit moved upon the
          face of the waters, in the beginning of the creation. So the Spirit of
          God may act upon the minds of men many ways, and communicate himself
          no more than when he acts upon an inanimate creature. For instance, he
          may excite thoughts in them, may assist their natural reason and
          understanding, or may assist other natural principles, and this
          without any union with the soul, but may act, as it were, upon an
          external object. But as he acts in his holy influences and spiritual
          operations, he acts in a way of peculiar communication of himself, so
          that the subject is thence denominated spiritual.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This spiritual and divine light does not consist in any impression
          made upon the imagination. It is no impression upon the mind, as
          though one saw anything with the bodily eyes. It is no imagination or
          idea of an outward light or glory, or any beauty of form or
          countenance, or a visible luster or brightness of any object. The
          imagination may be strongly impressed with such things, but this is
          not spiritual light. Indeed when the mind has a lively discovery of
          spiritual things, and is greatly affected by the power of divine
          light, it may, and probably very commonly does, much affect the
          imagination, so that impressions of an outward beauty or brightness
          may accompany those spiritual discoveries. But spiritual light is not
          that impression upon the imagination, but an exceeding different
          thing. Natural men may have lively impressions on their imaginations,
          and we cannot determine but the devil, who transforms himself into an
          angel of light, may cause imaginations of an outward beauty, or
          visible glory, and of sounds and speeches, and other such things. But
          these are things of a vastly inferior nature to spiritual light.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This spiritual light is not the suggesting of any new truths or
          propositions not contained in the Word of God. This suggesting of new
          truths or doctrines to the mind, independent of any antecedent
          revelation of those propositions, either in word or writing, is
          inspiration, such as the prophets and apostles had, and such as some
          enthusiasts pretend to. But this spiritual light that I am speaking
          of, is quite a different thing from inspiration. It reveals no new
          doctrine, it suggests no new proposition to the mind, it teaches no
          new thing of God, or Christ, or another world, not taught in the
          Bible, but only gives a due apprehension of those things that are
          taught in the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is not every affecting view that men have of religious things
          that is this spiritual and divine light. Men by mere principles of
          nature are capable of being affected with things that have a special
          relation to religion as well as other things. A person by mere nature,
          for instance, may be liable to be affected with the story of Jesus
          Christ, and the sufferings he underwent, as well as by any other
          tragic story. He may be the more affected with it from the interest he
          conceives mankind to have in it. Yea, he may be affected with it
          without believing it, as well as a man may be affected with what he
          reads in a romance, or sees acted in a stage play. He may be affected
          with a lively and eloquent description of many pleasant things that
          attend the state of the blessed in heaven, as well as his imagination
          be entertained by a romantic description of the pleasantness of fairy
          land, or the like. And a common belief of the truth of such things,
          from education or otherwise, may help forward their affection. We read
          in Scripture of many that were greatly affected with things of a
          religious nature, who yet are there represented as wholly graceless,
          and many of them very ill men. A person therefore may have affecting
          views of the things of religion, and yet be very destitute of
          spiritual light. Flesh and blood may be the author of this: one man
          may give another an affecting view of divine things with but common
          assistance, but God alone can give a spiritual discovery of them. —
          But I proceed to show,
        </p>
        <p>Secondly, positively what this spiritual and divine light is.</p>
        <p>
          And it may be thus described: A true sense of the divine excellency of
          the things revealed in the Word of God, and a conviction of the truth
          and reality of them thence arising. This spiritual light primarily
          consists in the former of these, viz. A real sense and apprehension of
          the divine excellency of things revealed in the Word of God. A
          spiritual and saving conviction of the truth and reality of these
          things, arises from such a sight of their divine excellency and glory,
          so that this conviction of their truth is an effect and natural
          consequence of this sight of their divine glory. There is therefore in
          this spiritual light,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. A true sense of the divine and superlative excellency of the things
          of religion: a real sense of the excellency of God and Jesus Christ,
          and of the work of redemption, and the ways and works of God revealed
          in the gospel. There is a divine and superlative glory in these
          things, an excellency that is of a vastly higher kind and more sublime
          nature than in other things, [and] a glory greatly distinguishing them
          from all that is earthly and temporal. He that is spiritually
          enlightened truly apprehends and sees it, or has a sense of it. He
          does not merely rationally believe that God is glorious, but he has a
          sense of the gloriousness of God in his heart. There is not only a
          rational belief that God is holy, and that holiness is a good thing,
          but there is a sense of the loveliness of God’s holiness. There is not
          only a speculatively judging that God is gracious, but a sense how
          amiable God is on account of the beauty of this divine attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a twofold knowledge of good of which God has made the mind of
          man capable. The first, that which is merely notional, as when a
          person only speculatively judges that anything is, which by the
          agreement of mankind, is called good or excellent, viz., that which is
          most to general advantage, and between which and a reward there is a
          suitableness, — and the like. And the other is, that which consists in
          the sense of the heart, as when the heart is sensible of pleasure and
          delight in the presence of the idea of it. In the former is exercised
          merely the speculative faculty, or the understanding, in distinction
          from the will or disposition of the soul. In the latter, the will, or
          inclination, or heart, is mainly concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus there is a difference between having an opinion, that God is holy
          and gracious, and having a sense of the loveliness and beauty of that
          holiness and grace. There is a difference between having a rational
          judgment that honey is sweet, and having a sense of its sweetness. A
          man may have the former that knows not how honey tastes, but a man
          cannot have the latter unless he has an idea of the taste of honey in
          his mind. So there is a difference between believing that a person is
          beautiful, and having a sense of his beauty. The former may be
          obtained by hearsay, but the latter only by seeing the countenance.
          When the heart is sensible of the beauty and amiableness of a thing,
          it necessarily feels pleasure in the apprehension. It is implied in a
          person’s being heartily sensible of the loveliness of a thing, that
          the idea of it is pleasant to his soul, which is a far different thing
          from having a rational opinion that it is excellent.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There arises from this sense of divine excellency of things
          contained in the Word of God, a conviction of the truth and reality of
          them; and that either indirectly or directly.
        </p>
        <p>(1.) Indirectly, and that two ways.</p>
        <p>
          1. As the prejudices of the heart, against the truth of divine things,
          are hereby removed, so that the mind becomes susceptive of the due
          force of rational arguments for their truth. The mind of man is
          naturally full of prejudices against divine truth. It is full of
          enmity against the doctrines of the gospel, which is a disadvantage to
          those arguments that prove their truth, and causes them to lose their
          force upon the mind. But when a person has discovered to him the
          divine excellency of Christian doctrines, this destroys the enmity,
          removes those prejudices, sanctifies the reason, and causes it to lie
          open to the force of arguments for their truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence was the different effect that Christ’s miracles had to convince
          the disciples, from what they had to convince the scribes and
          Pharisees. Not that they had a stronger reason, or had their reason
          more improved, but their reason was sanctified, and those blinding
          prejudices, that the scribes and Pharisees were under, were removed by
          the sense they had of the excellency of Christ, and his doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It not only removes the hindrances of reason, but positively helps
          reason. It makes even the speculative notions more lively. It engages
          the attention of the mind, with more fixedness and intensity to that
          kind of objects, which causes it to have a clearer view of them, and
          enables it more clearly to see their mutual relations, and occasions
          it to take more notice of them. The ideas themselves that otherwise
          are dim and obscure, are by this means impressed with the greater
          strength, and have a light cast upon them, so that the mind can better
          judge of them. As he that beholds the objects on the face of the
          earth, when the light of the sun is cast upon them, is under greater
          advantage to discern them in their true forms and mutual relations,
          than he that sees them in a dim twilight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mind being sensible of the excellency of divine objects, dwells
          upon them with delight. The powers of the soul are more awakened and
          enlivened to employ themselves in the contemplation of them, and exert
          themselves more fully and much more to the purpose. The beauty of the
          objects draws on the faculties, and draws forth their exercises, so
          that reason itself is under far greater advantages for its proper and
          free exercises, and to attain its proper end, free of darkness and
          delusion. — But,
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) A true sense of the divine excellency of the things of God’s Word
          does more directly and immediately convince of the truth of them, and
          that because the excellency of these things is so superlative. There
          is a beauty in them that is so divine and God-like, that it greatly
          and evidently distinguishes them from things merely human, or that of
          which men are the inventors and authors. [There is] a glory that is so
          high and great, that when clearly seen, commands assent to their
          divine reality. When there is an actual and lively discovery of this
          beauty and excellency, it will not allow of any such thought as that
          it is the fruit of men’s invention. This is a kind of intuitive and
          immediate evidence. They believe the doctrines of God’s Word to be
          divine, because they see a divine, and transcendent, and most
          evidently distinguishing glory in them. Such a glory as, if clearly
          seen, does not leave room to doubt of their being of God, and not of
          men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such a conviction of the truths of religion as this, arising from a
          sense of the divine excellency, is included in saving faith. And this
          original of it, is that by which it is most essentially distinguished
          from that common assent, of which unregenerate men are capable.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I proceed now to the second thing proposed, viz. To show how this
          light is immediately given by God, and not obtained by natural means.
          And here,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it is not intended that the natural faculties are not used of
          in it. They are the subject of this light, and in such a manner that
          they are not merely passive, but active in it. God, in letting in this
          light into the soul, deals with man according to his nature, and makes
          use of his rational faculties. But yet this light is not the less
          immediately from God for that. The faculties are made use of as the
          subject and not as the cause. As the use that we make of our eyes in
          beholding various objects, when the sun arises, is not the cause of
          the light that discovers those objects to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, it is not intended that outward means have no concern in this
          affair. It is not in this affair, as in inspiration, where new truths
          are suggested. For by this light is given only a due apprehension of
          the same truths that are revealed in the Word of God, and therefore it
          is not given without the Word. The gospel is employed in this affair.
          This light is the “light of the glorious gospel of Christ,” 2 Cor.
          4:4. The gospel is as a glass, by which this light is conveyed to us,
          1 Cor. 13:12. Now we see through a glass. — But,
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, when it is said that this light is given immediately by God,
          and not obtained by natural means, hereby is intended that it is given
          by God without making use of any means that operate by their own
          power, or a natural force. God makes use of means, but it is not as
          mediate causes to produce this effect. There are not truly any second
          causes of it, but it is produced by God immediately. The Word of God
          is no proper cause of this effect, but is made use of only to convey
          to the mind the subject matter of this saving instruction, and this
          indeed it does convey to us by natural force or influence. It conveys
          to our minds these doctrines. It is the cause of the notion of them in
          our heads, but not of the sense of their divine excellency in our
          hearts. Indeed a person cannot have spiritual light without the Word.
          But that does not argue, that the Word properly causes that light. The
          mind cannot see the excellency of any doctrine, unless that doctrine
          be first in the mind. But the seeing of the excellency of the doctrine
          may be immediately from the Spirit of God, though the conveying of the
          doctrine or proposition itself may be by the Word. So that the notions
          which are the subject matter of this light, are conveyed to the mind
          by the Word of God, but that due sense of the heart, wherein this
          light formally consists, is immediately by the Spirit of God. As for
          instance, that notion that there is a Christ, and that Christ is holy
          and gracious, is conveyed to the mind by the Word of God. But the
          sense of the excellency of Christ by reason of that holiness and
          grace, is nevertheless immediately the work of the Holy Spirit. — I
          come now,
        </p>
        <p>
          III. To show the truth of the doctrine; that is, to show that there is
          such a thing as that spiritual light that has been described, thus
          immediately let into the mind by God. And here I would show briefly,
          that this doctrine is both scriptural and rational.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it is scriptural. My text is not only full to the purpose, but
          it is a doctrine with which the Scripture abounds. We are there
          abundantly taught, that the saints differ from the ungodly in this:
          that they have the knowledge of God, and a sight of God, and of Jesus
          Christ. I shall mention but few texts of many. 1 John 3:6, “Whosoever
          sinneth, has not seen him, nor known him.” 3 John 11, “He that doth
          good, is of God: but he that doth evil, hath not seen God.” John
          14:19, “The world seeth me no more; but ye see me.” John 17:3, “And
          this is eternal life, that they might know thee, the only true God,
          and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.” This knowledge, or sight of God
          and Christ, cannot be a mere speculative knowledge, because it is
          spoken of that wherein they differ from the ungodly. And by these
          Scriptures it must not only be a different knowledge in degree and
          circumstances, and different in its effects, but it must be entirely
          different in nature and kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this light and knowledge is always spoken of as immediately given
          of God, Mat. 11:25, 26, 27, “At that time Jesus answered and said, I
          thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid
          these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
          babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. All things
          are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but
          the Father: neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he
          to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.” Here this effect is ascribed
          alone to the arbitrary operation, and gift of God, bestowing this
          knowledge on whom he will, and distinguishing those with it who have
          the least natural advantage or means for knowledge, even babes, when
          it is denied to the wise and prudent. And imparting this knowledge is
          here appropriated to the Son of God, as his sole prerogative. And
          again, 2 Cor. 4:6, “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of
          darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the
          knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.” This
          plainly shows that there is a discovery of the divine superlative
          glory and excellency of God and Christ, peculiar to the saints, and
          also, that it is as immediately from God, as light from the sun, and
          that it is the immediate effect of his power and will. For it is
          compared to God’s creating the light by his powerful Word in the
          beginning of the creation, and is said to be by the Spirit of the
          Lord, in the 18th verse of the preceding chapter. God is spoken of as
          giving the knowledge of Christ in conversion, as of what before was
          hidden and unseen. Gal. 1:15, 16, “But when it pleased God, who
          separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace, to
          reveal his Son in me.” — The Scripture also speaks plainly of such a
          knowledge of the Word of God, as has been described, as the immediate
          gift of God, Psa. 119:18: “Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold
          wondrous things out of thy law.” What could the Psalmist mean, when he
          begged of God to open his eyes? Was he ever blind? Might he not have
          resort to the law and see every word and sentence in it when he
          pleased? And what could he mean by those wondrous things? Were they
          wonderful stories of the creation, and deluge, and Israel’s passing
          through the Red Sea, and the like? Were not his eyes open to read
          these strange things when he would? Doubtless by wondrous things in
          God’s law, he had respect to those distinguishing and wonderful
          excellencies, and marvelous manifestations of the divine perfections
          and glory, contained in the commands and doctrines of the Word, and
          those works and counsels of God that were revealed. So the Scripture
          speaks of a knowledge of God’s dispensation, and covenant of mercy,
          and way of grace towards his people, as peculiar to the saints, and
          given only by God, Psa. 25:14: “The secret of the Lord is with them
          that fear him; and he will show them his covenant.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And that a true and saving belief of the truth of religion is that
          which arises from such a discovery, is also what the Scripture
          teaches. As John 6:40, “And this is the will of him that sent me, that
          everyone who seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting
          life;” where it is plain that a true faith is what arises from a
          spiritual sight of Christ. And John 17:6, 7, 8, “I have manifested thy
          name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world. — Now they
          have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me, are of thee.
          For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they
          have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee,
          and they have believed that thou didst send me;” where Christ’s
          manifesting God’s name to the disciples, or giving them the knowledge
          of God, was that whereby they knew that Christ’s doctrine was of God,
          and that Christ himself proceeded from him, and was sent by him.
          Again, John 12:44, 45, 46, “Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on
          me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. And he that seeth
          me, seeth him that sent me. I am come a light into the world, that
          whosoever believeth on me, should not abide in darkness.” Their
          believing in Christ, and spiritually seeing him, are spoken of as
          running parallel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ condemns the Jews, that they did not know that he was the
          Messiah, and that his doctrine was true, from an inward distinguishing
          taste and relish of what was divine, in Luke 12:56, 57. He having
          there blamed the Jews that though they could discern the face of the
          sky and of the earth, and signs of the weather, that yet they could
          not discern those times — or as it is expressed in Matthew, the signs
          of those times — adds, “yea, and why even of your own selves, judge ye
          not what is right?” i.e., without extrinsic signs. Why have ye not
          that sense of true excellency, whereby ye may distinguish that which
          is holy and divine? Why have ye not that savor of the things of God,
          by which you may see the distinguishing glory, and evident divinity of
          me and my doctrine?
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle Peter mentions it as what gave them him and his companions
          good and well grounded assurance of the truth of the gospel, that they
          had seen the divine glory of Christ. — 2 Pet. 1:16, “For we have not
          followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the
          power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of
          his majesty.” The apostle has respect to that visible glory of Christ
          which they saw in his transfiguration: that glory was so divine,
          having such an ineffable appearance and semblance of divine holiness,
          majesty and grace, that it evidently denoted him to be a divine
          person. But if a sight of Christ’s outward glory might give a rational
          assurance of his divinity, why may not an apprehension of his
          spiritual glory do so too? Doubtless Christ’s spiritual glory is in
          itself as distinguishing, and as plainly showing his divinity, as his
          outward glory, — nay a great deal more. For his spiritual glory is
          that wherein his divinity consists, and the outward glory of his
          transfiguration showed him to be divine, only as it was a remarkable
          image or representation of that spiritual glory. Doubtless, therefore,
          he that has had a clear sight of the spiritual glory of Christ, may
          say, I have not followed cunningly devised fables, but have been an
          eyewitness of his majesty, upon as good grounds as the apostle, when
          he had respect to the outward glory of Christ that he had seen. But
          this brings me to what was proposed next, viz., to show that,
        </p>
        <p>Secondly, this doctrine is rational.</p>
        <p>
          1. It is rational to suppose that there is really such an excellency
          in divine things — so transcendent and exceedingly different from what
          is in other things — that if it were seen, would most evidently
          distinguish them. We cannot rationally doubt but that things that are
          divine, which appertain to the Supreme Being, are vastly different
          from things that are human: that there is a high, glorious, and
          God-like excellency in them that does most remarkably difference them
          from the things that are of men, insomuch that if the difference were
          but seen, it would have a convincing, satisfying influence upon anyone
          that they are divine. What reason can be offered against it, unless we
          would argue that God is not remarkably distinguished in glory from
          men.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Christ should now appear to anyone as he did on the mount at his
          transfiguration. Or if he should appear to the world in his heavenly
          glory, as he will do at the day of judgment, without doubt, the glory
          and majesty would be such as would satisfy everyone that he was a
          divine person, and that religion was true. It would be a most
          reasonable, and well-grounded conviction too. And why may there not be
          that stamp of divinity, or divine glory, on the Word of God, on the
          scheme and doctrine of the gospel, that may be in like manner
          distinguishing and as rationally convincing, provided it be but seen?
          It is rational to suppose, that when God speaks to the world, there
          should be something in his Word vastly different from man’s word.
          Supposing that God never had spoken to the world, but we had notice
          that he was about to reveal himself from heaven, and speak to us
          immediately himself, or that he should give us a book of his own
          inditing: after what manner should we expect that he would speak?
          Would it not be rational to suppose, that his speech would be
          exceeding different from man’s speech, that there should be such an
          excellency and sublimity in his speech or word, such a stamp of
          wisdom, holiness, majesty and other divine perfections, that the word
          of man, yea of the wisest of men, should appear mean and base in
          comparison of it? Doubtless it would be thought rational to expect
          this, and unreasonable to think otherwise. When a wise man speaks in
          the exercise of his wisdom, there is something in everything he says
          that is very distinguishable from the talk of a little child. So,
          without doubt, and much more, is the speech of God to be distinguished
          from that of the wisest of men; agreeably to Jer. 23:28, 29. God
          having there been reproving the false prophets that prophesied in his
          name, and pretended that what they spoke was his Word, when indeed it
          was their own word, says, “The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell
          a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully:
          what is the chaff to the wheat? saith the Lord. Is not my word like as
          a fire? saith the Lord: and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in
          pieces?”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If there be such a distinguishing excellency in divine things, it
          is rational to suppose that there may be such a thing as seeing it.
          What should hinder but that it may be seen? It is no argument that
          there is no such thing as such a distinguishing excellency, or that it
          cannot be seen, because some do not see it, though they may be
          discerning men in temporal matters. It is not rational to suppose, if
          there be any such excellency in divine things, that wicked men should
          see it. Is it rational to suppose, that those whose minds are full of
          spiritual pollution, and under the power of filthy lusts, should have
          any relish or sense of divine beauty or excellency, or that their
          minds should be susceptive of that light that is in its own nature so
          pure and heavenly? It need not seem at all strange, that sin should so
          blind the mind, seeing that men’s particular natural tempers and
          dispositions will so much blind them in secular matters, as when men’s
          natural temper is melancholy, jealous, fearful, proud, or the like.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is rational to suppose that this knowledge should be given
          immediately by God, and not be obtained by natural means. Upon what
          account should it seem unreasonable that there should be any immediate
          communication between God and the creature? It is strange that men
          should make any matter of difficulty of it. Why should not he that
          made all things, still have something immediately to do with the
          things that he has made? Where lies the great difficulty, if we own
          the being of a God, and that he created all things out of nothing, of
          allowing some immediate influence of God on the creation still? And if
          it be reasonable to suppose it with respect to any part of the
          creation, it is especially so with respect to reasonable, intelligent
          creatures, who are next to God in the gradation of the different
          orders of beings, and whose business is most immediately with God.
          Reason teaches that man was made to serve and glorify his Creator. And
          if it be rational to suppose that God immediately communicates himself
          to man in any affair, it is in this. It is rational to suppose that
          God would reserve that knowledge and wisdom, which is of such a divine
          and excellent nature, to be bestowed immediately by himself, and that
          it should not be left in the power of second causes. Spiritual wisdom
          and grace is the highest and most excellent gift that ever God bestows
          on any creature: in this the highest excellency and perfection of a
          rational creature consists. It is also immensely the most important of
          all divine gifts. It is that wherein man’s happiness consists, and on
          which his everlasting welfare depends. How rational is it to suppose
          that God, however he has left lower gifts to second causes, and in
          some sort in their power, yet should reserve this most excellent,
          divine, and important of all divine communications, in his own hands,
          to be bestowed immediately by himself, as a thing too great for second
          causes to be concerned in! It is rational to suppose that this
          blessing should be immediately from God, for there is no gift or
          benefit that is in itself so nearly related to the divine nature.
          Nothing which the creature receives is so much a participation of the
          Deity. It is a kind of emanation of God’s beauty, and is related to
          God as the light is to the sun. It is therefore congruous and fit that
          when it is given of God, it should be immediately from himself, and by
          himself, according to his own sovereign will.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is rational to suppose that it should be beyond a man’s power to
          obtain this light by the mere strength of natural reason, for it is
          not a thing that belongs to reason, to see the beauty and loveliness
          of spiritual things. It is not a speculative thing, but depends on the
          sense of the heart. Reason indeed is necessary in order to it, as it
          is by reason only that we are become the subjects of the means of it,
          which means I have already shown to be necessary in order to it,
          though they have no proper causal influence in the affair. It is by
          reason that we become possessed of a notion of those doctrines that
          are the subject matter of this divine light or knowledge. Reason may
          many ways be indirectly and remotely an advantage to it. Reason has
          also to do in the acts that are immediately consequent on this
          discovery. For seeing the truth of religion from hence, is by reason,
          though it be but by one step, and the inference be immediate. So
          reason has to do in that accepting of, and trusting in Christ, that is
          consequent on it. But if we take reason strictly — not for the faculty
          of mental perception in general, but for ratiocination, or a power of
          inferring by arguments — the perceiving of spiritual beauty and
          excellency no more belongs to reason, than it belongs to the sense of
          feeling to perceive colors, or the power of seeing to perceive the
          sweetness of food. It is out of reason’s province to perceive the
          beauty or loveliness of anything: such a perception does not belong to
          that faculty. Reason’s work is to perceive truth and not excellency.
          It is not ratiocination that gives men the perception of the beauty
          and amiableness of a countenance, though it may be many ways
          indirectly an advantage to it. Yet it is no more reason that
          immediately perceives it, than it is reason that perceives the
          sweetness of honey: it depends on the sense of the heart. — Reason may
          determine that a countenance is beautiful to others, it may determine
          that honey is sweet to others, but it will never give me a perception
          of its sweetness.
        </p>
        <p>I will conclude with a brief improvement of what has been said.</p>
        <p>
          First, this doctrine may lead us to reflect on the goodness of God,
          that has so ordered it, that a saving evidence of the truth of the
          gospel is such, as is attainable by persons of mean capacities and
          advantages, as well as those that are of the greatest parts and
          learning. If the evidence of the gospel depended only on history, and
          such reasonings as learned men only are capable of, it would be above
          the reach of far the greatest part of mankind. But persons with but an
          ordinary degree of knowledge are capable, without a long and subtle
          train of reasoning, to see the divine excellency of the things of
          religion. They are capable of being taught by the Spirit of God, as
          well as learned men. The evidence that is this way obtained, is vastly
          better and more satisfying, than all that can be obtained by the
          arguings of those that are most learned, and greatest masters of
          reason. And babes are as capable of knowing these things, as the wise
          and prudent, and they are often hid from these when they are revealed
          to those. 1 Cor. 1:26, 27, “For ye see your calling, brethren, how
          that not many wise men, after the flesh, not many mighty, nor many
          noble, are called. But God hath chosen the foolish things of the
          world. — ”
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, this doctrine may well put us upon examining ourselves,
          whether we have ever had this divine light let into our souls. If
          there be such a thing indeed, doubtless it is of great importance
          whether we have thus been taught by the Spirit of God; whether the
          light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, has
          shined unto us, giving us the light of the knowledge of the glory of
          God in the face of Jesus Christ; [and] whether we have seen the Son,
          and believed on him, or have that faith of gospel doctrines which
          arises from a spiritual sight of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, all may hence be exhorted, earnestly to seek this spiritual
          light. To influence and move to it, the following things may be
          considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This is the most excellent and divine wisdom that any creature is
          capable of. It is more excellent than any human learning. It is far
          more excellent than all the knowledge of the greatest philosophers or
          statesmen. Yea, the least glimpse of the glory of God in the face of
          Christ does more exalt and ennoble the soul, than all the knowledge of
          those that have the greatest speculative understanding in divinity
          without grace. This knowledge has the most noble object that is or can
          be, viz. the divine glory and excellency of God and Christ. The
          knowledge of these objects is that wherein consists the most excellent
          knowledge of the angels, yea, of God himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This knowledge is that which is above all others sweet and joyful.
          Men have a great deal of pleasure in human knowledge, in studies of
          natural things, but this is nothing to that joy which arises from this
          divine light shining into the soul. This light gives a view of those
          things that are immensely the most exquisitely beautiful, and capable
          of delighting the eye of the understanding. This spiritual light is
          the dawning of the light of glory in the heart. There is nothing so
          powerful as this to support persons in affliction, and to give the
          mind peace and brightness in this stormy and dark world.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This light is such as effectually influences the inclination, and
          changes the nature of the soul. It assimilates our nature to the
          divine nature, and changes the soul into an image of the same glory
          that is beheld. 2 Cor. 3:18, “But we all with open face, beholding as
          in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image,
          from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.” This
          knowledge will wean from the world, and raise the inclination to
          heavenly things. It will turn the heart to God as the fountain of
          good, and to choose him for the only portion. This light, and this
          only, will bring the soul to a saving close with Christ. It conforms
          the heart to the gospel, mortifies its enmity and opposition against
          the scheme of salvation therein revealed. It causes the heart to
          embrace the joyful tidings, and entirely to adhere to, and acquiesce
          in the revelation of Christ as our Savior. It causes the whole soul to
          accord and symphonize with it, admitting it with entire credit and
          respect, cleaving to it with full inclination and affection, and it
          effectually disposes the soul to give up itself entirely to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This light, and this only, has its fruit in a universal holiness of
          life. No merely notional or speculative understanding of the doctrines
          of religion will ever bring to this. But this light, as it reaches the
          bottom of the heart, and changes the nature, so it will effectually
          dispose to a universal obedience. It shows God as worthy to be obeyed
          and served. It draws forth the heart in a sincere love to God, which
          is the only principle of a true, gracious, and universal obedience,
          and it convinces of the reality of those glorious rewards that God has
          promised to them that obey him.
