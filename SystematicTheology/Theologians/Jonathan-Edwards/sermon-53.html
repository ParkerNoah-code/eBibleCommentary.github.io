          Ezekiel 23:37, 38, 39, “That they have committed adultery, and blood
          is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery,
          and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for
          them through the fire to devour them. More over this they have done
          unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have
          profaned my Sabbaths. For when they had slain their children to their
          idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it;
          and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.”
        </p>
        <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
        <p>
          Samaria and Jerusalem, or Israel and Judah, are here represented by
          two women, Aholah and Aholibah. And their idolatry and treachery
          towards their covenant God is represented by the adultery of these
          women. They forsook God, who was their husband, and the guide of their
          youth, and prostituted themselves to others. The baseness of Aholah
          and Aholibah towards God their husband is here pointed out by two
          things, viz. adultery and bloodshed: They have committed adultery, and
          blood is in their hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. They committed adultery with other lovers, viz. with their idols:
          With their idols have they committed adultery.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. They not only committed adultery, but they took their children
          that they bore to God, and killed them for their lovers. Their hearts
          were quite alienated from God, their husband, and they were so
          bewitched with lust after those other lovers, that they took their own
          children, whom they had by their husband, and put them to cruel
          deaths, to make a feast with them for their lovers. As it is said in
          verse 37, “And have also caused my sons whom they bare unto me, to
          pass for them through the fire to devour them.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But here is a twofold wickedness of those actions of theirs held forth
          to us in the words.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the wickedness of them considered in themselves. For who can
          express the horrid baseness of this their treatment of God, their
          husband?
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, an additional wickedness, resulting from the joining of these
          actions with sacred things. Beside the monstrous wickedness of these
          actions in themselves considered, there was this which exceedingly
          increased the guilt, that on the same day they came into God’s
          sanctuary, or that they lived in such wickedness at the same time that
          they came and attended the holy ordinances of God’s house, pretending
          to worship and adore him, whom they all the while treated in such a
          horrid manner. And so herein defiled and profaned holy things, as in
          verse 38 and 39, “Moreover, this have they done unto me; they have
          defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths.
          For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came
          the same day into my sanctuary, to profane it; and, lo, thus have they
          done in the midst of mine house.”
        </p>
        <p>DOCTRINE</p>
        <p>
          When they that attend ordinances of divine worship allow themselves in
          known wickedness, they are guilty of dreadfully profaning and
          polluting those ordinances.
        </p>
        <p>
          By a divine ordinance, when the expression is used in its greatest
          latitude, is meant anything of divine institution or appointment. Thus
          we call marriage a divine ordinance because it was appointed by God.
          So civil government is called an ordinance of God. Rom. 13:1, 2, “Let
          every soul be subject to the higher powers; for there is no power but
          of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever, therefore,
          resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But the word is more commonly used only for an instituted or appointed
          way or mean of worship. So the sacraments are ordinances. So public
          prayer, singing of praise, the preaching of the word, and the hearing
          of the word preached are divine ordinances. The setting apart of
          certain officers in the church, the appointed way of discipline,
          public confession of scandals, admonition, and excommunication are
          ordinances. These are called the ordinances of God’s house, or of
          public worship. And these are intended in the doctrine. It is the
          profanation of these ordinances that is spoken of in the text: “They
          came into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo! thus have they done in
          the midst of mine house,” says God. This doctrine seems to contain two
          propositions.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>The ordinances of God are holy</p>
        <p>DIVINE ordinances are holy in the following respects:</p>
        <p>
          I. They are conversant wholly and immediately about God, and things
          divine. When we are in the attendance on the ordinances of divine
          worship, we are in the special presence of God. When persons come and
          attend on the ordinances of God, they are said to come before God, and
          to come into his presence. Jer. 7:10, “Come and stand before me, in
          this house which is called by my name.” Psa. 100:2, “Come into his
          presence with singing.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In divine ordinances, persons have immediate intercourse with God,
          either in applying to him, as in prayer and singing praises, or in
          receiving from him, waiting solemnly and immediately on him for
          spiritual good, as in hearing the word; or in both applying to God and
          receiving from him, as in the sacraments. They were appointed on
          purpose that in them men might converse and hold communion with God.
          We are poor, ignorant, blind worms of the dust. And God did not see it
          meet that our way of intercourse with God should be left to ourselves.
          But God has given us his ordinances, as ways and means of conversing
          with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these ordinances, holy and divine things are exhibited and
          represented. In the preaching of the word, holy doctrines and the
          divine will are exhibited. In the sacraments are represented our
          faith, love, and obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The end of God’s ordinances is holy. The immediate end is to
          glorify God. They are instituted to direct us in the holy exercises of
          faith and love, divine fear and reverence, submission, thankfulness,
          holy joy and sorrow, holy desires, resolutions, and hopes. True
          worship consists in these holy and spiritual exercises, and as these
          divine ordinances are the ordinances of worship, they are to help us,
          and to direct us in such worship as this.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. They have the sanction of divine authority. They are not only
          conversant about a divine and holy object, and designed to direct and
          help us in divine and holy exercises, but they have a divine and holy
          author. The infinitely great and holy God has appointed them, the
          eternal Three in One. Each person in the Trinity has been concerned in
          their institution. God the Father has appointed them, and that by his
          own Son. They are of Christ’s own appointment, and he appointed, as he
          had received of the Father. John 12:49, “I have not spoken of myself,
          but the Father which sent me, he gave me commandment what I should
          say, and what I should speak.” And the Father and Son more fully
          revealed and ratified them by the Spirit. And they are committed to
          writing by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are holy, in that God has hallowed them, or consecrated them.
          They are conversant about holy things. And God ordained them that in
          them we might be conversant about holy things. They are for a holy
          use. And it is God who, by his own immediate authority, ordained them
          for that holy use, which renders them much more sacred than otherwise
          they would have been.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. They are attended in the name of God. Thus we are commanded to do
          all that we do, in word or deed, in the name of Christ, Col. 3:17,
          which is to be understood especially of our attendance on ordinances.
          Ordinances are administered in the name of God. When the word is
          preached by authorized ministers, they speak in God’s name, as
          Christ’s ambassadors, as co-workers together with Christ. 2 Cor. 5:20,
          “Now we are ambassadors for Christ.” Chap. 4:1, “We are workers
          together with him.” When a true minister preaches, he speaks as the
          oracles of God, 1 Pet. 4:11. And he is to be heard as one representing
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          So in administering the sacraments, the minister represents the person
          of Christ. He baptizes in his name, and in the Lord’s supper stands in
          his stead. In administering church-censures, he still acts, as the
          apostle expresses it, in the person of Christ, 2 Cor. 2:10. On the
          other hand, the congregation, in their addresses to God in ordinances,
          as prayer and praise, act in the name of Christ, the Mediator, as
          Having him to represent them, and as coming to God by him.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION II</p>
        <p>
          God’s ordinances are dreadfully profaned by those who attend on
          them,<br />
          and yet allow themselves in ways of wickedness.
        </p>
        <p>
          PERSONS who come to the house of God, into the holy presence of God,
          attending the duties and ordinances of his public worship, pretending
          with others, according to divine institution, to call on the name of
          God, to praise him, to hear his word, and commemorate Christ’s death,
          and who yet, at the same time, are wittingly and allowedly going on in
          wicked courses, or in any practice contrary to the plain rules of the
          Word of God, therein greatly profane the holy worship of God, defile
          the temple of God and those sacred ordinances on which they attend.
          The truth of this proposition appears by the following considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. By attending ordinances, and yet living in allowed wickedness, they
          show great irreverence and contempt of those holy ordinances. When
          persons who have been committing known wickedness, as it were the same
          day, as it is expressed into the text, and attend the sacred solemn
          worship and ordinances of God, and then go from the house of God
          directly to the like allowed wickedness — they hereby express a most
          irreverent spirit with respect to holy things, and in a horrid manner
          cast contempt upon God’s sacred institutions, and on those holy things
          which we are concerned with in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          They show that they have no reverence of that God who has hallowed
          these ordinances. They show a contempt of that divine authority which
          instituted them. They show a horribly irreverent spirit towards that
          God into whose presence they come, and with whom they immediately have
          to do in ordinances, and in whose name these ordinances are performed
          and attended. They show a contempt of the adoration of God, of that
          faith and love, and that humiliation, submission, and praise, which
          ordinances were instituted to express. What an irreverent spirit does
          it show, that they are so careless after what manner they come before
          God! That they take no care to cleanse and purify themselves, in order
          that they may be fit to come before God! Yea, that they take no care
          to avoid making themselves more and more unclean and filthy!
        </p>
        <p>
          They have been taught many a time that God is of purer eyes than to
          behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity, and how exceedingly he is
          offended with sin; yet they care not how unclean and abominable they
          come into his presence. It shows horrid irreverence and contempt, that
          they are so bold, that they are not afraid to come into the presence
          of God in such a manner, and that they will presume to go out of the
          presence of God, and from an attendance upon holy things, again to
          their sinful practices. If they had any reverence of God and holy
          things, an approach into his presence, and an attendance on those holy
          things, would leave that awe upon their minds, that they would not
          dare to go immediately from them to their ways of known wickedness,
        </p>
        <p>
          It would show a great irreverence in any person towards a king, if he
          should not care how he came into his presence, and if he should come
          in a sordid habit, and in a very indecent manner. How much more horrid
          irreverence does it show, for persons willingly and allowedly to
          defile themselves with that filth which God infinitely hates, and so
          frequently come into the presence of God!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. By making a show of respect to God in ordinances, and then acting
          the contrary in their lives, they do but mock God. In attending
          ordinances, they make a show of respect to God. By joining in prayer,
          in public adorations, confessions, petitions, and thanksgivings, they
          make a show of high thoughts of God, and of humbling themselves before
          him; of sorrow for their sins, of thankfulness for mercies, and of a
          desire of grace and assistance to obey and serve God. By attending
          upon the hearing of the word, they make a show of a teachable spirit,
          and of a readiness to practice according to the instructions given. By
          attending on the sacraments, they make a show of faith in Christ, of
          choosing him for their portion, and spiritually feeding upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But by their actions they all the while declare the contrary. They
          declare, that they have no high esteem of God, but that they despise
          him in their hearts. They declare, that they are so far from repenting
          of, that they intend to continue in, their sins. They declare, that
          they have no desire of that grace and assistance to live in a holy
          manner for which they prayed, and that they rather live wickedly. This
          is what they choose, and for the present are resolved upon. They
          declare by their actions that there is no truth in what they pretend
          in hearing the word preached, that they had a desire to know what the
          will of God is, that they might be directed in their duty. For they
          declare by their actions, that they desire not to do the will of God,
          and that they do not intend any such thing. But intend, on the
          contrary, to disobey him. And that they prefer their carnal interests
          before his authority and glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          They declare by their actions that there is not truth in what they
          pretend in their attendance on the sacraments that they desire to be
          fed with spiritual nourishment, and to be conformed and assimilated to
          Christ, and to have communion with him. They show by their practices
          that they have no regard to Christ, and that they had rather have
          their lusts gratified, than to be fed with his spiritual food. They
          show, that they desire not any assimilation to Christ but to be
          different from him, and of an opposite character to him. They show
          that instead of desiring communion with Christ, they are his resolved
          and allowed enemies, willfully acting the part of enemies to Christ,
          dishonoring him, and promoting the interest of Satan against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what can this be else but mockery, to make a show of great
          respect, reverence, love, and obedience, and at the same time
          willfully to declare the reverse in actions. If a rebel or traitor
          should send addresses to his king, making a show of great loyalty and
          fidelity, and should all the while openly, and in the king’s sight,
          carry on designs of dethroning him, how could his addresses be
          considered other than mockery? If a man should bow and kneel before
          his superior, and use many respectful terms to him, but at the same
          time should strike him, or spit in his face, would his bowing and his
          respectful terms be looked upon in any light than as done in mockery?
          When the Jews kneeled before Christ, and said Hail, King of the Jews,
          but at the same time spit in his face, and smote him upon the head
          with a reed, could their kneeling and salutations be considered as any
          other than mockery?
        </p>
        <p>
          Men attend ordinances, and yet willingly live in wicked practices,
          treat Christ in the same manner that these Jews did. They come to
          public worship, and pretend to pray to him, to sing his praises, to
          sit and hear his word. They come to the sacrament, pretending to
          commemorate his death. Thus they kneel before him, and say, Hail, King
          of the Jews; yet at the same time they live in ways of wickedness,
          which they know Christ has forbidden, of which he has declared the
          greatest hatred, and which are exceedingly to his dishonor. Thus they
          buffet him, and spit in his face. They do as Judas did, who came to
          Christ saying, Hail, Master, and kissed him, at the same time
          betraying him into the hands of those who sought his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          How can it be interpreted in any other light, when men come to public
          worship, and attend ordinariness, and yet will be drunkards and
          profane swearers, will live in lasciviousness, injustice, or some
          other known wickedness? If a man should pray to God to keep him from
          drunkenness, and at the same time should put the bottle to his own
          mouth, and drink himself drunk; the absurdity and horrid wickedness of
          his conduct would be manifest to every man. But the very same thing,
          though not so visible to us, is done by those who make profession of
          great respect to God, and pray God from time to time to keep them from
          sin; yet at the same time have no design to forsake their known sins,
          but intend the contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
          God sees men’s designs and resolutions more plainly than we can see
          their outward actions. Therefore for a man to pray to God to be kept
          from sin, and at the same time to intend to sin, is mockery as visible
          to God as if he prayed to be kept from some particular sin, which he
          was at the same time willingly and allowedly committing.
        </p>
        <p>
          These persons are guilty of a horrid profanation of God’s ordinances.
          For they make them occasions of a greater affront to God, the
          occasions of showing their impudence and presumption. For he who lives
          in willful wickedness, and does not enjoy the ordinances of God, is
          not guilty of so great presumption as he who attends these ordinances,
          and yet allows himself in wickedness. This latter acts as though he
          came into the presence of God on purpose to affront him. He comes from
          time to time to hear the will of God, and all the while designs
          disobedience, and goes away and acts directly contrary to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          A servant would affront his master by willfully disobeying his
          commands in any wise. But he would affront him much more, if he should
          on every occasion come to him to inquire his will, as though he were
          ready to do whatever his master would have him do, and then should
          immediately go away and do the contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. They put the ordinances of God to a profane use. The ordinances
          of God are holy, as they are set apart of God to a holy use and
          purpose. They are the worship of God, instituted for the ends of
          giving honor and glory to him, and to be means of grace and spiritual
          good to us. But those persons who attend these ordinances, and yet
          live in allowed wickedness, aim at neither of these ends. They, in
          their attendance on ordinances, neither aim to give honor to God, or
          to express any love, or esteem, or thankfulness. Nor do they sincerely
          seek the good of their own souls. It is not truly the aim of any such
          persons to obtain grace, or to be made holy. Their actions plainly
          show that this is not their desire. They choose to be wicked, and
          intend it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not therefore to these purposes that they improve the holy
          ordinances of God. But they put them to another and profane use. They
          attend ordinances to avoid that discredit which a voluntarily and
          habitual absence from them would cause among those with whom they
          live, to avoid the punishment of human laws, or for their worldly
          advantage, to make up for other wickedness, or for some other carnal
          purposes. Thus they profane the ordinances of God, by perverting them
          to profane purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. When persons thus treat God’s holy ordinances, it tends to beget
          contempt of them in others. When others see sacred things commonly
          used so irreverently, and attended with such carelessness and
          contempt, and treated without any sacred regard; when they see persons
          are bold with them, treat them without any solemnity of spirit; when
          they see them thus commonly profaned, it tends to diminish their sense
          of their sacredness, and to make them seem no very awful things. In
          short, it tends to embolden them to do the like.
        </p>
        <p>
          The holy vessels and utensils of the temple and tabernacle were never
          to be put to a common use, nor to be handled without the greatest care
          and reverence. For if it had been commonly otherwise, the reverence of
          them could not have been maintained. They would have seemed no more
          sacred than anything else. So it is in the ordinances of Christian
          worship.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION III</p>
        <p>A call to self-examination.</p>
        <p>
          LET this doctrine put all upon examining themselves, whether they do
          not allow themselves in known wickedness. You are such as do enjoy the
          ordinances of divine worship. You come into the holy presence of God,
          attending on those ordinances, which God, by scared authority, has
          hallowed and set apart, that in them we might have immediate
          intercourse with himself, that we might worship and adore him, and
          express to him a humble, holy, supreme respect, and that in them we
          might receive immediate communications from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here you come and speak to God, pretending to express your sense how
          glorious he is, and how worthy that you should fear and love him,
          humble yourselves before him, devote yourselves to him, obey him, and
          have a greater respect to his commands and to his honor, than to any
          temporal interest, ease, or pleasure of your own. Here you pretend
          before God, that you are sensible how unworthily you have done by sins
          committed in times past, and that you have a great desire not to do
          the like in time to come. You pretend to confess your sins, and to
          humble yourselves for them. Here you pray that God would give you his
          Spirit to assist you against sin, to keep you from the commission of
          it, enable you to overcome temptations, and help you to walk holy in
          all your conversation, as though you really had a great desire to
          avoid such sins as you have been guilty of in time past. And the like
          pretenses you have made in your attendance upon the other ordinances,
          as in hearing the word, in singing praise, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          But consider whether you do not horribly defile and profane the public
          prayers and other ordinances. Notwithstanding all your pretenses, and
          what you seem to hold forth by your attendance on them, do you not all
          the while live in known wickedness against God? For all your pretenses
          of respect to God, of humiliation for sin, and desires to avoid it,
          have you not come directly from the allowed practice of known sin to
          God’s ordinances, and did not at all repent of what you had done, nor
          at all sorry for it at the very time when you stood before God, making
          these pretenses, and even had no design of reformation, but intended
          to return to the same practice again after your departure from the
          presence of God? — I say, has not this, on many occasions, been your
          manner of coming and attending on the ordinances of divine worship?
          Not only so, but is it not still your manner, your common way of
          attending upon these ordinances, even to this very day? Do you not lie
          to God with your tongues, when you pretend, that he is a great God,
          and that you are poor, guilty, unworthy creatures, deserving his wrath
          by the sins of which you have been guilty? And when you pretend that
          you earnestly desire he would keep you from the like for time to come?
          Are you not guilty of horrid mockery of God in it, when at the same
          time you design no such thing, but the contrary?
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you not even the same day that you come into God’s house, and to
          his ordinances, allow yourselves in known sins? Do you not with
          consent and approbation think of the sinful practices, in which you
          allow yourselves, and in which you have been exercising yourselves in
          the week past? Do you not the very day in which you attend ordinances,
          allowedly please and gratify a wicked imagination? And are you not
          then perpetrating wickedness in your thoughts, and contriving the
          further fulfillment of your wickedness? Yea, are you not guilty of
          these things sometimes even in the very time of your attendance on
          ordinances, when you are in the immediate presence of God? And while
          others have immediate intercourse with God, and you likewise pretend
          to the same? Do you not, even in these circumstances, allow yourselves
          in wicked thoughts and imaginations, voluntarily wallowing in known
          wickedness?
        </p>
        <p>
          Are not some of you guilty of allowedly breaking God’s holy Sabbath,
          in maintaining no government of your thoughts, thinking indifferently
          about anything that comes next to mind; and not only thinking, but
          talking too about common, worldly affairs? And sometimes talking in
          such a manner, as is not suitable even on other days, talking
          profanely, or in an unclean manner, sporting and diverting yourselves
          in such conversation on God’s holy day? Yea, it is well if some have
          not been thus guilty in the very time of attendance on the ordinances
          of worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examine yourselves, how it has been with you. You all attend many of
          the ordinances of divine worship. You come to the house of God, attend
          public prayers, singing, and preaching of the word. And many of you
          come to the Lord’s supper, that holy ordinance, instituted for the
          special commemoration of the greatest and most wonderful of all divine
          acts towards mankind, for the special and visible representation of
          the most glorious and wonderful things of our religion, for the most
          solemn profession and renewal of your engagement to God, and for
          special communion with Jesus Christ. Let such examine themselves
          whether they do not allow themselves in known sin, to the horrid
          profanation and pollution of his most sacred ordinance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examine and see whether you do not allow yourselves in some way of
          dealing with your fellow-men, which you have sufficient light to know
          to be evil; or whether you do not allow yourselves in a known evil
          behavior towards some person or persons of the families to which you
          respectively belong, as towards your husbands, your wives, your
          children, or servants; or your neighbors, in your spirit and behavior
          towards them, or in your talk of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examine whether you do not some way willingly indulge an unclean
          appetite, in less or grosser acts of uncleanness, or in you discourse,
          or in you imagination. Or do you not give way to a lust after strong
          drink, or indulge yourselves in some vicious excess in gratifying some
          sensual appetite in meat or drink, or otherwise? Are you not willingly
          guilty of vanity, and extravagance in your conversation?
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you not, for all your attendance on ordinances, continue in the
          allowed neglect of your precious souls, neglecting secret prayer or
          some known duty of private religion? Or do you not allow yourselves in
          Sabbath-breaking? — In all these ways are the ordinances of God’s
          sacred worship polluted and profaned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Men are apt to act very treacherously and perversely in the matter of
          self-examination. When they are put upon examining themselves, they
          very often decline it, and will not enter into any serious examination
          of themselves at all. They hear uses of examination insisted on, but
          put them off to others, and never seriously apply them to themselves.
          — And if they do examine themselves, when they are put upon it, they
          are exceedingly partial to themselves. They spare themselves. They do
          not search, and look, and pass a judgment according to truth, but so
          as unreasonably to favor and justify themselves — If they can be
          brought to examine themselves at all, whether they do not allow
          themselves in known wickedness, although they attend on divine
          ordinances, they will not do it impartially. Their endeavor will not
          be indeed to know the truth of their case, and to give a true answer
          to their consciences, but to blind themselves, to persuade and flatter
          themselves that they do not allow themselves in known sin, whether it
          be true or not. There are two things especially wherein persons often
          act very perversely and falsely in this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Persons very often deal very perversely in pretending that the sins
          in which they live are not known sins. Nothing is more common surely,
          than for persons to flatter themselves with this concerning the
          wickedness in which they live. Let that wickedness be almost what it
          may, they will plead to their consciences, and endeavor to still them,
          that there is no evil in it. Men’s own consciences can best tell how
          they are wont to do in this matter. — There is hardly any kind of
          wickedness that men commit, but they will plead thus in excuse for it.
          They will plead thus about their cheating and injustice, about their
          hatred of their neighbors, about their evil speaking, about their
          revengeful spirit, about their excessive drinking, about their lying,
          their neglect of secret prayer, their lasciviousness, their unclean
          dalliances. Yea, they will plead excuses for very gross acts of
          uncleanness, as fornication, adultery, and what not. They have their
          vain excuses and carnal reasonings in favor of all their evil actions.
          They will say, What harm, what evil is there in such and such an
          action? And if there be a plain rule against it, yet they will plead
          that their circumstances are peculiar, and that they are excepted from
          the general rule, that their temptation is so great, that they are
          excusable. Or something will they find to plead.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be some thing upon which their lusts are much set, and about
          which they feel remorse of conscience, they will never leave studying
          and contriving with all the art and subtlety of which they are
          masters, till they shall have found out some reason, some excuse, with
          which they shall be able in some measure to quiet their consciences.
          And whether after all they shall have made it out to blind conscience
          or not, yet they will plead that their argument is good, and it is no
          sin. Or if it be a sin, it is only a sin of ignorance. — So men will
          plead for the wickedness which they do in the dark. So without doubt
          some very gross sinners plead to their consciences, as would appear,
          if we could but look into their hearts. When indeed the strongest
          argument they have, that in such a thing there is no evil, is the
          strongest lust they have to it, the inordinate desire they have to
          commit it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the saying of one, Licitis perimus omnes; that is, We all
          perish by lawful things; which is as much as to say, man commonly live
          wickedly and go to hell, in those ways which they flatter themselves,
          that they are sins of ignorance, they do not know them to be unlawful.
          — Thus, I make no doubt some will be apt to do, in applying to
          themselves this use of examination, if they can be persuaded to apply
          it to themselves at all. Whether these things be true of you, let your
          own consciences speak, you that neglect secret prayer; you that
          indulge an inordinate appetite for strong drink; you that defraud or
          oppress others; you that indulge a spirit of revenge and hatred toward
          your neighbor. — Here I desire you to consider two or three things.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, not all sins, which one knows not with a certain knowledge to
          be sinful, are justly called sins of ignorance. Men often will excuse
          themselves for venturing upon a sinful action or practice, with this,
          that they know not that it is sinful, which is at most true no
          otherwise, than as they do not know it to be sinful with a certain
          knowledge, or with the evidence of absolute demonstration; although at
          the same time it is a sin against their light, and against great
          light. They have been so taught, that they have had light enough to
          make them sensible that it is displeasing to God, and not warranted or
          allowed by him. And they do in their consciences think it to be
          sinful. They are secretly convinced of it, however they may pretend
          the contrary, and labor to deceive themselves, and to persuade
          themselves that they do not think there is any evil in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those sins which are contrary to sufficient information and
          instruction, and contrary to the real dictates of their own
          consciences, or to the judgment of their own minds, whether there be
          certain or demonstrative knowledge or no, these are what I would be
          understood to mean, when I speak of known sins. Such light as this,
          whether there be absolutely certain knowledge or no, is sufficient to
          render the action utterly inexcusable, and to render it, when allowed,
          a horrible profanation and pollution of the holy ordinances of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, it is vain for persons to pretend that those are sins of
          ignorance, which they have often and clearly heard testified against
          from the Word of God. It will be found to be so at last. It will be
          found to be a vain thing for persons who have lived under the light of
          the gospel, and where all manner of iniquity is testified against, if
          they live in immoral and vicious practices, to pretend that they are
          sins of ignorance, unless the case be very peculiar and extraordinary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, it is in vain for you to pretend that those are sins of
          ignorance, of which you would not dare to proceed in the practice, if
          you knew that your soul was to be required of you this night. Persons
          do many things, for which they plead, and pretend they think there is
          no evil in them, who yet would as soon eat fire, as do the same, if
          they knew that they were to stand before the judgment seat of Christ
          within four and twenty hours. This shows that persons do but
          prevaricate, when they pretend that their sins are sins of ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Another way wherein men deal falsely and perversely in this matter
          is in pretending that they do not allow themselves in those sins which
          they practice. They either pretend that they know them not to be sins,
          or if they cannot but own that, then they will say, they do not allow
          themselves in them. And so they hope God is not very much provoked by
          them. They pretend this, though they make a trade of them. They go on
          repeating one act after another, without ever seriously repenting of
          past, or resolving against future acts. But take heed that you do not
          deceive yourselves in this matter. For such pretenses, however they do
          something towards stilling your consciences now, will do nothing when
          you come to stand before your righteous and holy Judge.
        </p>
        <p>SECTION IV</p>
        <p>
          Address to such as attend ordinances, and yet allow themselves in
          known sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider how holy and sacred the ordinances of God are. What mockery
          you are guilty of in making such a show, and such pretenses in
          attending ordinances, and yet voluntarily acting the reverse of what
          you pretend. Consider that there is no sort of sinners with whom God
          is so provoked, and who stand so guilty before him, as the profaners
          of his ordinances. The fire of God’s wrath id kindled by none so much
          as by the polluters of holy things. They are represented as those who
          are especially guilty before God, in the third commandment: “The Lord
          will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.” Why is this
          annexed to this command, rather than to any other of the ten, but
          because the breach of it especially renders a man guilty in the sight
          of God?
        </p>
        <p>
          The taking of God’s name in vain includes the profanation and
          pollution of ordinances and holy things. They do in a very dreadful
          manner take God’s name in vain, who attend on his ordinances, and yet
          live in known sin. For, as we have shown, they manifest the greatest
          irreverence for him, and contempt of divine things. They manifest a
          contempt of his authority, a contempt of the business and design of
          his ordinances, and a most careless and irreverent spirit in things
          wherein they have immediate converse with God. Ordinances, as we have
          shown, are attended in the name of God. And therefore, by such an
          attendance on them, the name of God is greatly profaned. You that
          attend ordinances in such a manner, take the name of God so much in
          vain, that you use it only in mockery, and so as to expose it to
          contempt. Such a way of attending ordinances is a trampling of all
          that is sacred under foot.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have in Scripture scarce any such awful instances of the immediate
          and miraculous vengeance of God, as on the profaners of holy things.
          How did God consume Nadab and Abihu, for offering strange fire before
          him! How did he break forth upon Uzza, for handling the ark with too
          much irreverence! 2 Sam. 6:6, 7. And how did he break forth on the
          children of Israel at Bethshemesh, for profaning the ark! “He smote of
          the people fifty thousand threescore and ten men,” as in 1 Sam. 6:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          And God has threatened in the New Testament, that if any man “defile
          the temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the temple of God is
          holy,” 1 Cor. 3:17. There is an emphasis in the expression. God will
          destroy all sinners, let it be what sin it will which they commit, and
          in which they continue; and yet it is said, “If any man defile the
          temple of God, him shall God destroy,” as if it had been said, there
          is something peculiar in the case, and God is especially provoked to
          destroy such, and consume them in the fire of his wrath. And he will
          indeed destroy them with a destruction especially dreadful.
        </p>
        <p>
          So God has declared, Gal. 6:7, “That he will not be mocked;” i.e. if
          any presume to mock him, they will find him by experience, to be no
          contemptible being. God will vindicate his holy majesty from the
          contempt of those who dare to mock him, and he will do it effectually.
          They shall fully find how dreadful a being he is, whose name they have
          daringly profaned and polluted. Defilers and profaners of ordinances,
          by known and allowed wickedness, provoke God more than the heathen,
          who have no ordinances. Thus the wickedness of Judah and Jerusalem is
          said to be far worse than that of Sodom, though the inhabitants of
          Sodom were, as we have reason to think, some of the worst of the
          heathens. See Eze. 16:46, 47, etc. The sin of Sodom is here spoken of
          as a light thing in comparison with the sins of Judah. And what should
          be the reason, but that Judah enjoyed holy things which they profaned
          and polluted, which Sodom had no opportunity to do? For it is not to
          be supposed, that Judah otherwise arrived to the same pass that Sodom
          had.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider therefore, ye who allow yourselves in known wickedness, and
          live in it, who yet come to the house of God, and to his ordinances
          from time to time, without any serious design of forsaking your sins,
          but, on the contrary, with an intention of continuing in them, and who
          frequently go from the house of God to your wicked practices, consider
          how guilty you have made yourselves in the sight of God, and how
          dreadfully God is provoked by you. It is a wonder of God’s patience,
          that he does not break forth upon you, and strike you dead in a
          moment. For you profane holy things in a more dreadful manner than
          Uzza did, when yet God struck him dead for his error. And whereas he
          was struck dead for only one offense. You are guilty of the same sin
          from week to week, and from day to day.

          It is a wonder that God suffers you to live upon earth, that he has
          not, with thunderbolt of his wrath, struck you down to the bottomless
          pit long ago. You that are allowedly and voluntarily living in sin,
          who have gone on hitherto in sin, are still going on, and do not
          design any other than to go on yet. It is a wonder that the Almighty’s
          thunder lies still, and suffers you to sit in his house, or to live
          upon earth. It is a wonder that the earth will bear you, and that hell
          does not swallow you up. It is a wonder that fire does not come down
          from heaven, or come up from hell, and devour you, that hell-flames do
          not enlarge themselves to reach you, and that the bottomless pit has
          not swallowed you up.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, that you are as yet born with, is no argument that your
          damnation slumbers. The anger of God is not like the passions of men,
          that it should be in haste. There is a day of vengeance and recompense
          appointed for the vessels of wrath. And when the day shall have come,
          and the iniquity shall be full, none shall deliver out of God’s hand.
          Then will he recompense, even recompense into your bosoms.
