          'I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I
          leave the world, and go to the Father.' -- JOHN xvi.28.
        </p>
        <p>
          These majestic and strange words are the proper close of our Lord's
          discourse, what follows being rather a reply to the disciples'
          exclamation. There is nothing absolutely new in them, but what is new
          is the completeness and the brevity with which they cover the whole
          ground of His being, work, and glory. They fall into two halves, each
          consisting of two clauses; the former half describing our Lord's
          <i>descent</i>, the latter His <i>ascent</i>. In each half the two
          clauses deal with the same fact, considered from the two opposite ends
          as it were -- the point of departure and the point of arrival. 'I came
          forth <i>from</i> the Father, and am come
          <i>into the world: again I </i>leave<i> the world and go </i>to the
          Father.' But the first point of departure is the last point of
          arrival, and the end comes round to the beginning. Our Lord's earthly
          life is, as it were, a jewel enclosed within the flashing gold of His
          eternal dwelling with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I think we shall best apprehend the scope, and appropriate to
          ourselves the blessing and power of these words, if we deal with the
          four points to which they call our attention -- the dwelling with the
          Father; the voluntary coming to the earth; the voluntary departure
          from the earth; and, once more, the dwelling with the Father. We must
          grasp them all if we would know the whole Christ and all that He is
          able to do and to be to us and to the world. So, then, I deal simply
          with these four points.
        </p>
        <p>I. Note then, first, the dwelling with the Father.</p>
        <p>
          If we adopt the most probable reading of the first clause of my text,
          it is even more forcible than in our version: 'I came forth
          <i>out of</i> the Father.' Such an egress implies a being
          <i>in</i> the Father in a sense ineffable for our words, and
          transcending our thoughts. It implies a far deeper and closer relation
          than even that of juxtaposition, companionship, or outward presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, in these great words there is involved obviously, to begin with,
          that, during His earthly life, our Lord bore about with Him the
          remembrance and consciousness of an individual existence prior to His
          life on earth. I need not remind you how frequently such hints drop
          from His lips -- 'Before Abraham was, I am,' and the like. But beyond
          that solemn thought of a remembered previous existence there is this
          other one -- that the words are the assertion by Christ Himself of a
          previous, deep, mysterious, ineffable union with the Father. On such a
          subject wisdom and reverence bid us speak only as we hear; but I
          cannot refrain from emphasising the fact that, if this fourth Gospel
          be a genuine record of the teaching of Jesus Christ -- and, if it is
          not, what genius was he who wrote it? -- if it be a genuine record of
          the teaching of Jesus Christ, then nothing is more plain than that
          over and over again, in all sorts of ways, by implication and by
          direct statement, to all sorts of audiences, friends and foes, He
          reiterated this tremendous claim to have 'dwelt in the bosom of the
          Father,' long before He lay on the breast of Mary. What did He mean
          when He said, 'No man hath ascended up into heaven save He which came
          down from heaven'? What did He mean when He said, 'What and if ye
          shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before'? What did He
          mean when He said, 'I came down from heaven, not to do Mine own will,
          but the will of Him that sent Me'? And what did He mean when, in the
          midst of the solemnities of that last prayer, He said, 'Glorify Thou
          Me with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was'?
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends! it seems to me that if we know anything about Jesus
          Christ, we know <i>that</i>. If we cannot believe that He thus spoke,
          we know nothing about Him on which we can rely. And so, without
          venturing to enlarge at all upon these solemn words, I leave this with
          you as a plain fact, that the meekest, lowliest, and most sane and
          wise of religious teachers made deliberately over and over again this
          claim, which is either absolutely true, and lifts Him into the region
          of the Deity, or else is fatal to His pretensions to be either meek or
          modest, or wise or sane, or a religious teacher to whom it is worth
          our while to listen.
        </p>
        <p>II. Note, secondly, the voluntary coming into the world.</p>
        <p>
          'I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world.' We all
          talk in a loose way about men coming into the world when they are
          born; but the weight of these words and the solemnity of the occasion
          on which they were spoken, and the purpose for which they were spoken
          -- viz., to comfort and to illuminate these disciples -- forbid us to
          see such a mere platitude as that in them. There would have been no
          consolation in them unless they meant something a great deal more than
          the undeniable fact that Jesus Christ was born, and the melancholy
          fact that Jesus Christ was about to die.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I am <i>come</i> into the world.' There has been a Man who chose to
          be born. There has been a Man who appeared here, not 'of the will of
          the flesh, nor of the will of man,' but by His own free choice. He
          willed to take upon Him the form of humanity. Now the voluntariness of
          the entrance of Jesus Christ into the conditions of our human life is
          all-important for us, for it underlies the whole value of that life
          and its whole power to be blessing and good to us. It underlies, for
          instance, the personal sinlessness of Jesus Christ, and hence His
          power to bring a new beginning of pure and perfect life into the midst
          of humanity. All the rest of mankind, knit together by that mysterious
          bond of natural descent which only now for the first time is beginning
          to receive its due attention on the part of men of science, by
          heredity have the taint upon them. And if Jesus Christ is only one of
          the series, then there is no deliverance in Him, for there is no
          sinlessness in that life. However fair its record may seem on the
          surface, there is beneath, somewhere or other, the leprosy that
          infects us all. Unless He came in another fashion from all the rest of
          us, He came with the same sin as all the rest of us, and He is no
          deliverer from sin. Rather He is one of the series who, like the
          melancholy captives on the road to Siberia, each carries a link of the
          hopeless chain that binds them all together. But, if it be true that
          of His own will He took to Himself humanity, and was born as the
          Scripture tells us He was born, His birth being His 'coming' and not
          His being brought, then, being free from taint, He can deliver us from
          taint, and, Himself unbound by the chain, He can break it from off our
          necks. The stream is fouled from its source downwards, and flows on,
          every successive drop participant of the primeval pollution. But, down
          from the white snows of the eternal hills of God, there comes into it
          an affluent which has no stain on its pure waters, and so can purge
          that into which it enters. Jesus Christ willed to be born, and to
          plant a new beginning of holy life in the very heart of humanity which
          henceforth should work as leaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me remind you, too, that this voluntary assumption of our nature
          is all-important to us, for unless we preserve it clear to our minds
          and hearts, the power to sway our affections is struck away from Jesus
          Christ. Unless He voluntarily took upon Himself the nature which He
          meant to redeem, why should I be thankful to Him for what He did, and
          what right has He to claim my love? But if He willingly came down
          amongst us, and 'to this end was born, and for this cause,' of His own
          loving heart, 'came into the world,' then I am knit to Him by cords
          that cannot be broken. One thing only saves for Jesus Christ the
          unbounded and perpetual love of mankind, and that is, that from His
          own infinite and perpetual love He came into the world. We talk about
          kings leaving their palaces and putting on the rags of the beggar, and
          learning 'love in huts where poor men lie,' and making experience of
          the conditions of their lowliest subjects. But here is a fact,
          infinitely beyond all these legends. It is set forth for us in a
          touching fashion, in the incident that almost immediately preceded
          these parting words of our Lord, when 'Jesus, knowing that He came
          forth from God, laid aside His garments and took a towel, and girded
          Himself,' and washed the foul feet of these travel-stained men. That
          was a parable of the Incarnation. The consciousness of His divine
          origin was ever with Him, and that consciousness led Him to lay aside
          the garments of His majesty, and to gird Himself with the towel of
          service. That He had a body round which to wrap it was more
          humiliation than that He wrapped it round the body which He took. And
          we may learn there what it is that gives Him His supreme right to our
          devotion and our surrender -- viz., that, 'being in the form of God,
          He thought not equality with God a thing to be covetously retained,
          but made Himself of no reputation, and was found in fashion as a Man.'
        </p>
        <p>III. Note the voluntary leaving the world.</p>
        <p>
          The stages of that departure are not distinguished. They are threefold
          in fact -- the death, the resurrection, the ascension, and in all
          three we have the majestic, spontaneous energy of Christ as their
          cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a voluntary death, I have so often had occasion to insist
          upon that, in the course of these sermons, that I do not need to dwell
          upon it now. Let me remind you only how distinctly and in what various
          forms that thought is presented to us in the Scriptures. We have our
          Lord's own words about His having 'power to lay down His life.' We
          have in the story of the Passion hints that seem to suggest that His
          relation to death, to which He is about to bow His head, was
          altogether different from that of ours. For instance, we read: 'Into
          Thy hands I <i>commend</i> My Spirit'; and 'He <i>gave up</i> the
          Spirit.' We have hints of a similar nature in the very swiftness of
          His death and unexpected brevity of His suffering, to be accounted for
          by no natural result of the physical process of crucifixion. The fact
          is that Jesus Christ is the Lord of death, and was so even when He
          seemed to be its Servant, and that He never showed Himself more
          completely the Prince of Life and the Conqueror of Death than when He
          gave up His life and died, not because He must, but because He would.
          There is a scene in a modern book of fiction of a man sitting on a
          rock and the ocean stretching round him. It reaches high upon his
          breast, but it threatens not his life, till he, sitting there in his
          calm, bows his head beneath the wave and lets it roll over him. So
          Christ willed to die, and died because He willed.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was also a voluntary resurrection by His own power; for although
          Scripture sometimes represents His rising again from the dead as being
          the Father's attestation of the Son's finished work, it also
          represents it as being, in accordance with His own claim of 'power to
          lay down My life, and to take it again,' the Son's triumphant egress
          from the prison into which, for the moment, He willed to pass. Jesus
          'was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,' but also Jesus
          rose from the dead by His own power.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was also a voluntary ascension to the heavens. There was no need
          for Elijah's chariot of fire. There was no need for a whirlwind to
          sweep a mortal to the sky. There was no need for any external vehicle
          or agency whatsoever. No angels bore Him up upon their wings. But, the
          cords of duty which bound Him to earth being cut, He rose to His own
          native sphere; and, if one might so say, the natural forces of His
          supernatural life bore Him, by inverted gravitation, upward to the
          place which was His own. He ascended by His own inherent power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, by a voluntary death, He became the Sacrifice for our sins; by
          the might of His self-effected resurrection He proclaimed Himself the
          Lord of death and the resurrection for all that trust Him; and by
          ascending up on high He draws our hearts' desires after Him, so that
          we, too, as we see Him lost from our sight, behind the bright Shekinah
          cloud that stooped to conceal the last stages of His ascension from
          our view, may return to our lowly work 'with great joy,' and 'set our
          affection on things above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand
          of God.'
        </p>
        <p>IV. So, lastly, we have here the dwelling again with the Father.</p>
        <p>
          But that final dwelling with God is not wholly identical with the
          initial one. The earthly life was no mere parenthesis, and He who
          returned to the Throne carried with Him the manhood which He had
          assumed, and bore it thither into the glory in which the Word had
          dwelt from the beginning. And this is the true consolation which
          Christ offered to these His weeping servants, and which He still
          offers to us His waiting children, that now the manhood of Jesus
          Christ is exalted to participation in the divine glory, and dwells
          there in the calm, invisible sweetness and solemnity of fellowship
          with the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that be so, it is no mere abstract dogma of theology, but it
          touches our daily life at all points, and is essential to the fullness
          of our satisfaction and our rest in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          'We see not all things put under Him, but we see Jesus.' Our Brother
          is elevated to the Throne, and, if I might so say, He makes the
          fortunes of the family, and none of them will be poor as long as He is
          so rich. He sends us from the far-off land where He is gone precious
          gifts of its produce, and He will send for us to share His throne one
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ's ascension to the Father is the elevation of our best and
          dearest Friend to the Throne of the Universe, and the hands that were
          pierced for us on the Cross hold the helm and sway the sceptre of
          Creation, and therefore we may calmly meet all events.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elevation of Jesus Christ to the Throne fills Heaven for our
          faith, our imagination, and our hearts. How different it is to look up
          into those awful abysses, and to wonder where, amidst their crushing
          infinitude, the spirits of dear ones that are gone are wandering, if
          they are at all; and to look up and to think 'My Christ hath passed
          through the Heavens,' and is somewhere with a true Body, and with Him
          all that loved Him. Without an ascended Christ we recoil from the cold
          splendours of an unknown Heaven, as a rustic might from the
          unintelligible magnificence of a palace. But if we believe that He is
          'at the right hand of God,' then the far-off becomes near, and the
          vague becomes definite, and the unsubstantial becomes solid, and what
          was a fear becomes a joy, and we can trust ourselves and the dear dead
          in His hands, knowing that where He is they are, and that in Him they
          and we have all that we need.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, dear friends! it all comes to this -- make sure that you have hold
          of the whole Christ for yourselves. His earthly life is little without
          the celestial halo that rings it round. His life is nothing without
          His death. His death without His resurrection and ascension maybe a
          little more pathetic than millions of other deaths, but is nothing,
          really, to us. And the life and death and resurrection are not
          apprehended in their fullest power until they are set between the
          eternal glory before and the eternal glory after.
        </p>
        <p>
          These four facts -- the dwelling in the Father; the voluntary coming
          to earth; the voluntary leaving earth; and, again, the dwelling with
          the Father -- are the walls of the strong fortress into which we may
          flee and be safe. With them it 'stands four square to every wind that
          blows.' Strike away one of them, and it totters into ruin. Make the
          whole Christ your Christ; for nothing less than the whole Christ,
          'conceived of the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, ... crucified,
          dead, and buried, ... ascended into Heaven, and sitting at the right
          hand of God,' is strong enough to help your infirmities, vast enough
          to satisfy your desires, loving enough to love you as you need, or
          able to deliver you from your sins, and to lift you to the glories of
          His own Throne.
