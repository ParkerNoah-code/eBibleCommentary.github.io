          'Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it
          was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest
          they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. Pilate
          then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against
          this Man? They answered and said unto him, If He were not a
          malefactor, we would not have delivered Him up unto thee. Then said
          Pilate unto them, Take ye Him, and judge Him according to your law.
          The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any
          man to death: That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which He
          spake, signifying what death He should die. Then Pilate entered into
          the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto Him, Art Thou
          the King of the Jews? Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of
          thyself, or did others tell it thee of Me? Pilate answered, Am I a
          Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered Thee unto
          me: what hast Thou done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this
          world: if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight,
          that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is My kingdom not
          from hence. Pilate therefore said unto Him, Art Thou a king then?
          Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born,
          and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness
          unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth My voice.
          Pilate saith unto Him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he
          went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in Him no
          fault at all. But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one
          at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of
          the Jews? Then cried they all again, saying, Not this Man, but
          Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.' -- JOHN xviii.28-40.
        </p>
        <p>
          John evidently intends to supplement the synoptic Gospels' account. He
          tells of Christ's appearance before Annas, but passes by that before
          Caiaphas, though he shows his knowledge of it. Similarly he touches
          lightly on the public hearing before Pilate, but gives us in detail
          the private conversation in this section, which he alone records. We
          may suppose that he was present at both the hearing before Annas and
          the interview within the palace between Jesus and Herod, for he would
          not be deterred from entering, as the Jews were, and there seems to
          have been no other impediment in the way. The passage has three stages
          -- the fencing between the Sanhedrists and Pilate, the 'good
          confession before Pontius Pilate,' and the preference of Barabbas to
          Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The passage of arms between the priests and the governor. 'It was
          early,' probably before 6 A.M. A hurried meeting of the Sanhedrim had
          condemned Jesus to death, and the next thing was to get the Roman
          authority to carry out the sentence. The necessity of appeal to it was
          a bitter pill, but it had to be swallowed, for the right of capital
          punishment had been withdrawn. A 'religious' scruple, too, stood in
          the way -- very characteristic of such formalists. Killing an innocent
          man would not in the least defile them, or unfit for eating the
          passover, but to go into a house that had not been purged of 'leaven,'
          and was further unclean as the residence of a Gentile, though he was
          the governor, that would stain their consciences -- a singular scale
          of magnitude, which saw no sin in condemning Jesus, and great sin in
          going into Pilate's palace! Perhaps some of our conventional sins are
          of a like sort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pilate was, probably, not over-pleased at being roused so early, nor
          at having to defer to a scruple which would to him look like
          insolence; and through all his bearing to the Sanhedrim a certain
          irritation shows itself, which sometimes flashes out in sarcasm, but
          is for the most part kept down. His first question is, perhaps, not so
          simple as it looks, for he must have had some previous knowledge of
          the case, since Roman soldiers had been used for the arrest. But,
          clearly, those who brought him a prisoner were bound to be the
          prosecutors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether or not Pilate knew that his question was embarrassing, the
          rulers felt it so. Why did they not wish to formulate a charge? Partly
          from pride. They hugged the delusion that their court was competent to
          condemn, and wanted, as we all often do, to shut their eyes to a plain
          fact, as if ignoring it annihilated it. Partly because the charge on
          which they had condemned Jesus -- that of blasphemy in calling Himself
          'the Son of God' -- was not a crime known to Roman law, and to allege
          it would probably have ended in the whole matter being scornfully
          dismissed. So they stood on their dignity and tried to bluster. 'We
          have condemned Him; that is enough. We look to you to carry out the
          sentence at our bidding.' So the 'ecclesiastical authority' has often
          said to the 'secular arm' since then, and unfortunately the civil
          authority has not always been as wise as Pilate was.
        </p>
        <p>
          He saw an opening to get rid of the whole matter, and with just a
          faint flavour of irony suggests that, as they have 'a law' -- which
          he, no doubt, thought of as a very barbarous code -- they had better
          go by it, and punish as well as condemn. That sarcastic proposal
          compelled them to acknowledge their subjection. Pilate had given the
          reins the least touch, but enough to make them feel the bit; and
          though it went sore against the grain, they will own their master
          rather than lose their victim. So their reluctant lips say, 'It is not
          lawful for us.' Pilate has brought them on their knees at last, and
          they forget their dignity, and own the truth. Malicious hatred will
          eat any amount of dirt and humiliation to gain its ends, especially if
          it calls itself religious zeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          John sees in the issue of this first round in the duel between Pilate
          and the rulers the sequence of events which brought about the
          fulfilment of our Lord's prediction of His crucifixion, since that was
          not a Jewish mode of execution. This encounter of keen wits becomes
          tragical and awful when we remember Who it was that these men were
          wrangling about.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. We have Jesus and Pilate; the 'good confession,' and the
          indifferent answer. We must suppose that, unwillingly, the rulers had
          brought the accusation that Jesus had attempted rebellion against
          Rome. John omits that, because he takes it for granted that it is
          known. It is implied in the conversation which now ensued. We must
          note as remarkable that Pilate does not conduct his first examination
          in the presence of the rulers, but has Jesus brought to him in the
          palace. Perhaps he simply wished to annoy the accusers, but more
          probably his Roman sense of justice combined with his wish to assert
          his authority, and perhaps with a suspicion that there was something
          strange about the whole matter -- and not least strange that the
          Sanhedrim, who were not enthusiastic supporters of Rome, should all at
          once display such loyalty -- to make him wish to have the prisoner by
          himself, and try to fathom the business. With Roman directness he went
          straight to the point: 'Art Thou the King of the Jews, as they have
          been saying?' There is emphasis on 'Thou' -- the emphasis which a
          practical Roman official would be likely to put as he looked at the
          weak, wearied, evidently poor and helpless man bound before him. There
          is almost a touch of pity in the question, and certainly the beginning
          of the conviction that this was not a very formidable rival to Caesar.
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer to be given depended on the sense in which Pilate asked the
          question, to bring out which is the object of Christ's question in
          reply. If Pilate was asking of himself, then what he meant by 'a king'
          was one of earth's monarchs after the emperor's pattern, and the
          answer would be 'No.' If he was repeating a Jewish charge, then, 'a
          king' might mean the prophetic King of Israel, who was no rival of
          earthly monarchs, and the answer would be 'Yes,' but that 'Yes' would
          give Pilate no more reason to crucify Him than the 'No' would have
          given.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pilate is getting tired of fencing, and impatiently answers, with true
          Roman contempt for subject-people's thoughts as well as their weapons.
          'I ... a Jew?' is said with a curl of the firm lips. He points to his
          informants, 'Thine own nation and the chief priests,' and does not say
          that their surrender of a would-be leader in a war of independence
          struck him as suspicious. But he brushes aside the cobwebs which he
          felt were being spun round him, and comes to the point, 'What hast
          Thou done?' He is supremely indifferent to ideas and vagaries of
          enthusiasts. This poor man before him may call Himself anything He
          chooses, but <i>his</i> only concern is with overt acts. Strange to
          ask the Prisoner what He had done! It had been well for Pilate if he
          had held fast by that question, and based his judgment resolutely on
          its answer! He kept asking it all through the case, he never succeeded
          in getting an answer; he was convinced that Jesus had done nothing
          worthy of death, and yet fear, and a wish to curry favour with the
          rulers, drove him to stain the judge's robe with innocent blood, from
          which he vainly sought to cleanse his hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord's double answer claims a kingdom, but first shows what it is
          not, and then what it is. It is 'not <i>of</i> this world,' though it
          is <i>in</i> this world, being established and developed here, but
          having nothing in common with earthly dominions, nor being advanced by
          their weapons or methods. Pilate could convince himself that this
          'kingdom' bore no menace to Rome, from the fact that no resistance had
          been offered to Christ's capture. But the principle involved in these
          great words goes far beyond their immediate application. It forbids
          Christ's 'servants' to assimilate His kingdom to the world, or to use
          worldly powers as the means for the kingdom's advancement. The history
          of the Church has sadly proved how hard it is for Christian men to
          learn the lesson, and how fatal to the energy and purity of the Church
          the forgetfulness of it has been. The temptation to such assimilation
          besets all organised Christianity, and is as strong to- day as when
          Constantine gave the Church the paralysing gift of 'establishing' it
          as a kingdom 'of this world.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Pilate did pick out of this saying an increased certainty that he had
          nothing to fear from this strange 'King'; and half-amused contempt for
          a dreamer, and half-pitying wonder at such lofty claims from such a
          helpless enthusiast, prompted his question, 'Art Thou a king then?'
          One can fancy the scornful emphasis on that 'Thou.' and can understand
          how grotesquely absurd the notion of his prisoner's being a king must
          have seemed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having made clear part of the sense in which the avowal was to be
          taken, our Lord answered plainly 'Yes.' Thus before the high-priest,
          He declared Himself to be the Son of God, and before Pilate He claimed
          to be King, at each tribunal putting forward the claim which each was
          competent to examine -- and, alas! at each meeting similar levity and
          refusal to inquire seriously into the validity of the claim. The
          solemn revelation to Pilate of the true nature of His kingdom and of
          Himself the King fell on careless ears. A deeper mystery than Pilate
          dreamed of lay beneath the double designation of His origin; for He
          not only had been 'born' like other men, but had 'come into the
          world,' having 'come forth from the Father,' and having been before He
          was born. It was scarcely possible that Pilate should apprehend the
          meaning of that duplication, but some vague impression of a mysterious
          personality might reach him, and Jesus would not have fully expressed
          His own consciousness if He had simply said, 'I was born.' Let us see
          that we keep firm hold of all which that utterance implies and
          declares.
        </p>
        <p>
          The end of the Incarnation is to 'bear witness to the truth.' That
          witness is the one weapon by which Christ's kingdom is established.
          That witness is not given by words only, precious as these are, but by
          deeds which are more than words. These witnessing deeds are not
          complete till Calvary and the empty grave and Olivet have witnessed at
          once to the perfect incarnation of divine love, to the perfect
          Sacrifice for the world's sin, to the Victor over death, and to the
          opening of heaven to all believers. Jesus is 'the faithful and true
          Witness,' as John calls Him, not without reminiscences of this
          passage, just because He is 'the First-begotten of the dead.' As here
          He told Pilate that He was a 'king,' because a 'witness,' so John, in
          the passage referred to, bases His being 'Prince of the kings of the
          earth' on the same fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          How little Pilate knew that he was standing at the very crisis of his
          fate! A yielding to the impression that was slightly touching his
          heart and conscience, and he, too, might have 'heard' Christ's voice.
          But he was not 'of the truth,' though he might have been if he had
          willed, and so the words were wind to him, and he brushed aside all
          the mist, as he thought it, with the light question, which summed up a
          Roman man of the world's indifference to ideas, and belief in solid
          facts like legions and swords. 'What is truth?' may be the cry of a
          seeking soul, or the sneer of a confirmed sceptic, or the shrug of
          indifference of the 'practical man.'
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the last in Pilate's case, as is shown by his not waiting for
          an answer, but ending the conversation with it as a last shot. It
          meant, too, that he felt quite certain that this man, with his high-
          strained, unpractical talk about a kingdom resting on such a filmy
          nothing, was absolutely harmless. Therefore the only just thing for
          him to have done was to have gone out to the impatient crowd and said
          so, and flatly refused to do the dirty work of the priests for them,
          by killing an innocent man. But he was too cowardly for that, and, no
          doubt, thought that the murder of one poor Jew was a small price to
          pay for popularity with his troublesome subjects. Still, like all weak
          men, he was not easy in his conscience, and made a futile attempt to
          get the right thing done, and yet not to suffer for doing it. The
          rejection of Barabbas is touched very lightly by John, and must be
          left unnoticed here. The great contribution to our knowledge which
          John makes is this private interview between the King who reigns by
          the truth, and the representative of earthly rule, based on arms and
          worldly forces.
