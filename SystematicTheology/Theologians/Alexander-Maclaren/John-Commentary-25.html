          'As soon then as He had said unto them, I am He, they went backward,
          and fell to the ground. Then asked He them again, Whom seek ye? And
          they said, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered, I have told you that I
          am He: if therefore ye seek Me, let these go their way: That the
          saying might he fulfilled, which He spake, Of them which Thou gayest
          Me have I lost none.' -- JOHN xviii.6-9.
        </p>
        <p>
          This remarkable incident is narrated by John only. It fits in with the
          purpose which he himself tells us governed his selection of the
          incidents which he records. 'These things are written,' says he, near
          the end of the Gospel, 'that ye might believe that Jesus is the Son of
          God, and that, believing, ye might have life in His name.' The whole
          of the peculiarities of the substance of John's Gospel are to be
          explained on the two grounds that he was writing a supplement to, and
          not a substitute for, or a correction of, the Gospels already in
          existence; and that his special business was to narrate such facts and
          words as set forth the glory of Christ as 'the Only Begotten of the
          Father.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The incident before us is, as I think, one of these. The Evangelist
          would have us see in it, as I gather from his manner of narrating it,
          mainly three things. He emphasises that strange recoil of the would-
          be captors before Christ's majestic, calm 'I am He'; that was a
          manifestation of Christ's glory. He emphasises our Lord's patient
          standing there, in the midst of the awe-struck crowd, and even
          inciting them, as it would seem, to do the work for which they had
          come out; that was a manifestation of the voluntariness of Christ's
          sufferings. And He emphasises the self-forgetting care with which at
          that supreme moment He steps between His faithless, weak friends and
          danger, with the wonderful words, 'If ye seek Me, let these go their
          way'; to the Evangelist that little incident is an illustration, on a
          very low level, and in regard to a comparatively trivial matter, of
          the very same principle by which salvation from all evil in time and
          in eternity, is guaranteed to all that believe on Him: --
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, consider this remarkable, momentary manifestation of
          our Lord's glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I am He!' When the Band were thus doubly assured by the traitor's
          kiss and by His own confession, why did they not lay hands upon Him?
          There He stood in the midst of them, alone, defenceless; there was
          nothing to hinder their binding Him on the spot. Instead of that they
          recoil, and fall in a huddled heap before Him. Some strange awe and
          terror, of which they themselves could have given no account, was upon
          their spirits. How came it about? Many things may have conspired to
          produce it. I am by no means anxious to insist that this was a
          miracle. Things of the same sort, though much less in degree, have
          been often enough seen; when some innocent and illustrious victim has
          for a moment paralysed the hands of his would-be captors and made them
          feel, though it were but transiently, 'how awful goodness is.' There
          must have been many in that band who had heard Him, though, in the
          uncertain light of quivering moonbeams and smoking torches, they
          failed to recognise Him till He spoke. There must have been many more
          who had heard of Him, and many who suspected that they were about to
          lay hands on a holy man, perhaps on a prophet. There must have been
          reluctant tools among the inferiors, and no doubt some among the
          leaders whoso consciences needed but a touch to be roused to action.
          To all, His calmness and dignity would appeal, and the manifest
          freedom from fear or desire to flee would tend to deepen the strange
          thoughts which began to stir in their hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the impression which the narrative seems intended to leave,
          appears to me to be of something more than this. It looks as if there
          were something more than human in Christ's look and tone. It may have
          been the same in kind as the ascendency which a pure and calm nature
          has over rude and inferior ones. It may have been the same in kind as
          has sometimes made the headsman on the scaffold pause before he
          struck, and has bowed rude gaolers into converts before some grey-
          haired saint or virgin martyr; yet the difference is so great in
          degree as practically to become quite another thing. Though I do not
          want to insist upon any 'miraculous' explanation of the cause of this
          incident, yet I would ask, May it not be that here we see, perhaps
          apart from Christ's will altogether, rising up for one moment to the
          surface, the indwelling majesty which was always there?
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not know the laws that regulated the dwelling of the Godhead,
          bodily, within that human frame, but we do know that at one other time
          there came upon His features a transfiguration, and over His very
          garments a lustre which was not thrown upon them from without, but
          rose up from within. And I am inclined to think that here, as there,
          though under such widely different circumstances and to such various
          issues, there was for a moment a little rending of the veil of His
          flesh, and an emission of some flash of the brightness that always
          tabernacled within Him; and that, therefore, just as Isaiah, when He
          saw the King in His glory, said, 'Woe is me, for I am undone!' and
          just as Moses could not look upon the Face, but could only see the
          back parts, so here the one stray beam of manifest divinity that shot
          through the crevice, as it were, for an instant, was enough to
          prostrate with a strange awe even those rude and insensitive men. When
          He had said 'I am He,' there was something that made them feel, 'This
          is One before whom violence cowers abashed, and in whose presence
          impurity has to hide its face.' I do not assert that this is the
          explanation of that panic terror. I only ask, May it not be?
        </p>
        <p>
          But whatever we may think was the reason, at all events the incident
          brings out very strikingly the elevation and dignity of Christ, and
          the powerful impressions made by His personality, even at such a time
          of humiliation. This Evangelist is always careful to bring out the
          glory of Christ, especially when that glory lies side by side with His
          lowliness. The blending of these two is one of the remarkable features
          in the New Testament portraiture of Jesus Christ. Wherever in our
          Lord's life any incident indicates more emphatically than usual the
          lowliness of His humiliation, there, by the side of it, you get
          something that indicates the majesty of His glory. For instance, He is
          born a weak infant, but angels herald His birth; He lies in a manger,
          but a star hangs trembling above it, and leads sages from afar, with
          their myrrh, and incense, and gold. He submits Himself to the baptism
          of repentance, but the heavens open and a voice proclaims, 'This is My
          beloved Son!' He sits wearied, on the stone coping of the well, and
          craves for water from a peasant woman; but He gives her the Water of
          Life. He lies down and sleeps, from pure exhaustion, in the stern of
          the little fishing-boat, but He wakes to command the storm, and it is
          still. He weeps beside the grave, but He flings His voice into its
          inmost recesses, and the sheeted dead comes forth. He well-nigh faints
          under the agony in the garden, but an angel from Heaven strengthens
          Him. He stands a prisoner at a human bar, but He judges and condemns
          His judges. He dies, and that hour of defeat is His hour of triumph,
          and the union of shame and glory is most conspicuous in that hour when
          on the Cross the 'Son of Man is <i>glorified</i>, and God is glorified
          in Him.'
        </p>
        <p>
          This strange blending of opposites -- the glory in the lowliness, and
          the abasement in the glory -- is the keynote of this singular event.
          He will be 'delivered into the hands of men.' Yes; but ere He is
          delivered He pauses for an instant, and in that instant comes a flash
          'above the brightness of the noonday sun' to tell of the hidden glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not forget that we may well look upon that incident as a prophecy
          of what shall be. As one of the suggestive, old commentators on this
          verse says: 'He will say |I am He,| again, a third time. What will He
          do coming to reign, when He did this coming to die? And what will His
          manifestation be as a Judge when this was the effect of the
          manifestation as He went to be judged?' 'Every eye shall see Him'; and
          they that loved not His appearing shall fall before Him when He cometh
          to be our Judge; and shall call on the rocks and the hills to cover
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. There is here, secondly, a manifestation of the voluntariness of
          our Lord's suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          When that terrified mob recoiled from Him, why did He stand there so
          patiently? The time was propitious for flight, if He had cared to
          flee. He might have 'passed through the midst of them and gone His
          way.' as He did once before, if He had chosen. He comes from the
          garden; there shall be no difficulty in finding Him. He tells who He
          is; there shall be no need for the traitor's kiss. He lays them low
          for a moment, but He will not flee. When Peter draws his sword He
          rebukes his ill-advised appeal to force, and then He holds out His
          hands and lets them bind Him. It was not their fetters, but the 'cords
          of love' which held Him prisoner. It was not their power, but His own
          pity which drew Him to the judgment hall and the Cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us dwell upon that thought for a moment. The whole story of the
          Gospels is constructed upon the principle, and illustrates the fact,
          that our Lord's life, as our Lord's death, was a voluntary surrender
          of Himself for man's sin, and that nothing led Him to, and fastened
          Him on, the Cross but His own will. He willed to be born. He 'came
          into the world' by His own choice. He 'took upon Him the form of a
          servant.' He 'took part' of the children's 'flesh and blood.' His
          birth was His own act, the first of the long series of the acts, by
          which for the sake of the love which He bore us, He 'humbled Himself.'
          Step by step He voluntarily journeyed towards the Cross, which stood
          clear before Him from the very beginning as the necessary end, made
          necessary by His love.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we get nearer and nearer to the close of the history, we see more
          and more distinctly that He willingly went towards the Cross, Take;
          for instance, the account of the last portion of our Lord's life, and
          you see in the whole of it a deliberate intention to precipitate the
          final conflict. Hence the last journey to Jerusalem when 'His face was
          set,' and His disciples followed Him amazed. Hence the studied
          publicity of His triumphal entry into Jerusalem. Hence the studied,
          growing severity of His rebukes to the priests and rulers. The same
          impression is given, though in a somewhat different way, by His
          momentary retreat from the city and by the precautions taken against
          premature arrest, that He might not die before the Passover. In both
          the hastening toward the city and in the retreating from it, there is
          apparent the same design: that He Himself shall lay down His life, and
          shall determine the how, and the when, and the where as seems good to
          Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we look at the act of death itself, Jesus did not die because He
          must. It was not the nails of the Cross, the physical exhaustion, the
          nervous shock of crucifixion that killed Him. He died because He
          would. 'I have power to lay down My life,' He said, 'and I have power'
          -- of course -- 'to take it again.' At that last moment, He was Lord
          and Master of death when He bowed His head to death, and, if I might
          so say, He summoned that grim servant with a 'Come!' and he came, and
          He set him his task with a 'Do this!' and he did it. He was manifested
          as the Lord of death, having its 'keys' in His hands, when He died
          upon the Cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I pray you to ask yourselves the question, if it be true that
          Christ died because He would, why was it that He would die? If because
          He chose, what was it that determined His choice? And there are but
          two answers, which two are one. The divine motive that ruled His life
          is doubly expressed: 'I must do the will of My Father,' and 'I must
          save the world.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The taunt that those Jewish rulers threw at Him had a deeper truth
          than they dreamed, and was an encomium, and not a taunt. 'He saved
          others' -- yes, and <i>therefore</i>, 'Himself He cannot save.' He
          cannot, because His choice and will to die are determined by His free
          love to us and to all the world. His fixed will 'bore His body to the
          tree,' and His love was the strong spring which kept His will fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          You and I have our share in these voluntary sufferings, and our place
          in that loving heart which underwent them for us. Oh! should not that
          thought speak to all our hearts, and bind us in grateful service and
          lifelong surrender to Him who gave Himself for us; and <i>must</i> die
          because He loved us all so much that He <i>could not</i> leave us
          unsaved?
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We have, lastly, here, a symbol, or, perhaps, more accurately, an
          instance, on a small scale, of Christ's self-sacrificing care for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          His words: 'If ye seek Me, let these go their way,' sound more like
          the command of a prince than the intercession of a prisoner. The calm
          dignity of them strikes one just as much as the perfect self-
          forgetfulness of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a very small matter which He was securing thereby. The Apostles
          would have to die for Him some day, but they were not ready for it
          yet, and so He casts the shield of His protection round them for a
          moment, and interposes Himself between them and the band of soldiers
          in order that their weakness may have a little more time to grow
          strong. And though it was wrong and cowardly for them to forsake Him
          and flee, yet these words of my text more than half gave them
          permission and warrant for their departure: 'Let these go their way.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Now John did not think that this small deliverance was all that Christ
          meant by these great words: 'Of them which Thou gavest Me have I lost
          none!' He saw that it was one case, a very trifling one, a merely
          transitory one, yet ruled by the same principles which are at work in
          the immensely higher region to which the words properly refer. Of
          course they have their proper fulfilment in the spiritual realm, and
          are not fulfilled, in the highest sense, till all who have loved and
          followed Christ are presented faultless before the Father in the home
          above. But the little incident may be a result of the same cause as
          the final deliverance is. A dew-drop is shaped by the same laws which
          mould the mightiest of the planets. The old divines used to say that
          God was greatest in the smallest things, and the self-sacrificing care
          of Jesus Christ, as He gives Himself a prisoner that His disciples may
          go free, comes from the same deep heart of pitying love, which led Him
          to die, the 'just for the unjust.' It may then well stand for a
          partial fulfilment of His mighty words, even though these wait for
          their complete accomplishment till the hour when all the sheep are
          gathered into the one fold, and no evil beasts, nor weary journeys,
          nor barren pastures can harass them any more.
        </p>
        <p>
          This trivial incident, then, becomes an exposition of highest truth.
          Let us learn from such an use of such an event to look upon all common
          and transitory circumstances as governed by the same loving hands, and
          working to the same ends, as the most purely spiritual. The visible is
          the veil which drapes the invisible, and clings so closely to it as to
          reveal its outline. The common events of life are all parables to the
          devout heart, which is the wise heart. They speak mystic meanings to
          ears that can hear. The redeeming love of Jesus is proclaimed by every
          mercy which perishes in the using; and all things should tell us of
          His self-forgetting, self-sacrificing care.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, then, we may see in that picture of our Lord's surrendering
          Himself that His trembling disciples might go free, an emblem of what
          He does for us, in regard to all our foes. He stands between us and
          them, receives their arrows into His own bosom, and says, 'Let these
          go their way.' God's law comes with its terrors, with its penalties,
          to us who have broken it a thousand times. The consciousness of guilt
          and sin threatens us all more or less, and with varying intensity in
          different minds. The weariness of the world, 'the ills that flesh is
          heir to,' the last grim enemy, Death, and that which lies beyond them
          all, ring you round. My friends! what are you going to do in order to
          escape from them? You are a sinful man, you have broken God's law.
          That law goes on crashing its way and crushing down all that is
          opposed to it. You have a weary life before you, however joyful it may
          sometimes be. Cares, and troubles, and sorrows, and tears, and losses,
          and disappointments, and hard duties that you will not be able to
          perform, and dark days in which you will be able to see but very
          little light, are all certain to come sooner or later; and the last
          moment will draw near when the King of Terrors will be at your side;
          and beyond death there is a life of retribution in which men reap the
          things that they have sown here. All that is true, much of it is true
          about you at this moment, and it will all be true some day. In view of
          that, what are you going to do?
        </p>
        <p>
          I preach to you a Saviour who has endured all for us. As a mother
          might fling herself out of the sledge that her child might escape the
          wolves in full chase, here is One that comes and fronts all your foes,
          and says to them, 'Let these go their way. Take Me.' 'By His stripes
          we are healed.' 'On Him was laid the iniquity of us all.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He died because He chose; He chose because He loved. His love had to
          die in order that His death might be our life, and that in it we
          should find our forgiveness and peace. He stands between our foes and
          us. No evil can strike us unless it strike Him first. He takes into
          His own heart the sharpest of all the darts which can pierce ours. He
          has borne the guilt and punishment of a world's sin. These solemn
          penalties have fallen upon Him that we, trusting in Him, 'may go our
          way,' and that there may be 'no condemnation' to us if we are in
          Christ Jesus. And if there be no condemnation, we can stand whatever
          other blows may fall upon us. They are easier to bear, and their whole
          character is different, when we know that Christ has borne them
          already. Two of the three whom Christ protected in the garden died a
          martyr's death; but do you not think that James bowed his neck to
          Herod's sword, and Peter let them gird him and lead him to his cross,
          more joyfully and with a different heart, when they thought of Him
          that had died before them? The darkest prison cell will not be so very
          dark if we remember that Christ has been there before us, and death
          itself will be softened into sleep because our Lord has died. 'If
          therefore,' says He, to the whole pack of evils baying round us, with
          their cruel eyes and their hungry mouths, 'ye seek Me, let these go
          their way.' So, brother, if you will fix your trust, as a poor, sinful
          soul, on that dear Christ, and get behind Him, and put Him between you
          and your enemies, then, in time and in eternity, that saying will be
          fulfilled in you which He spake, 'Of them which Thou gavest Me, have I
          lost none.'
