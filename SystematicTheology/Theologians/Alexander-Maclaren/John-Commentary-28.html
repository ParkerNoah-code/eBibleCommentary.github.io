          'Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged Him. And the soldiers
          platted a crown of thorns, and put it on His head, and they put on Him
          a purple robe. And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote Him
          with their hands. Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto
          them, Behold, I bring Him forth to you, that ye may know that I find
          no fault in Him. Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns,
          and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the Man! When
          the chief priests therefore and officers saw Him, they cried out,
          saying, Crucify Him, crucify Him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye Him,
          and crucify Him: for I find no fault in Him. The Jews answered him, We
          have a law, and by our law He ought to die, because He made Himself
          the Son of God. When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the
          more afraid; And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto
          Jesus, Whence art Thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. Then saith
          Pilate unto Him, Speakest Thou not unto me I knowest Thou not that I
          have power to crucify Thee, and have power to release Thee? Jesus
          answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against Me, except it
          were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered Me unto thee
          hath the greater sin. And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release
          Him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this Man go, thou art
          not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against
          Caesar. When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus
          forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the
          Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. And it was the preparation of
          the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews,
          Behold your King! But they cried out, Away with Him, away with Him,
          crucify Him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The
          chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. Then delivered he
          Him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led
          Him away.'<br />
          -- JOHN xix.1-16.
        </p>
        <p>
          The struggle between the vacillation of Pilate and the fixed malignity
          of the rulers is the principal theme of this fragment of Christ's
          judicial trial. He Himself is passive and all but silent, speaking
          only one sentence of calm rebuke. The frequent changes of scene from
          within to without the praetorium indicate the steps in the struggle,
          and vividly reflect the irresolution of Pilate. These changes may help
          to mark the stages in the narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The cruelties and indignities in verses 1-3 were inflicted within
          the 'palace,' to which Pilate, with his prisoner, had returned after
          the popular vote for Barabbas. John makes that choice of the robber
          the reason for the scourging of Jesus. His thought seems to be that
          Pilate, having failed in his attempt to get rid of the whole
          difficulty by releasing Jesus, according to the 'custom,' ordered the
          scourging, in hope that the lighter punishment might satisfy the
          turbulent crowd, whom he wished to humour, while, if possible, saving
          their victim. It was the expedient of a weak and cynical nature, and,
          like all weak attempts at compromise between right and wrong, only
          emboldened the hatred which it was meant to appease. If by clamour the
          rulers had succeeded in getting Pilate to scourge a man whom he
          thought innocent, they might well hope to get him to crucify, if they
          clamoured loudly and long enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          One attitude only befitted Pilate, since he did not in the least
          believe that Jesus threatened the Roman supremacy; namely, to set Him
          at liberty, and let the disappointed rulers growl like wild beasts
          robbed of their prey. But he did not care enough about a single half-
          crazy Jewish peasant to imperil his standing well with his awkward
          subjects, for the sake of righteousness. The one good which Rome could
          give to its vassal nations was inflexible justice and a sovereign law;
          but in Pilate's action there was not even the pretence of legality.
          Tricks and expedients run through it all, and never once does he say,
          This is the law, this is justice, and by it I stand or fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cruel scourging, which, in Roman hands, was a much more severe
          punishment than the Jewish 'beating with rods' and often ended in
          death, was inflicted on the silent, unresisting Christ, not because
          His judge thought that it was deserved, but to please accusers whose
          charge he knew to be absurd. The underlings naturally followed their
          betters' example, and after they had executed Pilate's orders to
          scourge, covered the bleeding wounds with some robe, perhaps ragged,
          but of the royal colour, and crushed the twisted wreath of thorn-
          branch down on the brows, to make fresh wounds there. The jest of
          crowning such a poor, helpless creature as Jesus seemed to them, was
          exactly on the level of such rude natures, and would be the more
          exquisite to them because it was double-barrelled, and insulted the
          nation as well as the 'King.' They came in a string, as the tense of
          the original word suggests, and offered their mock reverence. But that
          sport became tame after a little, and mockery passed into violence, as
          it always does in such natures. These rough legionaries were cruel and
          brutal, and they were unconscious witnesses to His Kingship as founded
          on suffering; but they were innocent as compared with the polished
          gentleman on the judgment-seat who prostituted justice, and the
          learned Pharisees outside who were howling for blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. In verses 4-8 the scene changes again to without the palace, and
          shows us Pilate trying another expedient, equally in vain. The
          hesitating governor has no chance with the resolute, rooted hate of
          the rulers. Jesus silently and unresistingly follows Pilate from the
          hall, still wearing the mockery of royal pomp. Pilate had calculated
          that the sight of Him in such guise, and bleeding from the lash, might
          turn hate into contempt, and perhaps give a touch of pity. 'Behold the
          man!' as he meant it, was as if he had said, 'Is this poor, bruised,
          spiritless sufferer worth hate or fear? Does He look like a King or a
          dangerous enemy?' Pilate for once drops the scoff of calling Him their
          King, and seeks to conciliate and move to pity. The profound meanings
          which later ages have delighted to find in his words, however
          warrantable, are no part of their design as spoken, and we gain a
          better lesson from the scene by keeping close to the thoughts of the
          actors. What a contrast between the vacillation of the governor, on
          the one hand, afraid to do right and reluctant to do wrong, and the
          dogged malignity of the rulers and their tools on the other, and the
          calm, meek endurance of the silent Christ, knowing all their thoughts,
          pitying all, and fixed in loving resolve, even firmer than the rulers'
          hate, to bear the utmost, that He might save a world!
        </p>
        <p>
          Some pity may have stirred in the crowd, but the priests and their
          immediate dependants silenced it by their yell of fresh hate at the
          sight of the prisoner. Note how John gives the very impression of the
          fierce, brief roar, like that of wild beasts for their prey, by his
          'Crucify, crucify!' without addition of the person. Pilate lost
          patience at last, and angrily and half seriously gives permission to
          them to take the law into their own hands. He really means, 'I will
          not be your tool, and if my conviction of |the Man's| innocence is to
          be of no account, <i>you</i> must punish Him; for <i>I</i> will not.'
          How far he meant to abdicate authority, and how far he was launching
          sarcasms, it is difficult to say. Throughout he is sarcastic, and
          thereby indicates his weakness, indemnifying himself for being
          thwarted by sneers which sit so ill on authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the offer, or sarcasm, whichever it was, missed fire, as the
          appeal to pity had done, and only led to the production of a new
          weapon. In their frantic determination to compass Jesus' death, the
          rulers hesitate at no degradation; and now they adduced the charge of
          blasphemy, and were ready to make a heathen the judge. To ask a Roman
          governor to execute their law on a religious offender, was to drag
          their national prerogative in the mud. But formal religionists,
          inflamed by religious animosity, are often the degraders of religion
          for the gratification of their hatred. They are poor preservers of the
          Church who call on the secular arm to execute their 'laws.' Rome went
          a long way in letting subject peoples keep their institutions; but it
          was too much to expect Pilate to be the hangman for these furious
          priests, on a charge scarcely intelligible to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was Jesus doing while all this hell of wickedness and fury boiled
          round Him? Standing there, passive and dumb, 'as a sheep before her
          shearers,' Himself is the least conspicuous figure in the history of
          His own trial. In silent communion with the Father, in silent
          submission to His murderers, in silent pity for us, in silent
          contemplation of 'the joy that was set before Him,' He waits on their
          will.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Once more the scene changes to the interior of the praetorium
          (vs.9-11). The rulers' words stirred a deepened awe in Pilate. He 'was
          the more afraid'; then he had been already afraid. His wife's dream,
          the impression already produced by the person of Jesus, had touched
          him more deeply than probably he himself was aware of; and now this
          charge that Jesus had 'made Himself the Son of God' shook him. What if
          this strange man were in some sense a messenger of the gods? Had he
          been scourging one sent from them? Sceptical he probably was, and
          therefore superstitious; and half-forgotten and disbelieved stories of
          gods who had 'come down in the likeness of men' would swim up in his
          memory. If this Man were such, His strange demeanour would be
          explained. Therefore he carried Jesus in again, and, not now as judge,
          sought to hear from His own lips His version of the alleged claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why did not Jesus answer such a question? His silence was answer; but,
          besides that, Pilate had not received as he ought what Jesus had
          already declared to him as to His kingdom and His relation to 'the
          truth,' and careless turning away from Christ's earlier words is
          righteously and necessarily punished by subsequent silence, if the
          same disposition remains. That it did remain, Christ's silence is
          proof. Had there been any use in answering, Pilate would not have
          asked in vain. If Jesus was silent, we may be sure that He who sees
          all hearts and responds to all true desires was so, because He knew
          that it was best to say nothing. The question of His origin had
          nothing to do with Pilate's duty then, which turned, not on whence
          Jesus had come, but on what Pilate believed Him to have done, or not
          to have done. He who will not do the plain duty of the moment has
          little chance of an answer to his questions about such high matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shallow character of the governor's awe and interest is clearly
          seen from the immediate change of tone to arrogant reminder of his
          absolute authority. 'To me dost Thou not speak?' The pride of offended
          dignity peeps out there. He has forgotten that a moment since he half
          suspected that the prisoner, whom he now seeks to terrify with the
          cross, and to allure with deliverance, was perhaps come from some
          misty heaven. Was that a temper which would have received Christ's
          answer to his question?
        </p>
        <p>
          But one thing he might be made to perceive, and therefore Jesus broke
          silence for the only time in this section, and almost the only time
          before Pilate. He reads the arrogant Roman the lesson which he and all
          his tribe in all lands and ages need -- that their power is derived
          from God, therefore in its foundation legitimate, and in its exercise
          to be guided by His will and used for His purposes. It was God who had
          brought the Roman eagles, with their ravening beaks and strong claws,
          to the Holy City. Pilate was right in exercising jurisdiction over
          Jesus. Let him see that he exercised justice, and let him remember
          that the power which he boasted that he 'had' was 'given.' The truth
          as to the source of power made the guilt of Caiaphas or of the rulers
          the greater, inasmuch as they had neglected the duties to which they
          had been appointed, and by handing over Jesus on a charge which they
          themselves should have searched out, had been guilty of 'theocratic
          felony.' This sudden flash of bold rebuke, reminding Pilate of his
          dependence, and charging him with the lesser but yet real 'sin,' went
          deeper than any answer to his question would have done, and spurred
          him to more earnest effort, as John points out. He 'sought to release
          Him,' as if formerly he had been rather simply unwilling to condemn
          than anxious to deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. So the scene changes again to outside. Pilate went out alone,
          leaving Jesus within, and was met before he had time, as would appear,
          to speak, by the final irresistible weapon which the rulers had kept
          in reserve. An accusation of treason was only too certain to be
          listened to by the suspicious tyrant who was then Emperor, especially
          if brought by the authorities of a subject nation. Many a provincial
          governor had had but a short shrift in such a case, and Pilate knew
          that he was a ruined man if these implacable zealots howling before
          him went to Tiberius with such a charge. So the die was cast. With
          rage in his heart, no doubt, and knowing that he was sacrificing
          'innocent blood' to save himself, he turned away from the victorious
          mob, apparently in silence, and brought Jesus out once more. He had no
          more words to say to his prisoner. Nothing remained but the formal act
          of sentence, for which he seated himself, with a poor assumption of
          dignity, yet feeling all the while, no doubt, what a contemptible
          surrender he was making.
        </p>
        <p>
          Judgment-seats and mosaic pavements do not go far to secure reverence
          for a judge who is no better than an assassin, killing an innocent man
          to secure his own ends. Pilate's sentence fell most heavily on
          himself. If 'the judge is condemned when the guilty is acquitted,' he
          is tenfold condemned when the innocent is sentenced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pilate returned to his sarcastic mood when he returned to his
          injustice, and found some satisfaction in his old jeer, 'your King.'
          But the passion of hatred was too much in earnest to be turned or even
          affected by such poor scoffs, and the only answer was the renewed roar
          of the mob, which had murder in its tone. The repetition of the
          governor's taunt, 'Shall I crucify your King?' brought out the answer
          in which the rulers of the nation in their fury blindly flung away
          their prerogative. It is no accident that it was 'the chief priests'
          who answered, 'We have no king but Caesar.' Driven by hate, they
          deliberately disown their Messianic hope, and repudiate their national
          glory. They who will not have Christ have to bow to a tyrant.
          Rebellion against Him brings slavery.
