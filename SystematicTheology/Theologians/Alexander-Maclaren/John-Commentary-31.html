        <p>'What I have written I have written.' -- JOHN xix.22.</p>
        <p>
          This was a mere piece of obstinacy. Pilate knew that he had
          prostituted his office in condemning Jesus, and he revenged himself
          for weak compliance by ill-timed mulishness. A cool-headed governor
          would have humoured his difficult subjects in such a trifle, as a just
          one would have been inflexible in a matter of life and death. But this
          man's facile yielding and his stiff-necked obstinacy were both
          misplaced. 'So I will, so I command. Let my will suffice for a
          reason,' was what he meant. He had written his gibe, and not all the
          Jews in Jewry should make him change.
        </p>
        <p>
          But his petulant answer to the rulers' request for the removal of the
          offensive placard carried in it a deeper meaning, as the Title also
          did, and as the people's fierce yell, 'His blood be on us and on our
          children,' did. Possibly the Evangelist had some thought of that sort
          in recording this saying; but, at all events, I venture to take a
          liberty with it which I should not do if it were a word of God's, or
          if it were given for our instruction. So I take it now as expressing
          in a vivid way, and irrespective of Pilate's intention, the thought of
          the irrevocable past.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Every man is perpetually writing a permanent record of himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is almost impossible to get the average man to think of his life as
          a whole, or to realise that the fleeting present leaves indelible
          traces. They seem to fade away wholly. The record appears to be
          written in water. It is written in ink which is invisible, but as
          indelible as invisible. Grammarians define the perfect tense as that
          which expresses an action completed in the past and of which the
          consequences remain in the present. That is true of all our actions.
          Our characters, our circumstances, our remembrances, are all
          permanent. Every day we make entries in our diary.
        </p>
        <p>II. That record, once written, is irrevocable.</p>
        <p>
          We all know what it is to long that some one action should have been
          otherwise, to have taken some one step which perhaps has coloured
          years, and which we would give the world not to have taken. But it
          cannot be. Remorse cannot alter it. Wishes are vain. Repentance is
          vain. A new line of conduct is vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          What an awful contrast in this respect between time future and time
          past! Think of the indefinite possibilities in the one, the rigid
          fixity of the other. Our present actions are like cements that dry
          quickly and set hard on exposure to the air -- the dirt of the trowel
          abides on the soft brick for ever. Many cuneiform inscriptions were
          impressed with a piece of wood on clay, and are legible millenniums
          after.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have to write <i>currente calamo</i>, and as soon as written, the
          MS. is printed and stereotyped, and no revising proofs nor erasures
          are possible. An action, once done, escapes from us wholly.
        </p>
        <p>
          How needful, then, to have lofty principles ready at hand! The fresco
          painter must have a sure touch, and a quick hand, and a full mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a boundless field the future offers us! How much it may be! How
          much, perhaps, we resolve it shall be! What a shrunken heap the
          harvest is! Are you satisfied with what you have written?
        </p>
        <p>III. This record, written here, is read yonder.</p>
        <p>
          Our actions carry eternal consequences. These will be read by
          ourselves. Character remains. Memory remains.
        </p>
        <p>We shall read with all illusions stripped away.</p>
        <p>Others will read -- God and a universe.</p>
        <p>
          'We shall all be <i>manifested</i> before the judgment-seat of
          Christ.'
        </p>
        <p>IV. This record may be blotted out by the blood of Christ.</p>
        <p>
          It cannot be made not to have been, but God's pardon will be given,
          and in respect to all personal consequences it is made non-existent.
          Circumstances may remain, but their pressure is different. Character
          may be renewed and sanctified, and even made loftier by the evil past.
          Our dead selves may become 'stepping-stones to higher things.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Memory may remain, but its sting is gone, and new hopes, and joys, and
          work may fill the pages of our record.
        </p>
        <p>
          'He took away the handwriting that was against us, nailing it to His
          Cross.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Our lives and characters may become a palimpsest. 'I will write upon
          him My new name.' 'Ye are an epistle of Christ ministered by us.'
