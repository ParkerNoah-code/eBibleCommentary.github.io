          'The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was
          yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the
          sepulchre. Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the
          other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken
          away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have
          laid Him. Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and
          came to the sepulchre. So they ran both together: and the other
          disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. And he
          stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went
          he not in. Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the
          sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, And the napkin, that was
          about His head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together
          in a place by itself. Then went in also that other disciple, which
          came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. For as yet they
          knew not the scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. Then
          the disciples went away again unto their own home. But Mary stood
          without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down,
          and looked into the sepulchre, And seeth two angels in white sitting,
          the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of
          Jesus had lain. And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She
          saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not
          where they have laid Him. And when she had thus said, she turned
          herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
          Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She,
          supposing Him to be the gardener, saith unto Him, Sir, if thou have
          borne Him hence, tell me where thou hast laid Him, and I will take Him
          away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto
          Him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch Me
          not; for I am not yet ascended to My Father: but go to My brethren,
          and say unto them, I ascend unto My Father, and your Father; and to My
          God, and your God. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she
          had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her.' --
          JOHN xx.1-18.
        </p>
        <p>
          John's purpose in his narrative of the resurrection is not only to
          establish the fact, but also to depict the gradual growth of faith in
          it, among the disciples. The two main incidents in this passage, the
          visit of Peter and John to the tomb and the appearance of our Lord to
          Mary, give the dawning of faith before sight and the rapturous faith
          born of sight. In the remainder of the chapter are two more instances
          of faith following vision, and the teaching of the whole is summed up
          in Christ's words to the doubter, 'Because thou hast seen Me, thou
          hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
          believed!'
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The open sepulchre and the bewildered alarm it excited. The act of
          resurrection took place before sunrise. 'At midnight,' probably, 'the
          Bridegroom came.' It was fitting that He who was to scatter the
          darkness of the grave should rise while darkness covered the earth,
          and that no eye should behold 'how' that dead was 'raised up.' The
          earthquake and the descent of angels and the rolling away of the stone
          were after the tomb was empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          John's note of time seems somewhat earlier than that of the other
          Gospels, but is not so much so as to require the supposition that Mary
          preceded the other women. She appears alone here, because the reason
          for mentioning her at all is to explain how Peter and John knew of the
          empty tomb, and she alone had been the informant. In these Eastern
          lands, 'as it began to dawn,' 'very early at the rising of the sun,'
          and 'while it was yet dark,' are times very near each other, and Mary
          may have reached the sepulchre a little before the others. Her own
          words, 'We know not,' show that she had spoken with others who had
          seen the empty grave. We must therefore suppose that she had with the
          others come to it, seen that the sacred corpse was gone and their
          spices useless, exchanged hurried words of alarm and bewilderment, and
          then had hastened away before the appearance of the angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          The impulse to tell the leaders of the forlorn band the news, which
          she thinks to be so bad, was womanly and natural. It was not hope, but
          wonder and sorrow that quickened her steps as she ran through the
          still morning to find them. Whether they were in one house or not is
          uncertain; but, at all events, Peter's denial had not cut him off from
          his brethren, and the two who were so constantly associated before and
          afterwards were not far apart that morning. The disciple who had stood
          by the Cross to almost the last had an open heart, and probably an
          open house for the denier. 'Restore such an one, ... considering
          thyself.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Mary had seen the tomb empty, and springs to the conclusion that
          'they' -- some unknown persons -- have taken away the dead body,
          which, with clinging love that tries to ignore death, she still calls
          'the Lord.' Possibly she may have thought that the resting-place in
          Joseph's new sepulchre was only meant for temporary shelter (ver.15).
          At all events the corpse was gone, and the fact suggested no hope to
          her. How often do we, in like manner, misinterpret as dark what is
          really pregnant with light, and blindly attribute to 'them' what Jesus
          does! A tone of mind thus remote from anticipation of the great fact
          is a precious proof of the historical truth of the resurrection; for
          here was no soil in which hallucinations would spring, and such people
          would not have believed Him risen unless they had seen Him living.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Peter and John at the tomb, the dawning of faith, and the
          continuance of bewildered wonder. In the account, we may observe,
          first, the characteristic conduct of each of the two. Peter is first
          to set out, and John follows, both men doing according to their kind.
          The younger runs faster than his companion. He looked into the tomb,
          and saw the wrappings lying; but the reverent awe which holds back
          finer natures kept him from venturing in. Peter is not said to have
          looked before entering. He loved with all his heart, but his love was
          impetuous and practical, and he went straight in, and felt no reason
          why he should pause. His boldness encouraged his friend, as the
          example of strong natures does. Some of my readers will recall
          Bushnell's noble sermon on 'Unconscious Influence' from this incident,
          and I need say no more about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, too, the further witness of the folded grave-clothes. John
          from outside had not seen the napkin, lying carefully rolled up apart
          from the other cloths. It was probably laid in a part of the tomb
          invisible from without. But the careful disposal of these came to him,
          when he saw them, with a great flash of illumination. There had been
          no hurried removal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here had been no hostile hands, or there would not have been this
          deliberation; nor friendly hands, or there would not have been such
          dishonour to the sacred dead as to carry away the body nude. What did
          it mean? Could He Himself have done for Himself what He had bade them
          do for Lazarus? Could He have laid aside the garments of the grave as
          needing them no more? 'They have taken away' -- what if it were not
          'they' but He? No trace of hurry or struggle was there. He did 'not go
          out with haste, nor go by flight,' but calmly, deliberately, in the
          majesty of His lordship over death, He rose from His slumber and left
          order in the land of confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, too, the birth of the Apostle's faith. John connects it with
          the sight of the folded garments. 'Believed' here must mean more than
          recognition of the fact that the grave was empty. The next clause
          seems to imply that it means belief in the resurrection. The
          scripture, which they 'knew' as scripture, was for John suddenly
          interpreted, and he was lifted out of the ignorance of its meaning,
          which till that moment he had shared with his fellow-disciples. Their
          failure to understand Christ's frequent distinct prophecies that He
          would rise again the third day has been thought incredible, but is
          surely intelligible enough if we remember how unexampled such a thing
          was, and how marvellous is our power of hearing and yet not hearing
          the plainest truth. We all in the course of our lives are lost in
          astonishment when things befall us which we have been plainly told
          will befall. The fulfilment of all divine promises (and threatenings)
          is a surprise, and no warnings beforehand teach one tithe so clearly
          as experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          John believed, but Peter still was in the dark. Again the former had
          outrun his friend. His more sensitive nature, not to say his deeper
          love -- for that would be unjust, since their love differed in quality
          more than in degree -- had gifted him with a more subtle and swifter-
          working perception. Perhaps if Peter's heart had not been oppressed by
          his sin, he would have been readier to feel the sunshine of the
          wonderful hope. We condemn ourselves to the shade when we deny our
          Lord by deed or word.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The first appearance of the Lord, and revelation of the new form
          of intercourse. Nothing had been said of Mary's return to the tomb;
          but how could she stay away? The disciples might go, but she lingered,
          woman-like, to indulge in the bitter-sweet of tears. Eyes so filled
          are more apt to see angels. No wonder that these calm watchers, in
          their garb of purity and joy, had not been seen by the two men. The
          laws of such appearance are not those of ordinary optics. Spiritual
          susceptibility and need determine who shall see angels, and who shall
          see but the empty place. Wonder and adoration held these bright forms
          there. They had hovered over the cradle and stood by the shepherds at
          Bethlehem, but they bowed in yet more awestruck reverence at the
          grave, and death revealed to them a deeper depth of divine love.
        </p>
        <p>
          The presence of angels was a trifle to Mary, who had only one thought
          -- the absence of her Lord. Surely that touch in her unmoved answer,
          as if speaking to men, is beyond the reach of art. She says 'My Lord'
          now, and 'I know not,' but otherwise repeats her former words, unmoved
          by any hope caught from John. Her clinging love needed more than an
          empty grave and folded clothes arid waiting angels to stay its tears,
          and she turned indifferently and wearily away from the interruption of
          the question to plunge again into her sorrow. Chrysostom suggests that
          she 'turned herself' because she saw in the angels' looks that they
          saw Christ suddenly appearing behind her; but the preceding
          explanation seems better. Her not knowing Jesus might be accounted for
          by her absorbing grief. One who looked at white- robed angels, and saw
          nothing extraordinary, would give but a careless glance at the
          approaching figure, and might well fail to recognise Him. But
          probably, as in the case of the two travellers to Emmaus, her 'eyes
          were holden,' and the cause of non-recognition was not so much a
          change in Jesus as an operation on her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be that as it may, it is noteworthy that His voice, which was
          immediately to reveal Him, at first suggested nothing to her; and even
          His gentle question, with the significant addition to the angels'
          words, in 'Whom seekest thou?' which indicated His knowledge that her
          tears fell for some person dear and lost, only made her think of Him
          as being 'the gardener,' and therefore probably concerned in the
          removal of the body. If He were so, He would be friendly; and so she
          ventured her pathetic petition, which does not name Jesus (so full is
          her mind of the One, that she thinks everybody must know whom she
          means), and which so overrated her own strength in saying, 'I will
          take Him away,' The first words of the risen Christ are on His lips
          yet to all sad hearts. He seeks our confidences, and would have us
          tell Him the occasions of our tears. He would have us recognise that
          all our griefs and all our desires point to one Person -- Himself --
          as the one real Object of our 'seeking,' whom finding, we need weep no
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Verse 16 tells us that Mary turned herself to see Him when He next
          spoke, so that, at the close of her first answer to Him, she must have
          once more resumed her gaze into the tomb, as if she despaired of the
          newcomer giving the help she had asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who can say anything about that transcendent recognition, in which all
          the stooping love of the risen Lord is smelted into one word, and the
          burst of rapture, awe, astonishment, and devotion pours itself through
          the narrow channel of one other? If this narrative is the work of some
          anonymous author late in the second century, he is indeed a 'Great
          Unknown,' and has managed to imagine one of the two or three most
          pathetic 'situations' in literature. Surely it is more reasonable to
          suppose him no obscure genius, but a well-known recorder of what he
          had seen, and knew for fact. Christ's calling by name ever reveals His
          loving presence. We may be sure that He knows us by name, and we
          should reply by the same swift cry of absolute submission as sprung to
          Mary's lips. 'Rabboni! Master!' is the fit answer to His call.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Mary's exclamation was imperfect in that it expressed the
          resumption of no more than the old bond, and her gladness needed
          enlightenment. Things were not to be as they had been. Christ's
          'Mary!' had indeed assured her of His faithful remembrance and of her
          present place in His love; but when she clung to His feet she was
          seeking to keep what she had to learn to give up. Therefore Jesus, who
          invited the touch which was to establish faith and banish doubt (Luke
          xxiv.39; John xx.27), bids her unclasp her hands, and gently instils
          the ending of the blessed past by opening to her the superior joys of
          the begun future. His words contain for us all the very heart of our
          possible relation to Him, and teach us that we need envy none who
          companied with Him here. His ascension to the Father is the condition
          of our truest approach to Him. His prohibition encloses a permission.
          'Touch Me not! for I am not yet ascended,' implies 'When I am, you
          may.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, the ascended Christ is still our Brother. Neither the mystery
          of death nor the impending mystery of dominion broke the tie. Again,
          the Resurrection is the beginning of Ascension, and is only then
          rightly understood when it is considered as the first upward step to
          the throne. 'I ascend,' not 'I have risen, and will soon leave you,'
          as if the Ascension only began forty days after on Olivet. It is
          already in process. Once more the ascended Christ, our Brother still,
          and capable of the touch of reverent love, is yet separated from us by
          the character, even while united to us by the fact, of His filial and
          dependent relation to God. He cannot say 'Our Father' as if standing
          on the common human ground. He is 'Son' as we are not, and we are
          'sons' through Him, and can only call God our Father because He is
          Christ's.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such were the immortal hopes and new thoughts which Mary hastened from
          the presence of her recovered Lord to bring to the disciples. Fragrant
          though but partially understood, they were like half-opened blossoms
          from the tree of life planted in the midst of that garden, to bloom
          unfading, and ever disclosing new beauty in believing hearts till the
          end of time.
