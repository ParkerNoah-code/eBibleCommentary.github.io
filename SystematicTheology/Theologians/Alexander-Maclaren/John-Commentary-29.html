          'And He bearing His cross went forth into a place called the place of
          a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: Where they crucified
          Him, and two other with Him, on either side one, and Jesus in the
          midst. And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the
          writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. This title then
          read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was
          nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.
          Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King
          of the Jews; but that He said, I am King of the Jews. Pilate answered,
          What I have written I have written. Then the soldiers, when they had
          crucified Jesus, took His garments, and made four parts, to every
          soldier a part; and also His coat: now the coat was without seam,
          woven from the top throughout. They said therefore among themselves,
          Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the
          scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted My raiment
          among them, and for My vesture they did cast lots. These things
          therefore the soldiers did. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His
          mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary
          Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple
          standing by, whom He loved, He saith unto His mother, Woman, behold
          Thy Son! Then saith He to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from
          that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. After this, Jesus
          knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture
          might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Now there was set a vessel full
          of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon
          hyssop, and put it to His mouth. When Jesus therefore had received the
          vinegar, He said, It is finished: and He bowed His head, and gave up
          the ghost.' -- JOHN xix.17-30.
        </p>
        <p>
          In great and small matters John's account adds much to the narrative
          of the crucifixion. He alone tells of the attempt to have the title on
          the Cross altered, of the tender entrusting of the Virgin to his care,
          and of the two 'words' 'I thirst' and 'It is finished.' He gives
          details which had been burned into his memory, such as Christ's
          position 'in the midst' of the two robbers, and the jar of 'vinegar'
          standing by the crosses. He says little about the act of fixing Jesus
          to the Cross, but enlarges what the other Evangelists tell as to the
          soldiers 'casting lots.' He had heard what they said to one another.
          He alone distinctly tells that when He went forth, Jesus was bearing
          the Cross which afterwards Simon of Cyrene had to carry, probably
          because our Lord's strength failed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who appointed the two robbers to be crucified at the same time? Not
          the rulers, who had no such power but probably Pilate, as one more
          shaft of sarcasm which was all the sharper both because it seemed to
          put Jesus in the same class as they, and because they were of the same
          class as the man of the Jews' choice, Barabbas, and possibly were two
          of his gang. Jesus was 'in the midst,' where He always is, completely
          identified with the transgressors, but central to all things and all
          men. As He was in the midst on the Cross, with a penitent on one hand
          and a rejecter on the other, He is still in the midst of humanity, and
          His judgment-seat will be as central as His Cross was.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the Evangelists give the title written over the Cross, but John
          alone tells that it was Pilate's malicious invention. He thought that
          he was having a final fling at the priests, and little knew how truly
          his title, which was meant as a bitter jest, was a fact. He had it put
          into the three tongues in use -- 'Hebrew,' the national tongue;
          'Greek,' the common medium of intercourse between varying
          nationalities; and 'Latin' the official language. He did not know that
          he was proclaiming the universal dominion of Jesus, and prophesying
          that wisdom as represented by Greece, law and imperial power as
          represented by Rome, and all previous revelation as represented by
          Israel, would yet bow before the Crucified, and recognise that His
          Cross was His throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'high-priests' winced, and would fain have had the title altered.
          Their wish once more denied Jesus, and added to their condemnation,
          but it did not move Pilate. It would have been well for him if he had
          been as firm in carrying out his convictions of justice as in abiding
          by his bitter jest. He was obstinate in the wrong place, partly
          because he was angry with the rulers, and partly to recover his self-
          respect, which had been damaged by his vacillation. But his stiff-
          necked speech had a more tragic meaning than he knew, for 'what he had
          written' on his own life-page on that day could never be erased, and
          will confront him. We are all writing an imperishable record, and we
          shall have to read it out hereafter, and acknowledge our handwriting.
        </p>
        <p>
          John next sets in strong contrast the two groups round the Cross --
          the stolid soldiers and the sad friends. The four legionaries went
          through their work as a very ordinary piece of military duty. They
          were well accustomed to crucify rebel Jews, and saw no difference
          between these three and former prisoners. They watched the pangs
          without a touch of pity, and only wished that death might come soon,
          and let them get back to their barracks. How blind men may be to what
          they are gazing at! If knowledge measures guilt, how slight the
          culpability of the soldiers! They were scarcely more guilty than the
          mallet and nails which they used. The Sufferer's clothes were their
          perquisite, and their division was conducted on cool business
          principles, and with utter disregard of the solemn nearness of death.
          Could callous indifference go further than to cast lots for the robe
          at the very foot of the Cross?
        </p>
        <p>
          But the thing that most concerns us here is that Jesus submitted to
          that extremity of shame and humiliation, and hung there naked for all
          these hours, gazed on, while the light lasted, by a mocking crowd. He
          had set the perfect Pattern of lowly self-abnegation when, amid the
          disciples in the upper room, He had 'laid aside His garments,' but now
          He humbles Himself yet more, being clothed only 'with shame.'
          Therefore should we clothe Him with hearts' love. Therefore God has
          clothed Him with the robes of imperial majesty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another point emphasised by John is the fulfilment of prophecy in this
          act. The seamless robe, probably woven by loving hands, perhaps by
          some of the weeping women who stood there, was too valuable to divide,
          and it would be a moment's pastime to cast lots for it. John saw, in
          the expedient naturally suggested to four rough men, who all wanted
          the robe but did not want to quarrel over it, a fulfilment of the cry
          of the ancient sufferer, who had lamented that his enemies made so
          sure of his death that they divided his garments and cast lots for his
          vesture. But he was 'wiser than he knew,' and, while his words were to
          his own apprehension but a vivid metaphor expressing his desperate
          condition, 'the Spirit which was in' him 'did signify' by them 'the
          sufferings of Christ.' Theories of prophecy or sacrifice which deny
          the correctness of John's interpretation have the New Testament
          against them, and assume to know more about the workings of
          inspiration than is either modest or scientific.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a contrast the other group presents! John's enumeration of the
          women may be read so as to mention four or three, according as 'His
          mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas,' is taken to mean one
          woman or two. The latter is the more probable supposition, and it is
          also probable that the unnamed sister of our Lord's mother was no
          other than Salome, John's own mother. If so, entrusting Mary to John's
          care would be the more natural. Tender care, joined with consciousness
          that henceforth the relation of son and mother was to be supplanted,
          not merely by Death's separating fingers, but by faith's uniting bond,
          breathed through the word, so loving yet so removing, 'Woman, behold
          thy son!' Dying trust in the humble friend, which would go far to make
          the friend worthy of it, breathed in the charge, to which no form of
          address corresponding to 'Woman' is prefixed. Jesus had nothing else
          to give as a parting gift, but He gave these two to each other, and
          enriched both. He showed His own loving heart, and implied His
          faithful discharge of all filial duties hitherto. And He taught us the
          lesson, which many of us have proved to be true, that losses are best
          made up when we hear Him pointing us by them to new offices of help to
          others, and that, if we will let Him, He will point us too to what
          will fill empty places in our hearts and homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second of the words on the Cross which we owe to John is that
          pathetic expression, 'I thirst.' Most significant is the insight into
          our Lord's consciousness which John, here as elsewhere, ventures to
          give. Not till He knew 'that all things were accomplished' did He give
          heed to the pangs of thirst, which made so terrible a part of the
          torture of crucifixion. The strong will kept back the bodily cravings
          so long as any unfulfilled duty remained. Now Jesus had nothing to do
          but to die, and before He died He let flesh have one little
          alleviation. He had refused the stupefying draught which would have
          lessened suffering by dulling consciousness, but He asked for the
          draught which would momentarily slake the agony of parched lips and
          burning throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words of verse 28 are not to be taken as meaning that Jesus said
          'I thirst' with the mere intention of fulfilling the Scripture. His
          utterance was the plaint of a real need, not a performance to fill a
          part. But it is John who sees in that wholly natural cry the
          fulfilment of the psalm (Ps. lxix.21). All Christ's bodily sufferings
          may be said to be summed up in this one word, the only one in which
          they found utterance. The same lips that said, 'If any man thirst, let
          him come unto Me, and drink,' said this. Infinitely pathetic in
          itself, that cry becomes almost awful in its appeal to us when we
          remember who uttered it, and why He bore these pangs. The very
          'Fountain of living water' knew the pang of thirst that every one that
          thirsteth might come to the waters, and might drink, not water only,
          but 'wine and milk, without money or price.'
        </p>
        <p>
          John's last contribution to our knowledge of our Lord's words on the
          Cross is that triumphant 'It is finished,' wherein there spoke, not
          only the common dying consciousness of life being ended, but the
          certitude, which He alone of all who have died, or will die, had the
          right to feel and utter, that every task was completed, that all God's
          will was accomplished, all Messiah's work done, all prophecy
          fulfilled, redemption secured, God and man reconciled. He looked back
          over all His life and saw no failure, no falling below the demands of
          the occasion, nothing that could have been bettered, nothing that
          should not have been there. He looked upwards, and even at that moment
          He heard in His soul the voice of the Father saying, 'This is My
          beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased!'
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ's work is finished. It needs no supplement. It can never be
          repeated or imitated while the world lasts, and will not lose its
          power through the ages. Let us trust to it as complete for all our
          needs, and not seek to strengthen 'the sure foundation' which it has
          laid by any shifting, uncertain additions of our own. But we may
          remember, too, that while Christ's work is, in one aspect, finished,
          when He bowed His head, and by His own will 'gave up the ghost,' in
          another aspect His work is not finished, nor will be, until the whole
          benefits of His incarnation and death are diffused through, and
          appropriated by, the world. He is working to-day, and long ages have
          yet to pass, in all probability, before the voice of Him that sitteth
          on the throne shall say 'It is done!'
