          'And after this Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but
          secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away
          the body of Jesus; ... And there came also Nicodemus which at the
          first came to Jesus by night.' -- JOHN xix.38, 39.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Christ lived, these two men had been unfaithful to their
          convictions; but His death, which terrified and paralysed and
          scattered His avowed disciples, seems to have shamed and stung them
          into courage. They came now, when they must have known that it was too
          late, to lavish honour and tears on the corpse of the Master whom they
          had been too cowardly to acknowledge, whilst acknowledgment might yet
          have availed. How keen an arrow of self-condemnation must have pierced
          their hearts as they moved in their offices of love, which they
          thought that He could never know, round His dead corpse!
        </p>
        <p>
          They were both members of the Sanhedrim; the same motives, no doubt,
          had withheld each of them from confessing Christ; the same impulses
          united them in this too late confession of discipleship. Nicodemus had
          had the conviction, at the beginning of Christ's ministry, that He was
          at least a miraculously attested and God-sent Teacher. But the fear
          which made him steal to Jesus by night -- the unenviable distinction
          which the Evangelist pitilessly reiterates at each mention of him --
          arrested his growth and kept him dumb when silence was treason. Joseph
          of Arimathea is described by two of the Evangelists as 'a disciple';
          by the other two as a devout Israelite, like Simeon and Anna, 'waiting
          for the Kingdom of God.' Luke informs us that he had not concurred in
          the condemnation of Jesus, but leads us to believe that his dissent
          had been merely silent. Perhaps he was more fully convinced than
          Nicodemus, and at the same time even more timid in avowing his
          convictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may take these two contrite cowards as they try to atone for their
          unfaithfulness to their living Master by their ministrations to Him
          dead, as examples of secret disciples, and see here the causes, the
          misery, and the cure of such.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Let us look at them as illustrations of secret discipleship and its
          causes.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were restrained from the avowal of the Messiahship of Jesus by
          fear. There is nothing in the organisation of society at this day to
          make any man afraid of avowing the ordinary kind of Christianity which
          satisfies the most of us; rather it is the proper thing with the bulk
          of us middle-class people, to say that in some sense or other we are
          Christians. But when it comes to a real avowal, a real carrying out of
          a true discipleship, there are as many and as formidable, though very
          different, impediments in the way to-day, from those which blocked the
          path of these two cowards in our text. In all regions of life it is
          hard to work out into practice any moral conviction whatever. How many
          of us are there who have beliefs about social and moral questions
          which we are ashamed to avow in certain companies for fear of the
          finger of ridicule being pointed at us? It is not only in the Church,
          and in reference to purely religious belief, that we find the curse of
          secret discipleship, but it is everywhere. Wherever there are moral
          questions which are yet the subject of controversy, and have not been
          enthroned with the hallelujahs of all men, you get people that carry
          their convictions shut up in their own breasts, and lock their lips in
          silence, when there is most need of frank avowal. The political,
          social, and moral conflicts of this day have their 'secret disciples,'
          who will only come out of their holes when the battle is over, and
          will then shout with the loudest.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to turn to the more immediate subject before us, how many men and
          women, I wonder, are there who ought to be and are not, distinctly and
          openly united with the Christian community?
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not mean to say -- God forbid that I should -- that connection
          with any existing church is the same as a connection with Jesus
          Christ, or that the neglect to be so associated is tantamount to
          secret discipleship; I know there are plenty of other ways of
          acknowledging Him than that, but I am quite sure that this is one
          department in which a large number of men, in all our congregations --
          and there are not a few in this congregation -- need a very plain word
          of earnest remonstrance. It is one way of manifesting whose you are,
          that you should unite yourselves openly with those who belong to Him,
          and who try to serve Him. I do not dwell upon this matter, because I
          do not wish to be misunderstood, as if I supposed that union to a
          church is equivalent to union with Him; or that a connection with a
          church is the only, or even the principal way of making an open avowal
          of Christian principle; but I am certain that amongst us in this day
          there is a laxity in this matter which is doing harm both to the
          Church and to some of you. Therefore I say to you, dear friends,
          suffer the word of exhortation as to the duty of openly uniting
          yourselves with the Christian community.
        </p>
        <p>
          But far higher and more important than that -- do you ever say anyhow
          that you belong to Jesus Christ? In a society like ours, in which the
          influence of Christian morality affects a great many people who have
          no personal connection with Him, it is not always enough that the life
          should preach, because over a very large field of ordinary daily life
          the underground influence, so to speak, of Christian ethics has
          infiltrated and penetrated, so that many a tree bears a greener leaf
          because of the water that has found its way to it from the river,
          though it be planted far from its banks. Even those who are not
          Christians live outward lives largely regulated by Christian
          principle. The whole level of morality has been heaved up, as the
          coastline has sometimes been by hidden fires slowly working, by the
          imperceptible, gradual influence of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it needs sometimes that you should <i>say</i> 'I am a Christian,'
          as well as that you should live like one. Ask yourselves, dear
          friends! whether you have buttoned your greatcoat over your uniform
          that nobody may know whose soldier you are. Ask yourselves whether you
          have sometimes held your tongues because you knew that if you spoke
          people would find out where you came from and what country you
          belonged to. Ask yourselves, Have you ever accompanied the witness of
          your lives with the commentary of your confession? Did you ever,
          anywhere but in a church, stand up and say, 'I believe in Jesus
          Christ, His only Son, <i>my</i> Lord'?
        </p>
        <p>
          And then ask yourselves another question: Have you ever dared to be
          singular? We are all of us in this world often thrust into
          circumstances in which it is needful that we should say, 'So do not I
          because of the fear of the Lord.' Boys go to school; they used always
          to kneel down at their bedsides and say their prayers when they were
          at home. They do not like to do it with all those critical and cruel
          eyes -- and there are no eyes more critical and more cruel than young
          eyes -- fixed upon them, and so they give up prayer. A young man comes
          to Manchester, goes into a warehouse, pure of life, and with a tongue
          that has not blossomed into rank fruit of obscenity and blasphemy. And
          he hears, at the next desk there, words that first of all bring a
          blush to his cheek, and he is tempted into conduct that he knows to be
          a denial of his Master. And he covers up his principles, and goes with
          the tempters into the evil. I might sketch a dozen other cases, but I
          need not. In one form or other, we have all to go through the same
          ordeal. We have sometimes to dare to be in a minority of one, if we
          will not be untrue to our Master and to ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the reasons for this unfaithfulness to conviction and to Christ,
          are put by the Apostle here in a very blunt fashion -- 'For fear of
          the Jews.' That is not what we say to ourselves; some of us say, 'Oh!
          I have got beyond outward organisations. I find it enough to be united
          to Christ. The Christian communities are very imperfect. There is not
          any of them that I quite see eye to eye with. So I stand apart,
          contemplating all, and happy in my unsectarianism.' Yes, I quite admit
          the faults, and suppose that as long as men think at all they will not
          find any Church which is entirely to their mind; and I rejoice to
          think that some day we shall all outgrow visible organisations -- when
          we get there where the seer 'saw no temple therein.' Admitting all
          that, I also know that isolation is always weakness, and that if a man
          stand apart from the wholesome friction of his brethren, he will get
          to be a great diseased mass of oddities, of very little use either to
          himself, or to men, or to God. It is not a good thing, on the whole,
          that people should fight for their own hands, and the wisest thing any
          of us can do is, preserving our freedom of opinion, to link ourselves
          with some body of Christian people, and to find in them our shelter
          and our home.
        </p>
        <p>
          But these two in our text were moved by 'fear.' They dreaded ridicule,
          the loss of position, the expulsion from Sanhedrim and synagogue,
          social ostracism, and all the armoury of offensive weapons which would
          have been used against them by their colleagues. So, ignobly they kept
          their thumb on their convictions, and the two of them sat dumb in the
          council when the scornful question was asked, 'Have any of the rulers
          or of the Pharisees believed on Him?' when they ought to have started
          to their feet and said 'Yes, we have!' And when Nicodemus ventured a
          feeble remonstrance, which he carefully divested of all appearance of
          personal sympathy, and put upon the mere abstract ground of fair play
          -- 'Doth our law judge any man before it hear him?' -- one
          contemptuous question was enough to reduce him to silence. 'Art thou
          also of Galilee?' was enough to cow him into dropping his timid plea
          for Him whom in his heart he believed to be the Messiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          So with us, the fear of loss of position comes into play. I have heard
          of people who settled the congregation which they should honour by
          their presence from the consideration of the social advantages which
          it offered. I have heard of their saying, 'Oh! we cannot attach
          ourselves to such and such a community; there is no society for the
          children.' Then many of us are very much afraid of being laughed at.
          Ridicule, I think, to sensitive people in a generation like ours, is
          pretty nearly as bad as the old rack and the physical torments of
          martyrdom. We have all got so nervous and high-strung nowadays, and
          depend so much upon other people's good opinion, that it is a dreadful
          thing to be ridiculed. Timid people do not come to the front and say
          what they believe, and take up unpopular causes, because they cannot
          bear to be pointed at and pelted with the abundant epithets of
          disparagement, which are always flung at earnest people who will not
          worship at the appointed shrines, and have sturdy convictions of their
          own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ridicule breaks no bones. It has no power if you make up your mind
          that it shall not have. Face it, and it will only be unpleasant for a
          moment at first. When a child goes into the sea to bathe, he is
          uncomfortable till his head has been fairly under water, and then
          after that he is all right. So it is with the ridicule which out-and-
          out Christian faithfulness may bring on us. It only hurts at the
          beginning, and people very soon get tired. Face your fears and they
          will pass away. It is not perhaps a good advice to give
          unconditionally, but it is a very good one in regard of all moral
          questions -- always do what you are afraid to do. In nine cases out of
          ten it will be the right thing to do. If people would only discount
          'the fear of men which bringeth a snare' by making up their minds to
          neglect it, there would be fewer 'dumb dogs' and 'secret disciples'
          haunting and weakening the Church of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I have spent too much time upon this part of my subject, and I
          must deal briefly with the following. Let me say a word about the
          illustrations that we have in this text of the miseries of this secret
          discipleship.
        </p>
        <p>
          How much these two men lost -- all those three years of communion with
          the Master; all His teaching, all the stimulus of His example, all the
          joy of fellowship with Him! They might have had a treasure in their
          memories that would have enriched them for all their days, and they
          had flung it all away because they were afraid of the curled lip of a
          long-bearded Pharisee or two.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so it always is; the secret disciple diminishes his communion with
          his Master. It is the valleys which lay their bosoms open to the sun
          that rejoice in the light and warmth; the narrow clefts in the rocks
          that shut themselves grudgingly up against the light, are all dank and
          dark and dismal. And it is the men that come and avow their
          discipleship that will have the truest communion with their Lord. Any
          neglected duty puts a film between a man and his Saviour; any
          conscious neglect of duty piles up a wall between you and Christ. Be
          sure of this, that if from cowardly or from selfish regard to position
          and advantages, or any other motive, we stand apart from Him, and have
          our lips locked when we ought to speak, there will steal over our
          hearts a coldness, His face will be averted from us, and our eyes will
          not dare to seek, with the same confidence and joy, the light of His
          countenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          What you lose by unfaithful wrapping of your convictions in a napkin
          and burying them in the ground is the joyful use of the convictions,
          the deeper hold of the truth by which you live, and before which you
          bow, and the true fellowship with the Master whom you acknowledge and
          confess. And when these men came for Christ's corpse and bore it away,
          what a sharp pang went through their hearts! They woke at last to know
          what cowardly traitors they had been. If you are a disciple at all,
          and a secret one, you will awake to know what you have been doing, and
          the pang will be a sharp one. If you do not awake in this life, then
          the distance between you and your Lord will become greater and
          greater; if you do, then it will be a sad reflection that there are
          years of treason lying behind you. Nicodemus and Joseph had the veil
          torn away by the contemplation of their dead Master. You may have the
          veil torn away from your eyes by the sight of the throned Lord; and
          when you pass into the heavens may even there have some sharp pang of
          condemnation when you reflect how unfaithful you have been.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blessed be His name! The assurance is firm that if a man be a disciple
          he shall be saved; but the warning is sure that if he be an unfaithful
          and a secret disciple there will be a life-long unfaithfulness to a
          beloved Master to be purged away 'so as by fire.'
        </p>
        <p>III. And so, lastly, let me point you to the cure.</p>
        <p>
          These men learned to be ashamed of their cowardice, and their dumb
          lips learned to speak, and their shy, hidden love forced for itself a
          channel by which it could flow out into the light; because of Christ's
          death. And in another fashion that same death and Cross are for us,
          too, the cure of all cowardice and selfish silence. The sight of
          Christ's Cross makes the coward brave. It was no small piece of
          courage for Joseph to go to Pilate and avow his sympathy with a
          condemned criminal. The love must have been very true which was forced
          to speak by disaster and death. And to us the strongest motive for
          stiffening our vacillating timidity into an iron fortitude, and
          fortifying us strongly against the fear of what man can do to us, is
          to be found in gazing upon His dying love who met and conquered all
          evils and terrors for our sakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          That Cross will kindle a love which will not rest concealed, but will
          be 'like the ointment of the right hand which bewrayeth itself.' I can
          fancy men to whom Christ is only what He was to Nicodemus at first, 'a
          Teacher sent from God,' occupying Nicodemus' position of hidden belief
          in His teaching without feeling any need to avow themselves His
          followers; but if once into our souls there has come the constraining
          and the melting influence of that great and wondrous love which died
          for us, then, dear brethren, it is unnatural that we should be silent.
          If those 'for whom Christ has died' should hold their peace, 'the
          stones would immediately cry out.' That death, wondrous, mysterious,
          terrible, but radiant, and glorious with hope, with pardon, with
          holiness for us and for all the world -- that death smites on the
          chords of our hearts, if I may so speak, and brings out music from
          them all. The love that died for me will force me to express my love,
          'Then shall the tongue of the dumb sing,' and silence will be
          impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sight of the Cross not only leads to courage, and kindles a love
          which demands expression, but it impels to joyful surrender. Joseph
          gave a place in his own new tomb, where he hoped that one day his
          bones should be laid by the side of the Master against whom he had
          sinned -- for he had no thought of a resurrection. Nicodemus brought a
          lavish, almost an extravagant, amount of costly spices, as if by
          honour to the dead he could atone for treason to the living. And both
          the one and the other teach us that if once we gain the true vision of
          that great and wondrous love that died on the Cross for us, then the
          natural language of the loving heart is --
        </p>
        <p>
          'Here, Lord! I give <i>myself</i> away;<br />'Tis all that I can do.'
        </p>
        <p>
          If following Him openly involves sacrifices, the sacrifices will be
          sweet, so long as our hearts look to His dying love. All love delights
          in expression, and most of all in expression by surrender of precious
          things, which are most precious because they give love materials which
          it may lay at the beloved's feet. What are position, possessions,
          reputation, capacities, perils, losses, self, but the 'sweet spices'
          which we are blessed enough to be able to lay upon the altar which
          glorifies the Giver and the gift? The contemplation of Christ's
          sacrifice -- and that alone -- will so overcome our natural
          selfishness as to make sacrifice for His dear sake most blessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I beseech you, then, look ever to Him dying on the Cross for each of
          us. It will kindle our courage, it will make our hearts glow with
          love, it will turn our silence into melody and music of praise; it
          will lead us to heights of consecration and joys of confession; and so
          it will bring us at last into the possession of that wondrous honour
          which He promised when He said, 'He that confesseth Me before men, him
          will I also confess; and he that denieth Me before men, him will I
          also deny.'
        </p>
