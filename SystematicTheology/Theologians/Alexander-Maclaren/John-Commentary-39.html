          'And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of His
          disciples, which are not written in this book: But these are written,
          that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and
          that believing ye might have life through His name.' -- JOHN XX.30,
          31.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident that these words were originally the close of this
          Gospel, the following chapter being an appendix, subsequently added by
          the writer himself. In them we have the Evangelist's own
          acknowledgment of the incompleteness of his Gospel, and his own
          statement of the purpose which he had in view in composing it. That
          purpose was first of all a doctrinal one, and he tells us that in
          carrying it out he omitted many things that he could have put in if he
          had chosen. But that doctrinal purpose was subordinate to a still
          further aim. His object was not only to present the truth that Jesus
          was the Christ, the Son of God, but to present it in such a way as to
          induce his readers to believe in that Christ. And he desired that they
          might have faith in order that they might have life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it is a very good old canon in judging of a book that 'in every
          work' we are to 'regard the writer's end,' and if that simple
          principle had been applied to this Gospel, a great many of the
          features in it which have led to some difficulty would have been seen
          to be naturally explained by the purpose which the Evangelist had in
          view.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this text may be applied very much more widely than to John's
          Gospel. We may use it to point our thoughts to the strange silences
          and incompletenesses of the whole of Revelation, and to the
          explanation of these incompletenesses by the consideration of the
          purpose which it all had in view. In that sense I desire to look at
          these words before us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, we have here set forth the incompleteness of
          Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take this Gospel first. Anybody who looks at it can see that it is a
          fragment. It is not meant to be a biography; it is avowedly a
          selection, and a selection under the influence, as I shall have to
          show you presently, of a distinct dogmatic purpose. There is nothing
          in it about Christ's birth, nothing in it about His baptism, nor about
          His selection of His Apostles. There is scarcely anything about the
          facts of His outward life at all. There is scarcely a word about the
          whole of His ministry in Galilee. There is not one of His parables,
          there are only seven of His miracles before the Resurrection, and two
          of these occur also in the other Evangelists. There is scarcely any of
          His ethical teaching; there is not a word about the Lord's Supper.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so I might go on enumerating many remarkable gaps in this Gospel.
          Nearly half of it is taken up with the incidents of one week at the
          end of His life, and the incidents of and after the Resurrection. Of
          the remainder-by far the larger portion consists of several
          conversations which are hung upon miracles that seem to be related
          principally for the sake of these. The whole of the phenomena show us
          at once the fragmentary character of this Gospel as stamped upon the
          very surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when we turn to the other three, the same thing is true, though
          less strikingly so. Why was it that in the Church, after the
          completion of the Scriptural canon, there sprang up a whole host of
          Apocryphal Gospels, full of childish stories of events which people
          felt had been passed over with strange silence, in the teachings of
          the four Evangelists: stories of His childhood, for instance, and
          stories about what happened between His death and His resurrection? A
          great many miracles were added to those that have been told us in
          Scripture. The condensed hints of the canonical Gospels received a
          great expansion, which indicated how much their silence about certain
          points had been felt. What a tiny pamphlet they make! Is it not
          strange that the greatest event in the world's history should be told
          in such brief outline, and that here, too, the mustard seed, 'less
          than the least of all seeds,' should have become such a great tree?
          Put the four Gospels down by the side of the two thick octavo volumes,
          which it is the regulation thing to write nowadays, as the biography
          of any man that has a name at all, and you will feel their
          incompleteness as biographies. They are but a pen-and-ink drawing of
          the Sun! And yet, although they be so tiny that you might sit down and
          read them all in an evening over the fire, is it not strange that they
          have stamped on the mind of the world an image so deep and so sharp,
          of such a character as the world never saw elsewhere? They are
          fragments, but they have left a symmetrical and an unique impression
          on the consciousness of the whole world.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, if you turn to the whole Book, the same thing is true,
          though in a modified sense there. I have no time to dwell upon that
          fruitful field, but the silence of Scripture is quite as eloquent as
          its speech. Think, for instance, of how many things in the Bible are
          taken for granted which one would not expect to be taken for granted
          in a book of religious instruction. It takes for granted the being of
          a God. It takes for granted our relations to Him. It takes for granted
          our moral nature. In its later portions, at all events, it takes for
          granted the future life. Look at how the Bible, as a whole, passes by,
          without one word of explanation or alleviation, a great many of the
          difficulties which gather round some of its teaching. For instance, we
          find no attempt to explain the divine nature of our Lord; or the
          existence of the three Persons in the Godhead. It has not a word to
          say in explanation of the mystery of prayer; or of the difficulty of
          reconciling the Omnipotent will of God on the one hand, with our own
          free will on the other. It has not a word to explain, though many a
          word to proclaim and enforce, the fact of Christ's death as the
          atonement for the sins of the whole world. Observe, too, how scanty
          the information on points on which the heart craves for more light.
          How closely, for instance, the veil is kept over the future life! How
          many questions which are not prompted by mere curiosity, our sorrow
          and our love ask in vain!
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is the incompleteness of Scripture as a historical book less
          marked. Nations and men appear on its pages abruptly, rending the
          curtain of oblivion, and striding to the front of the stage for a
          moment, and then they disappear, swallowed up of night. It has no care
          to tell the stories of any of its heroes, except for so long as they
          were the organs of that divine breath, which, breathed through the
          weakest reed, makes music. The self-revelation of God, not the acts
          and fortunes of even His noblest servants, is the theme of the Book.
          It is full of gaps about matters that any sciolist or philosopher or
          theologian would have filled up for it. There it stands, a Book unique
          in the world's history, unique in what it says, and no less unique in
          what it does not say.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Many other things truly did' that divine Spirit in His march through
          the ages, 'which are not written in this book; but these are written
          that ye might believe.'
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And so that brings me next to say a word or two about the more
          immediate purpose which explains all these gaps and incompletenesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          John's Gospel, and the other three Gospels, and the whole Bible, New
          Testament and Old, have this for their purpose, to produce in men's
          hearts the faith in Jesus as 'the Christ' and as 'the Son of God.'
        </p>
        <p>
          I need not speak at length about this one Gospel with any special
          regard to that thought. I have already said that the Evangelist avows
          that his work is a selection, that he declares that the purpose that
          determined his selection was doctrinal, and that he picked out facts
          which would tend to represent Jesus Christ to us in the twofold
          capacity, -- as the Christ, the Fulfiller of all the expectations and
          promises of the Old Covenant, and as the Son of God. The one of these
          titles is a name of office, the other a name of nature; the one
          declares that He had come to be, and to do, all to which types and
          prophecies and promises had dimly pointed, and the other declares that
          He was 'the Eternal Word,' which 'in the beginning was with God and
          was God,' and was manifest here upon earth to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was his purpose, and this representation of Jesus Christ is that
          which shapes all the facts and all the phenomena of this Gospel, from
          the very first words of it to its close.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, although it is wide from my present subject, I may just make
          one parenthetical remark, to the effect that it is ridiculous in the
          face of this statement for 'critics' to say, as some of them do: 'The
          author of the fourth Gospel has not told us this, that, and the other
          incident in Christ's life, therefore, he did not know it.' Then some
          of them will draw the conclusion that John's Gospel is not to be
          trusted in the given case, because he does not give us a certain
          incident, and others might draw the conclusion that the other three
          Evangelists are not to be trusted because they do give it us. And the
          whole fabric is built up upon a blunder, and would have been avoided
          if people had listened when John said to them: 'I knew a great many
          things about Jesus Christ, but I did not put them down here because I
          was not writing a biography, but preaching a gospel; and what I wanted
          to proclaim was that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.'
        </p>
        <p>
          But now we may extend that a great deal further. It is just as true
          about the whole New Testament. The four Gospels are written to tell us
          these two facts about Christ. They are none of them merely
          biographies; as such they are singularly deficient, as we have seen.
          But they are biographies <i>plus</i> a doctrine; and the biography is
          told mainly for the sake of carrying this twofold truth into men's
          understandings and hearts, that Jesus is, first of all, the Christ,
          and second, the Son of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then comes the rest of the New Testament, which is nothing more
          than the working out of the theoretical and practical consequence of
          these great truths. All the Epistles, the Book of Revelation, and the
          history of the Church, as embodied in the Acts of the Apostles, -- all
          these are but the consequences of that fundamental truth; and the
          whole of Scripture in its later portions is but the drawing of the
          inferences and the presenting of the duties that flow from the facts
          that 'Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.'
        </p>
        <p>
          And what about the Old Testament? Why, this about it: that whatever
          may be the conclusion as to the date and authorship of any of the
          books in it, -- and I am not careful to contend about these at
          present; -- and whatever a man may believe about the verbal prophecies
          which most of us recognise there, -- there is stamped unmistakably
          upon the whole system, of which the Old Testament is the record, an
          onward-looking attitude. It is all anticipatory of 'good things to
          come,' and of a Person who will bring them. Sacrifice, sacred offices,
          such as priesthood and kingship, and the whole history of Israel, have
          their faces turned to the future. 'They that went before, and they
          that followed after, cried |Hosanna! Blessed be He that cometh in the
          name of the Lord!|' This Christ towers up above the history of the
          world and the process of revelation, like Mount Everest among the
          Himalayas. To that great peak all the country on the one side runs
          upwards, and from it all the valleys on the other descend; and the
          springs are born there which carry verdure and life over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ, the Son of God, is the centre of Scripture; and the Book --
          whatever be the historical facts about its origin, its authorship, and
          the date of the several portions of which it is composed -- the Book
          is a unity, because there is driven right through it, like a core of
          gold, either in the way of prophecy and onward-looking anticipation,
          or in the way of history and grateful retrospect, the reference to the
          one 'Name that is above every name,' the name of the Christ, the Son
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And all its incompleteness, its fragmentariness, its carelessness
          about persons, are intended, as are the slight parts in a skilful
          artist's handiwork, to emphasise the beauty and the sovereignty of
          that one central Figure on which all lights are concentrated, and on
          which the painter has lavished all the resources of his art. So God --
          for <i>God</i> is the Author of the Bible -- on this great canvas has
          painted much in sketchy outline, and left much unfilled in, that every
          eye may be fixed on the central Figure, the Christ of God, on whose
          head comes down the Dove, and round whom echoes the divine
          declaration: 'This is My Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.'
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is not merely in order to represent Jesus as the Christ of God
          that these things are written, but it is that that representation may
          become the object of our faith. If the intention of Scripture had been
          simply to establish the fact that Jesus was the Christ and the Son of
          God, it might have been done in a very different fashion. A
          theological treatise would have been enough to do that. But if the
          object be that men should not only accept with their understandings
          the truth concerning Christ's office and nature, but that their hearts
          should go out to Him, and that they should rest their sinful souls
          upon Him <i>as</i> the Son of God and the Christ, then there is no
          other way to accomplish that, but by the history of His life and the
          manifestation of His heart. If the object were simply to make us know
          about Christ, we do not need a Book like this; but if the object is to
          lead us to put our faith in Him, then we must have what we have here,
          the infinitely touching and tender Figure of Jesus Christ Himself, set
          before us in all its sweetness and beauty as He lived and moved and
          died for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, dear friends, let me put one last word here about this part of
          my subject. If this be the purpose of Scripture, then let us learn on
          the one hand the wretched insufficiency of a mere orthodox creed, and
          let us learn on the other hand the equal insufficiency of a mere
          creedless emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the purpose of Scripture, in these Gospels, and all its parts, is
          that we should believe 'that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,'
          that purpose is not accomplished when we simply yield our
          understanding to that truth and accept it as a great many people do.
          That was much more the fault of the last generation than of this,
          though many of us may still make the mistake of supposing that we are
          Christians because we idly assent to -- or, at least, do not deny, and
          so fancy that we accept -- Christian truth. But, as Luther says in one
          of his rough figures, 'Human nature is like a drunken peasant; if you
          put him up on the horse on the one side, he is sure to tumble down on
          the other.' And so the reaction from the heartless, unpractical
          orthodoxy of half a century ago has come with a vengeance to-day, when
          everybody is saying, 'Oh! give me a Christianity without dogma!' Well,
          I say that too, about a great many of the metaphysical subtleties
          which have been called Doctrinal Christianity. But this doctrine of
          the nature and office of Jesus Christ cannot be given up, and the
          Christianity which Christ and His Apostles taught be retained. Do you
          believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God? Do you trust your
          soul to Him in these characters? If you do, I think we can shake
          hands. If you do not, Scripture has failed to do its work on you, and
          you have not reached the point which all God's lavish revelation has
          been expended on the world that you and all men might attain.
        </p>
        <p>III. Now, lastly, notice the ultimate purpose of the whole.</p>
        <p>
          Scripture is not given to us merely to make us know something about
          God in Christ, nor only in order that we may have faith in the Christ
          thus revealed to us, but for a further end -- great, glorious, but,
          blessed be His Name! not distant -- namely, that we may 'have life in
          His name.' 'Life' is deep, mystical, inexplicable by any other words
          than itself. It includes pardon, holiness, well-being, immortality,
          Heaven; but it is more than they all.
        </p>
        <p>
          This life comes into our dead hearts and quickens them by union with
          God. That which is joined to God lives. Each being according to its
          nature, is, on condition of the divine power acting upon it. This bit
          of wood upon which I put my hand, and the hand which I put upon it,
          would equally crumble into nothingness if they were separated from
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can separate your wills and your spiritual nature from Him, and
          thus separated you are 'dead in trespasses and in sins.' And, O
          brother! the message comes to you: there is life in that great Christ,
          'in His name'; that is to say, in that revealed character of His by
          which He is made known to us as the Christ and the Son of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Union with Him in His Sonship will bring life into dead hearts. He is
          the true 'Prometheus' who has come from Heaven with 'fire,' the fire
          of the divine Life in the 'reed' of His humanity, and He imparts it to
          us all if we will. He lays Himself upon us, as the prophet laid
          himself on the little child in the upper chamber; and lip to lip, and
          beating heart to dead heart, He touches our death, and it is quickened
          into life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The condition on which that great Name will bring to us life is simply
          our faith. Do you believe in Him, and trust yourself to Him, as He who
          came to fulfil all that prophet, priest, and king, sacrifice, altar,
          and Temple of old times prophesied and looked for? Do you trust in Him
          as the Son of God who comes down to earth that we in Him might find
          the immortal life which He is ready to give? If you do, then, dear
          brethren! the end that God has in view in all His revelation, that
          Christ had in view in His bitter Passion, has been accomplished for
          you. If you do not it has not. You may admire Him, you may think
          loftily of Him, you may be ready to call Him by many great and
          appreciative names, but Oh! unless you have learned to see in Him the
          divine Saviour of your souls, you have not seen what God means you to
          see.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you have, then all other questions about this Book, important
          as they are in their places, may settle themselves as they will; you
          have got the kernel, the thing that it was meant to bring you. Many an
          erudite scholar, who has studied the Bible all his life, has missed
          the purpose for which it was given; and many a poor old woman in her
          garret has found it. It is not meant to wrangle over, it is not meant
          to be read as an interesting product of the religious consciousness,
          it is not to be admired as all that remains of the literature of a
          nation that had a genius for religion; but it is to be taken as being
          God's great Word to the world, the record of the revelation that He
          has given us in His Son. The Eternal Word is the theme of all the
          written word. Have you made the jewel which is brought us in that
          casket your own? Is Jesus to you the Son of the living God, believing
          on whom you share His life, and become 'sons of God' by Him? Can you
          take on to your thankful lips that triumphant and rapturous confession
          of the doubting Thomas, -- the flag flying on the completed roof-tree
          of this Gospel -- 'My Lord and my God'? If you can, you will receive
          the blessing which Christ then promised to all of us standing beyond
          the limits of that little group, 'who have not seen and yet have
          believed' -- even that eternal life which flows into our dead spirits
          from the Christ, the Son of God, who is the Light of the world, and
          the Life of men.
