        <p>X. Sanctification</p>
        <p>A. THE SCRIPTURAL TERMS FOR SANCTIFICATION AND HOLINESS.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE OLD TESTAMENT TERMS. The Old Testament word for 'to sanctify'
          is qadash, a verb that is used in the niphal, piel, hiphil, and
          hithpa'el species. The corresponding noun is qodesh, while the
          adjective is qadosh. The verbal forms are derived from the nominal and
          adjectival forms. The original meaning of these words is uncertain.
          Some are of the opinion that the word qadash is related to chadash,
          meaning 'to shine.' This would be in harmony with the qualitative
          aspect of the Biblical idea of holiness, namely, that of purity.
          Others, with a greater degree of probability, derive the word from the
          root qad, meaning 'to cut.' This would make the idea of separation the
          original idea. The word would then point to aloofness, separateness,
          or majesty. Though this meaning of the words 'sanctification' and
          'holiness' may seem unusual to us, it is in all probability the
          fundamental idea expressed by them. Says Girdlestone: "The terms
          'sanctification' and 'holiness' are now used so frequently to
          represent moral and spiritual qualities, that they hardly convey to
          the reader the idea of position or relationship as existing between
          God and some person or thing consecrated to Him; yet this appears to
          be the real meaning of the word."87 Similarly, Cremer-Koegel calls
          attention to the fact that the idea of separation is fundamental to
          that of holiness. "Heiligkeit ist ein verhaeltnisbegriff." At the same
          time it is admitted that the two ideas of holiness and separation do
          not merge, are not absorbed in each other, but that the former in a
          measure serves to qualify the latter.88
        </p>
        <p>2. THE NEW TESTAMENT TERMS.</p>
        <p>
          a. The verb hagiazo and its various meanings. The verb hagiazo is a
          derivative of hagios, which like the Hebrew qadosh expresses primarily
          the idea of separation. It is used in several different senses,
          however, in the New Testament. We may distinguish the following: (1)
          It is used in a mental sense of persons or things, Mat_6:9; Luk_11:2;
          1Pe_3:15. In such cases it means "to regard an object as holy," "to
          ascribe holiness to it," or "to acknowledge its holiness by word or
          deed." (2) It is also employed occasionally in a ritual sense, that
          is, in the sense of "separating from ordinary for sacred purposes," or
          of "setting aside for a certain office," Mat_23:17; Mat_23:19;
          Joh_10:36; 2Ti_2:21. (3) Again it is used to denote that operation of
          God by which He, especially through His Spirit, works in man the
          subjective quality of holiness, Joh_17:17; Act_20:32; Act_26:18;
          1Co_1:2; 1Th_5:23. (4) Finally, in the Epistle to the Hebrews it seems
          to be used in an expiatory sense, and also in the related sense of the
          Pauline dikaio-o, Heb_9:13; Heb_10:10, Heb_10:29; Heb_13:12.89
        </p>
        <p>
          b.The adjectives expressive of the idea of holiness. (1) Hieros. The
          word that is used least and that is also the least expressive, is the
          word hieros. It is found only in 1Co_9:13; 2Ti_3:15, and then not of
          persons but of things. It does not express moral excellence, but is
          expressive of the inviolable character of the thing referred to, which
          springs from the relation in which it stands to God. It is best
          translated by the English word "sacred." (2) Hosios. The word hosios
          is of more frequent occurrence. It is found in Act_2:27; Act_13:34-35;
          1Ti_2:8; Tit_1:8; Heb_7:26; Rev_15:4; Rev_16:5, and is applied not
          only to things, but also to God and to Christ. It describes a person
          or thing as free from defilement or wickedness, or more actively (of
          persons) as religiously fulfilling every moral obligation. (3) Hagnos.
          The word hagnos occurs in 2Co_7:11; 2Co_11:2; Php_4:8; 1Ti_5:22;
          Jas_3:17; 1Pe_3:2; 1Jn_3:3. The fundamental idea of the word seems to
          be that of freedom from impurity and defilement in an ethical sense.
          (4) Hagios. The really characteristic word of the New Testament,
          however, is hagios. Its primary meaning is that of separation in
          consecration and devotion to the service of God. With this is
          connected the idea that what is set aside from the world for God,
          should also separate itself from the world's defilement and share in
          God's purity. This explains the fact that hagios speedily acquired an
          ethical signification. The word does not always have the same meaning
          in the New Testament. (a) It is used to designate an external official
          relation, a being set aside from ordinary purposes for the service of
          God, as for instance, when we read of "holy prophets," Luk_1:70, "holy
          apostles," Eph_3:5, and "holy men of God" 2Pe_1:21. (b) More often,
          however, it is employed in an ethical sense to describe the quality
          that is necessary to stand in close relation to God and to serve Him
          acceptably, Eph_1:4; Eph_5:27; Col_1:22; 1Pe_1:15-16. It should be
          borne in mind that in treating of sanctification we use the word
          primarily in the latter sense. When we speak of holiness in connection
          with sanctification, we have in mind both an external relation and an
          inner subjective quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The nouns denoting sanctification and holiness. The New Testament
          word for sanctification is hagiasmos. It occurs ten times, namely, in
          Rom_6:19; Rom_6:22; 1Co_1:30; 1Th_4:3-4; 1Th_4:7; 2Th_2:13; 1Ti_2:15;
          Heb_12:14; 1Pe_1:2. While it denotes ethical purification, it includes
          the idea of separation, namely, "the separation of the spirit from all
          that is impure and polluting, and a renunciation of the sins towards
          which the desires of the flesh and of the mind lead us." While
          hagiasmos denotes the work of sanctification, there are two other
          words that describe the result of the process, namely, hagiotes and
          hagiosune. The former is found in 1Co_1:30 and Heb_12:10; and the
          latter in Rom_1:4; 2Co_7:2, and 1Th_3:13. These passages show that the
          quality of holiness or freedom from pollution and impurity is
          essential to God, was exhibited by Jesus Christ, and is imparted to
          the Christian.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE DOCTRINE OF SANCTIFICATION IN HISTORY.</p>
        <p>
          1. BEFORE THE REFORMATION. In the historical unfolding of the doctrine
          of sanctification, the Church concerned itself primarily with three
          problems: (a) the relation of the grace of God in sanctification to
          faith; (b) the relation of sanctification to justification; and (c)
          the degree of sanctification in this present life. The writings of the
          early Church Fathers contain very little respecting the doctrine of
          sanctification. A strain of moralism is quite apparent in that man was
          taught to depend for salvation on faith and good works. Sins committed
          before baptism were washed away in baptism, but for those after
          baptism man must provide by penance and good works. He must lead a
          life of virtue and thus merit the approval of the Lord. "Such
          dualism," says Scott in his The Nicene Theology,90 "left the domain of
          sanctification only indirectly related to the redemption of Christ;
          and this was the field in which grew up, naturally, defective
          conceptions of sin, legalism, Sacramentarianism, priestcraft, and all
          the excesses of monkish devotion." Asceticism came to be regarded as
          of the greatest importance. There was also a tendency to confound
          justification and sanctification. Augustine was the first one to
          develop rather definite ideas of sanctification, and his views had a
          determining influence on the Church of the Middle Ages. He did not
          clearly distinguish between justification and sanctification, but
          conceived of the latter as included in the former. Since he believed
          in the total corruption of human nature by the fall, he thought of
          sanctification as a new supernatural impartation of divine life, a new
          infused energy, operating exclusively within the confines of the
          Church and through the sacraments. While he did not lose sight of the
          importance of personal love to Christ as a constituent element in
          sanctification, he manifested a tendency to take a metaphysical view
          of the grace of God in sanctification, â€” to regard it as a deposit
          of God in man. He did not sufficiently stress the necessity of a
          constant preoccupation of faith with the redeeming Christ, as the most
          important factor in the transformation of the Christian's life. The
          tendencies apparent in the teachings of Augustine came to fruitage in
          the theology of the Middle Ages, which is found in its most developed
          form in the writings of Thomas Aquinas. Justification and
          sanctification are not clearly distinguished, but the former is made
          to include the infusion of divine grace, as something substantial,
          into the human soul. This grace is a sort of donum superadditum, by
          which the soul is lifted to a new level or a higher order of being,
          and is enabled to achieve its heavenly destiny of knowing, possessing,
          and enjoying God. The grace is derived from the inexhaustible treasury
          of the merits of Christ and is imparted to believers by the
          sacraments. Looked at from the divine point of view, this sanctifying
          grace within the soul secures the remission of original sin, imparts a
          permanent habit of inherent righteousness, and carries within itself
          the potency of further development, and even of perfection. Out of it
          the new life develops with all its virtues. Its good work can be
          neutralized or destroyed by mortal sins; but the guilt contracted
          after baptism can be removed by the eucharist in the case of venial
          sins, and by the sacrament of penance in the case of mortal sins.
          Considered from the human point of view, the supernatural works of
          faith working through love have merit before God, and secure an
          increase of grace. Such works are impossible, however, without the
          continuous operation of the grace of God. The result of the whole
          process was known as justification rather than as sanctification; it
          consisted in making man just before God. These ideas are embodied in
          the Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. AFTER THE REFORMATION. The Reformers in speaking of sanctification
          emphasized the antithesis of sin and redemption rather than that of
          nature and supernature. They made a clear distinction between
          justification and sanctification, regarding the former as a legal act
          of divine grace, affecting the judicial status of man, and the latter,
          as a moral or re-creative work, changing the inner nature of man. But
          while they made a careful distinction between the two, they also
          stressed their inseparable connection. While deeply convinced that man
          is justified by faith alone, they also understood that the faith which
          justifies is not alone. Justification is at once followed by
          sanctification, since God sends out the Spirit of His Son into the
          hearts of His own as soon as they are justified, and that Spirit is
          the Spirit of sanctification. They did not regard the grace of
          sanctification as a supernatural essence infused in man through the
          sacraments, but as a supernatural and gracious work of the Holy
          Spirit, primarily through the Word and secondarily through the
          sacraments, by which He delivers us more and more from the power of
          sin and enables us to do good works. Though in no way confounding
          justification and sanctification, they felt the necessity of
          preserving the closest possible connection between the former, in
          which the free and forgiving grace of God is strongly emphasized, and
          the latter, which calls for the co-operation of man, in order to avoid
          the danger of work-righteousness. In Pietism and Methodism great
          emphasis was placed on constant fellowship with Christ as the great
          means of sanctification. By exalting sanctification at the expense of
          justification, they did not always avoid the danger of
          self-righteousness. Wesley did not merely distinguish justification
          and sanctification, but virtually separated them, and spoke of entire
          sanctification as a second gift of grace, following the first, of
          justification by faith, after a shorter or longer period. While he
          also spoke of sanctification as a process, he yet held that the
          believer should pray and look for full sanctification at once by a
          separate act of God. Under the influence of Rationalism and of the
          moralism of Kant sanctification ceased to be regarded as a
          supernatural work of the Holy Spirit in the renewal of sinners, and
          was brought down to the level of a mere moral improvement by the
          natural powers of man. For Schleiermacher it was merely the
          progressive domination of the God-consciousness within us over the
          merely sentient and ever morally defective world-consciousness. And
          for Ritschl it was the moral perfection of the Christian life to which
          we attain by fulfilling our vocation as members of the Kingdom of God.
          In a great deal of modern liberal theology sanctification consists
          only in the ever-increasing redemption of man's lower self by the
          domination of his higher self. Redemption by character is one of the
          slogans of the present day, and the term "sanctification" has come to
          stand for mere moral improvement.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE BIBLICAL IDEA OF HOLINESS AND SANCTIFICATION.</p>
        <p>
          1. IN THE OLD TESTAMENT. In Scripture the quality of holiness applies
          first of all to God, and as applied to Him its fundamental idea is
          that of unapproachableness. And this unapproachableness is based on
          the fact that God is divine and therefore absolutely distinct from the
          creature. Holiness in this sense is not merely an attribute to be co-
          ordinated with others in God. It is rather something that is
          predicable of everything that is found in God. He is holy in His grace
          as well as in His righteousness, in His love as well as in His wrath.
          Strictly speaking, holiness becomes an attribute only in the later
          ethical sense of the word. The ethical meaning of the term developed
          out of the majesty- meaning. This development starts with the idea
          that a sinful being is more keenly conscious of the majesty of God
          than a sinless being. The sinner becomes aware of his impurity as over
          against the majestic purity of God, cf. Isa_6:1-13. Otto speaks of
          holiness in the original sense as the numenous, and proposes to call
          the characteristic reaction to it "creature-feeling, or
          creature-consciousness," a disvaluation of self into nothingness,
          while he speaks of the reaction to holiness in the derived ethical
          sense as a "feeling of absolute profaneness." Thus the idea of
          holiness as majestic purity or ethical sublimity was developed. This
          purity is an active principle in God, that must vindicate itself and
          uphold its honor. This accounts for the fact that holiness is
          represented in Scripture also as the light of the divine glory turned
          into a devouring fire. Isa_5:24; Isa_10:17; Isa_33:14-15. Over against
          the holiness of God man feels himself to be, not merely insignificant,
          but positively impure and sinful, and as such an object of God's
          wrath. God revealed His holiness in the Old Testament in various ways.
          He did it in terrible judgments upon the enemies of Israel,
          Exo_15:11-12. He did it also by separating unto Himself a people,
          which He took out of the world, Exo_19:4-6; Eze_20:39-44. By taking
          this people out of the impure and ungodly world, He protested against
          that world and its sin. Moreover, He did it repeatedly in sparing His
          unfaithful people, because He did not want the unholy world to rejoice
          at what it might consider the failure of His work, Hos_11:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a derivative sense the idea of holiness is also applied to things
          and persons that are placed in a special relation to God. The land of
          Canaan, the city of Jerusalem, the temple-mount, the tabernacle and
          temple, the sabbaths and the solemn feasts of Israel, â€” they are all
          called holy, since they are consecrated to God and are placed within
          the radiance of His majestic holiness. Similarly, the prophets, the
          Levites, and the priests are called holy as persons that were set
          aside for the special service of the Lord. Israel had its sacred
          places, its sacred seasons, its sacred rites, and its sacred persons.
          This is not yet the ethical idea of holiness, however. One might be a
          sacred person, and yet be entirely devoid of the grace of God in his
          heart. In the old dispensation, as well as in the new, ethical
          holiness results from the renewing and sanctifying influence of the
          Holy Spirit. It should be remembered, however, that even where the
          conception of holiness is thoroughly spiritualized, it is always
          expressive of a relation. The idea of holiness is never that of moral
          goodness, considered in itself, but always that of ethical goodness
          seen in relation to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. In passing from the Old Testament to the New
          we become aware of a striking difference. While in the Old Testament
          there is not a single attribute of God that stands out with anything
          like the same prominence as His holiness, in the New Testament
          holiness is seldom ascribed to God. Except in a few Old Testament
          quotations, it is done only in the writings of John, Joh_17:11;
          1Jn_2:20; Rev_6:10. In all probability the explanation for this lies
          in the fact that in the New Testament holiness stands forth as the
          special characteristic of the Spirit of God, by whom believers are
          sanctified, are qualified for service, and are led to their eternal
          destiny, 2Th_2:13; Tit_3:5. The word hagios is used in connection with
          the Spirit of God well nigh a hundred times. The conception of
          holiness and sanctification, however, is no other in the New Testament
          than it is in the Old. In the former as well as in the latter holiness
          is ascribed in a derived sense to man. In the one as well as in the
          other ethical holiness is not mere moral rectitude, and sanctification
          is never mere moral improvement. These two are often confused in the
          present day, when people speak of salvation by character. A man may
          boast of great moral improvement, and yet be an utter stranger to
          sanctification. The Bible does not urge moral improvement pure and
          simple, but moral improvement in relation to God, for God's sake, and
          with a view to the service of God. It insists on sanctification. At
          this very point much ethical preaching of the present day is utterly
          misleading; and the corrective for it lies in the presentation of the
          true doctrine of sanctification. Sanctification may be defined as that
          gracious and continuous operation of the Holy Spirit, by which He
          delivers the justified sinner from the pollution of sin, renews his
          whole nature in the image of God, and enables him to perform good
          works.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE NATURE OF SANCTIFICATION.</p>
        <p>
          1. IT IS A SUPERNATURAL WORK OF GOD. Some have the mistaken notion
          that sanctification consists merely in the drawing out of the new
          life, implanted in the soul by regeneration, in a persuasive way by
          presenting motives to the will. But this is not true. It consists
          fundamentally and primarily in a divine operation in the soul, whereby
          the holy disposition born in regeneration is strengthened and its holy
          exercises are increased. It is essentially a work of God, though in so
          far as He employs means, man can and is expected to co-operate by the
          proper use of these means. Scripture clearly exhibits the supernatural
          character of sanctification in several ways. It describes it as a work
          of God, 1Th_5:23; Heb_13:20-21, as a fruit of the union of life with
          Jesus Christ, Joh_15:3; Gal_2:20; Gal_4:19, as a work that is wrought
          in man from within and which for that very reason cannot be a work of
          man, Eph_3:16; Col_1:11, and speaks of its manifestation in Christian
          virtues as the work of the Spirit, Gal_5:22. It should never be
          represented as a merely natural process in the spiritual development
          of man, nor brought down to the level of a mere human achievement, as
          is done in a great deal of modern liberal theology.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. IT CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS. The two parts of sanctification are
          represented in Scripture as:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The mortification of the old man, the body of sin. This Scriptural
          term denotes that act of God whereby the pollution and corruption of
          human nature that results from sin is gradually removed. It is often
          represented in the Bible as the crucifying of the old man, and is thus
          connected with the death of Christ on the cross. The old man is human
          nature in so far as it is controlled by sin, Rom_6:6; Gal_5:24. In the
          context of the passage of Galatians Paul contrasts the works of the
          flesh and the works of the Spirit, and then says: "And they who are of
          Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts
          thereof." This means that in their case the Spirit has gained
          predominance.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The quickening of the new man, created in Christ Jesus unto good
          works. While the former part of sanctification is negative in
          character, this is positive. It is that act of God whereby the holy
          disposition of the soul is strengthened, holy exercises are increased,
          and thus a new course of life engendered and promoted. The old
          structure of sin is gradually torn down, and a new structure of God is
          reared in its stead. These two parts of sanctification are not
          successive but contemporaneous. Thank God, the gradual erection of the
          new building need not wait until the old one is completely demolished.
          If it had to wait for that, it could never begin in this life. With
          the gradual dissolution of the old the new makes its appearance. It is
          like the airing of a house filled with pestiferous odors. As the old
          air is drawn out, the new rushes in. This positive side of
          sanctification is often called "a being raised together with Christ,"
          Rom_6:4-5; Col_2:12; Col_3:1-2. The new life to which it leads is
          called "a life unto God," Rom_6:11; Gal_2:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. IT AFFECTS THE WHOLE MAN: BODY AND SOUL; INTELLECT, AFFECTIONS AND
          WILL. This follows from the nature of the case, because sanctification
          takes place in the inner life of man, in the heart, and this cannot be
          changed without changing the whole organism of man. If the inner man
          is changed, there is bound to be change also in the periphery of life.
          Moreover, Scripture clearly and explicitly teaches that it affects
          both body and soul, 1Th_5:23; 2Co_5:17; Rom_6:12; 1Co_6:15; 1Co_6:20.
          The body comes into consideration here as the organ or instrument of
          the sinful soul, through which the sinful inclinations and habits and
          passions express themselves. The sanctification of the body takes
          place especially in the crisis of death and in the resurrection of the
          dead. Finally, it also appears from Scripture that sanctification
          affects all the powers or faculties of the soul: the understanding,
          Jer_31:34; Joh_6:45; â€” the will, Eze_36:25-27; Php_2:13; â€” the
          passions, Gal_5:24; â€” and the conscience, Tit_1:15; Heb_9:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. IT IS A WORK OF GOD IN WHICH BELIEVERS CO-OPERATE. When it is said
          that man takes part in the work of sanctification, this does not mean
          that man is an independent agent in the work, so as to make it partly
          the work of God and partly the work of man; but merely, that God
          effects the work in part through the instrumentality of man as a
          rational being, by requiring of him prayerful and intelligent
          co-operation with the Spirit. That man must co-operate with the Spirit
          of God follows: (a) from the repeated warnings against evils and
          temptations, which clearly imply that man must be active in avoiding
          the pitfalls of life, Rom_12:9; Rom_12:16-17; 1Co_6:9-10; Gal_5:16-23;
          and (b) from the constant exhortations to holy living. These imply
          that the believer must be diligent in the employment of the means at
          his command for the moral and spiritual improvement of his life,
          Mic_6:8; Joh_15:2; Joh_15:16; Rom_8:12-13; Rom_12:1-2; Rom_12:17;
          Gal_6:7-8; Gal_6:15.
        </p>
        <p>E. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SANCTIFICATION.</p>
        <p>
          1. As appears from the immediately preceding, sanctification is a work
          of which God and not man is the author. Only the advocates of the
          so-called free will can claim that it is a work of man. Nevertheless,
          it differs from regeneration in that man can, and is in duty bound to,
          strive for ever-increasing sanctification by using the means which God
          has placed at his disposal. This is clearly taught in Scripture,
          2Co_7:1; Col_3:5-14; 1Pe_1:22. Consistent Antinomians lose sight of
          this important truth, and feel no need of carefully avoiding sin,
          since this affects only the old man which is condemned to death, and
          not the new man which is holy with the holiness of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Sanctification takes place partly in the subconscious life, and as
          such is an immediate operation of the Holy Spirit; but also partly in
          the conscious life, and then depends on the use of certain means, such
          as the constant exercise of faith, the study of God's Word, prayer,
          and association with other believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Sanctification is usually a lengthy process and never reaches
          perfection in this life. At the same time there may be cases in which
          it is completed in a very short time or even in a moment, as, for
          instance, in cases in which regeneration and conversion are
          immediately followed by temporal death. If we may proceed on the
          assumption that the believer's sanctification is perfect immediately
          after death â€” and Scripture seems to teach this as far as the soul
          is concerned â€”, then in such cases the sanctification of the soul
          must be completed almost at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The sanctification of the believer must, it would seem, be
          completed either at the very moment of death, or immediately after
          death, as far as the soul is concerned, and at the resurrection in so
          far as it pertains to the body. This would seem to follow from that
          fact that, on the one hand, the Bible teaches that in the present life
          no one can claim freedom from sin, 1Ki_8:46; Pro_20:9; Rom_3:10;
          Rom_3:12; Jas_3:2; 1Jn_1:8; and that, on the other hand, those who
          have gone before are entirely sanctified. It speaks of them as "the
          spirits of just men made perfect," Heb_12:23, and as "without
          blemish," Rev_14:5. Moreover, we are told that in the heavenly city of
          God there shall in no wise enter "anything unclean or he that maketh
          an abomination and a lie," Rev_21:27; and that Christ at His coming
          will "fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be
          conformed to the body of His glory," Php_3:21.
        </p>
        <p>F. THE AUTHOR AND MEANS OF SANCTIFICATION.</p>
        <p>
          Sanctification is a work of the triune God, but is ascribed more
          particularly to the Holy Spirit in Scripture, Rom_8:11; Rom_15:16;
          1Pe_1:2. It is particularly important in our day, with its emphasis on
          the necessity of approaching the study of theology anthropologically
          and its one-sided call to service in the kingdom of God, to stress the
          fact that God, and not man, is the author of sanctification.
          Especially in view of the Activism that is such a characteristic
          feature of American religious life, and which glorifies the work of
          man rather than the grace of God, it is necessary to stress the fact
          over and over again that sanctification is the fruit of justification,
          that the former is simply impossible without the latter, and that both
          are the fruits of the grace of God in the redemption of sinners.
          Though man is privileged to co-operate with the Spirit of God, he can
          do this only in virtue of the strength which the Spirit imparts to him
          from day to day. The spiritual development of man is not a human
          achievement, but a work of divine grace. Man deserves no credit
          whatsoever for that which he contributes to it instrumentally. In so
          far as sanctification takes place in the subconscious life, it is
          effected by the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit. But as a work
          in the conscious life of believers it is wrought by several means,
          which the Holy Spirit employs.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE WORD OF GOD. In opposition to the Church of Rome it should be
          maintained that the principal means used by the Holy Spirit is the
          Word of God. The truth in itself certainly has no adequate efficiency
          to sanctify the believer, yet it is naturally adapted to be the means
          of sanctification as employed by the Holy Spirit. Scripture presents
          all the objective conditions for holy exercises and acts. It serves to
          excite spiritual activity by presenting motives and inducements, and
          gives direction to it by prohibitions, exhortations, and examples,
          1Pe_1:22; 1Pe_2:2; 2Pe_1:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE SACRAMENTS. These are the means par excellence according to the
          Church of Rome. Protestants regard them as subordinate to the Word of
          God, and sometimes even speak of them as the "visible Word." They
          symbolize and seal to us the same truths that are verbally expressed
          in the Word of God, and may be regarded as an acted word, containing a
          lively representation of the truth, which the Holy Spirit makes the
          occasion for holy exercises. They are not only subordinate to the Word
          of God, but cannot exist without it, and are therefore always
          accompanied by it, Rom_6:3; 1Co_12:13; Tit_3:5; 1Pe_3:21.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. PROVIDENTIAL GUIDANCE. God's providences, both favorable and
          adverse, are often powerful means of sanctification. In connection
          with the operation of the Holy Spirit through the Word, they work on
          our natural affections and thus frequently deepen the impression of
          religious truth and force it home. It should be borne in mind that the
          light of God's revelation is necessary for the interpretation of His
          providential guidances, Psa_119:71; Rom_2:4; Heb_12:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          G. RELATION OF SANCTIFICATION TO OTHER STAGES IN THE ORDO SALUTIS.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is of considerable importance to have a correct conception of the
          relation between sanctification and some of the other stages in the
          work of redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. TO REGENERATION. There is both difference and similarity here.
          Regeneration is completed at once, for a man cannot be more or less
          regenerated; he is either dead or alive spiritually. Sanctification is
          a process, bringing about gradual changes, so that different grades
          may be distinguished in the resulting holiness. Hence we are
          admonished to perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord, 2Co_7:1. The
          Heidelberg Catechism also presupposes that there are degrees of
          holiness, when it says that even "the holiest men, when in this life,
          have only a small beginning of this obedience."91 At the same time
          regeneration is the beginning of sanctification. The work of renewal,
          begun in the former, is continued in the latter, Php_1:6. Strong says:
          "It (sanctification) is distinguished from regeneration as growth from
          birth, or as the strengthening of a holy disposition from the original
          impartation of it."92
        </p>
        <p>
          2. TO JUSTIFICATION. Justification precedes and is basic to
          sanctification in the covenant of grace. In the covenant of works the
          order of righteousness and holiness was just the reverse. Adam was
          created with a holy disposition and inclination to serve God, but on
          the basis of this holiness he had to work out the righteousness that
          would entitle him to eternal life. Justification is the judicial basis
          for sanctification. God has the right to demand of us holiness of
          life, but because we cannot work out this holiness for ourselves, He
          freely works it within us through the Holy Spirit on the basis of the
          righteousness of Jesus Christ, which is imputed to us in
          justification. The very fact that it is based on justification, in
          which the free grace of God stands out with the greatest prominence,
          excludes the idea that we can ever merit anything in sanctification.
          The Roman Catholic idea that justification enables man to perform
          meritorious works is contrary to Scripture. Justification as such does
          not effect a change in our inner being and therefore needs
          sanctification as its complement. It is not sufficient that the sinner
          stands righteous before God; he must also be holy in his inmost life.
          Barth has a rather unusual representation of the relation between
          justification and sanctification. In order to ward off all
          self-righteousness, he insists on it that the two always be considered
          jointly. They go together and should not be considered quantitatively,
          as if the one followed the other. Justification is not a station which
          one passes, an accomplished fact on the basis of which one next
          proceeds to the highway of sanctification. It is not a completed fact
          to which one can look back with definite assurance, but occurs ever
          anew whenever man has reached the point of complete despair, and then
          goes hand in hand with sanctification. And just as man remains a
          sinner even after justification, so he also remains a sinner in
          sanctification, even his best deeds continue to be sins.
          Sanctification does not engender a holy disposition, and does not
          gradually purify man. It does not put him in possession of any
          personal holiness, does not make him a saint, but leaves him a sinner.
          It really becomes a declarative act like justification. McConnachie,
          who is a very sympathetic interpreter of Barth, says: "Justification
          and sanctification are, therefore, to Barth, two sides of one act of
          God upon men. Justification is the pardon of the sinner (justificatio
          impii ), by which God declares the sinner righteous. Sanctification is
          the sanctification of the sinner ( sanctificatio impii), by which God
          declares the sinner 'holy'." However laudable the desire of Barth to
          destroy every vestige of work-righteousness, he certainly goes to an
          unwarranted extreme, in which he virtually confuses justification and
          sanctification, negatives the Christian life, and rules out the
          possibility of confident assurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. TO FAITH. Faith is the mediate or instrumental cause of
          sanctification as well as of justification. It does not merit
          sanctification any more than it does justification, but it unites us
          to Christ and keeps us in touch with Him as the Head of the new
          humanity, who is the source of the new life within us, and also of our
          progressive sanctification, through the operation of the Holy Spirit.
          The consciousness of the fact that sanctification is based on
          justification, and is impossible on any other basis, and that the
          constant exercise of faith is necessary, in order to advance in the
          way of holiness, will guard us against all self-righteousness in our
          striving to advance in godliness and holiness of life. It deserves
          particular attention that, while even the weakest faith mediates a
          perfect justification, the degree of sanctification is commensurate
          with the strength of the Christian's faith and the persistence with
          which he apprehends Christ.
        </p>
        <p>H. THE IMPERFECT CHARACTER OF SANCTIFICATION IN THIS LIFE.</p>
        <p>
          1. SANCTIFICATION IMPERFECT IN DEGREE. When we speak of sanctification
          as being imperfect in this life, we do not mean to say that it is
          imperfect in parts, as if only a part of the holy man that originates
          in regeneration were affected. It is the whole, but yet undeveloped
          new man, that must grow into full stature. A new-born child is,
          barring exceptions, perfect in parts, but not vet in the degree of
          development for which it is intended. Just so the new man is perfect
          in parts, but remains in the present life imperfect in the degree of
          spiritual development. Believers must contend with sin as long as they
          live, 1Ki_8:46; Pro_20:9; Ecc_7:20; Jas_3:2; 1Jn_1:8.
        </p>
        <p>2. DENIAL OF THIS IMPERFECTION BY THE PERFECTIONISTS.</p>
        <p>
          a. The doctrine of perfectionism. Speaking generally, this doctrine is
          to the effect that religious perfection is attainable in the present
          life. It is taught in various forms by Pelagians, Roman Catholics or
          Semi-Pelagians, Arminians, Wesleyans, such mystical sects as the
          Labadists, the Quietists, the Quakers, and others, some of the Oberlin
          theologians, such as Mahan and Finney, and Ritschl. These all agree in
          maintaining that it is possible for believers in this life to attain
          to a state in which they comply with the requirements of the law under
          which they now live, or under that law as it was adjusted to their
          present ability and needs, and, consequently, to be free from sin.
          They differ, however: (1) In their view of sin, the Pelagians, in
          distinction from all the rest, denying the inherent corruption of man.
          They all agree, however, in externalizing sin. (2) In their conception
          of the law which believers are now obliged to fulfill, the Arminians,
          including the Wesleyans, differing from all the rest in holding that
          this is not the original moral law, but the gospel requirements or the
          new law of faith and evangelical obedience. The Roman Catholics and
          the Oberlin theologians maintain that it is the original law, but
          admit that the demands of this law are adjusted to man's deteriorated
          powers and to his present ability. And Ritschl discards the whole idea
          that man is subject to an externally imposed law. He defends the
          autonomy of moral conduct, and holds that we are under no law but such
          as is evolved out of our own moral disposition in the course of
          activities for the fulfilment of our vocation. (3) In their idea of
          the sinner's dependence on the renewing grace of God for the ability
          to fulfill the law. All, except the Pelagians, admit that he is in
          some sense dependent on divine grace, in order to the attainment of
          perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very significant that all the leading perfectionist theories
          (with the sole exception of the Pelagian, which denies the inherent
          corruption of man) deem it necessary to lower the standard of
          perfection and do not hold man responsible for a great deal that is
          undoubtedly demanded by the original moral law. And it is equally
          significant that they feel the necessity of externalizing the idea of
          sin, when they claim that only conscious wrong-doing can be so
          considered, and refuse to recognize as sin a great deal that is
          represented as such in Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>b. Scriptural proofs adduced for the doctrine of perfectionism.</p>
        <p>
          (1) The Bible commands believers to be holy and even to be perfect,
          1Pe_1:16; Mat_5:48; Jas_1:4, and urges them to follow the example of
          Christ who did no sin, 1Pe_2:21 f. Such commands would be
          unreasonable, if it were not possible to reach sinless perfection. But
          the Scriptural demand to be holy and perfect holds for the
          unregenerate as well as for the regenerate, since the law of God
          demands holiness from the start and has never been revoked. If the
          command implies that they to whom it comes can live up to the
          requirement, this must be true of every man. However, only those who
          teach perfectionism in the Pelagian sense can hold that view. The
          measure of our ability cannot be inferred from the Scriptural
          commandments. (2) Holiness and perfection are often ascribed to
          believers in Scripture, Son_4:7; 1Co_2:5; 2Co_5:17; Eph_5:27;
          Heb_5:14; Php_4:13; Col_2:10. When the Bible speaks of believers as
          holy and perfect, however, this does not necessarily mean that they
          are without sin, since both words are often used in a different sense,
          not only in common parlance, but also in the Bible. Persons set aside
          for the special service of God are called holy in the Bible,
          irrespective of their moral condition and life. Believers can be and
          are called holy, because they are objectively holy in Christ, or
          because they are in principle subjectively sanctified by the Spirit of
          God. Paul in his Epistles invariably addresses his readers as saints,
          that is "holy ones," and then proceeds in several cases to take them
          to task for their sins. And when believers are described as perfect,
          this means in some cases merely that they are full-grown, 1Co_2:6;
          Heb_5:14, and in others that they are fully equipped for their task,
          2Ti_3:17. All this certainly does not give countenance to the theory
          of sin less perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) There are, it is said, Biblical examples of saints who led perfect
          lives, such as Noah, Job, and Asa, Gen_6:9; Job_1:1; 1Ki_15:14. But,
          surely, such examples as these do not prove the point for the simple
          reason that they are no examples of sinless perfection. Even the most
          notable saints of the Bible are pictured as men who had their failings
          and who sinned, in some cases very grievously. This is true of Noah,
          Moses, Job, Abraham, and all the others. It is true that this does not
          necessarily prove that their lives remained sinful as long as they
          lived on earth, but it is a striking fact that we are not introduced
          to a single one who was without sin. The question of Solomon is still
          pertinent: "Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my
          sin?" Pro_20:9. Moreover, John says: "If we say that we have no sin,
          we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us," 1Jn_1:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) The apostle John declares explicitly that they who are born of God
          do not sin, 1Jn_3:6; Joh_3:8-9; 1Jn_5:18. But when John says that they
          who are born of God do not sin, he is contrasting the two states,
          represented by the old and the new man, as to their essential nature
          and principle. One of the essential characteristics of the new man is
          that he does not sin. In view of the fact that John invariably uses
          the present to express the idea that the one born of God does not sin,
          it is possible that he desires to express the idea that the child of
          God does not go on sinning habitually, as the devil does, 1Jn_3:8.93
          He certainly does not mean to assert that the believer never commits
          an act of sin, cf. 1Jn_1:8-10. Moreover, the Perfectionist cannot very
          well use these passages to prove his point, since they would prove too
          much for his purpose. He does not make bold to say that all believers
          are actually sinless, but only that they can reach a state of sinless
          perfection. The Johannine passages, however, would prove, on his
          interpretation, that all believers are without sin. And more than
          that, they would also prove that believers never fall from the state
          of grace (for this is sinning); and yet the Perfectionists are the
          very people who believe that even perfect Christians may fall away.
        </p>
        <p>c. Objections to the theory of Perfectionism.</p>
        <p>
          (1) In the light of Scripture the doctrine of Perfectionism is
          absolutely untenable. The Bible gives us the explicit and very
          definite assurance that there is no one on earth who does not sin,
          1Ki_8:46; Pro_20:9; Ecc_7:20; Rom_3:10; Jas_3:2; 1Jn_1:8. In view of
          these clear statements of Scripture it is hard to see how any who
          claim to believe the Bible as the infallible Word of God can hold that
          it is possible for believers to lead sinless lives, and that some
          actually succeed in avoiding all sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) According to Scripture there is a constant warfare between the
          flesh and the Spirit in the lives of God's children, and even the best
          of them are still striving for perfection. Paul gives a very striking
          description of this struggle in Rom_7:7-25, a passage which certainly
          refers to him in his regenerate state. In Gal_5:16-24 he speaks of
          that very same struggle as a struggle that characterizes all the
          children of God. And in Php_3:10-14 he speaks of himself, practically
          at the end of his career, as one who has not yet reached perfection,
          but is pressing on toward the goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Confession of sin and prayer for forgiveness are continually
          required. Jesus taught all His disciples without any exception to pray
          forthe forgiveness of sins and for deliverance from temptation and
          from the evil one, Mat_6:12-13. And John says: "If we confess our
          sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to
          cleanse us from all unrighteousness," 1Jn_1:9. Moreover, Bible saints
          are constantly represented as confessing their sins, Job_9:3;
          Job_9:20; Psa_32:5; Psa_103:3; Psa_143:2; Pro_20:9; Isa_64:6;
          Dan_9:16; Rom_7:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) The Perfectionists themselves deem it necessary to lower the
          standard of the law and to externalize the idea of sin, in order to
          maintain their theory. Moreover, some of them have repeatedly modified
          the ideal to which, in their estimation, believers can attain. At
          first the ideal was "freedom from all sin"; then, "freedom from all
          conscious sin," next, "entire consecration to God," and, finally,
          "Christian assurance." This is in itself a sufficient condemnation of
          their theory. We naturally do not deny that the Christian can attain
          to the assurance of faith.
        </p>
        <p>I. SANCTIFICATION AND GOOD WORKS.</p>
        <p>
          Sanctification and good works are most intimately related. Just as the
          old life expresses itself in works of evil, so the new life, that
          originates in regeneration and is promoted and strengthened in
          sanctification, naturally manifests itself in good works. These may be
          called the fruits of sanctification, and as such come into
          consideration here.
        </p>
        <p>1. THE NATURE OF GOOD WORKS.</p>
        <p>
          a. Good works in the specifically theological sense. When we speak of
          good works in connection with sanctification, we do not refer to works
          that are perfect, that answer perfectly to the requirements of the
          divine moral law, and that are of such inherent worth as to entitle
          one to the reward of eternal life under the conditions of the covenant
          of works. We do mean, however, works that are essentially different in
          moral quality from the actions of the unregenerate, and that are the
          expressions of a new and holy nature, as the principle from which they
          spring. These are works which God not only approves, but in a certain
          sense also rewards. The following are the characteristics of works
          that are spiritually good: (1) They are the fruits of a regenerate
          heart, since without this no one can have the disposition (to obey
          God) and the motive (to glorify God) that is required, Mat_12:33;
          Mat_7:17-18. (2) They are not only in external conformity with the law
          of God, but are also done in conscious obedience to the revealed will
          of God, that is, because they are required by God. They spring from
          the principle of love to God and from the desire to do His will,
          Deu_6:2; 1Sa_15:22; Isa_1:12; Isa_29:13; Mat_15:9. (3) Whatever their
          proximate aim may be, their final aim is not the welfare of man, but
          the glory of God, which is the highest conceivable aim of man's life,
          1Co_10:31; Rom_12:1; Col_3:17; Col_3:23.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Good works in a more general sense. Though the term "good works" is
          generally used in theology in the strict sense just indicated, it
          remains true that the unregenerate can also perform works that may be
          called good in a superficial sense of the word. They often perform
          works that are in outward conformity with the law of God and may be
          called objectively good, in distinction from flagrant transgressions
          of the law. Such works answer to a proximate aim that meets with the
          approval of God. Moreover, in virtue of the remains of the image of
          God in the natural man and of the light of nature, man may be guided
          in his relation to other men by motives which are laudable and in so
          far bear the stamp of God's approval. Those good works, however,
          cannot be regarded as fruits of the corrupt heart of man. They find
          their explanation only in the common grace of God. Furthermore, we
          should bear in mind that, though these works can be called good in a
          certain sense and are so called in the Bible, Luk_6:33, they are yet
          essentially defective. The deeds of the unregenerate are divorced from
          the spiritual root of love to God. They represent no inner obedience
          to the law of God and no subjection to the will of the sovereign Ruler
          of heaven and earth. They have no spiritual aim, since they are not
          performed for the purpose of glorifying God, but only bear on the
          relations of the natural life. The real quality of the act is, of
          course, determined by the quality of its final aim. The ability of the
          unregenerate to perform good works in some sense of the word has often
          been denied. Barth goes one step further when he goes to the extreme
          of denying that believers can do good works, and asserts that all
          their works are sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE MERITORIOUS CHARACTER OF GOOD WORKS. Even from the earliest
          ages of the Christian Church there was a tendency to ascribe a certain
          merit to good works, but the doctrine of merit was really developed in
          the Middle Ages. At the time of the Reformation it was very prominent
          in Roman Catholic theology and was pushed to ridiculous extremes in
          practical life. The Reformers at once joined issue with the Church of
          Rome on this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The position of Rome on the point in question. The Roman Catholic
          Church distinguishes between a meritum de condigno which represents
          inherent dignity and worth, and a meritum de congruo, which is a sort
          of quasi-merit, something fit to be rewarded. The former attaches only
          to works done after regeneration by the aid of divine grace, and is a
          merit which intrinsically deserves the reward it receives from the
          hand of God. The latter attaches to those dispositions or works which
          a man may develop or do before regeneration, in virtue of a mere
          prevenient grace, and is a merit which makes it congruous or fitting
          for God to reward the agent by infusing grace into his heart. Since
          the decisions of the Council of Trent are rather dubious on this
          point, there is some uncertainty, however, as to the exact position of
          the Church. The general idea seems to be that the ability to perform
          good works in the strict sense of the word springs from grace infused
          into the sinner's heart for the sake of Christ; and that afterwards
          these good works merit, that is, give man a just claim to, salvation
          and glory. The Church goes even farther than that, and teaches that
          believers can perform works of supererogation, can do more than is
          necessary for their own salvation and can thus lay by a store of good
          works, which may accrue to the benefit of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The Scriptural position on this point. Scripture clearly teaches
          that the good works of believers are not meritorious in the proper
          sense of the word. We should bear in mind, however, that the word
          "merit" is employed in a twofold sense, the one strict and proper, and
          the other loose. Strictly speaking, a meritorious work is one to
          which, on account of its intrinsic value and dignity, the reward is
          justly due from commutative justice. Loosely speaking, however, a work
          that is deserving of approval and to which a reward is somehow
          attached (by promise, agreement, or otherwise) is also sometimes
          called meritorious. Such works are praiseworthy and are rewarded by
          God. But, however this may be, they are surely not meritorious in the
          strict sense of the word. They do not, by their own intrinsic moral
          value, make God a debtor to him who performs them. In strict justice
          the good works of believers merit nothing. Some of the most conclusive
          passages of Scripture to prove the point under consideration are the
          following: Luk_17:9-10; Rom_5:15-18; Rom_6:23; Eph_2:8-10; 2Ti_1:9;
          Tit_3:5. These passages clearly show that believers do not receive the
          inheritance of salvation because it is due to them in virtue of their
          good works, but only as a free gift of God. It stands to reason also
          that such works cannot be meritorious, for: (1) Believers owe their
          whole life to God and therefore cannot merit anything by giving God
          simply what is His due, Luk_17:9-10. (2) They cannot perform good
          works in their own strength, but only in the strength which God
          imparts to them from day to day; and in view of that fact they cannot
          expect the credit for these works, 1Co_15:10; Php_2:13. (3) Even the
          best works of believers remain imperfect in this life, and all good
          works together represent only a partial obedience, while the law
          demands perfect obedience and can be satisfied with nothing less,
          Isa_64:6; Jas_3:2. (4) Moreover, the good works of believers are out
          of all proportion to the eternal reward of glory. A temporal and
          imperfect obedience can never merit an eternal and perfect reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE NECESSITY OF GOOD WORKS. There can be no doubt about the
          necessity of good works properly understood. They cannot be regarded
          as necessary to merit salvation, nor as a means to retain a hold on
          salvation, nor even as the only way along which to proceed to eternal
          glory, for children enter salvation without having done any good
          works. The Bible does not teach that no one can be saved apart from
          good works. At the same time good works necessarily follow from the
          union of believers with Christ. "He that abideth in me and I in him,
          the same beareth much fruit," Joh_15:5. They are also necessary as
          required by God, Rom_7:4; Rom_8:12-13; Gal_6:2, as the fruits of
          faith, Jas_2:14; Jas_2:17; Jas_2:20-22, as expressions of gratitude,
          1Co_6:20, unto the assurance of faith, 2Pe_1:5-10, and to the glory of
          God, Joh_15:8; 1Co_10:31. The necessity of good works must be
          maintained over against the Antinomians, who claim that, since Christ
          not only bore the penalty of sin, but also met the positive demands of
          the law, the believer is free from the obligation to observe it, an
          error that is still with us to-day in some of the forms of
          dispensationalism. This is a thoroughly false position, for it is only
          the law as a system of penalty and as a method of salvation that is
          abolished in the death of Christ. The law as the standard of our moral
          life is a transcript of the holiness of God and is therefore of
          permanent validity also for the believer, though his attitude to the
          law has undergone a radical change. He has received the Spirit of God,
          which is the Spirit of obedience, so that, without any constraint, he
          willingly obeys the law. Strong sums it up well, when he says: Christ
          frees us "(1) from the law as a system of curse and penalty; this He
          does by bearing the curse and penalty Himself . . . ; (2) from the law
          with its claims as a method of salvation; this He does by making His
          obedience and merits ours . . . ; (3) from the law as an outward and
          foreign compulsion; this He does by giving us the spirit of obedience
          and sonship, by which the law is progressively realized within."94

        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: How was theocratic, related to ethical,
          holiness among Israel? How were the ritual purifications related to
          sanctification? Who is the subject of sanctification, the old man or
          the new, or neither of the two? Does sanctification in this life
          affect all parts of man equally? Where does the process of
          sanctification begin? Do all Christians experience a steady progress
          in sanctification? What is the difference between sanctification and
          moral improvement? Does the fact that sanctification is never complete
          in this life necessarily lead to the doctrine of purgatory, or to that
          of the continuation of sanctification after death? How did Wesley
          conceive of "entire sanctification"? Does Barth also ascribe holiness
          as an ethical quality to the believer? What Scripture proof is there
          that the Christian is not free from the law as a rule of life? Do
          Protestants in general teach that good works are not necessary? How do
          Roman Catholics and Protestants differ as to the necessity of good
          works? Is it wise to say without any qualification that good works are
          necessary unto salvation? If all Christians inherit eternal life, in
          what sense will their good works be the standard of their reward?
