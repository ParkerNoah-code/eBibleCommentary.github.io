        <p>III. The Transmission of Sin</p>
        <p>
          Scripture and experience both teach us that sin is universal, and
          according to the Bible the explanation for this universality lies in
          the fall of Adam. These two points, the universality of sin, and the
          connection of Adam's sin with that of mankind in general, now call for
          consideration. While there has been rather general agreement as to the
          universality of sin, there have been different representations of the
          connection between the sin of Adam and that of his descendants.
        </p>
        <p>A. HISTORICAL REVIEW.</p>
        <p>
          1. BEFORE THE REFORMATION. The writings of the Apologists contain
          nothing definite respecting original sin, while those of Irenaeus and
          Tertullian clearly teach that our sinful condition is the result of
          Adam's fall. But the doctrine of the direct imputation of Adam's sin
          to his descendants is foreign even to them. Tertullian had a realistic
          conception of mankind. The whole human race was potentially and
          numerically present in Adam, and therefore sinned when he sinned and
          became corrupt when he became corrupt. Human nature as a whole sinned
          in Adam, and therefore every individualization of that nature is also
          sinful. Origen, who was profoundly influenced by Greek philosophy, had
          a different view of the matter, and scarcely recognized any connection
          between the sin of Adam and that of his descendants. He found the
          explanation of the sinfulness of the human race primarily in the
          personal sin of each soul in a pre-temporal state, though he also
          mentions some mystery of generation. Augustine shared the realistic
          conception of Tertullian. Though he also spoke of "imputation," he did
          not yet have in mind the direct or immediate imputation of the guilt
          of Adam to his posterity. His doctrine of original sin is not entirely
          clear. This may be due to the fact that he hesitated to choose between
          Traducianism and Creationism. While he stresses the fact that all men
          were seminally present in Adam and actually sinned in him, he also
          comes very close to the idea that they sinned in Adam as their
          representative. However, his main emphasis was on the transmission of
          the corruption of sin. Sin is passed on by propagation, and this
          propagation of Adam's sin is at the same time a punishment for his
          sin. Wiggers states the idea very briefly in these words: "The
          corruption of human nature, in the whole race, was the righteous
          punishment of the transgression of the first man, in whom all men
          already existed."39 Augustine's great opponent, Pelagius, denied such
          a connection between the sin of Adam and those of his posterity. As he
          saw it, the propagation of sin by generation involved the Traducianist
          theory of the origin of the soul, which he regarded as a heretical
          error; and the imputation of Adam's sin to anyone but himself would be
          in conflict with the divine rectitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pelagian view was rejected by the Church, and the Scholastics in
          general thought along the lines indicated by Augustine, the emphasis
          all the while being on the transmission of the pollution of Adam's sin
          rather than on that of his guilt. Hugo St. Victor and Peter the
          Lombard held that actual concupiscence stains the semen in the act of
          procreation, and that this stain in some way defiles the soul on its
          union with the body. Anselm, Alexander of Hales, and Bonaventura
          stressed the realistic conception of the connection between Adam and
          his posterity. The whole human race was seminally present in Adam, and
          therefore also sinned in him. His disobedience was the disobedience of
          the entire human race. At the same time generation was regarded as the
          sine qua non of the transmission of the sinful nature. In Bonaventura
          and others after him the distinction between original guilt and
          original pollution was more clearly expressed. The fundamental idea
          was, that the guilt of Adam's sin is imputed to all his descendants.
          Adam suffered the loss of original righteousness, and thereby incurred
          the divine displeasure. As a result all his descendants are deprived
          of original righteousness, and as such the objects of divine wrath.
          Moreover, the pollution of Adam's sin is in some way passed on to his
          posterity, but the manner of this transmission was a matter of dispute
          among the Scholastics. Since they were not Traducianists, and
          therefore could not say that the soul, which is after all the real
          seat of evil, was passed on from father to son by generation, they
          felt that something more had to be said to explain the transmission of
          inherent evil. Some said that it is passed on through the body, which
          in turn contaminates the soul as soon as it comes in contact with it.
          Others, sensing the danger of this explanation sought it in the mere
          fact that every man is now born in the state in which Adam was before
          he was endowed with original righteousness, and thus subject to the
          struggle between the unchecked flesh and the spirit. In Thomas Aquinas
          the realistic strain again appears rather strongly, though in a
          modified form. He pointed out that the human race constitutes an
          organism, and that, just as the act of one bodily member â€” say, the
          hand â€” is regarded as the act of the person, so the sin of one
          member of the organism of humanity is imputed to the whole organism.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. AFTER THE REFORMATION. While the Reformers did not agree with the
          Scholastics as to the nature of original sin, their view of its
          transmission did not contain any new elements. The ideas of Adam as
          the representative of the human race, and of the "immediate"
          imputation of his guilt to his descendants are not yet clearly
          expressed in their works. According to Luther we are accounted guilty
          by God because of the indwelling sin inherited from Adam. Calvin
          speaks in a somewhat similar vein. He holds that, since Adam was not
          only the progenitor but the root of the human race, all his
          descendants are born with a corrupt nature; and that both the guilt of
          Adam's sin and their own inborn corruption are imputed to them as sin.
          The development of the federal theology brought the idea of Adam as
          the representative of the human race to the foreground, and led to a
          clearer distinction between the transmission of the guilt and of the
          pollution of Adam's sin. Without denying that our native corruption
          also constitutes guilt in the sight of God, federal theology stressed
          the fact that there is an "immediate" imputation of Adam's guilt to
          those whom he represented as the head of the covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Socinians and Arminians both rejected the idea of the imputation of
          Adam's sin to his descendants. Placeus, of the school of Saumur,
          advocated the idea of "mediate" imputation. Denying all immediate
          imputation, he held that because we inherit a sinful nature from Adam,
          we are deserving of being treated as if we had committed the original
          offense. This was something new in Reformed theology, and Rivet had no
          difficulty in proving this by collecting a long line of testimonies. A
          debate ensued in which "immediate" and "mediate" imputation were
          represented as mutually exclusive doctrines; and in which it was made
          to appear as if the real question was, whether man is guilty in the
          sight of God solely on account of Adam's sin, imputed to him, or
          solely on account of his own inherent sin. The former was not the
          doctrine of the Reformed Churches, and the latter was not taught in
          them before the time of Placeus. The teachings of the latter found
          their way into New England theology, and became especially
          characteristic of the New School (New Haven) theology. In modern
          liberal theology the doctrine of the transmission of sin from Adam to
          his posterity is entirely discredited. It prefers to seek the
          explanation of the evil that is in the world in an animal inheritance,
          which is not itself sinful. Strange to say, even Barth and Brunner,
          though violently opposed to liberal theology, do not regard the
          universal sinfulness of the human race as the result of Adam's sin.
          Historically, the latter occupies a unique place merely as the first
          sinner.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE UNIVERSALITY OF SIN.</p>
        <p>
          Few will be inclined to deny the presence of evil in the human heart,
          however much they may differ as to the nature of this evil and as to
          the way in which it originated. Even Pelagians and Socinians are ready
          to admit that sin is universal. This is a fact that forces itself upon
          the attention of every one.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS AND OF PHILOSOPHY TESTIFY TO IT. The
          history of religions testifies to the universality of sin. The
          question of Job, "How shall a man be just with God?" is a question
          that was asked not merely in the realm of special revelation, but also
          outside of it in the Gentile world. The heathen religions testify to a
          universal consciousness of sin and of the need of reconciliation with
          a Supreme Being. There is a general feeling that the gods are offended
          and must be propitiated in some way. There is a universal voice of
          conscience, testifying to the fact that man falls short of the ideal
          and stands condemned in the sight of some higher Power. Altars reeking
          with the blood of sacrifices, often the sacrifices of dear children,
          repeated confessions of wrongdoing, and prayers for deliverance from
          evil, â€” all point to the consciousness of sin. Missionaries find
          this wherever they go. The history of philosophy is indicative of the
          same fact. Early Greek philosophers were already wrestling with the
          problem of moral evil, and since their day no philosopher of name was
          able to ignore it. They were all constrained to admit the universality
          of it, and that in spite of the fact they were not able to explain the
          phenomenon. There was, it is true, a superficial optimism in the
          eighteenth century, which dreamt of the inherent goodness of man, but
          in its stupidity flew in the face of the facts and was sharply rebuked
          by Kant. Many liberal theologians were induced to believe and to
          preach this inherent goodness of man as gospel truth, but to-day many
          of them qualify it as one of the most pernicious errors of the past.
          Surely, the facts of life do not warrant such optimism.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE BIBLE CLEARLY TEACHES IT. There are direct statements of
          Scripture that point to the universal sinfulness of man, such as
          1Ki_8:46; Psa_143:2; Pro_20:9; Ecc_7:20; Rom_3:1-12; Rom_3:19-20;
          Rom_3:23; Gal_3:22; Jas_3:2; 1Jn_1:8; 1Jn_1:10. Several passages of
          Scripture teach that sin is the heritage of man from the time of his
          birth, and is therefore present in human nature so early that it
          cannot possibly be considered as the result of imitation, Psa_51:5;
          Job_14:4; Joh_3:6. In Eph_2:3 Paul says of the Ephesians that they
          "were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest." In this passage
          the term "by nature" points to something inborn and original, as
          distinguished from what is subsequently acquired. Sin, then, is
          something original, in which all men participate, and which makes them
          guilty before God. Moreover, according to Scripture, death is visited
          even upon those who have never exercised a personal and conscious
          choice, Rom_5:12-14. This passage implies that sin exists in the case
          of infants prior to moral consciousness. Since infants die, and
          therefore the effect of sin is present in their case, it is but
          natural to assume that the cause is also present. Finally, Scripture
          also teaches that all men are under condemnation and therefore need
          the redemption which is in Christ Jesus. Children are never made an
          exception to this rule, cf. the preceding passages and also Joh_3:3;
        </p>
        <p>
          Joh_3:5; 1Jn_5:12. This is not contradicted by those passages which
          ascribe a certain righteousness to man, such as, Mat_9:12-13;
          Act_10:35; Rom_2:14; Php_3:6; 1Co_1:30, for this may be either civil
          righteousness, ceremonial or covenant righteousness, the righteousness
          of the law, or the righteousness which is in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE CONNECTION OF ADAM'S SIN WITH THAT OF THE RACE.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE DENIAL OF THIS CONNECTION. Some deny the causal connection of
          the sin of Adam with the sinfulness of the human race either wholly or
          in part.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Pelagians and Socinians deny absolutely that there is any necessary
          connection between our sin and the sin of Adam. The first sin was
          Adam's sin only and does not concern his posterity in any way. The
          most they will admit is that the evil example of Adam led to
          imitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Semi-Pelagians and the earlier Arminians teach that man inherited a
          natural inability from Adam, but is not responsible for this
          inability, so that no guilt attaches to it, and it may even be said
          that God is somewhat under obligation to provide a cure for it. The
          Wesleyan Arminians admit that this inborn corruption also involves
          guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The New School (New Haven) theory teaches that man is born with an
          inherent tendency to sin, in virtue of which his moral preference is
          invariably wrong; but that this tendency cannot itself be called sin,
          since sin always consists exclusively in conscious and intentional
          transgression of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. The Theology of crisis stresses the solidarity of sin in the human
          race, but denies that sin originated in an act of Adam in paradise.
          The fall belongs to pre- or super- history, and is already a thing of
          the past when the historical Adam appears upon the scene. It is the
          secret of God's predestination. The story of the fall is a myth. Adam
          appears as the type of Christ in so far as it can be seen in him that
          life without sin is possible in communion with God. Says Brunner: "In
          Adam all have sinned â€” that is the Biblical statement; but how? The
          Bible does not tell us that. The doctrine of original sin is read into
          it."40
        </p>
        <p>2. DIFFERENT THEORIES TO EXPLAIN THE CONNECTION.</p>
        <p>
          a. The realistic theory. The earliest method of explaining the
          connection between the sin of Adam and the guilt and pollution of all
          his descendants was the realistic theory. This theory is to the effect
          that human nature constitutes, not only generically but numerically as
          well, a single unit. Adam possessed the whole human nature, and in him
          it corrupted itself by its own voluntary apostatizing act in Adam.
          Individual men are not separate substances, but manifestations of the
          same general substance; they are numerically one. This universal human
          nature became corrupt and guilty in Adam, and consequently every
          individualization of it in the descendants of Adam is also corrupt and
          guilty from the very beginning of its existence. This means that all
          men actually sinned in Adam before the individualization of human
          nature began. This theory was accepted by some of the early Church
          Fathers and by some of the Scholastics, and was defended in more
          recent times by Dr. Shedd. However, it is open to several objections:
          (1) By representing the souls of men as individualizations of the
          general spiritual substance that was present in Adam, it would seem to
          imply that the substance of the soul is of a material nature, and thus
          to land us inevitably in some sort of materialism. (2) It is contrary
          to the testimony of consciousness and does not sufficiently guard the
          interests of human personality. Every man is conscious of being a
          separate personality, and therefore far more than a mere passing wave
          in the general ocean of existence. (3) It does not explain why Adam's
          descendants are held responsible for his first sin only, and not for
          his later sins, nor for the sins of all the generations of forefathers
          that followed Adam. (4) Neither does it give an answer to the
          important question, why Christ was not held responsible for the actual
          commission of sin in Adam, for He certainly shared the same human
          nature, the nature that actually sinned in Adam.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The doctrine of the covenant of works. This implies that Adam stood
          in a twofold relationship to his descendants, namely, that of the
          natural head of all mankind, and that of the representative head of
          the entire human race in the covenant of works. (1) The natural
          relationship. In his natural relationship Adam was the father of all
          mankind. As he was created by God he was subject to change, and had no
          rightful claim to an unchangeable state. He was in duty bound to obey
          God, and this obedience did not entitle him to any reward. On the
          other hand, if he sinned, he would become subject to corruption and to
          punishment, but the sin would be only his own, and could not be placed
          to the account of his descendants. Dabney holds that, according to the
          law that like begets like, his corruption would have passed on to his
          descendants. But however this may be â€” and it is rather useless to
          speculate about it â€” they certainly could not have been held
          responsible for this corruption. They could not have been considered
          guilty in Adam merely in virtue of the natural relationship in which
          Adam stood to the race. The usual Reformed representation is a
          different one. (2) The covenant relationship. To the natural
          relationship in which Adam stood to his descendants God graciously
          added a covenant relationship containing several positive elements:
          (a) An element of representation. God ordained that in this covenant
          Adam should not stand for himself only, but as the representative of
          all his descendants. Consequently, he was the head of the race not
          only in a parental, but also in a federal sense. (b) An element of
          probation. While apart from this covenant Adam and his descendants
          would have been in a continual state of trial, with a constant danger
          of sinning, the covenant guaranteed that persistent perseverance for a
          fixed period of time would be rewarded with the establishment of man
          in a permanent state of holiness and bliss. (c) An element of reward
          or punishment. According to the terms of the covenant Adam would
          obtain a rightful claim to eternal life, if he fulfilled the
          conditions of the covenant. And not only he, but all his descendants
          as well would have shared in this blessing. In its normal operation,
          therefore, the covenant arrangement would have been of incalculable
          benefit for mankind. But there was a possibility that man would
          disobey, thereby reversing the operation of the covenant, and in that
          case the results would naturally be correspondingly disastrous.
          Transgression of the covenant commandment would result in death. Adam
          chose the course of disobedience, corrupted himself by sin, became
          guilty in the sight of God, and as such subject to the sentence of
          death. And because he was the federal representative of the race, his
          disobedience affected all his descendants. In His righteous judgment
          God imputes the guilt of the first sin, committed by the head of the
          covenant, to all those that are federally related to him. And as a
          result they are born in a depraved and sinful condition as well, and
          this inherent corruption also involves guilt. This doctrine explains
          why only the first sin of Adam, and not his following sins nor the
          sins of our other forefathers, is imputed to us, and also safeguards
          the sinlessness of Jesus, for He was not a human person and therefore
          not in the covenant of works.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The theory of mediate imputation. This theory denies that the guilt
          of Adam's sin is directly imputed to his descendants, and represents
          the matter as follows: Adam's descendants derive their innate
          corruption from him by a process of natural generation, and only on
          the basis of that inherent depravity which they share with him are
          they also considered guilty of his apostasy. They are not born corrupt
          because they are guilty in Adam, but they are considered guilty
          because they are corrupt. Their condition is not based on their legal
          status, but their legal status on their condition. This theory, first
          advocated by Placeus, was adopted by the younger Vitringa and Venema,
          by several New England theologians, and by some of the New School
          theologians in the Presbyterian Church. This theory is objectionable
          for several reasons: (1) A thing cannot be mediated by its own
          consequences. The inherent depravity with which the descendants of
          Adam are born is already the result of Adam's sin, and therefore
          cannot be considered as the basis on which they are guilty of the sin
          of Adam. (2) It offers no objective ground whatsoever for the
          transmission of Adam's guilt and depravity to all his descendants. Yet
          there must be some objective legal ground for this. (3) If this theory
          were consistent, it ought to teach the mediate imputation of the sins
          of all previous generations to those following, for their joint
          corruption is passed on by generation. (4) It also proceeds on the
          assumption that there can be moral corruption that is not at the same
          time guilt, a corruption that does not in itself make one liable to
          punishment. (5) And finally, if the inherent corruption which is
          present in the descendants of Adam can be regarded as the legal ground
          for the explanation of something else, there is no more need of any
          mediate imputation.
