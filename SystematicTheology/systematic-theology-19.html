        <p>II. The Essential Character of Sin</p>
        <p>
          Sin is one of the saddest but also one of the most common phenomena of
          human life. It is a part of the common experience of mankind, and
          therefore forces itself upon the attention of all those who do not
          deliberately close their eyes to the realities of human life. Some may
          for a time dream of the essential goodness of man and speak
          indulgently of those separate words and actions that do not measure up
          to the ethical standards of good society as mere foibles and
          weaknesses, for which man is not responsible, and which readily yield
          to corrective measures; but as time goes on, and all measures of
          external reform fail, and the suppression of one evil merely serves to
          release another, such persons are inevitably disillusioned. They
          become conscious of the fact that they have merely been fighting the
          symptoms of some deep-seated malady, and that they are confronted, not
          merely with the problem of sins, that is, of separate sinful deeds,
          but with the much greater and deeper problem of sin. of an evil that
          is inherent in human nature. This is exactly what we are beginning to
          witness at the present time. Many Modernists at present do not
          hesitate to say that the doctrine of Rousseau respecting the inherent
          goodness of man has proved to be one of the most pernicious teachings
          of the Enlightenment, and now call for a greater measure of realism in
          the recognition of sin Thus Walter Horton, who pleads for a realistic
          theology and believes that this calls for the acceptance of some
          Marxian principles, says: "I believe that orthodox Christianity
          represents a profound insight into the whole human predicament. I
          believe that the basic human difficulty is that perversion of the
          will, that betrayal of divine trust, which is called sin; and I
          believe that sin is in a sense a racial disease, transmissible from
          generation to generation In affirming these things the Christian
          Fathers and the Protestant Reformers spoke as realists, and could have
          assembled masses of empirical evidence to support their views."37 In
          view of the fact that sin is real and that no man can get away from it
          in this present life, it is no wonder that philosophers as well as
          theologians undertook to grapple with the problem of sin, though in
          philosophy it is known as the problem of evil rather than as the
          problem of sin. We shall briefly consider some of the most important
          philosophical theories of evil before we state the Scriptural doctrine
          of sin.
        </p>
        <p>A. PHILOSOPHIC THEORIES RESPECTING THE NATURE OF EVIL.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE DUALISTIC THEORY. This is one of the views that were current in
          Greek philosophy. In the form of Gnosticism it found entrance into the
          early Church. It assumes the existence of an eternal principle of
          evil, and holds that in man the spirit represents the principle of
          good, and the body, that of evil. It is objectionable for several
          reasons: (a) The position is philosophically untenable, that there is
          something outside of God that is eternal and independent of His will.
          (b) This theory robs sin of its ethical character by making it
          something purely physical and independent of the human will, and
          thereby really destroys the idea of sin. (c) It also does away with
          the responsibility of man by representing sin as a physical necessity.
          The only escape from sin lies in deliverance from the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE THEORY THAT SIN IS MERELY PRIVATION. According to Leibnitz the
          present world is the best possible one. The existence of sin in it
          must be considered as unavoidable. It cannot be referred to the agency
          of God, and therefore must be regarded as a simple negation or
          privation, for which no efficient cause is needed. The limitations of
          the creature render it unavoidable. This theory makes sin a necessary
          evil, since creatures are necessarily limited, and sin is an
          unavoidable consequence of this limitation. Its attempt to avoid
          making God the author of sin is not successful, for even if sin is a
          mere negation requiring no efficient cause, God is nevertheless the
          author of the limitation from which it results. Moreover, it tends to
          obliterate the distinction between moral and physical evil, since it
          represents sin as little more than a misfortune which has befallen
          man. Consequently, it has a tendency to blunt man's sense of the evil
          or pollution of sin, to destroy the sense of guilt, and to abrogate
          man's moral responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE THEORY THAT SIN IS AN ILLUSION. For Spinoza, as for Leibnitz,
          sin is simply a defect, a limitation of which man is conscious; but
          while Leibnitz regards the notion of evil, arising from this
          limitation, as necessary, Spinoza holds that the resulting
          consciousness of sin is simply due to the inadequacy of man's
          knowledge, which fails to see everything sub specie aeternitatis, that
          is, in unity with the eternal and infinite essence of God. If man's
          knowledge were adequate, so that he saw everything in God, he would
          have no conception of sin; it would simply be non-existent for him.
          But this theory, representing sin as something purely negative, does
          not account for its terrible positive results, to which the universal
          experience of mankind testifies in the most convincing manner.
          Consistently carried through, it abrogates all ethical distinctions,
          and reduces such concepts as "moral character" and "moral conduct" to
          meaningless phrases. In fact, it reduces the whole life of man to an
          illusion: his knowledge, his experience, the testimony of conscience,
          and so on, for all his knowledge is inadequate. Moreover, it goes
          contrary to the experience of mankind, that the greatest intellects
          are often the greatest sinners, Satan being the greatest of all.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE THEORY THAT SIN IS A WANT OF GOD-CONSCIOUSNESS, DUE TO MAN'S
          SENSUOUS NATURE. This is the view of Schleiermacher. According to him
          man's consciousness of sin is dependent on his God-consciousness. When
          the sense of God awakens in man, he is at once conscious of the
          opposition of his lower nature to it. This opposition follows from the
          very constitution of his being, from his sensuous nature, from the
          soul's connection with a physical organism. It is therefore an
          inherent imperfection, but one which man feels as sin and guilt. Yet
          this does not make God the author of sin, since man wrongly conceives
          of this imperfection as sin. Sin has no objective existence, but
          exists only in man's consciousness. But this theory makes man
          constitutionally evil. The evil was present in man even in his
          original state, when the God-consciousness was not sufficiently strong
          to control the sensuous nature of man. It is in flagrant opposition to
          Scripture, when it holds that man wrongly adjudges this evil to be
          sin, and thus makes sin and guilt purely subjective. And though
          Schleiermacher wishes to avoid this conclusion, it does make God the
          responsible author of sin, for He is the creator of man's sensuous
          nature. It also rests upon an incomplete induction of facts, since it
          fails to take account of the fact that many of the most hateful sins
          of man do not pertain to his physical but to his spiritual nature,
          such as avarice, envy, pride, malice, and others. Moreover, it leads
          to the most absurd conclusions as, for instance, that asceticism, by
          weakening the sensuous nature, necessarily weakens the power of sin;
          that man becomes less sinful as his senses fail with age; that death
          is the only redeemer; and that disembodied spirits, including the
          devil himself, have no sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. THE THEORY OF SIN AS WANT OF TRUST IN GOD AND OPPOSITION TO HIS
          KINGDOM, DUE TO IGNORANCE. Like Schleiermacher, Ritschl too stresses
          the fact that sin is understood only from the standpoint of the
          Christian consciousness. They who are outside of the pale of the
          Christian religion, and they who are still strangers to the experience
          of redemption, have no knowledge of it. Under the influence of the
          redemptive work of God man becomes conscious of his lack of trust in
          God and of his opposition to the Kingdom of God, which is the highest
          good. Sin is not determined by man's attitude to the law of God, but
          by his relation to the purpose of God, to establish the Kingdom. Man
          imputes his failure to make the purpose of God his own to himself as
          guilt, but God regards it merely as ignorance, and because it is
          ignorance, it is pardonable. This view of Ritschl reminds us by way of
          contrast of the Greek dictum that knowledge is virtue. It fails
          completely to do justice to the Scriptural position that sin is above
          all transgression of the law of God, and therefore renders man guilty
          in the sight of God and worthy of condemnation. Moreover, the idea
          that sin is ignorance goes contrary to the voice of Christian
          experience. The man who is burdened with the sense of sin certainly
          does not feel that way about it. He is grateful, too, that not only
          the sins which he committed in ignorance are pardonable, but all the
          others as well, with the single exception of the blasphemy against the
          Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. THE THEORY THAT SIN IS SELFISHNESS. This position is taken among
          others by Mueller and A. H. Strong. Some who take this position
          conceive of selfishness merely as the opposite of altruism or
          benevolence; others understand by it the choice of self rather than
          God as the supreme object of love. Now this theory, especially when it
          conceives of selfishness as a putting of self in the place of God, is
          by far the best of the theories named. Yet it can hardly be called
          satisfactory. Though all selfishness is sin, and there is an element
          of selfishness in all sin, it cannot be said that selfishness is the
          essence of sin. Sin can be properly defined only with reference to the
          law of God, a reference that is completely lacking in the definition
          under consideration. Moreover, there is a great deal of sin in which
          selfishness is not at all the governing principle. When a
          poverty-stricken father sees his wife and children pine away for lack
          of food, and in his desperate desire to help them finally resorts to
          theft, this can hardly be called pure selfishness. It may even be that
          the thought of self was entirely absent. Enmity to God, hardness of
          heart, impenitence, and unbelief, are all heinous sins, but cannot
          simply be qualified as selfishness. And certainly the view that all
          virtue is disinterestedness or benevolence, which seems to be a
          necessary corollary of the theory under consideration, at least in one
          of its forms, does not hold. An act does not cease to be virtuous,
          when its performance meets and satisfies some demand of our nature.
          Moreover, justice, fidelity, humility, forbearance, patience, and
          other virtues may be cultivated or practiced, not as forms of
          benevolence, but as virtues inherently excellent, not merely as
          promoting the happiness of others, but for what they are in
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. THE THEORY THAT SIN CONSISTS IN THE OPPOSITION OF THE LOWER
          PROPENSITIES OF HUMAN NATURE TO A GRADUALLY DEVELOPING MORAL
          CONSCIOUSNESS. This view was developed, as we pointed out in the
          preceding, by Tennant in his Hulsean Lectures. It is the doctrine of
          sin constructed according to the theory of evolution. Natural impulses
          and inherited qualities, derived from the brute, form the material of
          sin, but do not actually become sin until they are indulged in
          contrary to the gradually awakening moral sense of mankind. The
          theories of McDowall and Fiske move along similar lines. The theory as
          presented by Tennant halts somewhat between the Scriptural view of man
          and that presented by the theory of evolution, inclining now to the
          one and anon to the other side. It assumes that man had a free will
          even before the awakening of his moral consciousness, so that he was
          able to choose when he was placed before a moral ideal; but does not
          explain how we can conceive of a free and indeterminate will in a
          process of evolution. It limits sin to those transgressions of the
          moral law, which are committed with a clear consciousness of a moral
          ideal and are therefore condemned by conscience as evil. As a matter
          of fact, it is merely the old Pelagian view of sin grafted into the
          theory of evolution, and is therefore open to all the objections with
          which Pelagianism is burdened.
        </p>
        <p>
          The radical defect in all these theories is that they seek to define
          sin without taking into consideration that sin is essentially a
          breaking away from God, opposition to God, and transgression of the
          law of God. Sin should always be defined in terms of man's relation to
          God and to His will as expressed in the moral law.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE SCRIPTURAL IDEA OF SIN.</p>
        <p>
          In giving the Scriptural idea of sin it is necessary to call attention
          to several particulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. SIN IS A SPECIFIC KIND OF EVIL. At the present time we hear a great
          deal about evil, and comparatively little about sin; and this is
          rather misleading. Not all evil is sin. Sin should not be confused
          with physical evil, with that which is injurious or calamitous. It is
          possible to speak not only of sin but also of sickness as an evil, but
          then the word "evil" is used in two totally different senses. Above
          the physical lies the ethical sphere, in which the contrast between
          moral good and evil applies, and it is only in this sphere that we can
          speak of sin. And even in this sphere it is not desirable to
          substitute the word "evil" for "sin" without any further
          qualification, for the latter is more specific than the former. Sin is
          a moral evil. Most of the names that are used in Scripture to
          designate sin point to its moral character. Chatta'th directs
          attention to it as an action that misses the mark and consists in a
          deviation from the right way. ' Avel and 'avon indicate that it is a
          want of integrity and rectitude, a departure from the appointed path.
          Pesha' refers to it as a revolt or a refusal of subjection to rightful
          authority, a positive transgression of the law, and a breaking of the
          covenant. And resha' points to it as a wicked and guilty departure
          from the law. Furthermore, it is designated as guilt by 'asham, as
          unfaithfulness and treason, by ma'al, as vanity, by ' aven, and as
          perversion or distortion of nature (crookedness) by 'avah. The
          corresponding New Testament words, such as hamartia, adikia,
          parabasis, paraptoma, anomia, paranomia, and others, point to the same
          ideas. In view of the use of these words, and of the way in which the
          Bible usually speaks of sin, there can be no doubt about its ethical
          character. It is not a calamity that came upon man unawares, poisoned
          his life, and ruined his happiness, but an evil course which man has
          deliberately chosen to follow and which carries untold misery with it.
          Fundamentally, it is not something passive, such as a weakness, a
          fault, or an imperfection, for which we cannot be held responsible,
          but an active opposition to God, and a positive transgression of His
          law, which constitutes guilt. Sin is the result of a free but evil
          choice of man. This is the plain teaching of the Word of God,
          Gen_3:1-6; Isa_48:8; Rom_1:18-32; 1Jn_3:4. The application of the
          philosophy of evolution to the study of the Old Testament led some
          scholars to the conviction that the ethical idea of sin was not
          developed until the time of the prophets, but this view is not borne
          out by the way in which the earliest books of the Bible speak of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. SIN HAS AN ABSOLUTE CHARACTER. In the ethical sphere the contrast
          between good and evil is absolute. There is no neutral condition
          between the two. While there are undoubtedly degrees in both, there
          are no gradations between the good and the evil. The transition from
          the one to the other is not of a quantitative, but of a qualitative
          character. A moral being that is good does not become evil by simply
          diminishing his goodness, but only by a radical qualitative change, by
          turning to sin. Sin is not a lesser degree of goodness, but a positive
          evil. This is plainly taught in the Bible. He who does not love God is
          thereby characterized as evil. Scripture knows of no position of
          neutrality. It urges the wicked to turn to righteousness, and
          sometimes speaks of the righteous as falling into evil; but it does
          not contain a single indication that either the one or the other ever
          lands in a neutral position. Man is either on the right side or on the
          wrong side, Mat_10:32-33; Mat_12:30; Luk_11:23; Jas_2:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. SIN ALWAYS HAS RELATION TO GOD AND HIS WILL. The older dogmaticians
          realized that it was impossible to have a correct conception of sin
          without contemplating it in relation to God and His will, and
          therefore emphasized this aspect and usually spoke of sin as "lack of
          conformity to the law of God." This is undoubtedly a correct formal
          definition of sin. But the question arises, Just what is the material
          content of the law? What does it demand? If this question is answered,
          it will be possible to determine what sin is in a material sense. Now
          there is no doubt about it that the great central demand of the law is
          love to God. And if from the material point of view moral goodness
          consists in love to God, then moral evil must consist in the opposite.
          It is separation from God, opposition to God, hatred of God, and this
          manifests itself in constant transgression of the law of God in
          thought, word, and deed. The following passages clearly show that
          Scripture contemplates sin in relation to God and His law, either as
          written on the tablets of the heart, or as given by Moses, Rom_1:32;
          Rom_2:12-14; Rom_4:15; Jas_2:9; 1Jn_3:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. SIN INCLUDES BOTH GUILT AND POLLUTION. Guilt is the state of
          deserving condemnation or of being liable to punishment for the
          violation of a law or a moral requirement. It expresses the relation
          which sin bears to justice or to the penalty of the law. But even so
          the word has a twofold meaning. It may denote an inherent quality of
          the sinner, namely, his demerit, ill-desert, or guiltiness, which
          renders him worthy of punishment. Dabney speaks of this as "potential
          guilt." It is inseparable from sin, is never found in one who is not
          personally a sinner, and is permanent, so that once established, it
          cannot be removed by pardon. But it may also denote the obligation to
          satisfy justice, to pay the penalty of sin, "actual guilt," as Dabney
          calls it.38 It is not inherent in man, but is the penal enactment of
          the lawgiver, who fixes the penalty of the guilt. It may be removed by
          the satisfaction of the just demands of the law personally or
          vicariously. While many deny that sin includes guilt, this does not
          comport with the fact that sin was threatened and is indeed visited
          with punishment, and clearly contradicts the plain statements of
          Scripture, Mat_6:12; Rom_3:19; Rom_5:18; Eph_2:3. By pollution we
          understand the inherent corruption to which every sinner is subject.
          This is a reality in the life of every individual. It is not
          conceivable without guilt, though guilt as included in a penal
          relationship, is conceivable without immediate pollution. Yet it is
          always followed by pollution. Every one who is guilty in Adam is, as a
          result, also born with a corrupt nature. The pollution of sin is
          clearly taught in such passages as Job_14:4; Jer_17:9; Mat_7:15-20;
          Rom_8:5-8; Eph_4:17-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. SIN HAS ITS SEAT IN THE HEART. Sin does not reside in any one
          faculty of the soul, but in the heart, which in Scriptural psychology
          is the central organ of the soul, out of which are the issues of life.
          And from this center its influence and operations spread to the
          intellect, the will, the affections, in short, to the entire man,
          including his body. In his sinful state the whole man is the object of
          God's displeasure. There is a sense in which it can be said that sin
          originated in the will of man, but then the will does not designate
          some actual volition as much as it does the volitional nature of man.
          There was a tendency of the heart underlying the actual volition when
          sin entered the world. This view is in perfect harmony with the
          representations of Scripture in such passages as the following:
          Pro_4:23; Jer_17:9; Mat_15:19-20; Luk_6:45; Heb_3:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. SIN DOES NOT CONSIST EXCLUSIVELY IN OVERT ACTS. Sin does not
          consist only in overt acts, but also in sinful habits and in a sinful
          condition of the soul. These three are related to one another as
          follows: The sinful state is the basis of the sinful habits, and these
          manifest themselves in sinful deeds. There is also truth, however, in
          the contention that repeated sinful deeds lead to the establishment of
          sinful habits. The sinful acts and dispositions of man must be
          referred to and find their explanation in a corrupt nature. The
          passages referred to in the preceding paragraph substantiate this
          view, for they clearly prove that the state or condition of man is
          thoroughly sinful. And if the question should still be raised, whether
          the thoughts and affections of the natural man, called "flesh" in
          Scripture, should be regarded as constituting sin, it might be
          answered by pointing to such passages as the following: Mat_5:22;
          Mat_5:28; Rom_7:7; Gal_5:17; Gal_5:24, and others. In conclusion it
          may be said that sin may be defined as lack of conformity to the moral
          law of God, either in act, disposition, or state.

        <p>C. THE PELAGIAN VIEW OF SIN.</p>
        <p>
          The Pelagian view of sin is quite different from that presented above.
          The only point of similarity lies in this that the Pelagian also
          considers sin in relation to the law of God, and regards it as a
          transgression of the law. But in all other particulars his conception
          differs widely from the Scriptural and Augustinian view.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. STATEMENT OF THE PELAGIAN VIEW. Pelagius takes his startingpoint in
          the natural ability of man. His fundamental proposition is: God has
          commanded man to do that which is good; hence the latter must have the
          ability to do it. This means that man has a free will in the absolute
          sense of the word, so that it is possible for him to decide for or
          against that which is good, and also to do the good as well as the
          evil. The decision is not dependent on any moral character in man, for
          the will is entirely indeterminate. Whether a man will do good or evil
          simply depends on his free and independent will. From this it follows,
          of course, that there is no such thing as a moral development of the
          individual. Good and evil are located in the separate actions of man.
          From this fundamental position the doctrinal teaching of Pelagius
          respecting sin naturally follows. Sin consists only in the separate
          acts of the will. There is no such thing as a sinful nature, neither
          are there sinful dispositions. Sin is always a deliberate choice of
          evil by a will which is perfectly free, and can just as well choose
          and follow the good. But if this is so, then the conclusion inevitably
          follows that Adam was not created in a state of positive holiness, but
          in a state of moral equilibrium. His condition was one of moral
          neutrality. He was neither good nor bad, and therefore had no moral
          character; but he chose the course of evil, and thus became sinful.
          Inasmuch as sin consists only in separate acts of the will, the idea
          of its propagation by procreation is absurd. A sinful nature, if such
          a thing should exist, might be passed on from father to son, but
          sinful acts cannot be so propagated. This is in the nature of the case
          an impossibility. Adam was the first sinner, but his sin was in no
          sense passed on to his descendants. There is no such thing as original
          sin. Children are born in a state of neutrality, beginning exactly
          where Adam began, except that they are handicapped by the evil
          examples which they see round about them. Their future course must be
          determined by their own free choice. The universality of sin is
          admitted, because all experience testifies to it. It is due to
          imitation and to the habit of sinning that is gradually formed.
          Strictly speaking, there are, on the Pelagian standpoint, no sinners,
          but only separate sinful acts. This makes a religious conception of
          the history of the race utterly impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. OBJECTIONS TO THE PELAGIAN VIEW. There are several weighty
          objections to the Pelagian view of sin, of which the following are the
          most important:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The fundamental position that man is held responsible by God only
          for what he is able to do, is absolutely contrary to the testimony of
          conscience and to the Word of God. It is an undeniable fact that, as a
          man increases in sin, his ability to do good decreases. He becomes in
          an ever greater measure the slave of sin. According to the theory
          under consideration this would also involve a lessening of his
          responsibility. But this is equivalent to saying that sin itself
          gradually redeems its victims by relieving them of their
          responsibility. The more sinful a man, the less responsible he is.
          Against this position conscience registers a loud protest. Paul does
          not say that the hardened sinners, which he describes in Rom_1:18-32
          were virtually without responsibility, but regards them as worthy of
          death. Jesus said of the wicked Jews who gloried in their freedom, but
          manifested their extreme wickedness by seeking to kill Him, that they
          were bond- servants of sin, did not understand His speech, because
          they could not hear His word, and would die in their sins,
          Joh_8:21-22; Joh_8:34; Joh_8:43. Though slaves of sin, they were yet
          responsible.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. To deny that man has by nature a moral character, is simply
          bringing him down to the level of the animal. According to this view
          everything in the life of man that is not a conscious choice of the
          will, is deprived of all moral quality. But the consciousness of men
          in general testifies to the fact that the contrast between good and
          evil also applies to man's tendencies, desires, moods, and affections,
          and that these also have a moral character. In Pelagianism sin and
          virtue are reduced to superficial appendages of man, in no way
          connected with his inner life. That the estimate of Scripture is quite
          different appears from the following passages: Jer_17:9; Psa_51:6;
          Psa_51:10; Mat_15:19; Jas_4:1-2.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. A choice of the will that is in no way determined by man's
          character, is not only psychologically unthinkable, but also ethically
          worthless. If a good deed of man simply happens to fall out as it
          does, and no reason can be given why it did not turn out to be the
          opposite, in other words, if the deed is not an expression of man's
          character, it lacks all moral value. It is only as an exponent of
          character that a deed has the moral value that is ascribed to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. The Pelagian theory can give no satisfactory account of the
          universality of sin. The bad example of parents and grandparents
          offers no real explanation. The mere abstract possibility of man's
          sinning, even when strengthened by the evil example, does not explain
          how it came to pass that all men actually sinned. How can it be
          accounted for that the will invariably turned in the direction of sin,
          and never in the opposite direction? It is far more natural to think
          of a general disposition to sin.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC VIEW OF SIN.</p>
        <p>
          Though the Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent are somewhat
          ambigious in the doctrine of sin, the prevailing Roman Catholic view
          of sin may be expressed as follows: Real sin always consists in a
          conscious act of the will. It is true that the dispositions and habits
          that are not in accord with the will of God, are of a sinful
          character; yet they cannot be called sins in the strict sense of the
          word. The indwelling concupiscence, which lies back of sin, gained the
          upper hand in man in paradise, and thus precipitated the loss of the
          donum superadditum of original righteousness, cannot be regarded as
          sin, but only as the fomes or fuel of sin. The sinfulness of Adam's
          descendants is primarily only a negative condition, consisting in the
          absence of something that ought to be present, that is, of original
          righteousness, which is not essential to human nature. Something
          essential is wanting only if, as some hold, the justitia naturalis was
          also lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objections to this view are perfectly evident from what was said
          in connection with the Pelagian theory. A bare reminder of them would
          seem to be quite sufficient. In so far as it holds that real sin
          consists only in a deliberate choice of the will and in overt acts,
          the objections raised against Pelagianism are pertinent. The idea that
          original righteousness was supernaturally added to man's natural
          constitution, and that its loss did not detract from human nature, is
          an un-Scriptural idea, as was pointed out in our discussion of the
          image of God in man. According to the Bible concupiscence is sin, real
          sin, and the root of many sinful actions. This was brought out when
          the Biblical view of sin was considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY. Has philosophy succeeded in explaining
          the origin of sin? Does Scripture bear out the view that sin
          originally had no ethical quality? What objection is there to the view
          that sin is mere privation? Must we conceive of sin as a substance?
          With whose name is this view associated? Does this sin exist apart
          from the sinner? How can we prove that sin must always be judged by
          the law of God? Did Paul favor the old Greek dualism, when he spoke of
          "the body of sin" and used the term "flesh" to denote man's sinful
          nature? Is the present tendency to speak of 'evil' ratherthan of 'sin'
          commendable? What is meant by the social interpretation of sin? Does
          this recognize sin for what it is fundamentally?
