        <p>VII. The Intercessory Work of Christ</p>
        <p>
          The priestly work of Christ is not limited to the sacrificial offering
          of Himself on the cross. The representation is sometimes given that,
          while Christ was a Priest on earth, He is a King in heaven. This
          creates the impression that His priestly work is finished, which is by
          no means correct. Christ is not only an earthly but also, and
          especially, a heavenly High Priest. He is even while seated at the
          right hand of God in heavenly majesty, "a minister of the sanctuary,
          and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man." Heb_8:2.
          He only began His priestly work on earth, and is completing it in
          heaven. In the strict sense of the word He is not reckoned among the
          earthly priests, who were but shadows of a coming reality, Heb_8:4. He
          is the true, that is, the real Priest, serving at the real sanctuary,
          of which the tabernacle of Israel was but an imperfect shadow. At the
          same time He is now the Priest upon the throne, our Intercessor with
          the Father.
        </p>
        <p>A. SCRIPTURAL PROOF FOR THE INTERCESSORY WORK OF CHRIST.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE INTERCESSORY WORK OF CHRIST SYMBOLIZED. While the sacrificial
          work of Christ was symbolized primarily by the priestly functions at
          the brazen altar and the sacrifices that were brought upon it, His
          intercessory work was prefigured by the daily burning of incense on
          the golden altar in the Holy Place. The constantly rising cloud of
          incense was not only a symbol of the prayers of Israel, but also a
          type of the high priestly prayer of our great High Priest. This
          symbolic action of burning incense was not dissociated from, but most
          closely connected with, the bringing of the sacrifices at the brazen
          altar. It was connected with the application of the blood of the more
          important sin offerings, which was applied to the horns of the golden
          altar, also called the altar of incense, was sprinkled towards the
          veil, and on the great Day of Atonement was even brought within the
          Holy of Holies and sprinkled upon the mercy-seat. This manipulation of
          the blood symbolized the presentation of the sacrifice to God, who
          dwelt between the cherubim. The Holy of Holies was clearly a symbol
          and type of the city four-square, the heavenly Jerusalem. There is
          still another connection between the sacrificial work at the brazen
          altar and the symbolical intercession at the golden altar. The fact
          that the incense might be burned only on living coals taken from the
          altar of burnt-offering was an indication of the fact that the
          intercession was based on the sacrifice and would be effective in no
          other way. This clearly indicates that the intercessory work of Christ
          in heaven is based on His accomplished sacrificial work, and is
          acceptable only on that basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. NEW TESTAMENT INDICATIONS OF CHRIST'S INTERCESSORY WORK. The term
          parakletos is applied to Christ. The word is found only in Joh_14:16,
          Joh_14:26; Joh_15:26; 1Jn_2:1. It is rendered "Comforter" wherever it
          is found in the Gospel of John, but "Advocate" in the single passage
          in which it is found in the First Epistle of John. The form is a
          passive, and can therefore, says Westcott, "properly mean only 'one
          called to the side of another,' and that with the secondary notion of
          counseling or aiding him."53 He points out that the word has that
          meaning in classical Greek, in Philo, and also in the writings of the
          Rabbis. Many of the Greek Fathers, however, gave the word an active
          sense, rendered it "Comforter," and thus gave undue prominence to what
          is but a secondary application of the term, though they felt that this
          meaning would not fit in 1Jn_2:1. The word, then, denotes one who is
          called in for aid, an advocate, one who pleads the cause of another
          and also gives him wise counsel. Naturally, the work of such an
          advocate may bring comfort, and therefore he can also in a secondary
          sense be called a comforter. Christ is explicitly called our Advocate
          only in 1Jn_2:1, but by implication also in Joh_14:16. The promise,
          "And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter,
          that He may be with you forever," clearly implied that Christ was also
          a parakletos. The Gospel of John regularly applies the term to the
          Holy Spirit. There are therefore two Advocates, Christ and the Holy
          Spirit. Their work is partly identical and partly different. When
          Christ was on earth, He was the Advocate of the disciples, pleading
          their cause against the world and serving them with wise counsel, and
          the Holy Spirit is now continuing that work in the Church. In so far
          the work is identical, but there is also a difference. Christ as our
          Advocate pleads the believer's cause with the Father against Satan,
          the accuser (Zec_3:1; Heb_7:25; 1Jn_2:1; Rev_12:10), while the Holy
          Spirit not only pleads the cause of believers against the world
          (Joh_16:8), but also pleads the cause of Christ with believers and
          serves them with wise counsel, (Joh_14:26; Joh_15:26; Joh_16:14).
          Briefly, we can also say that Christ pleads our cause with God, while
          the Holy Spirit pleads God's cause with us. Other New Testament
          passages which speak of the intercessory work of Christ are found in
          Rom_8:24; Heb_7:25; Heb_9:24.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE NATURE OF CHRIST'S INTERCESSORY WORK.</p>
        <p>
          It is evident that this work of Christ may not be dissociated from His
          atoning sacrifice, which forms its necessary basis. It is but the
          continuation of the priestly work of Christ, carrying it to
          completion. Compared with the sacrificial work of Christ His ministry
          of intercession receives but little attention. Even in evangelical
          circles the impression is often given, though perhaps without
          intending it, that the work accomplished by the Saviour on earth was
          far more important than the services which He now renders in heaven.
          It seems to be little understood that in the Old Testament the daily
          ministration at the temple culminated in the burning of incense, which
          symbolized the ministry of intercession; and that the annual ritual on
          the great Day of Atonement reached its highest point, when the high
          priest passed beyond the veil with the atoning blood. Neither can it
          be said that the ministry of intercession is sufficiently understood.
          This may be the cause, but may also be the result, of the widespread
          failure of Christians to rivet the attention on it. The prevailing
          idea is that the intercession of Christ consists exclusively in the
          prayers which He offers for His people. Now it cannot be denied that
          these form an important part of the intercessory work of Christ, but
          they are not the whole of it. The fundamental point to remember is
          that the ministry of intercession should not be dissociated from the
          atonement, since they are but two aspects of the same redemptive work
          of Christ, and the two may be said to merge into one. Martin finds
          that the two constantly appear in juxtaposition and are so closely
          related in Scripture, that he feels justified in making the following
          statement: "The essence of the Intercession is Atonement; and the
          Atonement is essentially an Intercession. Or, perhaps, to put the
          paradox more mildly: The Atonement is real, â€” real sacrifice and
          offering, and not mere passive endurance, â€” because it is in its
          very nature an active and infallible intercession; while, on the other
          hand, the Intercession is real intercession, â€” judicial,
          representative, and priestly intercession, and not a mere exercise of
          influence, â€” because it is essentially an Atonement or
          substitutionary oblation, once perfected on Calvary, now perpetually
          presented and undergoing perpetual acceptance in heaven."54 Analyzing
          it, we find the following elements in the intercession of Christ:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Just as the high priest on the great Day of Atonement entered the
          Holy of Holies with the completed sacrifice, to present it to God, so
          Christ entered the heavenly Holy Place with His completed, perfect,
          and all-sufficient sacrifice, and offered it to the Father. And just
          as the high priest, on entering the Holy Place, came into the presence
          of God, symbolically bearing the tribes of Israel on His breast, so
          Christ appeared before God as the representative of His people, and
          thus reinstated humanity in the presence of God. It is to this fact
          that the writer of Hebrews refers when he says: "For Christ entered
          not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true;
          but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us,"
          Heb_9:24. Reformed theologians often directed attention to it that the
          perpetual presence of the completed sacrifice of Christ before God
          contains in itself an element of intercession as a constant reminder
          of the perfect atonement of Jesus Christ. It is something like the
          blood of the passover, of which the Lord said: "And the blood shall be
          to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the
          blood, I will pass over you." Exo_12:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There is also a judicial element in the intercession, just as there
          is in the atonement. Through the atonement Christ met all the just
          demands of the law, so that no legal charges can justly be brought
          against those for whom He paid the price. However, Satan the accuser
          is ever bent on bringing charges against the elect; but Christ meets
          them all by pointing to His completed work. He is the Paraklete, the
          Advocate, for His people, answering all the charges that are brought
          against them. We are reminded of this not only by the name
          "Paraklete," but also by the words of Paul in Rom_8:33-34 : "Who shall
          lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth;
          who is he that condemneth? It is Jesus Christ that died, yea rather,
          that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who
          also maketh intercession for us." Here the judicial element is clearly
          present. Cf. also Zec_3:1-2.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Not only does the intercessory work of Christ bear on our judicial
          state; it also relates to our moral condition, our gradual
          sanctification. When we address the Father in His name, He sanctifies
          our prayers. They need this, because they are often so imperfect,
          trivial, superficial, and even insincere, while they are addressed to
          One who is perfect in holiness and majesty. And besides rendering our
          prayers acceptable, He also sanctifies our services in the Kingdom of
          God. This is also necessary, because we are often conscious of the
          fact that they do not spring from the purest motives; and that even
          when they do, they are far from that perfection that would make them,
          in themselves, acceptable to a holy God. The blight of sin rests upon
          them all. Therefore Peter says: "Unto whom coming, a living stone,
          rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious, ye also as
          living stones are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood,
          to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus
          Christ. " Christ's ministry of intercession is also a ministry of
          loving care for His people. He helps them in their difficulties, their
          trials, and their temptations. "For we have not a high priest which
          cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that
          hath been in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin: for
          in that He himself hath suffered, being tempted, He is able to succor
          them that are tempted." Heb_4:15; Heb_2:18.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. And in and through it all there is, finally, also the element of
          prayer for the people of God. If the intercession is of a piece with
          the atoning work of Christ, it follows that the prayer of intercession
          must have reference to the things pertaining to God (Heb_5:1), to the
          completion of the work of redemption. That this element is included,
          is quite evident from the intercessory prayer in Joh_17:1-26, where
          Christ explicitly says that He prays for the apostles and for those
          who through their word will believe in Him. It is a consoling thought
          that Christ is praying for us, even when we are negligent in our
          prayer life; that He is presenting to the Father those spiritual needs
          which were not present to our minds and which we often neglect to
          include in our prayers; and that He prays for our protection against
          the dangers of which we are not even conscious, and against the
          enemies which threaten us, though we do not notice it. He is praying
          that our faith may not cease, and that we may come out victoriously in
          the end.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE PERSONS FOR WHOM AND THE THINGS FOR WHICH HE INTERCEDES.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE PERSONS FOR WHOM HE INTERCEDES. The intercessory work is, as
          has been said, simply the complement of His redemptive priestly work,
          and is therefore equal to it in extent. Christ intercedes for all
          those for whom He has made atonement, and for those only. This may be
          inferred from the limited character of the atonement, and also from
          such passages as Rom_8:34; Heb_7:25; Heb_9:24, in every one of which
          the word "us" refers to believers. Moreover, in the high priestly
          prayer, recorded in Joh_17:1-26, Jesus tells us that He prays for His
          immediate disciples and "for them also that believe on me through
          their word," Joh_17:9; Joh_17:20. In Joh_17:9 He makes a very explicit
          statement respecting the limitation of His high priestly prayer: "I
          pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast
          given me." And from Joh_17:20 we can learn that He does not intercede
          for present believers only, but for all the elect, whether they are
          already believers, or will believe some time in the future. The
          intercessor is mindful of each one of those that are given unto Him,
          Luk_21:32; Rev_3:5. Lutherans distinguish between a general
          intercession of Christ for all men, and a special intercession for the
          elect only. For proof they appeal to Luk_23:34, which contains
          Christ's prayer for His enemies, but that prayer need not be
          considered as a part of the official intercessory work of Christ.
          Dabney believes that it was, and that the objects of this prayer were
          later on converted. But it is also possible that this prayer was
          simply a prayer such as Christ taught all his followers to pray for
          their enemies, a prayer to ward off an immediate and terrible
          punishment for the enormous crime committed. Cf. Mat_5:44.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE THINGS FOR WHICH CHRIST INTERCEDES. Christ has a great deal to
          pray for in His intercessory prayer. We can only give a brief
          indication of some of the things for which He prays. He prays that the
          elect who have not yet come to Him may be brought into a state of
          grace; that those who have already come may receive pardon for their
          daily sins, that is, may experience the continued application to them
          of the fruits of justification; that believers may be kept from the
          accusations and temptations of Satan; that the saints may be
          progressively sanctified, Joh_17:17; that their intercourse with
          heaven may be kept up, Heb_4:14; Heb_4:16; Heb_10:21-22; that the
          services of the people of God may be accepted, 1Pe_2:5; and that they
          may at last enter upon their perfect inheritance in heaven, Joh_17:24.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS INTERCESSION.</p>
        <p>
          There are especially three characteristics of the intercessory work of
          Christ, to which attention should be directed:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE CONSTANCY OF HIS INTERCESSION. We need not only a Saviour who
          has completed an objective work for us in the past, but also one who
          is daily engaged in securing for His own the subjective application of
          the fruits of the accomplished sacrifice, Tens of thousands of people
          call for His attention at once, and a moment's intermission would
          prove fatal to their interests. Therefore He is always on the alert.
          He is alive to all their wants, and none of their prayers escape Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE AUTHORITATIVE CHARACTER OF HIS INTERCESSION. It is not
          altogether correct to represent Him as a suppliant at the throne of
          God, begging favors of His Father for His people. His prayer is not
          the petition of the creature to the Creator, but the request of the
          Son to the Father. "The consciousness of His equal dignity, of His
          potent and prevailing intercession, speaks out in this, that as often
          as He asks, or declares that He will ask, anything of the Father, it
          is always eroto, eroteso an asking, that is, as upon equal terms
          (Joh_14:16; Joh_16:26; Joh_17:9; Joh_17:15; Joh_17:20), never aiteo or
          aiteso."55 Christ stands before the Father as an authorized
          intercessor, and as one who can present legal claims. He can say:
          "Father, I desire that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me
          where I am," Joh_17:24.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE EFFICACY OF HIS INTERCESSION. The intercessory prayer of Christ
          is a prayer that never fails. At the grave of Lazarus the Lord
          expressed the assurance that the Father always hears Him, Joh_11:42.
          His intercessory prayers for His people are based on His atoning work;
          He has merited all that He asks, and therein lies the assurance that
          those prayers are effective. They will accomplish all that He desires.
          The people of God may derive comfort from the fact that they have such
          a prevailing intercessor with the Father.
