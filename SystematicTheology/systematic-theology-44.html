        <p>V. The Mystical Union</p>
        <p>
          Calvin repeatedly expresses the idea that the sinner cannot share in
          the saving benefits of Christ's redemptive work, unless he be in union
          with Him, and thus emphasizes a very important truth. As Adam was the
          representative head of the old humanity, so Christ is the
          representative head of the new humanity. All the blessings of the
          covenant of grace flow from Him who is the Mediator of the covenant.
          Even the very first blessing of the saving grace of God which we
          receive already presupposes a union with the Person of the Mediator.
          It is exactly at this point that we find one of the most
          characteristic differences between the operations and blessings of
          special and those of common grace. The former can be received and
          enjoyed only by those who are in union with Christ, while the latter
          can be and are enjoyed also by those who are not reckoned in Christ,
          and therefore are not one with Him. Every spiritual blessing which
          believers receive flows to them out of Christ. Hence Jesus in speaking
          of the coming Paraklete could say unto His disciples: "He shall
          glorify me; for He shall take of mine, and shall declare it unto you,"
          Joh_16:14. Subjectively, the union between Christ and believers is
          effected by the Holy Spirit in a mysterious and supernatural way, and
          for that reason is generally designated as the unio mystica or
          mystical union.
        </p>
        <p>A. NATURE OF THE MYSTICAL UNION.</p>
        <p>
          Lutherans generally treat the doctrine of the mystical union
          anthropologically, and therefore conceive of it as established by
          faith. Hence they naturally take it up at a later point in their
          soteriology. But this method fails to do full justice to the idea of
          our union with Christ, since it loses sight of the eternal basis of
          the union and of its objective realization in Christ, and deals
          exclusively with the subjective realization of it in our lives, and
          even so only with our personal conscious entrance into this union.
          Reformed theology, on the other hand, deals with the union of
          believers with Christ theologically, and as such does far greater
          justice to this important subject. In doing so it employs the term
          "mystical union" in a broad sense as a designation not only of the
          subjective union of Christ and believers, but also of the union that
          lies back of it, that is basic to it, and of which it is only the
          culminating expression, namely, the federal union of Christ and those
          who are His in the counsel of redemption, the mystical union ideally
          established in that eternal counsel, and the union as it is
          objectively effected in the incarnation and the redemptive work of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE FEDERAL UNION OF CHRIST WITH THOSE WHOM THE FATHER HAS GIVEN
          HIM, IN THE COUNSEL OF REDEMPTION. In the counsel of peace Christ
          voluntarily took upon Himself to be the Head and Surety of the elect,
          destined to constitute the new humanity, and as such to establish
          their righteousness before God by paying the penalty for their sin and
          by rendering perfect obedience to the law and thus securing their
          title to everlasting life. In that eternal covenant the sin of His
          people was imputed to Christ, and His righteousness was imputed to
          them. This imputation of the righteousness of Christ to His people in
          the counsel of redemption is sometimes represented as a justification
          from eternity. It is certainly the eternal basis of our justification
          by faith, and is the ground on which we receive all spiritual
          blessings and the gift of life eternal. And this being so, it is basic
          to the whole of soteriology, and even to the first stages in the
          application of the work of redemption, such as regeneration and
          internal calling.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE UNION OF LIFE IDEALLY ESTABLISHED IN THE COUNSEL OF REDEMPTION.
          In the case of the first Adam there was not only a federal, but also a
          natural and organic union between him and his descendants. There was
          the tie of a common life between him and all his progeny, and this
          made it possible that the blessings of the covenant of works, if these
          had eventuated, could have been passed on to the whole organism of
          mankind in an organic way. A somewhat similar situation obtained in
          the case of the last Adam as the representative Head of the covenant
          of redemption. Like the first Adam, He did not represent a
          conglomeration of disjointed individuals, but a body of men and women
          who were to derive their life from Him, to be united by spiritual
          ties, and thus to form a spiritual organism. Ideally this body, which
          is the Church, was already formed in the covenant of redemption, and
          formed in union with Christ, and this union made it possible that all
          the blessings merited by Christ could be passed on to those whom He
          represented in an organic way. They were conceived of as a glorious
          body, a new humanity, sharing the life of Jesus Christ. It was in
          virtue of that union, as it was realized in the course of history,
          that Christ could say: "Behold, I and the children whom God hath given
          me," Heb_2:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE UNION OF LIFE OBJECTIVELY REALIZED IN CHRIST. In virtue of the
          legal or representative union established in the covenant of
          redemption Christ became incarnate as the substitute for His people,
          to merit all the blessings of salvation for them. Since His children
          were sharers in flesh and blood, "He also in like manner partook of
          the same; that through death He might bring to nought him that had the
          power of death, that is the devil; and might deliver all them who
          through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage,"
          Heb_2:14-15. He could merit salvation for them just because He already
          stood in relation to them as their Surety and Mediator, their Head and
          Substitute. The whole Church was included in Him as her Head. In an
          objective sense she was crucified with Christ, she died with Him, she
          arose in Him from the dead, and was made to sit with Him in the
          heavenly places. All the blessings of saving grace lie ready for the
          Church in Christ; man can add nothing to them; and they now only await
          their subjective application by the operation of the Holy Spirit,
          which is also merited by Christ and is sure of progressive realization
          in the course of history.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE UNION OF LIFE SUBJECTIVELY REALIZED BY THE OPERATION OF THE
          HOLY SPIRIT. The work of Christ was not finished when He had merited
          salvation for His people and had obtained actual possession of the
          blessings of salvation. In the counsel of redemption He took it upon
          Himself to put all His people in possession of all these blessings,
          and He does this through the operation of the Holy Spirit, who takes
          all things out of Christ, and gives them unto us. We should not
          conceive of the subjective realization of the mystical union in the
          Church atomistically, as if it were effected by bringing now this and
          then that individual sinner to Christ. It should be seen from the
          point of view of Christ. Objectively, the whole Church is in Him, and
          is born out of Him as the Head. It is not a mechanism, in which the
          parts precede the whole, but an organism, in which the whole is prior
          to the parts. The parts come forth out of Christ through the
          regenerating work of the Holy Spirit, and then continue in living
          relationship with Him. Jesus calls attention to this organic
          relationship when He says: "I am the vine, ye are the branches: he
          that abideth in me and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for
          apart from me ye can do nothing," Joh_15:5. In view of what was said,
          it is quite evident that it is not correct to say that the mystical
          union is the fruit of man's believing acceptance of Christ, as if
          faith were not one of the blessings of the covenant which flow unto us
          from the fulness of Christ, but a condition which man must meet partly
          or wholly in his own strength, in order to enter into living
          relationship with Jesus Christ. Faith is first of all a gift of God,
          and as such a part of the treasures that are hidden in Christ. It
          enables us to appropriate on our part what is given unto us in Christ,
          and to enter ever-increasingly into conscious enjoyment of the blessed
          union with Christ, which is the source of all our spiritual riches.
        </p>
        <p>
          This union may be defined as that intimate, vital, and spiritual union
          between Christ and His people, in virtue of which He is the source of
          their life and strength, of their blessedness and salvation. That it
          is a very intimate union appears abundantly from the figures that are
          used in Scripture to describe it. It is a union as of the vine and the
          branches, Joh_15:5, as of a foundation and the building that is reared
          on it, 1Pe_2:4-5, as of husband and wife, Eph_5:23-32, and as of the
          head and the members of the body, Eph_4:15-16. And even these figures
          fail to give full expression to the reality. It is a union that passes
          understanding. Says Dr. Hodge: "The technical designation of this
          union in theological language is 'mystical,' because it so far
          transcends all the analogies of earthly relationships, in the intimacy
          of its connection, in the transforming power of its influence, and in
          the excellence of its consequences."37 If the discussion of this
          aspect of the mystical union is taken up first of all in the ordo
          salutis, it should be borne in mind (a) that it would seem to be
          desirable to consider it in connection with what precedes it, ideally
          in the counsel of redemption, and objectively in the work of Christ;
          and (b) that the order is logical rather than chronological. Since the
          believer is "a new creature" (2Co_5:17), or is "justified" (Act_13:39)
          only in Christ, union with Him logically precedes both regeneration
          and justification by faith, while yet, chronologically, the moment
          when we are united with Christ is also the moment of our regeneration
          and justification.
        </p>
        <p>B. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MYSTICAL UNION.</p>
        <p>
          From the preceding it appears that the term "mystical union" can be,
          and often is, used in a broad sense, including the various aspects
          (legal, objective, subjective) of the union between Christ and
          believers. Most generally, however, it denotes only the crowning
          aspect of that union, namely, its subjective realization by the
          operation of the Holy Spirit, and it is this aspect of it that is
          naturally in the foreground in soteriology. All that is said in the
          rest of this chapter bears on this subjective union. The following are
          the main characteristics of this union:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. IT IS AN ORGANIC UNION. Christ and the believers form one body. The
          organic character of this union is clearly taught in such passages as
          Joh_15:5; 1Co_15:1-19; Eph_1:22-23; Eph_4:15-16; Eph_5:29-30. In this
          organic union Christ ministers to the believers, and the believers
          minister to Christ. Every part of the body serves and is served by
          every other part, and together they are subservient to the whole in a
          union that is indissoluble.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. IT IS A VITAL UNION. In this union Christ is the vitalizing and
          dominating principle of the whole body of believers. It is none other
          than the life of Christ that indwells and animates believers, so that,
          to speak with Paul, "Christ is formed" in them, Gal_4:19. By it Christ
          becomes the formative principle of their life, and leads it in a
          Godward direction, Rom_8:10; 2Co_13:5; Gal_4:19-20.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. IT IS A UNION MEDIATED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. The Holy Spirit was in a
          special capacity a part of the Mediator's reward, and as such was
          poured out on the day of Pentecost for the formation of the spiritual
          body of Jesus Christ. Through the Holy Spirit Christ now dwells in
          believers, unites them to Himself, and knits them together in a holy
          unity, 1Co_6:17; 1Co_12:13; 2Co_3:17-18; Gal_3:2-3.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. IT IS A UNION THAT IMPLIES RECIPROCAL ACTION. The initial act is
          that of Christ, who unites believers to himself by regenerating them
          and thus producing faith in them. On the other hand, the believer also
          unites himself to Christ by a conscious act of faith, and continues
          the union, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, by the constant
          exercise of faith, Joh_14:23; Joh_15:4-5; Gal_2:20; Eph_3:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. IT IS A PERSONAL UNION. Every believer is personally united
          directly to Christ. The representation that the life which is in the
          Church through Christ flows from the Church into the individual
          believer is decidedly unScriptural, not only in its sacramentarian but
          also in its pantheistic form (Rome, Schleiermacher, and many modern
          theologians). Every sinner who is regenerated is directly connected
          with Christ and receives his life from Him. Consequently the Bible
          always emphasizes the bond with Christ, Joh_14:20; Joh_15:1-7;
          2Co_5:17; Gal_2:20; Eph_3:17-18.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. IT IS A TRANSFORMING UNION. By this union believers are changed
          into the image of Christ according to his human nature. What Christ
          effects in His people is in a sense a replica or reproduction of what
          took place with Him. Nor only objectively, but also in a subjective
          sense they suffer, bear the cross, are crucified, die, and are raised
          in newness of life, with Christ. They share in a measure the
          experiences of their Lord, Mat_16:24; Rom_6:5; Gal_2:20; Col_1:24;
          Col_2:12; Col_3:1; 1Pe_4:13.
        </p>
        <p>C. ERRONEOUS CONCEPTIONS OF THE MYSTICAL UNION.</p>
        <p>
          There are several erroneous conceptions of the mystical union, against
          which we should be on our guard. Errors on this point should not be
          regarded as inconsequential and therefore unimportant, for they are
          fraught with danger for a true understanding of the Christian life.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. RATIONALISTIC ERROR. We must avoid the error of the Rationalist who
          would identify the mystical union with the union of Christ as the
          Logos with the whole creation or with the immanence of God in all
          human spirits. This is found in the following statement, which A. H.
          Strong quotes from Campbell, The indwelling Christ: "In the immanence
          of Christ in nature we find the ground of his immanence in human
          nature. . . . A man may be out of Christ, but Christ is never out of
          him. Those who banish him he does not abandon." In this view the
          mystical union is robbed of its soteriological significance.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. MYSTICAL ERROR. Another dangerous error is that of the Mystics who
          understand the mystical union as an identification of the believer
          with Christ. According to this view there is in it a union of essence,
          in which the personality of the one is simply merged into that of the
          other, so that Christ and the believer do not remain two distinct
          persons. Even some of the Lutherans went to that extreme. One
          extremist did not hesitate to say, "I am Christ Jesus, the living Word
          of God; I have redeemed thee by my sinless sufferings."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. SOCINIAN AND ARMINIAN ERROR. Quite another extreme is found in the
          teachings of Socinians and Arminians, who represent the mystical union
          as a mere moral union, or a union of love and sympathy, like that
          existing between a teacher and his pupils or between friend and
          friend. Such a union does not involve any interpenetration of the life
          of Christ and that of believers. It would involve no more than loving
          adherence to Christ, friendly service freely rendered to him, and
          ready acceptance of the message of the Kingdom of God. It is a union
          that does not call for a Christ within us.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. SACRAMENTARIAN ERROR. Another error to be avoided is that of the
          sacramentarians, represented by the Roman Catholic Church and by some
          Lutherans and High Church Episcopalians. Strong speaks of this as
          "perhaps the most pernicious misinterpretation of the nature of this
          union." It makes the grace of God something substantial, of which the
          Church is the depositary, and which can be passed on in the
          sacraments; and completely loses sight of the fact that the sacraments
          cannot effect this union, because they already presuppose it.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MYSTICAL UNION.</p>
        <p>
          1. The mystical union in the sense in which we are now speaking of it
          is not the judicial ground, on the basis of which we become partakers
          of the riches that are in Christ. It is sometimes said that the merits
          of Christ cannot be imputed to us as long as we are not in Christ,
          since it is only on the basis of our oneness with Him that such an
          imputation could be reasonable. But this view fails to distinguish
          between our legal unity with Christ and our spiritual oneness with
          Him, and is a falsification of the fundamental element in the doctrine
          of redemption, namely, of the doctrine of justification. Justification
          is always a declaration of God, not on the basis of an existing
          condition, but on that of a gracious imputation, â€” a declaration
          which is not in harmony with the existing condition of the sinner. The
          judicial ground for all the special grace which we receive lies in the
          fact that the righteousness of Christ is freely imputed to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But this state of affairs, namely, that the sinner has nothing in
          himself and receives everything freely from Christ, must be reflected
          in the consciousness of the sinner. And this takes place through the
          mediation of the mystical union. While the union is effected when the
          sinner is renewed by the operation of the Holy Spirit, he does not
          become cognizant of it and does not actively cultivate it until the
          conscious operation of faith begins. Then he becomes aware of the fact
          that he has no righteousness of his own, and that the righteousness by
          which he appears just in the sight of God is imputed to him. But even
          so something additional is required. The sinner must feel his
          dependence on Christ in the very depths of his being, â€” in the
          sub-conscious life. Hence he is incorporated in Christ, and as a
          result experiences that all the grace which he receives flows from
          Christ. The constant feeling of dependence thus engendered, is an
          antidote against all self-righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The mystical union with Christ also secures for the believer the
          continuously transforming power of the life of Christ, not only in the
          soul but also in the body. The soul is gradually renewed in the image
          of Christ, as Paul expresses it, "from glory to glory, even as by the
          Spirit of the Lord." 2Co_3:18. And the body is consecrated in the
          present to be a fit instrument of the renewed soul, and will at last
          be raised up in the likeness of Christ's glorified body, Php_3:21.
          Being in Christ, believers share in all the blessings which He merited
          for his people. He is for them a perennial fountain springing into
          everlasting life.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. In virtue of this union believers have fellowship with Christ. Just
          as Christ shared the labours, the sufferings, and the temptations of
          His people, they are now made to share His experiences. His sufferings
          are, in a measure, reproduced and completed in the lives of His
          followers. They are crucified with Him, and also arise with Him in
          newness of life The final triumph of Christ also becomes their
          triumph. Rom_6:5; Rom_6:8; Rom_6:8; Rom_8:17; 2Co_1:7; Php_3:10;
          1Pe_4:13.

          5. Finally, the union of believers with Christ furnishes the basis for
          the spiritual unity of all believers, and consequently for the
          communion of the saints. They are animated by the same spirit, are
          filled with the same love, stand in the same faith, are engaged in the
          same warfare, and are bound for the same goal. Together they are
          interested in the things of Christ and His Church, of God and His
          Kingdom. Joh_17:20-21; Act_2:42; Rom_12:15; Eph_4:2-3; Col_3:16;
          1Th_4:18; 1Th_5:11; Heb_3:13; Heb_10:24-25; Jas_5:16; 1Jn_1:3;
          1Jn_1:7.

          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: What is the meaning of the term
          'mystical' as applied to the union with Christ? What is the relation
          between grace in the legal, and that in the moral sphere? How should
          we answer the contention that the sinner cannot become a participant
          in the blessings of God's special grace until he is subjectively
          incorporated in Christ? What can be said in reply to the assertion
          that faith precedes regeneration, because it effects the union with
          Christ, while regeneration is the fruit of this union? Does the
          mystical union suppress or does it preserve the personality of man?
          Cf. Eph_4:13. Do all believers derive equal benefits from this union?
          If this union is indissoluble, how must Joh_15:1-7 be understood? What
          is Schleiermacher's conception of the believer's union with Christ?
