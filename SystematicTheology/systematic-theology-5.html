        <p>VI. The Incommunicable Attributes</p>
        <p>(God as the Absolute Being)</p>
        <p>
          It has been quite common in theology to speak of God as the absolute
          Being. At the same time the term "absolute" is more characteristic of
          philosophy than it is of theology. In metaphysics the term "the
          Absolute" is a designation of the ultimate ground of all existence;
          and because the theist also speaks of God as the ultimate ground of
          all existence, it is sometimes thought that the Absolute of philosophy
          and the God of theism are one and the same. But that is not
          necessarily so. In fact the usual conception of the Absolute renders
          it impossible to equate it with the God of the Bible and of Christian
          theology. The term "Absolute" is derived from the Latin absolutus,
          acompound of ab (from) and solvere (to loosen), and thus means free as
          to condition, or free from limitation or restraint. This fundamental
          thought was worked out in various ways, so that the Absolute was
          regarded as that which is free from all conditions (the Unconditioned
          or Self-Existent), from all relations (the (Unrelated), from all
          imperfections (the Perfect), or free from all phenomenal differences
          or distinctions, such as matter and spirit, being and attributes,
          subject and object, appearance and reality (the Real, or Ultimate
          Reality).
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer to the question, whether the Absolute of philosophy can be
          identified with the God of theology, depends on the conception one has
          of the Absolute. If Spinoza conceives of the Absolute as the one
          Self-subsistent Being of which all particular things are but transient
          modes, thus identifying God and the world, we cannot share his view of
          this Absolute as God. When Hegel views the Absolute as the unity of
          thought and being, as the totality of all things, which includes all
          relations, and in which all the discords of the present are resolved
          in perfect unity, we again find it impossible to follow him in
          regarding this Absolute as God. And when Bradley says that his
          Absolute is related to nothing, and that there cannot be any practical
          relation between it and the finite will, we agree with him that his
          Absolute cannot be the God of the Christian religion, for this God
          does enter into relations with finite creatures. Bradley cannot
          conceive of the God of religion as other than a finite God. But when
          the Absolute is defined as the First Cause of all existing things, or
          as the ultimate ground of all reality, or as the one self-existent
          Being, it can be considered as identical with the God of theology. He
          is the Infinite One, who does not exist in any necessary relations,
          because He is self-sufficient, but at the same time can freely enter
          into various relations with His creation as a whole and with His
          creatures. While the incommunicable attributes emphasize the absolute
          Being of God, the communicable attributes stress the fact that He
          enters into various relations with His creatures. In the present
          chapter the following perfections of God come into consideration.
        </p>
        <p>A. THE SELFEXISTENCE OF GOD</p>
        <p>
          God is self-existent, that is, He has the ground of His existence in
          Himself. This idea is sometimes expressed by saying that He is causa
          sui (His own cause), but this expression is hardly accurate, since God
          is the uncaused, who exists by the necessity of His own Being, and
          therefore necessarily. Man, on the other hand, does not exist
          necessarily, and has the cause of his existence outside of himself.
          The idea of God's self-existence was generally expressed by the term
          aseitas, meaning self-originated, but Reformed theologians quite
          generally substituted for it the word independentia (independence), as
          expressing, not merely that God is independent in His Being, but also
          that He is independent in everything else: in His virtues, decrees,
          works, and so on. It may be said that there is a faint trace of this
          perfection in the creature, but this can only mean that the creature,
          though absolutely dependent, yet has its own distinct existence. But,
          of course, this falls far short of being self-existent. This attribute
          of God is generally recognized, and is implied in heathen religions
          and in the Absolute of philosophy. When the Absolute is conceived of
          as the self-existent and as the ultimate ground of all things, which
          voluntarily enters into various relations with other beings, it can be
          identified with the God of theology. As the self-existent God, He is
          not only independent in Himself, but also causes everything to depend
          on Him. This self- existence of God finds expression in the name
          Jehovah. It is only as the self-existent and independent One that God
          can give the assurance that He will remain eternally the same in
          relation to His people. Additional indications of it are found in the
          assertion in Joh_5:26, "For as the Father hath life in Himself, even
          so gave He to the Son also to have life in Himself"; in the
          declaration that He is independent of all things and that all things
          exist only through Him, Psa_94:8 ff.; Isa_40:18 ff.; Act_7:25; and in
          statements implying that He is independent in His thought,
          Rom_11:33-34, and in His will, Dan_4:35; Rom_9:19; Eph_1:5; Rev_4:11,
          in His power, Psa_115:3, and in His counsel, Psa_33:11.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE IMMUTABILITY OF GOD</p>
        <p>
          The Immutability of God is a necessary concomitant of His aseity. It
          is that perfection of God by which He is devoid of all change, not
          only in His Being, but also in His perfections, and in His purposes
          and promises. In virtue of this attribute He is exalted above all
          becoming, and is free from all accession or diminution and from all
          growth or decay in His Being or perfections. His knowledge and plans,
          His moral principles and volitions remain forever the same. Even
          reason teaches us that no change is possible in God, since a change is
          either for better or for worse. But in God, as the absolute
          Perfection, improvement and deterioration are both equally impossible.
          This immutability of God is clearly taught in such passages of
          Scripture as Exo_3:14; Psa_102:26-28; Isa_41:4; Isa_48:12; Mal_3:6;
          Rom_1:23; Heb_1:11-12; Jas_1:17. At the same time there are many
          passages of Scripture which seem to ascribe change to God. Did not He
          who dwelleth in eternity pass on to the creation of the world, become
          incarnate in Christ, and in the Holy Spirit take up His abode in the
          Church? Is He not represented as revealing and hiding Himself, as
          coming and going, as repenting and changing His intention, and as
          dealing differently with man before and after conversion? Cf.
          Exo_32:10-14; Jon_3:10; Pro_11:20; Pro_12:22; Psa_18:16-17. The
          objection here implied is based to a certain extent on
          misunderstanding. The divine immutability should not be understood as
          implying immobility as if there were no movement in God. It is even
          customary in theology to speak of God as actus purus, a God who is
          always in action. The Bible teaches us that God enters into manifold
          relations with man and, as it were, lives their life with them. There
          is change round about Him, change in the relations of men to Him, but
          there is no change in His Being, His attributes, His purpose, His
          motives of action, or His promises. The purpose to create was eternal
          with Him, and there was no change in Him when this purpose was
          realized by a single eternal act of His will. The incarnation brought
          no change in the Being or perfections of God, nor in His purpose, for
          it was His eternal good pleasure to send the Son of His love into the
          world. And if Scripture speaks of His repenting, changing His
          intention, and altering His relation to sinners when they repent, we
          should remember that this is only an anthropopathic way of speaking.
          In reality the change is not in God, but in man and in man's relations
          to God. It is important to maintain the immutability of God over
          against the Pelagian and Arminian doctrine that God is subject to
          change, not indeed in His Being, but in His knowledge and will, so
          that His decisions are to a great extent dependent on the actions of
          man; over against the pantheistic notion that God is an eternal
          becoming rather than an absolute Being, and that the unconscious
          Absolute is gradually developing into conscious personality in man;
          and over against the present tendency of some to speak of a finite,
          struggling, and gradually growing God.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE INFINITY OF GOD</p>
        <p>
          The infinity of God is that perfection of God by which He is free from
          all limitations. In ascribing it to God we deny that there are or can
          be any limitations to the divine Being or attributes. It implies that
          He is in no way limited by the universe, by this time- space world, or
          confined to the universe. It does not involve His identity with the
          sum- total of existing things, nor does it exclude the co-existence of
          derived and finite things, to which He bears relation. The infinity of
          God must be conceived as intensive rather than extensive, and should
          not be confused with boundless extension, as if God were spread out
          through the entire universe, one part being here and another there,
          for God has no body and therefore no extension. Neither should it be
          regarded as a merely negative concept, though it is perfectly true
          that we cannot form a positive idea of it. It is a reality in God
          fully comprehended only by Him. We distinguish various aspects of
          God's infinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. HIS ABSOLUTE PERFECTION. This is the infinity of the Divine Being
          considered in itself. It should not be understood in a quantitative,
          but in a qualitative sense; it qualifies all the communicable
          attributes of God. Infinite power is not an absolute quantum, but an
          exhaustless potency of power; and infinite holiness is not a boundless
          quantum of holiness, but a holiness which is, qualitatively free from
          all limitation or defect. The same may be said of infinite knowledge
          and wisdom, and of infinite love and righteousness. Says Dr. Orr:
          "Perhaps we can say that infinity in God is ultimately: (a) internally
          and qualitatively, absence of all limitation and defect; (b) boundless
          potentiality."24 In this sense of the word the infinity of God is
          simply identical with the perfection of His Divine Being. Scripture
          proof for it is found in Job_11:7-10; Psa_145:3; Mat_5:48.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. HIS ETERNITY. The infinity of God in relation to time is called His
          eternity. The form in which the Bible represents God's eternity is
          simply that of duration through endless ages, Psa_90:2; Psa_102:12;
          Eph_3:21. We should remember, however, that in speaking as it does the
          Bible uses popular language, and not the language of philosophy. We
          generally think of God's eternity in the same way, namely, as duration
          infinitely prolonged both backwards and forwards. But this is only a
          popular and symbolical way of representing that which in reality
          transcends time and differs from it essentially. Eternity in the
          strict sense of the word is abscribed to that which transcends all
          temporal limitations. That it applies to God in that sense is at least
          intimated in 2Pe_3:8. "Time," says Dr. Orr, "strictly has relation to
          the world of objects existing in succession. God fills time; is in
          every part of it; but His eternity still is not really this being in
          time. It is rather that to which time forms a contrast."25 Our
          existence is marked off by days and weeks and months and years; not so
          the existence of God. Our life is divided into a past, present and
          future, but there is no such division in the life of God. He is the
          eternal "I am." His eternity may be defined as that perfection of God
          whereby He is elevated above all temporal limits and all succession of
          moments, and possesses the whole of His existence in one indivisible
          present. The relation of eternity to time constitutes one of the most
          difficult problems in philosophy and theology, perhaps incapable of
          solution in our present condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. HIS IMMENSITY. The infinity of God may also be viewed with
          reference to space, and is then called His immensity. It may be
          defined as that perfection of the Divine Being by which He transcends
          all spatial limitations, and yet is present in every point of space
          with His whole Being. It has a negative and a positive side, denying
          all limitations of space to the Divine Being, and asserting that God
          is above space and fills every part of it with His whole Being. The
          last words are added, in order to ward off the idea that God is
          diffused through space, so that one part of His Being is present in
          one place, and another part in some other place. We distinguish three
          modes of presence in space. Bodies are in space circumscriptively,
          because they are bounded by it; finite spirits are in space
          definitively, since they are not everywhere, but only in a certain
          definite place; and in distinction from both of these God is in space
          repletively, because He fills all space. He is not absent from any
          part of it, nor more present in one part than in another.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a certain sense the terms "immensity" and "omnipresence," as
          applied to God, denote the same thing, and can therefore be regarded
          as synonymous. Yet there is a point of difference that should be
          carefully noted. "Immensity" points to the fact that God transcends
          all space and is not subject to its limitations, while "omnipresence"
          denotes that He nevertheless fills every part of space with His entire
          Being. The former emphasizes the transcendence, and the latter, the
          immanence of God. God is immanent in all His creatures, in His entire
          creation, but is in no way bounded by it. In connection with God's
          relation to the world we must avoid, on the one hand, the error of
          Pantheism, so characteristic of a great deal of present day thinking,
          with its denial of the transcendence of God and its assumption that
          the Being of God is really the substance of all things; and, on the
          other hand, the Deistic conception that God is indeed present in
          creation per potentiam (with His power), but not per essentiam et
          naturam (with His very Being and nature), and acts upon the world from
          a distance. Though God is distinct from the world and may not be
          identified with it, He is yet present in every part of His creation,
          not only per potentiam, but also per essentiam. This does not mean,
          however, that He is equally present and present in the same sense in
          all His creatures. The nature of His indwelling is in harmony with
          that of His creatures. He does not dwell on earth as He does in
          heaven, in animals as He does in man, in the inorganic as He does in
          the organic creation, in the wicked as He does in the pious, nor in
          the Church as He does in Christ. There is an endless variety in the
          manner in which He is immanent in His creatures, and in the measure in
          which they reveal God to those who have eyes to see. The omnipresence
          of God is clearly revealed in Scripture. Heaven and earth cannot
          contain Him, 1Ki_8:27; Isa_66:1; Act_7:48-49; and at the same time He
          fills both and is a God at hand, Psa_139:7-10; Jer_23:23-24;
          Act_17:27-28.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE UNITY OF GOD</p>
        <p>
          A distinction is made between the unitas singularitatis and the unitas
          simplicitatis.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE UNITAS SINGULARITATIS. This attribute stresses both the oneness
          and the unicity of God, the fact that He is numerically one and that
          as such He is unique. It implies that there is but one Divine Being,
          that from the nature of the case there can be but one, and that all
          other beings exist of and through and unto Him. The Bible teaches us
          in several passages that there is but one true God. Solomon pleaded
          with God to maintain the cause of His people, "that all the peoples of
          the earth may know that Jehovah, He is God; there is none else,"
          1Ki_8:60. And Paul writes to the Corinthians, "But to us there is but
          one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and one
          Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we in Him," 1Co_8:6.
          Similarly he writes to Timothy, "For there is one God, and one
          Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus," 1Ti_2:5. Other
          passages do not stress the numerical unity of God as much as they do
          His uniqueness. This is the case in the well known words of Deu_6:4,
          "Hear, O Israel; Jehovah our God is one Jehovah." The Hebrew word '
          echad, translated by "one" may also be rendered "an only," the
          equivalent of the German "einig" and the Dutch "eenig." And this would
          seem to be a better translation. Keil stresses that fact that this
          passage does not teach the numerical unity of God, but rather that
          Jehovah is the only God that is entitled to the name Jehovah. This is
          also the meaning of the term in Zec_14:9. The same idea is beautifully
          expressed in the rhetorical question of Exo_15:11, "Who is like unto
          thee, O Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like thee, glorious in
          holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?" This excludes all
          polytheistic conceptions of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE UNITAS SIMPLICITATIS. While the unity discussed in the
          preceding sets God apart from other beings, the perfection now under
          consideration is expressive of the inner and qualitative unity of the
          Divine Being. When we speak of the simplicity of God, we use the term
          to describe the state or quality of being simple, the condition of
          being free from division into parts, and therefore from compositeness.
          It means that God is not composite and is not susceptible of division
          in any sense of the word. This implies among other things that the
          three Persons in the Godhead are not so many parts of which the Divine
          essence is composed, that God's essence and perfections are not
          distinct, and that the attributes are not superadded to His essence.
          Since the two are one, the Bible can speak of God as light and life,
          as righteousness and love, thus identifying Him with His perfections.
          The simplicity of God follows from some of His other perfections; from
          His Self-existence, which excludes the idea that something preceded
          Him, as in the case of compounds; and from His immutability, which
          could not be predicated of His nature, if it were made up of parts.
          This perfection was disputed during the Middle Ages, and was denied by
          Socinians and Arminians. Scripture does not explicitly assert it, but
          implies it where it speaks of God as righteousness, truth, wisdom,
          light, life, love, and so on, and thus indicates that each of these
          properties, because of their absolute perfection, is identical with
          His Being. In recent works on theology the simplicity of God is seldom
          mentioned. Many theologians positively deny it, either because it is
          regarded as a purely metaphysical abstraction, or because, in their
          estimation, it conflicts with the doctrine of the Trinity. Dabney
          believes that there is no composition in the substance of God, but
          denies that in Him substance and attributes are one and the same. He
          claims that God is no more simple in that respect than finite
          spirits.26

        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY. What different conceptions of the
          Absolute do we meet with in philosophy? Can the Absolute of philosophy
          always be identified with the God of theology? How does Bradley
          distinguish between the two? How is the finite God of James, Schiller,
          Ward, Wells and others, related to the Absolute? How do the
          incommunicable attributes of God link up with the Absolute? Does the
          immutability of God exclude all movement in God? In how far does it
          exclude changes of action and relations? Should the absolute
          perfection of God be regarded as an attribute? Why does the Bible
          represent God's eternity as endless duration? Is it possible to
          harmonize the transcendence and the immanence of God? How is
          transcendence frequently interpreted in modern theology? What is
          implied in the simplicity of God?
