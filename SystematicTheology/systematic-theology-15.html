        <p>II. The Constitutional Nature of Man</p>
        <p>
          The previous chapter is of a more or less introductory nature, and
          does not, strictly speaking, form an integral part of the systematic
          presentation of the doctrine of man in dogmatics. This explains why
          many treatises on systematic theology fail to devote a separate
          chapter to the origin of man. Yet it seemed desirable to insert it
          here, since it furnishes a fitting background for what follows. Under
          the present caption we shall consider the essential constituents of
          human nature, and the question of the origin of the soul in the
          individuals that constitute the race.
        </p>
        <p>THE CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS OF HUMAN NATURE.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE DIFFERENT VIEWS THAT WERE CURRENT IN HISTORY and DICHOTOMY AND
          TRICHOTOMY. It is customary, especially in Christian circles, to
          conceive of man as consisting of two. and only two, distinct parts,
          namely, body and soul. This view is technically called dichotomy.
          Alongside of it, however, another made its appearance, to the effect
          that human nature consists of three parts, body, soul, and spirit. It
          is designated by the term trichotomy. The tri-partite conception of
          man originated in Greek philosophy, which conceived of the relation of
          the body and the spirit of man to each other after the analogy of the
          mutual relation between the material universe and God. It was thought
          that, just as the latter could enter into communion with each other
          only by means of a third substance or an intermediate being, so the
          former could enter into mutual vital relationships only by means of a
          third or intermediate element, namely, the soul. The soul was regarded
          as, on the one hand, immaterial, and on the other, adapted to the
          body. In so far as it appropriated the nous or pneuma, it was regarded
          as immortal, but in so far as it was related to the body, as carnal
          and mortal. The most familiar but also the crudest form of trichotomy
          is that which takes the body for the material part of man's nature,
          the soul as the principle of animal life, and the spirit as the
          God-related rational and immortal element in man. The trichotomic
          conception of man found considerable favor with the Greek or
          Alexandrian Church Fathers of the early Christian centuries. It is
          found, though not always in exactly the same form, in Clement of
          Alexandria, Origen, and Gregory of Nyssa. But after Apollinaris
          employed it in a manner impinging on the perfect humanity of Jesus, it
          was gradually discredited. Some of the Greek Fathers still adhered to
          it, though Athanasius and Theodoret explicitly repudiated it. In the
          Latin Church the leading theologians distinctly favored the twofold
          division of human nature. It was especially the psychology of
          Augustine that gave prominence to this view. During the Middle Ages it
          had become a matter of common belief. The Reformation brought no
          change in this respect, though a few lesser lights defended the
          trichotomic theory. The Roman Catholic Church adhered to the verdict
          of Scholasticism, but in the circles of Protestantism other voices
          were heard. During the nineteenth century trichotomy was revived in
          some form or other by certain German and English theologians, as Roos,
          Olshausen, Beck, Delitzsch, Auberlen, Oehler, White, and Heard; but it
          did not meet with great favor in the theological world. The recent
          advocates of this theory do not agree as to the nature of the psuche,
          nor as to the relation in which it stands to the other elements in
          man's nature. Delitzsch conceives of it as an efflux of the pneuma
          while Beck, Oehler, and Heard, regard it as the point of union between
          the body and the spirit. Delitzsch is not altogether consistent and
          occasionally seems to waver, and Beck and Oehler admit that the
          Biblical representation of man is fundamentally dichotomic. Their
          defense of a Biblical trichotomy can hardly be said to imply the
          existence of three distinct elements in man. Besides these two
          theological views there were, especially in the last century and a
          half, also the philosophical views of absolute Materialism and of
          absolute Idealism, the former sacrificing the soul to the body, and
          the latter, the body to the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE TEACHINGS OF SCRIPTURE AS TO THE CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS OF HUMAN
          NATURE. The prevailing representation of the nature of man in
          Scripture is clearly dichotomic. On the one hand the Bible teaches us
          to view the nature of man as a unity, and not as a duality, consisting
          of two different elements, each of which move along parallel lines but
          do not really unite to form a single organism. The idea of a mere
          parallelism between the two elements of human nature, found in Greek
          philosophy and also in the works of some later philosophers, is
          entirely foreign to Scripture. While recognizing the complex nature of
          man, it never represents this as resulting in a twofold subject in
          man. Every act of man is seen as an act of the whole man. It is not
          the soul but man that sins; it is not the body but man that dies; and
          it is not merely the soul, but man, body and soul, that is redeemed in
          Christ. This unity already finds expression in the classical passage
          of the Old Testament â€” the first passage to indicate the complex
          nature of man â€” namely, Gen_2:7 : "And Jehovah God formed man of the
          dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;
          and man became a living soul." The whole passage deals with man: "God
          formed man . . . and man became a living soul." This work of God
          should not be interpreted as a mechanical process, as if He first
          formed a body of clay and then put a soul into it. When God formed the
          body, He formed it so that by the breath of His Spirit man at once
          became a living soul. Job_33:4; Job_32:8. The word "soul" in this
          passage does not have the meaning which we usually ascribe to it â€” a
          meaning rather foreign to the Old Testament â€” but denotes an
          animated being, and is a description of man as a whole. The very same
          Hebrew term, nephesh chayyah (living soul or being) is also applied to
          the animals in Gen_1:21; Gen_1:24; Gen_1:30. So this passage, while
          indicating that there are two elements in man, yet stresses the
          organic unity of man. And this is recognized throughout the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time it also contains evidences of the dual composition of
          man's nature. We should be careful, however, not to expect the later
          distinction between the body as the material element, and the soul as
          the spiritual element, of human nature, in the Old Testament. This
          distinction came into use later on under the influence of Greek
          philosophy. The antithesis â€” soul and body â€” even in its New
          Testament sense, is not yet found in the Old Testament. In fact, the
          Hebrew has no word for the body as an organism. The Old Testament
          distinction of the two elements of human nature is of a different
          kind. Says Laidlaw in his work on The Bible Doctrine of Man:9 "The
          antithesis is clearly that of lower and higher, earthly and heavenly,
          animal and divine. It is not so much two elements, as two factors
          uniting in a single and harmonious result, â€” 'man became a living
          soul.'" It is quite evident that this is the distinction in Gen_2:7.
          Cf. also Job_27:3; Job_32:8; Job_33:4; Ecc_12:7. A variety of words is
          used in the Old Testament to denote the lower element in man or parts
          of it, such as "flesh," "dust," "bones," "bowels," "kidneys," and also
          the metaphorical expression "house of clay," Job_4:19. And there are
          also several words to denote the higher element, such as "spirit,"
          "soul," "heart," and "mind." As soon as we pass from the Old to the
          New Testament, we meet with the antithetic expressions that are most
          familiar to us, as "body and soul," "flesh and spirit." The
          corresponding Greek words were undoubtedly moulded by Greek
          philosophical thought, but passed through the Septuagint into the New
          Testament, and therefore retained their Old Testament force. At the
          same time the antithetic idea of the material and the immaterial is
          now also connected with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trichotomists seek support in the fact that the Bible, as they see it,
          recognizes two constituent parts of human nature in addition to the
          lower or material element, namely, the soul (Heb., nephesh; Greek,
          psuche) and the spirit (Heb., ruach; Greek, pneuma). But the fact that
          these terms are used with great frequency in Scripture does not
          warrant the conclusion that they designate component parts rather than
          different aspects of human nature. A careful study of Scripture
          clearly shows that it uses the words interchangeably. Both terms
          denote the higher or spiritual element in man, but contemplate it from
          different points of view. It should be pointed out at once, however,
          that the Scriptural distinction of the two does not agree with that
          which is rather common in philosophy, that the soul is the spiritual
          element in man, as it is related to the animal world, while the spirit
          is that same element in its relation to the higher spiritual world and
          to God. The following facts militate against this philosophical
          distinction: Ruach-pneuma, as well as nephesh-psuche, is used of the
          brute creation, Ecc_3:21; Rev_16:3. The word psuche is even used with
          reference to Jehovah, Isa_42:1; Jer_9:9; Amo_6:8 (Heb.); Heb_10:38.
          The disembodied dead are called psuchai, Rev_6:9; Rev_20:4. The
          highest exercises of religion are ascribed to the psuche, Mar_12:30;
          Luk_1:46; Heb_6:18-19; Jas_1:21. To lose the psuche is to lose all. It
          is perfectly evident that the Bible uses the two words
          interchangeably. Notice the parallelism in Luk_1:46-47 : "My soul doth
          magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour." The
          Scriptural formula for man is in some passages "body and soul,"
          Mat_6:25; Mat_10:28; and in others, "body and spirit," Ecc_12:7;
          1Co_5:3; 1Co_5:5. Death is sometimes described as the giving up of the
          soul, Gen_35:18; 1Ki_17:21; Act_15:26; and then again as the giving up
          of the spirit, Psa_31:5; Luk_23:46; Act_7:59. Moreover both "soul" and
          "spirit" are used to designate the immaterial element of the dead,
          1Pe_3:19; Heb_12:23; Rev_6:9; Rev_20:4. The main Scriptural
          distinction is as follows: the word "spirit" designates the spiritual
          element in man as the principle of life and action which controls the
          body; while the word "soul" denominates the same element as the
          subject of action in man, and is therefore often used for the personal
          pronoun in the Old Testament, Psa_10:1-2; Psa_104:1; Psa_146:1;
          Isa_42:1; cf. also Luk_12:19. In several instances it, more
          specifically, designates the inner life as the seat of the affections.
          All this is quite in harmony with Gen_2:7, "And Jehovah God . . .
          breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
          soul." Thus it may be said that man has spirit, but is soul. The Bible
          therefore points to two, and only two, constitutional elements in the
          nature of man, namely, body and spirit or soul. This Scriptural
          representation is also in harmony with the self-consciousness of man.
          While man is conscious of the fact that he consists of a material and
          a spiritual element, no one is conscious of possessing a soul in
          distinction from a spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two passages, however, that seem to conflict with the usual
          dichotomic representation of Scripture, namely, 1Th_5:23, "And the God
          of peace Himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and
          body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord
          Jesus Christ"; and Heb_4:12, "For the word of God is living, and
          active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the
          dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to
          discern the thoughts and intents of the heart." But it should be noted
          that: (a) It is a sound rule in exegesis that exceptional statements
          should be interpreted in the light of the analogia Scriptura, the
          usual representation of Scripture. In view of this fact some of the
          defenders of trichotomy admit that these passages do not necessarily
          prove their point. (b) The mere mention of spirit and soul alongside
          of each other does not prove that, according to Scripture, they are
          two distinct substances, any more than Mat_22:37 proves that Jesus
          regarded heart and soul and mind as three distinct substances. (c) In
          1Th_5:23 the apostle simply desires to strengthen the statement, "And
          the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly," by an epexigetical
          statement, in which the different aspects of man's existence are
          summed up, and in which he feels perfectly free to mention soul and
          spirit alongside of each other, because the Bible distinguishes
          between the two. He cannot very well have thought of them as two
          different substances here, because he speaks elsewhere of man as
          consisting of two parts, Rom_8:10; 1Co_5:5; 1Co_7:34; 2Co_7:1;
          Eph_2:3; Col_2:5. (d) Heb_4:12 should not be taken to mean that the
          word of God, penetrating to the inner man, makes a separation between
          his soul and his spirit, which would naturally imply that these two
          are different substances; but simply as declaring that it brings about
          a separation in both between the thoughts and intents of the heart.10
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE RELATION OF BODY AND SOUL TO EACH OTHER. The exact relation of
          body and soul to each other has been represented in various ways, but
          remains to a great extent a mystery. The following are the most
          important theories relating to this point:
        </p>
        <p>
          a.Monistic.There are theories which proceed on the assumption that
          body and soul are of the same primitive substance. According to
          Materialism this primitive substance is matter, and spirit is a
          product of matter. And according to absolute Idealism and Spiritualism
          the primitive substance is spirit, and this becomes objective to
          itself in what is called matter. Matter is a product of the spirit.
          The objection to this monistic view is that things so different as
          body and soul cannot be deduced the one from the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Dualistic. Some theories proceed on the assumption that there is an
          essential duality of matter and spirit, and present their mutual
          relations in various ways: (1) Occasionalism. According to this
          theory, suggested by Cartesius, matter and spirit each works,
          according to laws peculiar to itself, and these laws are so different
          that there is no possibility of joint action. What appears to be such
          can only be accounted for on the principle that, on the occasion of
          the action of the one, God by His direct agency produces a
          corresponding action in the other. (2) Parallelism. Leibnitz proposed
          the theory of pre-established harmony. This also rests on the
          assumption that there is no direct interaction between the material
          and the spiritual, but does not assume that God produces apparently
          joint actions by continual interference. Instead it holds that God
          made the body and the soul so that the one perfectly corresponds to
          the other. When a motion takes place in the body, there is a
          corresponding movement in the soul, according to a law of
          pre-established harmony. (3)Realistic Dualism. The simple facts to
          which we must always return, and which are embodied in the theory of
          realistic dualism, are the following: body and soul are distinct
          substances, which do interact, though their mode of interaction
          escapes human scrutiny and remains a mystery for us. The union between
          the two may be called a union of life: the two are organically
          related, the soul acting on the body and the body on the soul. Some of
          the actions of the body are dependent on the conscious operation of
          the soul, while others are not. The operations of the soul are
          connected with the body as its instrument in the present life; but
          from the continued conscious existence and activity of the soul after
          death it appears that it can also work without the body. This view is
          certainly in harmony with the representations of Scripture on this
          point. A great deal of present day psychology is definitely moving in
          the direction of materialism. Its most extreme form is seen in
          Behaviorism with its denial of the soul, of the mind, and even of
          consciousness. All that it has left as an object of study is human
          behavior.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE ORIGIN OF THE SOUL IN THE INDIVIDUAL.</p>
        <p>
          1. HISTORICAL VIEWS RESPECTING THE ORIGIN OF THE SOUL. Greek
          philosophy devoted considerable attention to the problem of the human
          soul and did not fail to make its influence felt in Christian
          theology. The nature, the origin, and the continued existence of the
          soul, were all subjects of discussion. Plato believed in the
          pre-existence and transmigration of the soul. In the early Church the
          doctrine of the pre-existence of the soul was practically limited to
          the Alexandrian school. Origen was the chief representative of this
          view and combined it with the notion of a pre-temporal fall. Two other
          views at once made their appearance and proved to be far more popular
          in Christian circles. The theory of creationism holds that God creates
          a new soul at the birth of every individual. It was the dominant
          theory in the Eastern Church, and also found some advocates in the
          West. Jerome and Hilary of Pictavium were its most prominent
          representatives. In the Western Church the theory of Traducianism
          gradually gained ground. According to this view the soul as well as
          the body of man originates by propagation. It is usually wedded to the
          realistic theory that human nature was created in its entirety by God
          and is ever-increasingly individualized as the human race multiplies.
          Tertullian was the first to state this theory of Traducianism and
          under his influence it continued to gain favor in the North African
          and Western Church. It seemed to fit in best with the doctrine of the
          transmission of sin that was current in those circles. Leo the Great
          called it the teaching of the catholic faith. In the East it found no
          favorable reception. Augustine hesitated to choose between the two
          views. Some of the earlier Scholastics were somewhat undecided, though
          they regarded creationism as the more probable of the two; but in
          course of time it became the consensus of opinion among the Schoolmen
          that the individual souls were created. Says Peter the Lombard: "The
          Church teaches that souls are created at their infusion into the
          body." And Thomas Aquinas went even further by saying: "It is
          heretical to say that the intellectual soul is transmitted by way of
          generation." This remained the prevailing view in the Roman Catholic
          Church. From the days of the Reformation there was a difference of
          opinion among the Protestants. Luther expressed himself in favor of
          Traducianism, and this became the prevailing opinion in the Lutheran
          Church. Calvin, on the other hand, decidedly favored creationism. Says
          he in his commentary on Gen_3:16 : "Nor is it necessary to resort to
          that ancient figment of certain writers, that souls are derived by
          descent from our first parents." Ever since the days of the
          Reformation this has been the common view in Reformed circles. This
          does not mean that there were no exceptions to the rule. Jonathan
          Edwards and Hopkins in New England theology favored Traducianism.
          Julius Mueller in his work on The Christian Doctrine of Sin again put
          up an argument in favor of the pre-existence of the soul, coupled with
          that of a pre-temporal fall, in order to explain the origin of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. PRE-EXISTENTIANISM. Some speculative theologians, among whom
          Origen, Scotus Erigena, and Julius Mueller are the most important,
          advocated the theory that the souls of men existed in a previous
          state, and that certain occurrences in that former state account for
          the condition in which those souls are now found. Origen looks upon
          man's present material existence, with all its inequalities and
          irregularities, physical and moral, as a punishment for sins committed
          in a previous existence. Scotus Erigena also holds that sin made its
          entrance into the world of humanity in the pre-temporal state, and
          that therefore man begins his career on earth as a sinner. And Julius
          Mueller has recourse to the theory, in order to reconcile the
          doctrines of the universality of sin and of individual guilt.
          According to him each person must have sinned willingly in that
          previous existence. This theory is open to several objections. (a) It
          is absolutely devoid of both Scriptural and philosophical grounds, and
          is, at least in some of its forms, based on the dualism of matter and
          spirit as taught in heathen philosophy, making it a punishment for the
          soul to be connected with the body. (b) It really makes the body
          something accidental. The soul was without the body at first, and
          received this later on. Man was complete without the body. This
          virtually wipes out the distinction between man and the angels. (c) It
          destroys the unity of the human race, for it assumes that all
          individual souls existed long before they entered the present life.
          They do not constitute a race. (d) It finds no support in the
          consciousness of man. Man has absolutely no consciousness of such a
          previous existence; nor does he feel that the body is a prison or a
          place of punishment for the soul. In fact, he dreads the separation of
          body and soul as something that is unnatural.

          3. TRADUCIANISM. According to Traducianism the souls of men are
          propagated along with the bodies by generation, and are therefore
          transmitted to the children by the parents. In the early Church
          Tertullian, Rufinus, Apollinarus, and Gregory of Nvssa were
          Traducianists. From the days of Luther Traducianism has been the
          prevailing view of the Lutheran Church. Among the Reformed it is
          favored by H. B. Smith and Shedd. A. H. Strong also prefers it.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Arguments in favor of Traducianism. Several arguments are adduced
          in favor of this theory. (1) It is said to be favored by the
          Scriptural representation (a) that God but once breathed into man's
          nostrils the breath of life, and then left it to man to propagate the
          species, Gen_1:28; Gen_2:7; (b) that the creation of Eve's soul was
          included in that of Adam, since she is said to be "of the man"
          (1Co_11:8), and nothing is said about the creation of her soul,
          Gen_2:23; (c) that God ceased from the work of creation after He had
          made man, Gen_2:2; and (d) that descendants are said to be in the
          loins of their fathers, Gen_46:26; Heb_7:9-10. Cf. also such passages
          as Joh_3:6; Joh_1:13; Rom_1:3; Act_17:26. (2) It is supported by the
          analogy of vegetable and animal life, in which the increase in numbers
          is secured, not by a continually increasing number of immediate
          creations, but by the natural derivation of new individuals from a
          parent stock. But cf. Psa_104:30. (3) It also seeks support in the
          inheritance of mental peculiarities and family traits, which are so
          often just as noticeable as physical resemblances, and which cannot be
          accounted for by education or example, since they are in evidence even
          when parents do not live to bring up their children. (4) Finally, it
          seems to offer the best basis for the explanation of the inheritance
          of moral and spiritual depravity, which is a matter of the soul rather
          than of the body. It is quite common to combine with Traducianism the
          realistic theory to account for original sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Objections to Traducianism. Several objections may be urged against
          this theory. (1) It is contrary to the philosophical doctrine of the
          simplicity of the soul. The soul is a pure spiritual substance that
          does not admit of division. The propagation of the soul would seem to
          imply that the soul of the child separates itself in some way from the
          soul of the parents. Moreover, the difficult question arises, whether
          it originates from the soul of the father or from that of the mother.
          Or does it come from both; and if so, is it not a compositum? (2) In
          order to avoid the difficulty just mentioned, it must resort to one of
          three theories: (a) that the soul of the child had a previous
          existence, a sort of pre-existence; (b) that the soul is potentially
          present in the seed of man or woman or both, which is materialism; or
          (c) that the soul is brought forth, that is, created in some way, by
          the parents, thus making them in a sense creators. (3) It proceeds on
          the assumption that, after the original creation, God works only
          mediately. After the six days of creation His creative work ceased.
          The continued creation of souls, says Delitzsch, is inconsistent with
          God's relation to the world. But the question may be raised, What,
          then, becomes of the doctrine of regeneration, which is not effected
          by second causes? (4) It is generally wedded to the theory of realism,
          since this is the only way in which it can account for original guilt.
          By doing this it affirms the numerical unity of the substance of all
          human souls, an untenable position; and also fails to give a
          satisfactory answer to the question, why men are held responsible only
          for the first sin of Adam, and not for his later sins, nor for the
          sins of the rest of their forebears. (5) Finally, in the form just
          indicated it leads to insuperable difficulties in Christology. If in
          Adam human nature as a whole sinned, and that sin was therefore the
          actual sin of every part of that human nature, then the conclusion
          cannot be escaped that the human nature of Christ was also sinful and
          guilty because it had actually sinned in Adam.

          4. CREATIONISM. This view is to the effect that each individual soul
          is to be regarded as an immediate creation of God, owing its origin to
          a direct creative act, of which the time cannot be precisely
          determined. The soul is supposed to be created pure, but united with a
          depraved body. This need not necessarily mean that the soul is created
          first in separation from the body, and then polluted by being brought
          in contact with the body, which would seem to assume that sin is
          something physical. It may simply mean that the soul, though called
          into being by a creative act of God, yet is pre-formed in the
          psychical life of the fÅ“tus, that is, in the life of the parents, and
          thus acquires its life not above and outside of, but under and in,
          that complex of sin by which humanity as a whole is burdened.11
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Arguments in favor of Creationism. The following are the more
          important considerations in favor of this theory: (1) It is more
          consistent with the prevailing representations of Scripture than
          Traducianism. The original account of creation points to a marked
          distinction between the creation of the body and that of the soul. The
          one is taken from the earth, while the other comes directly from God.
          This distinction is kept up throughout the Bible, where body and soul
          are not only represented as different substances, but also as having
          different origins, Ecc_12:7; Isa_42:5; Zec_12:1; Heb_12:9. Cf.
          Num_16:22. Of the passage in Hebrews even Delitzsch, though a
          Traducianist, says, "There can hardly be a more classical proof text
          for creationism."12 (2) It is clearly far more consistent with the
          nature of the human soul than Traducianism. The immaterial and
          spiritual, and therefore indivisible nature of the soul of man,
          generally admitted by all Christians, is clearly recognized by
          Creationism. The traducian theory on the other hand, posits a
          derivation of essence, which, as is generally admitted, necessarily
          implies separation or division of essence. (3) It avoids the pitfalls
          of Traducianism in Christology and does greater justice to the
          Scriptural representation of the person of Christ. He was very man,
          possessing a true human nature, a real body and a rational soul, was
          born of a woman, was made in all points like as we are, â€” and yet,
          without sin. He did not, like all other men, share in the guilt and
          pollution of Adam's transgression. This was possible, because he did
          not share the same numerical essence which sinned in Adam.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Objections to Creationism. Creationism is open to the following
          objections: (1) The most serious objection is stated by Strong in the
          following words: "This theory, if it allows that the soul is
          originally possessed of depraved tendencies, makes God the direct
          author of moral evil; if it holds the soul to have been created pure,
          it makes God indirectly the author of moral evil, by teaching that He
          put this pure soul into a body which will inevitably corrupt it." This
          is undoubtedly a serious difficulty, and is generally regarded as the
          decisive argument against Creationism. Augustine already called
          attention to the fact that the Creationist should seek to avoid this
          pitfall. But it should be borne in mind that the Creationist does not,
          like the Traducianist, regard original sin entirely as a matter of
          inheritance. The descendants of Adam are sinners, not as a result of
          their being brought into contact with a sinful body, but in virtue of
          the fact that God imputes to them the original disobedience of Adam.
          And it is for that reason that God withholds from them original
          righteousness, and the pollution of sin naturally follows. (2) It
          regards the earthly father as begetting only the body of his child,
          â€” certainly not the most important part of the child, â€” and
          therefore does not account for the re-appearance of the mental and
          moral traits of the parents in the children. Moreover, by taking this
          position it ascribes to the beast nobler powers of propagation than to
          man, for the beast multiplies itself after its kind. The last
          consideration is one of no great importance. And as far as mental and
          moral similarities of parents and children are concerned, it need not
          necessarily be assumed that these can be accounted for only on the
          basis of heredity. Our knowledge of the soul is still too deficient to
          speak with absolute assurance on this point. But this similarity may
          find its explanation partly in the example of the parents, partly in
          the influence of the body on the soul, and partly in the fact that God
          does not create all souls alike, but creates in each particular case a
          soul adapted to the body with which it will be united and the complex
          relationship into which it will be introduced. (3) It is not in
          harmony with God's present relationship to the world and His manner of
          working in it, since it teaches a direct creative activity of God, and
          thus ignores the fact that God now works through secondary causes and
          ceased from His creative work. This is not a very serious objection
          for those who do not have a deistic conception of the world. It is a
          gratuitous assumption that God has ceased from all creative activity
          in the world.
        </p>
        <p>5. CONCLUDING REMARKS.</p>
        <p>
          a.Caution required in speaking on the subject. It must be admitted
          that the arguments on both sides are rather well balanced. In view of
          this fact it is not surprising that Augustine found it rather hard to
          choose between the two. The Bible makes no direct statement respecting
          the origin of the soul of man, except in the case of Adam. The few
          Scriptural passages that are adduced as favoring the one theory or the
          other, can hardly be called conclusive on either side. And because we
          have no clear teaching of Scripture on the point in question, it is
          necessary to speak with caution on the subject. We ought not to be
          wise above that which is written. Several theologians are of the
          opinion that there is an element of truth in both of these theories,
          which must be recognized.13 Dorner even suggests the idea that each
          one of the three theories discussed represents one aspect of the whole
          truth: "Traducianism, generic consciousness; Pre- existentianism,
          self-consciousness or the interest of the personality as a separate
          eternal divine thought; Creationism, God-consciousness."14
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Some form of Creationism deserves preference. It seems to us that
          Creationism deserves the preference, because (1) it does not encounter
          the insuperable philosophical difficulty with which Traducianism is
          burdened; (2) it avoids the Christological errors which Traducianism
          involves; and (3) it is most in harmony with our covenant idea. At the
          same time we are convinced that the creative activity of God in
          originating human souls must be conceived as being most closely
          connected with the natural process in the generation of new
          individuals. Creationism does not claim to be able to clear up all
          difficulties, but at the same time it serves as a warning against the
          following errors: (1) that the soul is divisible; (2) that all men are
          numerically of the same substance; and (3) that Christ assumed the
          same numerical nature which fell in Adam.15
