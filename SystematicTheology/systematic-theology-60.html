        <p>IV. Christian Baptism</p>
        <p>A. ANALOGIES OF CHRISTIAN BAPTISM.</p>
        <p>
          1. IN THE GENTILE WORLD. Baptism was not something absolutely new in
          the days of Jesus. The Egyptians, the Persians, and the Hindus, all
          had their religious purifications. These were even more prominent in
          the Greek and Roman religions. Sometimes they took the form of a bath
          in the sea, and sometimes they were effected by sprinkling. Tertullian
          says that in some cases the idea of a new birth was connected with
          these lustrations. Many present day scholars hold that Christian
          baptism, especially as it was taught by Paul, owes its origin to
          similar rites in the mystery religions, but such a derivation does not
          even have appearance in its favor. While the initiatory rite in the
          mystery religions does involve a recognition of the deity in question,
          there is no trace of a baptism into the name of some god. Nor is there
          any evidence that the influence of the divine pneuma, rather prominent
          in the mystery religions, was ever connected with the rite of
          lustration. Moreover, the ideas of death and resurrection, which Paul
          associated with baptism, do not fit in with the mystery ritual at all.
          And, finally, the form of the taurobolium, which is supposed to be the
          most striking analogy that can be cited, is so foreign to the New
          Testament rite as to make the idea of the derivation of the latter
          from the former seem utterly ridiculous. These heathen purifications
          have very little in common, even in their external form, with our
          Christian baptism. Moreover, it is a well established fact that the
          mystery religions did not make their appearance in the Roman Empire
          before the days of Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. AMONG THE JEWS. The Jews had many ceremonial purifications and
          washings, but these had no sacramental character, and therefore were
          no signs and seals of the covenant. The so-called baptism of
          proselytes bore a greater resemblance to Christian baptism. When
          Gentiles were incorporated in Israel, they were circumcized and, at
          least in later times, also baptized. It has long been a debatable
          question, whether this custom was in vogue before the destruction of
          Jerusalem, but Schuerer has shown conclusively by quotations from the
          Mishna that it was. According to the Jewish authorities quoted by Wall
          in his History of Infant Baptism, this baptism had to be administered
          in the presence of two or three witnesses. Children of parents who
          received this baptism, if born before the rite was administered, were
          also baptized, at the request of the father as long as they were not
          of age (the boys thirteen and the girls twelve), but if they were of
          age, only at their own request. Children who were born after the
          baptism of the parent or parents, were accounted as clean and
          therefore did not need baptism. It seems, however, that this baptism
          was also merely a sort of ceremonial washing, somewhat in line with
          the other purifications. It is sometimes said that the baptism of John
          was derived from this baptism of proselytes, but it is quite clear
          that this was not the case. Whatever historical relation there may
          have existed between the two, it is quite evident that the baptism of
          John was pregnant with new and more spiritual meanings. Lambert is
          quite correct when he, in speaking of the Jewish lustrations, says:
          "Their purpose was, by removing a ceremonial defilement, to restore a
          man to his normal position within the ranks of the Jewish community;
          John's baptism, on the other hand, aimed at transferring those who
          submitted to it into an altogether new sphere â€” the sphere of
          definite preparation for the approaching Kingdom of God. But above
          all, the difference lay in this, that John's baptism could never be
          regarded as a mere ceremony; it was always vibrant through and through
          with ethical meaning. A cleansing of the heart from sin was not only
          its preliminary condition, but its constant aim and purpose. And by
          the searching and incisive preaching with which he accompanied it,
          John kept it from sinking, as it would otherwise have tended to do, to
          the level of a mere opus operatum."39
        </p>
        <p>
          Another question that calls for consideration, is that of the relation
          of the baptism of John to that of Jesus. The Roman Catholic Church in
          the Canons of Trent 40 curses those who say that the baptism of John
          equalled that of Jesus in efficacy, and regards it, along with the Old
          Testament sacraments, as purely typical. It claims that those who were
          baptized by John did not receive real baptismal grace in this baptism,
          and were at a later time re-baptized, or, more correctly expressed,
          baptized for the first time in the Christian manner. The older
          Lutheran theologians maintained that the two were identical as far as
          purpose and efficacy were concerned, while some of the later ones
          rejected what they considered to be a complete and essential identity
          of the two. Something similar may be said of Reformed theologians. The
          older theologians generally identified the two baptisms, while those
          of a more recent date direct attention to certain differences. John
          himself would seem to call attention to a point of difference in
          Mat_3:11. Some also find a proof for the essential difference of the
          two in Act_19:1-6, which, according to them, records a case in which
          some, who were baptized by John, were re-baptized. But this
          interpretation is subject to doubt. It would seem to be correct to say
          that the two are essentially identical, though differing in some
          points. The baptism of John, like the Christian baptism, (a) was
          instituted by God Himself, Mat_21:25; Joh_1:33; (b) was connected with
          a radical change of life, Luk_1:1-17; Joh_1:20-30; (c) stood in
          sacramental relation to the forgiveness of sins, Mat_3:7-8; Mar_1:4';
          Luk_3:3 (comp. Act_2:28) and (d) employed the same material element,
          namely, water. At the same time there were several points of
          difference: (a) the baptism of John still belonged to the old
          dispensation, and as such pointed forward to Christ; (b) in harmony
          with the dispensation of the law in general, it stressed the necessity
          of repentance, though not entirely to the exclusion of faith; (c) it
          was intended for the Jews only, and therefore represented the Old
          Testament particularism rather than the New Testament universalism;
          and (d) since the Holy Spirit had not yet been poured out in
          pentecostal fulness, it was not yet accompanied with as great a
          measure of spiritual gifts as the later Christian baptism.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE INSTITUTION OF CHRISTIAN BAPTISM.</p>
        <p>
          1. IT WAS INSTITUTED WITH DIVINE AUTHORITY. Baptism was instituted by
          Christ after He had finished the work of reconciliation and this had
          received the approval of the Father in the resurrection. It is worthy
          of notice that He prefaced the great commission with the words, "All
          authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth." Clothed
          with the fulness of that mediatorial authority, He instituted
          Christian baptism and thus made it binding for all following
          generations. The great commission is couched in the following words:
          "Go ye therefore (that is, because all nations are made subject to
          Me), and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of
          the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: teaching them to
          observe whatsoever I have commanded you." Mat_28:19-20. The
          complementary form in Mar_16:15-16 reads as follows: "Go ye into all
          the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation. He that
          believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth
          shall be condemned." Thus the following elements are clearly indicated
          in this authoritative command: (a) The disciples were to go out into
          the whole world and to preach the gospel to all nations, in order to
          bring people to repentance and to the acknowledgment of Jesus as the
          promised Saviour. (b) They who accepted Christ by faith were to be
          baptized in the name of the triune God, as a sign and seal of the fact
          that they had entered into a new relation to God and as such were
          obliged to live according to the laws of the Kingdom of God. (c) They
          were to be brought under the ministry of the Word, not merely as a
          proclamation of the good news, but as an exposition of the mysteries,
          the privileges, and the duties, of the new covenant. For the
          encouragement of the disciples Jesus adds the words, "And lo, I (who
          am clothed with the authority to give this commandment) am with you
          always, even unto the end of the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE BAPTISMAL FORMULA. The apostles were specifically instructed to
          baptize eis to onoma tou patros kai tou huiou kai tou hagiou pneumatos
          (into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit).
          The Vulgate rendered the first words " eis to onoma " by the Latin "in
          nomine" (in the name), a rendering followed by Luther's "im namen."
          The words are thus made to mean "on the authority of the triune God."
          Robertson gives this as their meaning in his Grammar of the Greek New
          Testament, p. 649, but fails to give any proof for it. The fact is
          that this interpretation is exegetically untenable. The idea of "on
          the authority of" is expressed by the phrase en toi onomati or the
          shorter one en onomati, Mat_21:9; Mar_16:17; Luk_10:17; Joh_14:26;
          Act_3:6; Act_9:27, etc. The preposition eis (into) is indicative
          rather of an end, and may therefore be interpreted to mean "in
          relation to," or "into the profession of faith in one and sincere
          obedience to one." It is quite in harmony with this when Allen says in
          his commentary on Matthew: "The person baptized was symbolically
          introduced 'into the name of Christ,' that is, became His disciple,
          that is, entered into a state of allegiance to Him and fellowship with
          Him." This is the meaning given by Thayer, Robinson, and,
          substantially, also by Cremer- Koegel and Baljon, in their Lexicons.
          It is also that adopted by the commentators, such as Meyer, Alford,
          Allen, Bruce, Grosheide, and Van Leeuwen. This meaning of the term is
          fully borne out by such parallel expressions as eis ton Mousen,
          1Co_10:2; eis to onoma Paulou, 1Co_1:13; eis hen soma, 1Co_12:13; and
          eis Christon Rom_6:3; Gal_3:27. Dr. Kuyper's argument touching this
          point is found in Uit het Woord, Eerste Serie, Eerste Bundel.41 It
          would seem that we should translate the preposition eis by "into" or
          "to" (that is, "in relation to'") the name. The word onoma (name) is
          used in the sense of the Hebrew shem as indicative of all the
          qualities by which God makes Himself known, and which constitute the
          sum total of all that He is for His worshippers. Deissman in his Bible
          Studies42 refers to interesting examples of this particular use of the
          word onoma in the papyri. Interpreted in this light, the baptismal
          formula indicates that by baptism (that is, by that which is signified
          in baptism) the recipient is placed in a special relationship to the
          divine self-revelation, or to God as He has revealed Himself and
          revealed what He will be for His people, and at the same time becomes
          duty bound to live up to the light of that revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not necessary to assume that, when Jesus employed these words,
          He intended them as a formula to be used ever after. He merely used
          them as descriptive of the character of the baptism which He
          instituted, just as similar expressions serve to characterize other
          baptisms, Act_19:3; 1Co_1:13; 1Co_10:2; 1Co_12:13. It is sometimes
          said with an appeal to such passages as Act_2:4-8; Act_8:16;
          Act_10:48; Act_19:5, and also Rom_6:3, and Gal_3:27, that the apostles
          evidently did not use the trinitarian formula; but this is not
          necessarily implied, though it is entirely possible since they did not
          understand the words of Jesus in the great commission as prescribing a
          definite formula. It is also possible, however, that the expressions
          used in the passages indicated served to stress certain particulars
          respecting the baptism of the apostles. It should be noted that the
          prepositions differ. Act_2:38 speaks of a baptism epi toi onomati
          Jesou Christou, which probably refers to a baptism on the confession
          of Jesus as the Messiah. According to Act_10:48 those who were present
          in the house of Cornelius were baptized en onomati Jesou Christou, to
          indicate that they were baptized on the authority of Jesus. All the
          remaining passages mention a baptism eis to onoma Jesou Christou (or
          tou kuriou Jesou), or simply a baptism eis Christon. These expressions
          may simply serve to stress the fact that the recipients were brought
          into special relationship to Jesus Christ, whom the apostles were
          preaching, and were thereby made subject to Him as their Lord. But
          whatever may have been the practice in the apostolic age, it is quite
          evident that when the Church later on felt the need of a formula, it
          could find no better than that contained in the words of the
          institution. This formula was already in use when the Didache (The
          Teaching of the Twelve Apostles) was written (c. 100 A.D.).43
        </p>
        <p>C. THE DOCTRINE OF BAPTISM IN HISTORY.</p>
        <p>
          1. BEFORE THE REFORMATION. The early Fathers regarded baptism as the
          rite of initiation into the Church, and usually considered it as
          closely connected with the forgiveness of sins and the communication
          of the new life. Some of their expressions would seem to indicate that
          they believed in baptismal regeneration. At the same time it should be
          noted that in the case of adults they did not regard baptism as
          efficacious apart from the right disposition of the soul, and they did
          not consider baptism as absolutely essential to the initiation of the
          new life, but rather looked upon it as the completing element in the
          process of renewal. Infant baptism was already current in the days of
          Origen and Tertullian, though the latter discouraged it on the grounds
          of expediency. The general opinion was that baptism should never be
          repeated, but there was no unanimity as to the validity of baptism
          administered by heretics. In course of time, however, it became a
          fixed principle not to re-baptize those who were baptized into the
          name of the triune God. The mode of baptism was not in dispute. From
          the second century on the idea gradually gained ground that baptism
          works more or less magically. Even Augustine seems to have considered
          baptism as effective ex opere operato in the case of children. He
          regarded baptism as absolutely necessary and held that unbaptized
          children are lost. According to him baptism cancels original guilt,
          but does not wholly remove the corruption of nature. The Scholastics
          at first shared Augustine's view, that in the case of adults baptism
          presupposes faith, but gradually another idea gained the upper hand,
          namely, that baptism is always effective ex opere operato. The
          importance of subjective conditions was minimized. Thus the
          characteristic Roman Catholic conception of the sacrament, according
          to which baptism is the sacrament of regeneration and of initiation
          into the Church, gradually gained the upper hand. It contains the
          grace which it signifies and confers this on all those who put no
          obstacle in the way. This grace was regarded as very important, since
          (a) it sets an indelible mark on the recipient as a member of the
          Church; (b) delivers from the guilt of original sin and of all actual
          sins committed up to the time of baptism, removes the pollution of
          sin, though concupiscence remains, and sets man free from eternal
          punishment and from all positive temporal punishments; (c) works
          spiritual renewal by the infusion of sanctifying grace and of the
          supernatural virtues of faith, hope, and love; and (d) incorporates
          the recipient into the communion of the saints and into the visible
          Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. SINCE THE REFORMATION. The Lutheran Reformation did not entirely
          rid itself of the Roman Catholic conception of the sacraments. Luther
          did not regard the water in baptism as common water, but as a water
          which had become, through the Word with its inherent divine power, a
          gracious water of life, a washing of regeneration. Through this divine
          efficacy of the Word the sacrament effects regeneration. In the case
          of adults Luther made the effect of baptism dependent on faith in the
          recipient. Realizing that he could not consider it so in the case of
          children, who cannot exercise faith, he at one time held that God by
          His prevenient grace works faith in the unconscious child, but later
          on professed ignorance on this point. Later Lutheran theologians
          retained the idea of an infant-faith as a precondition for baptism,
          while others conceived of baptism as producing such a faith
          immediately. This in some cases led on to the idea that the sacrament
          works ex opere operato. Anabaptists cut the Gordian knot of Luther by
          denying the legitimacy of infant baptism. They insisted on baptizing
          all applicants for admission to their circle, who had received the
          sacrament in infancy, and did not regard this as a re-baptism, but as
          the first true baptism. With them children had no standing in the
          Church. Calvin and Reformed theology proceeded on the assumption that
          baptism is instituted for believers, and does not work but strengthens
          the new life. They were naturally confronted with the question as to
          how infants could be regarded as believers, and how they could be
          strengthened spiritually, seeing that they could not yet exercise
          faith. Some simply pointed out that infants born of believing parents
          are children of the covenant, and as such heirs of the promises of
          God, including also the promise of regeneration; and that the
          spiritual efficacy of baptism is not limited to the time of its
          administration, but continues through life. The Belgic Confession also
          expresses that idea in these words: "Neither does this baptism avail
          us only at the time when water is poured upon us, and received by us,
          but also through the whole course of our life."44 Others went beyond
          this position and maintained that the children of the covenant were to
          be regarded as presumptively regenerated. This is not equivalent to
          saying that they are all regenerated, when they are presented for
          baptism, but that they are assumed to be regenerated until the
          contrary appears from their lives. There were also a few who regarded
          baptism as nothing more than the sign of an external covenant. Under
          the influence of Socinians, Arminians, Anabaptists, and Rationalists,
          it has become quite customary in many circles to deny that baptism is
          a seal of divine grace, and to regard it as a mere act of profession
          on the part of man. In our day many professing Christians have
          completely lost the consciousness of the spiritual significance of
          baptism. It has become a mere formality.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE PROPER MODE OF BAPTISM.</p>
        <p>
          Baptists are at variance with the rest of the Christian world in their
          position that dipping or immersion, followed by emersion, is the only
          proper mode of baptism; and that this mode is absolutely essential to
          baptism, because this rite is intended to symbolize the death and
          resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the consequent death and
          resurrection of the subject of baptism with Him. Two questions arise,
          therefore, and it is best to consider them in the following order: (1)
          What is the essential thing in the symbolism of baptism? and (2) Is
          immersion the only proper mode of baptism? This order is preferable,
          because the former question is the more important of the two, and
          because the answer to the second will depend in part on that given to
          the first.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. WHAT IS THE ESSENTIAL THING IN THE SYMBOLISM OF BAPTISM? According
          to the Baptists immersion, followed by emersion, is the essential
          thing in the symbolism of baptism. A surrender of this would be
          equivalent to giving up baptism itself. The real baptismal idea, they
          say, is expressed in the going down into, and the coming up out of,
          the water. That such an immersion naturally involves a certain washing
          or purification, is something purely accidental. Baptism would be
          baptism even if one were immersed in something that has no cleansing
          properties. They base their opinion on Mar_10:38-39; Luk_12:50;
          Rom_6:3-4; Col_2:12. But the first two passages merely express the
          idea that Christ would be overwhelmed by His coming sufferings, and do
          not speak of the sacrament of baptism at all. The last two are the
          only ones that really have any bearing on the matter, and even these
          are not to the point, for they do not speak directly of any baptism
          with water at all, but of the spiritual baptism thereby represented.
          They represent regeneration under the figure of a dying and a rising
          again. It is certainly perfectly obvious that they do not make mention
          of baptism as an emblem of Christ's death and resurrection. If baptism
          were represented here at all as an emblem, it would be as an emblem of
          the believer's dying and rising again. And since this is only a
          figurative way of representing his regeneration, it would make baptism
          a figure of a figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reformed theology has an entirely different conception of the
          essential thing in the symbolism of baptism. It finds this in the idea
          of purification. The Heidelberg Catechism asks in Question 69: "How is
          it signified and sealed unto you in holy baptism that you have a part
          in the one sacrifice of Christ on the cross?" And it answers: "Thus,
          that Christ has appointed the outward washing with water and added the
          promise that I am washed with His blood and Spirit from the pollution
          of my soul, that is, from all my sins, as certainly as I am washed
          outwardly with water, by which the filthiness of the body is commonly
          washed away." This idea of purification was the pertinent thing in all
          the washings of the Old Testament, and also in the baptism of John,
          Psa_51:7; Eze_36:25; Joh_3:25-26. And we may assume that in this
          respect the baptism of Jesus was entirely in line with previous
          baptisms. If He had intended the baptism which He instituted as a
          symbol of something entirely different, He would have indicated this
          very clearly, in order to obviate all possible misunderstanding.
          Moreover, Scripture makes it abundantly clear that baptism symbolizes
          spiritual cleansing or purification, Act_2:38; Act_22:16; Rom_6:4 f.;
          1Co_6:11; Tit_3:5; Heb_10:22; 1Pe_3:21; Rev_1:5. This is exactly the
          point on which the Bible places all emphasis, while it never
          represents the going down and coming up as something essential.

          2. IS IMMERSION THE ONLY PROPER MODE OF BAPTISM? The generally
          prevailing opinion outside of Baptist circles is that, as long as the
          fundamental idea, namely, that of purification, finds expression in
          the rite, the mode of baptism is quite immaterial. It may be
          administered by immersion, by pouring or effusion, or by sprinkling.
          The Bible simply uses a generic word to denote an action designed to
          produce a certain effect, namely, cleansing or purification, but
          nowhere determines the specific mode in which the effect is to be
          produced. Jesus did not prescribe a certain mode of baptism. He
          evidently did not attach as much importance to it as the Baptists do.
          Neither do the Biblical examples of baptism stress any particular
          mode. There is not a single case in which we are explicitly told just
          how baptism was administered. The Baptists assert, however, that the
          Lord did command baptism by immersion, and that all those who
          administer it in a different way are acting in open disobedience to
          His authority. To prove their assertion, they appeal to the words
          bapto and baptizo, which are used in Scripture for "to baptize." The
          second word seems to be an intensive or frequentative form of the
          first, though in general usage the distinction does not always hold.
          Bapto is frequently used in the Old Testament, but occurs in the New
          Testament only four times, namely, in Luk_16:24; Joh_13:26; Rev_19:13,
          and in these cases does not refer to Christian baptism. Baptists were
          very confident at one time that this verb means only "to dip"; but
          many of them have changed their mind since Carson, one of their
          greatest authorities, came to the conclusion that it also has a
          secondary meaning, namely, "to dye," so that it came to mean "to dye
          by dipping," and even, "to dye in any manner," in which case it ceased
          to be expressive of mode.45
        </p>
        <p>
          The question further arose, whether baptizo, which is used 76 times,
          and which is the word employed by the Lord in the words of the
          institution, was derived from bapto in its primary or in its secondary
          meaning. And Dr. Carson answers that it is derived from bapto in the
          sense of "to dip." Says he: " Bapto, the root, I have shown to possess
          two meanings, and two only, 'to dip' and 'to dye.' Baptizo, I have
          asserted, has but one signification. It has been founded on the
          primary meaning of the root, and has never admitted the secondary....
          My position is, that it always signifies to dip; never expressing
          anything but mode."46 The Baptists must maintain this, if they want to
          prove that the Lord commanded baptism by immersion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the facts, as they appear in both classical and New Testament
          Greek, do not warrant this position. Even Dr. Gale, who was perhaps
          the most learned author who sought to maintain it, felt constrained by
          the facts to modify it. Wilson in his splendid work on Infant Baptism,
          which is partly a reply to the work of Dr. Carson, quotes Gale as
          saying: "The word baptizo perhaps does not so necessarily express the
          action of putting under water, as in general a thing's being in that
          condition, no matter how it comes to be so, whether it is put into the
          water, or the water comes over it; though, indeed, to put into the
          water is the most natural way and the most common, and is, therefore,
          usually and pretty constantly, but it may be not necessarily,
          implied."47 Wilson shows conclusively that, according to Greek usage,
          baptism is effected in various ways. Says he: "Let the baptizing
          element encompass its object, and in the case of liquids, whether this
          relative state has been produced by immersion, effusion, overwhelming,
          or in any other mode, Greek usage recognizes it as a valid baptism."
          He further goes on to show in detail that it is impossible to maintain
          the position that the word baptizo always signifies immersion in the
          New Testament.48
        </p>
        <p>
          It is quite evident that both words, bapto and baptizo, had other
          meanings, such as "to wash," "to bathe," and to "purify by washing."
          The idea of washing or purification gradually became the prominent
          idea, while that of the manner in which this took place retired more
          and more into the background. That this purification was sometimes
          effected by sprinkling, is evident from Num_8:7; Num_19:13;
          Num_19:18-20; Psa_51:7; Eze_36:25; Heb_9:10. In Jdt_12:7 and Mar_7:3-4
          we cannot possibly think of dipping. Neither is this possible in
          connection with the following passages of the New Testament: Mat_3:11;
          Luk_11:37-38; Luk_12:50; Rom_6:3; 1Co_12:13; Heb_9:10 (cf.
          Heb_9:13-14, Heb_9:9, Heb_9:21); 1Co_10:1-2. Since the word baptizo
          does not necessarily mean "to immerse," and because the New Testament
          does not in any case explicitly assert that baptism took place by
          immersion, the burden of proof would seem to rest on the Baptists. Was
          John the Baptist capable of the enormous task of immersing the
          multitudes that flocked unto him at the river Jordan, or did he simply
          pour water on them as some of the early inscriptions would seem to
          indicate? Did the apostles find enough water in Jerusalem, and did
          they have the necessary facilities, to baptize three thousand in a
          single day by immersion? Where is the evidence to prove that they
          followed any other method than the Old Testament mode of baptisms?
          Does Act_9:18 indicate in any way that Paul left the place where
          Ananias found him, to be immersed in some pool or river? Does not the
          account of the baptism of Cornelius create the impression that water
          was to be brought and that those present were baptized right in the
          house? Act_10:47-48. Is there any evidence that the jailor at Philippi
          was not baptized in or near the prison, but led his prisoners out to
          the river, in order that he might be immersed? Would he have dared to
          take them outside of the city, when he was commanded to keep them
          safely? Act_16:22-33. Even the account of the baptism of the eunuch,
          Act_8:36; Act_8:38, which is often regarded as the strongest
          Scriptural proof for baptism by immersion, cannot be regarded as
          conclusive evidence. A careful study of Luke's use of the preposition
          eis shows that he used it not only in the sense of into but also in
          the sense of to so that it is entirely possible to read the relevant
          statement in verse 38 as follows: "and they both went down to the
          water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him." And even if
          the words were intended to convey the idea that they went down into
          the water, this does not yet prove the point, for according to
          pictorial representations of the early centuries they who were
          baptized by effusion often stood in the water. It is entirely
          possible, of course, that in the apostolic age some were baptized by
          immersion, but the fact that the New Testament nowhere insists on this
          proves that it was not essential. Immersion is a proper mode of
          baptism, but so is baptism by effusion or by sprinkling, since they
          all symbolize purification. The passages referred to in the preceding
          prove that many Old Testament washings (baptizings) took place by
          sprinkling. In a prophecy respecting the spiritual renewal of the New
          Testament day the Lord says: "And I will sprinkle clean water upon
          you, and ye shall be clean," Eze_36:25. The matter signified in
          baptism, namely, the purifying Spirit, was poured out upon the Church,
          Joe_2:28-29; Act_2:4; Act_2:33. And the writer of Hebrews speaks of
          his readers as having their hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,
          Heb_10:22.
        </p>
        <p>E. THE LAWFUL ADMINISTRATORS OF BAPTISM.</p>
        <p>
          Roman Catholics consider baptism absolutely essential to salvation;
          and because they regard it as cruel to make the salvation of anyone
          dependent on the accidental presence or absence of a priest, they also
          in cases of emergency permit baptism by others, particularly by
          midwives. In spite of the contrary view of Cyprian, they recognize the
          baptism of heretics, unless their heresy involves a denial of the
          Trinity. The Reformed Churches always acted on the principle that the
          administration of the Word and of the sacraments belong together, and
          that therefore the teaching elder or the minister is the only lawful
          administrator of baptism. The Word and the sacrament are joined
          together in the words of the institution. And because baptism is not a
          private matter, but an ordinance of the Church, they also hold that it
          should be administered in the public assembly of believers. They have
          generally recognized the baptism of other Churches, not excluding the
          Roman Catholics, and also of the various sects, except in the case of
          Churches and sects which denied the Trinity. Thus they refused to
          honour the baptism of the Socinians and of the Unitarians. In general,
          they considered a baptism as valid which was administered by a duly
          accredited minister and in the name of the triune God.
        </p>
        <p>F. THE PROPER SUBJECTS OF BAPTISM.</p>
        <p>
          Baptism is intended only for properly qualified rational beings,
          namely, for believers and their children. Rome loses sight of this in
          so far as it applies the sacrament also to clocks, buildings, and so
          on. There are two classes to which it should be applied, namely,
          adults and infants.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. ADULT BAPTISM. In the case of adults baptism must be preceded by a
          profession of faith, Mar_16:16; Act_2:41; Act_8:37 (not found in some
          MSS.); Act_16:31-33. Therefore the Church insists on such a profession
          before baptizing adults. And when such a profession is made, this is
          accepted by the Church at its face value, unless she has good
          objective reasons for doubting its veracity. It does not belong to her
          province to pry into the secrets of the heart and thus to pass on the
          genuineness of such a profession. The responsibility rests on the
          person who makes it. The method of prying into the inner condition of
          the heart, in order to determine the genuineness of one's profession,
          is Labadistic and not in harmony with the practice of the Reformed
          Churches. Since baptism is not merely a sign and seal, but also a
          means of grace, the question arises as to the nature of the grace
          wrought by it. This question is raised here only with respect to adult
          baptism. In view of the fact that according to our Reformed
          conception, this baptism presupposes regeneration, faith, conversion,
          and justification, these surely are not to be conceived as wrought by
          it. In this respect we differ from the Church of Rome. Even the
          Lutherans, who ascribe greater power to baptism as a means of grace
          than the Reformed do, agree with the latter on this point. Neither
          does baptism work a special sacramental grace, consisting in this that
          the recipient is implanted into the body of Jesus Christ. The
          believer's incorporation into mystical union with Christ is also
          presupposed. Word and sacrament work exactly the same kind of grace,
          except that the Word, in distinction from the sacrament, is also
          instrumental in the origination of faith. The sacrament of baptism
          strengthens faith, and because faith plays an important part in all
          the other operations of divine grace, these are also greatly benefited
          by it. Baptism represents primarily an act of the grace of God, but
          because the professing Christian must voluntarily submit to it, it can
          also be considered from the side of man. There is in it an offer and
          gift of God, but also an acceptance on the part of man. Consequently,
          baptism also signifies that man accepts the covenant and assumes its
          obligations. It is a seal, not merely of an offered, but of an offered
          and accepted, that is, of a concluded covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. INFANT BAPTISM. It is on the point of infant baptism that the most
          important difference is found between us and the Baptists. The latter
          hold, as Dr. Hovey, a Baptist author, expresses it, "that only
          believers in Christ are entitled to baptism, and that only those who
          give credible evidence of faith in Him should be baptized." This means
          that children are excluded from the sacrament. In all other
          denominations, however, they receive it. Several points call for
          consideration in connection with this subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The Scriptural basis for infant baptism. It may be said at the
          outset that there is no explicit command in the Bible to baptize
          children, and that there is not a single instance in which we are
          plainly told that children were baptized. But this does not
          necessarily make infant baptism un-Biblical. The Scriptural ground for
          it is found in the following data:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The covenant made with Abraham was primarily a spiritual covenant,
          though it also had a national aspect, and of this spiritual covenant
          circumcision was a sign and seal. It is an unwarranted procedure of
          the Baptists to split this covenant up into two of three different
          covenants. The Bible refers to the covenant with Abraham several
          times, but always in the singular, Exo_2:24; Lev_26:42; 2Ki_13:23;
          1Ch_16:16; Psa_105:9. There is not a single exception to this rule.
          The spiritual nature of this covenant is proved by the manner in which
          its promises are interpreted in the New Testament, Rom_4:16-18;
          2Co_6:16-18; Gal_3:8-9; Gal_3:14; Gal_3:16; Heb_8:10; Heb_11:9-10;
          Heb_11:13. It also follows from the fact that circumcision was clearly
          a rite that had spiritual significance, Deu_10:16; Deu_30:6; Jer_4:4;
          Jer_9:25-26; Act_15:1; Rom_2:26-29; Rom_4:11; Php_3:2; and from the
          fact that the promise of the covenant is even called "the gospel,"
          Gal_3:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) This covenant is still in force and is essentially identical with
          the "new covenant" of the present dispensation. The unity and
          continuity of the covenant in both dispensations follows from the fact
          that the Mediator is the same, Act_4:12; Act_10:43; Act_15:10-11;
          Gal_3:16; 1Ti_2:5-6; 1Pe_1:9-12; the condition is the same, namely,
          faith, Gen_1:1-6; (Rom_4:3); Psa_32:10; Heb_2:4; Act_10:43;
          Heb_11:1-40; and the blessings are the same, namely, justification,
          Psa_32:1-2; Psa_32:5; Isa_1:18; Rom_4:9; Gal_3:6, regeneration,
          Deu_30:6; Psa_51:10, spiritual gifts, Joe_2:28; Joe_2:32; Act_2:17-21;
          Isa_40:31, and eternal life, Heb_11:10. Peter gave those who were
          under conviction on the day of Pentecost the assurance that the
          promise was unto them and to their children, Act_2:39. Paul argues in
          Rom_4:13-18; Gal_3:13-18 that the giving of the law did not make the
          promise of none effect, so that it still holds in the new
          dispensation. And the writer of Hebrews points out that the promise to
          Abraham was confirmed with an oath, so that New Testament believers
          may derive comfort from its immutability, Heb_6:13-18.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) By the appointment of God infants shared in the benefits of the
          covenant, and therefore received circumcision as a sign and seal.
          According to the Bible the covenant is clearly an organic concept, and
          its realization moves along organic and historical lines. There is a
          people or nation of God, an organic whole such as could only be
          constituted by families. This national idea is naturally very
          prominent in the Old Testament, but the striking thing is that it did
          not disappear when the nation of Israel had served its purpose. It was
          spiritualized and thus carried over into the New Testament, so that
          the New Testament people of God are also represented as a nation,
          Mat_21:43; Rom_9:25-26 (comp. Hos_2:23); 2Co_6:16; Tit_2:14; 1Pe_2:9.
          Infants were considered during the old dispensation as an integral
          part of Israel as the people of God. They were present when the
          covenant was renewed, Deu_29:10, Deu_29:13; Jos_8:35; 2Ch_20:13, had a
          standing in the congregation of Israel, and were therefore present in
          their religious assemblies, 2Ch_20:13; Joe_2:16. In view of such rich
          promises as those in Isa_54:13; Jer_31:34; Joe_2:28 we would hardly
          expect the privileges of such children to be reduced in the new
          dispensation, and certainly would not look for their exclusion from
          any standing in the Church. Jesus and the apostles did not exclude
          them, Mat_19:14; Act_2:39; 1Co_7:14. Such an exclusion would seem to
          require a very explicit statement to that effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) In the new dispensation baptism is by divine authority substituted
          for circumcision as the initiatory sign and seal of the covenant of
          grace. Scripture strongly insists on it that circumcision can no more
          serve as such, Act_15:1-2; Act_21:21; Gal_2:3-5; Gal_5:2-6;
          Gal_6:12-13; Gal_6:15. If baptism did not take its place, then the New
          Testament has no initiatory rite. But Christ clearly substituted it as
          such, Mat_28:19-20; Mar_16:15-16. It corresponds with circumcision in
          spiritual meaning. As circumcision referred to the cutting away of sin
          and to a change of heart, Deu_10:16; Deu_32:6; Jer_4:4; Jer_9:25-26;
          Eze_44:7; Eze_44:9, so baptism refers to the washing away of sin,
          Act_2:38; 1Pe_3:21; Tit_3:5, and to spiritual renewal, Rom_6:4;
          Col_2:11-12. The last passage clearly links up circumcision with
          baptism, and teaches that the Christ-circumcision, that is,
          circumcision of the heart, signified by circumcision in the flesh, was
          accomplished by baptism, that is, by that which baptism signifies. Cf.
          also Gal_3:27; Gal_3:29. But if children received the sign and seal of
          the covenant in the old dispensation, the presumption is that they
          surely have a right to receive it in the new, to which the pious of
          the Old Testament were taught to look forward as a much fuller and
          richer dispensation. Their exclusion from it would require a clear and
          unequivocal statement to that effect, but quite the contrary is found,
          Mat_19:14; Act_2:39; 1Co_7:14.

          (5) As was pointed out in the preceding, the New Testament contains no
          direct evidence for the practice of infant baptism in the days of the
          apostles. Lambert, after considering and weighing all the available
          evidence, expresses his conclusion in the following words: "The New
          Testament evidence, then, seems to point to the conclusion that infant
          baptism, to say the least, was not the general custom of the apostolic
          age."49 But it need not surprise anyone that there is no direct
          mention of the baptism of infants, for in a missionary period like the
          apostolic age the emphasis would naturally fall on the baptism of
          adults. Moreover, conditions were not always favorable to infant
          baptism. Converts would not at once have a proper conception of their
          covenant duties and responsibilities. Sometimes only one of the
          parents was converted, and it is quite conceivable that the other
          would oppose the baptism of the children. Frequently there was no
          reasonable assurance that the parents would educate their children
          piously and religiously, and yet such assurance was necessary. At the
          same time the language of the New Testament is perfectly consistent
          with a continuation of the organic administration of the covenant,
          which required the circumcision of children, Mat_19:14; Mar_10:13-16;
          Act_2:39; 1Co_7:14. Moreover, the New Testament repeatedly speaks of
          the baptism of households, and gives no indication that this is
          regarded as something out of the ordinary, but rather refers to it as
          a matter of course, Act_16:15; Act_16:33; 1Co_1:16. It is entirely
          possible, of course, but not very probable, that none of these
          households contained children. And if there were infants, it is
          morally certain that they were baptized along with the parents. The
          New Testament certainly contains no evidence that persons born and
          reared in Christian families may not be baptized until they have come
          to years of discretion and have professed their faith in Christ. There
          is not the slightest allusion to any such practice.

          (6) Wall in the introduction to his History of Infant Baptism points
          out that in the baptism of proselytes children of proselytes were
          often baptized along with their parents; but Edersheim says that there
          was a difference of opinion on this point.50 Naturally, even if this
          did happen, it would prove nothing so far as Christian baptism is
          concerned, but it would go to show that there was nothing strange in
          such a procedure. The earliest historical reference to infant baptism
          is found in writings of the last half of the second century. The
          Didache speaks of adult, but not of infant baptism; and while Justin
          makes mention of women who became disciples of Christ from childhood
          (ek paidon), this passage does not mention baptism, and ek paidon does
          not necessarily mean infancy. IrenÃ¦us, speaking of Christ, says: "He
          came to save through means of Himself all who through Him are born
          again unto God, infants, and little children, and boys, and youths,
          and old men."51 This passage, though it does not explicitly mention
          baptism, is generally regarded as the earliest reference to infant
          baptism, since the early Fathers so closely associated baptism with
          regeneration that they used the term "regeneration" for "baptism."
          That infant baptism was quite generally practiced in the latter part
          of the second century, is evident from the writings of Tertullian,
          though he himself considered it safer and more profitable to delay
          baptism.52 Origen speaks of it as a tradition of the apostles. Says
          he: "For this also it was, that the Church had from the apostles a
          tradition (or, order) to give baptism even to infants."53 The Council
          of Carthage (A.D. 253) takes infant baptism for granted and discusses
          simply the question, whether they may be baptized before the eighth
          day. From the second century on, infant baptism is regularly
          recognized, though it was sometimes neglected in practice. Augustine
          inferred from the fact that it was generally practiced by the Church
          throughout the world in spite of the fact that it was not instituted
          in Councils, that it was in all probability settled by the authority
          of the apostles. Its legitimacy was not denied until the days of the
          Reformation, when the Anabaptists opposed it.

        <p>
          b. Objections to infant baptism. A few of the more important
          objections to infant baptism call for brief consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Circumcision was merely a carnal and typical ordinance, and as
          such was destined to pass away. To put baptism in the place of
          circumcision, is simply to continue the carnal ordinance. Such carnal
          ordinances have no legitimate place in the New Testament Church. In
          our day this objection is raised by some dispensationalists, such as
          Bullinger and O'Hair, who claim that the baptism instituted by Jesus
          is connected with the Kingdom, and that only the baptism of the Spirit
          has a proper place in the Church. The book of Acts marks the
          transition from water-baptism to Spirit-baptism. Naturally, this
          argument would prove all baptism, adult as well as infant,
          illegitimate. In this representation of the matter the Jewish and
          Christian dispensations are placed over against each other as carnal
          and spiritual, and circumcision is said to belong to the former. But
          this argument is fallacious. There is no warrant for placing
          circumcision altogether on a level with the carnal ordinances of the
          Mosaic law. Says Bannerman: "Circumcision was independent either of
          the introduction or abolition of the law of Moses; and would have
          continued the standing ordinance for admission into the Church of God
          as the seal of the covenant of grace, had not baptism been expressly
          appointed as a substitute for it."54 It may be admitted that
          circumcision did acquire a certain typical significance in the Mosaic
          period, but it was primarily a sign and seal of the covenant already
          made with Abraham. In so far as it was a type it naturally ceased with
          the appearance of the antitype, and even as a seal of the covenant it
          made way for an unbloody sacrament expressly instituted by Christ for
          the Church, and recognized as such by the apostles, since Christ had
          put an end once for all to the shedding of blood in connection with
          the work of redemption. In the light of Scripture the position is
          entirely untenable, that baptism is connected with the Kingdom rather
          than with the Church, and is therefore Jewish rather than Christian.
          The words of the institution themselves condemn this view, and so does
          the fact that on the birthday of the New Testament Church Peter
          required of those who were added to it that they should be baptized.
          And if it be said that Peter, being a Jew, still followed the example
          of John the Baptist, it may be pointed out that Paul, the apostle of
          the Gentiles, also required that his converts be baptized, Act_18:8;
          1Co_1:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no explicit command that children must be baptized. This is
          perfectly true, but does not disprove the validity of infant baptism.
          It should be observed that this objection is based on a canon of
          interpretation to which the Baptists themselves are not true when they
          hold that Christians are in duty bound to celebrate the first day of
          the week as their Sabbath, and that women must also partake of the
          Lord's Supper; for these are things not explicitly commanded. May not
          the silence of Scripture be construed for, rather than against, infant
          baptism? For twenty centuries children had been formally initiated
          into the Church, and the New Testament does not say that this must now
          cease, though it does teach that circumcision can no more serve for
          this purpose. The Lord Himself instituted another rite, and on the day
          of Pentecost Peter says to those who joined the Church that the
          promise is unto them and to their children, and further to as many as
          the Lord Himself shall call. This statement of Peter at least proves
          that he still had the organic conception of the covenant in mind.
          Moreover, the question may be raised how the Baptist himself can prove
          the correctness of his own position by an express command of
          Scripture. Does the Bible anywhere command the exclusion of children
          from baptism? Does it command that all those who are born and reared
          in Christian families must profess their faith before they are
          baptized? Clearly, there are no such commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) A closely related objection is, that there is no example of infant
          baptism in the New Testament. It is perfectly true that the Bible does
          not explicitly say that children were baptized, though it does apprise
          us of the fact that the rite was administered to whole households. The
          absence of all definite references to infant baptism finds its
          explanation, at least to a large extent, in the fact that Scripture
          gives us a historical record of the missionary work of the apostles,
          but no such record of the work that was carried on in the organized
          churches. And here, too, the tables may be easily turned on the
          Baptist. Will he show us an example of the baptism of an adult who had
          been born and reared in a Christian home? There is no danger that he
          ever will.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) The most important objection to infant baptism raised by the
          Baptists, is that, according to Scripture, baptism is conditioned on
          an active faith revealing itself in a creditable profession. Now it is
          perfectly true that the Bible points to faith as a prerequisite for
          baptism, Mar_16:16; Act_10:44-48; Act_16:14-15; Act_16:31; Act_16:34.
          If this means that the recipient of baptism must in all cases give
          manifestations of an active faith before baptism, then children are
          naturally excluded. But though the Bible clearly indicates that only
          those adults who believed were baptized, it nowhere lays down the rule
          that an active faith is absolutely essential for the reception of
          baptism. Baptists refer us to the great commission, as it is found in
          Mar_16:15-16. In view of the fact that this is a missionary command,
          we may proceed on the assumption that the Lord had in mind an active
          faith in those words. And though it is not explicitly stated, it is
          altogether likely that He regarded this faith as a prerequisite for
          the baptism of the persons intended. But who are they? Evidently, the
          adults of the nations that were to be evangelized, and therefore the
          Baptist is not warranted in construing it as an argument against
          infant baptism. If he insists on doing this nevertheless, it should be
          pointed out that on his construction these words prove too much even
          for him, and therefore prove nothing. The words of our Saviour imply
          that faith is a prerequisite for the baptism of those who through the
          missionary efforts of the Church would be brought to Christ, and do
          not imply that it is also a prerequisite for the baptism of children.
          The Baptist generalizes this statement of the Saviour by teaching that
          it makes all baptism contingent on the active faith of the recipient.
          He argues as follows: Active faith is the prerequisite of baptism.
          Infants cannot exercise faith. Therefore infants may not be baptized.
          But in that way these words might also be construed into an argument
          against infant salvation, since they not only imply but explicitly
          state that faith (active faith) is the condition for salvation. To be
          consistent the Baptist would thus find himself burdened with the
          following syllogism: Faith is the conditio sine qua non of salvation.
          Children cannot yet exercise faith. Therefore children cannot be
          saved. But this is a conclusion from which the Baptist himself would
          shrink back.
        </p>
        <p>c. The ground for infant baptism.</p>
        <p>
          (1) The position of our confessional standards. The Belgic Confession
          declares in Art. XXXIV that infants of believing parents "ought to be
          baptized and sealed with the sign of the covenant, as the children of
          Israel formerly were circumcized upon the same promises which are made
          to our children." The Heidelberg Catechism answers the question, "Are
          infants also to be baptized?" as follows: "Yes, for since they, as
          well as adults, are included in the covenant and Church of God, and
          since both redemption from sin and the Holy Spirit, the Author of
          faith, are through the blood of Christ promised to them no less than
          to adults, they must also by baptism, as a sign of the covenant, be
          ingrafted into the Christian Church, and distinguished from the
          children of unbelievers, as was done in the old covenant or testament
          by circumcision, instead of which baptism was instituted in the new
          covenant."55 And the Canons of Dort contain the following statement in
          I, Art. 17: "Since we are to judge of the will of God from His Word,
          which testifies that the children of believers are holy, not by
          nature, but in virtue of the covenant of grace, in which they together
          with their parents are comprehended, godly parents ought not to doubt
          the election and salvation of their children whom it pleases God to
          call out of this life in their infancy (Gen_17:7; Act_2:39;
          1Co_7:14)." These statements of our confessional standards are
          entirely in line with the position of Calvin, that infants of
          believing parents, or those who have only one believing parent, are
          baptized on the basis of their covenant relationship.56 The same note
          is struck in our Form for the Baptism of Infants: "Since, then,
          baptism has come in the place of circumcision, the children should be
          baptized as heirs of the Kingdom of God and of His covenant." It will
          be observed that all these statements are based on the commandment of
          God to circumcize the children of the covenant, for in the last
          analysis that commandment is the ground of infant baptism. On the
          basis of our confessional standards it may be said that infants of
          believing parents are baptized on the ground that they are children of
          the covenant, and are as such heirs of the all-comprehensive
          covenant-promises of God, which include also the promise of the
          forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit unto regeneration
          and sanctification. In the covenant God makes over to them a certain
          grant or donation in a formal and objective way, requires of them that
          they will in due time accept this by faith, and promises to make it a
          living reality in their lives by the operation of the Holy Spirit. And
          in view of this fact the Church must regard them as prospective heirs
          of salvation, must regard them as under obligation to walk in the way
          of the covenant, has the right to expect that, under a faithful
          covenant administration, they, speaking generally, will live in the
          covenant, and is in duty bound to regard them as covenant breakers, if
          they do not meet its requirements. It is only in this way that it does
          full justice to the promises of God, which must in all their fulness
          be appropriated in faith by those who come to maturity. Thus the
          covenant, including the covenant promises, constitutes the objective
          and legal ground for the baptism of children. Baptism is a sign and
          seal of all that is comprehended in the promises.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Differences of opinion among Reformed theologians. Reformed
          theologians did not all agree in the past, and are not even now all
          unanimous, in their representation of the ground of infant baptism.
          Many theologians of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries took the
          position described in the preceding, namely, that infants of believers
          are baptized, because they are in the covenant and are as such heirs
          of the rich promises of God including a title, not only to
          regeneration, but also to all the blessings of justification and of
          the renewing and sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit. Others,
          however, while recognizing the truth of this representation, were not
          wholly satisfied with it. They stressed the fact that baptism is
          something more than the seal of a promise, or even of all the covenant
          promises; and that it is not merely the seal of a future good, but
          also of present spiritual possessions. The view became rather
          prevalent that baptism is administered to infants on the ground of
          presumptive regeneration. But even those who accepted this view did
          not all agree. Some combined this view with the other while others
          substituted it for the other. Some would proceed on the assumption
          that all the children presented for baptism are regenerated, while
          others would assume this only in connection with the elect children.
          The difference of opinion between those who believe that children of
          believers are baptized on the ground of their covenant relationship
          and of the covenant promise, and those who find this ground in
          presumptive regeneration persisted up to the present time and was the
          source of a lively controversy, especially in the Netherlands during
          the last period of the nineteenth, and the beginning of the twentieth,
          century. Dr. Kuyper at first spoke of presumptive regeneration as the
          ground of infant baptism, and many readily accepted this view. G.
          Kramer wrote his splendid thesis on Het Verband van Doop en
          Wedergeboorte especially in defense of this position. Later on Dr.
          Kuyper did not use this expression any more, and some of his followers
          felt the need of more careful discrimination and spoke of the covenant
          relationship as the legal, and presumptive regeneration as the
          spiritual ground of infant baptism. But even this is not a
          satisfactory position. Dr. Honig, who is also a disciple and admirer
          of Kuyper, is on the right track when he says in his recent Handboek
          van de Gereformeerde Dogmatiek57 "We do not baptize the children of
          believers on the ground of an assumption, but on the ground of a
          command and an act of God. Children must be baptized in virtue of the
          covenant of God" (translation mine). Presumptive regeneration
          naturally cannot be regarded as the legal ground of infant baptism;
          this can be found only in the covenant promise of God. Moreover, it
          cannot be the ground in any sense of the word, since the ground of
          baptism must be something objective, as the advocates of the view in
          question themselves are constrained to admit. If they are asked, why
          they assume the regeneration of children presented for baptism, they
          can only answer, Because they are born of believing parents, that is,
          because they are born in the covenant. Naturally, to deny that
          presumptive regeneration is the ground of infant baptism, is not
          equivalent to saying that it is entirely unwarranted to assume that
          infant children of believers are regenerated. This is a question that
          must be considered on its own merits.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be well to quote in this connection the first half of the
          fourth point of the Conclusions of Utrecht, which were adopted by our
          Church in 1908. We translate this as follows: "And, finally, as far as
          the fourth point, that of presumptive regeneration, is concerned,
          Synod declares that, according to the confession of our Churches, the
          seed of the covenant must, in virtue of the promise of God, be
          presumed to be regenerated and sanctified in Christ, until, as they
          grow up, the contrary appears from their life or doctrine; that it is,
          however, less correct to say that baptism is administered to the
          children of believers on the ground of their presumptive regeneration,
          since the ground of baptism is the command and the promise of God; and
          that further the judgment of charity, with which the Church presumes
          the seed of the covenant to be regenerated, by no means intends to say
          that therefore each child is really regenerated, since the Word of God
          teaches that they are not all Israel that are of Israel, and it is
          said of Isaac: in him shall thy seed be called (Rom_9:6-7), so that in
          preaching it is always necessary to insist on serious
          self-examination, since only those who shall have believed and have
          been baptized will be saved."58
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Objection to the view that children are baptized on the ground of
          their covenant relationship. It has been said that, if children are
          baptized on the ground that they are born in the covenant and are
          therefore heirs of the promise, they are baptized on another ground
          than adults, since these are baptized on the ground of their faith or
          their profession of faith. But this is hardly correct, as Calvin
          already pointed out in his day. The great Reformer answered this
          objection effectively. The following is a translation of what Kramer
          says respecting Calvin's position on this point: "Calvin finds
          occasion here in connection with infant baptism, now that he has taken
          the standpoint of the covenant, to draw the line farther. Up to this
          point he has not called attention to the fact that adults too are
          baptized according to the rule of the covenant. And therefore it might
          seem that there was a difference between the baptism of adults and
          that of children. The adults to be baptized on the ground of their
          faith, infants, on the ground of the covenant of God. No, the Reformer
          declares, the only rule according to which, and the legal ground on
          which, the Church may administer baptism, is the covenant. This is
          true in the case of adults as well as in the case of children. That
          the former must first make a confession of faith and conversion, is
          due to the fact that they are outside of the covenant. In order to be
          admitted into the communion of the covenant, they must first learn the
          requirements of the covenant, and then faith and conversion open the
          way to the covenant."59 The very same opinion is expressed by
          Bavinck.60 This means that, after adults find entrance into the
          covenant by faith and conversion, they receive the sacrament of
          baptism on the ground of this covenant relationship. Baptism is also
          for them a sign and seal of the covenant.

          d. Infant baptism as a means of grace. Baptism is a sign and seal of
          the covenant of grace. It does not signify one thing and seal another,
          but sets the seal of God on that which it signifies. According to our
          confessional standards and our Form for the administration of baptism,
          it signifies the washing away of our sins, and this is but a brief
          expression for the removal of the guilt of sin in justification, and
          for the removal of the pollution of sin in sanctification, which is,
          however, imperfect in this life. And if this is what is signified,
          then it is also that which is sealed. And if it be said, as it is
          sometimes in our Reformed literature, that baptism seals the
          promise(s) of God, this does not merely mean that it vouches for the
          truth of the promise, but that it assures the recipients that they are
          the appointed heirs of the promised blessings. This does not
          necessarily mean that they are already in principle in possession of
          the promised good, though this is possible and may even be probable,
          but certainly means that they are appointed heirs and will receive the
          heritage, unless they show themselves unworthy of it and refuse it.
          Dabney calls attention to the fact that seals are often appended to
          promissory covenants, in which the bestowment of the promised good is
          conditional.

          But baptism is more than a sign and seal; it is as such also a means
          of grace. According to Reformed theology it is not, as the Roman
          Catholics claim, the means of initiating the work of grace in the
          heart, but it is a means for the strengthening of it or, as it is
          often expressed, for the increase of grace. This gives rise to a
          rather difficult question in connection with infant baptism. It can
          readily be seen how baptism can strengthen the work of faith in the
          adult recipient, but it is not so apparent how it can operate as a
          means of grace in the case of children who are entirely unconscious of
          the significance of baptism and cannot yet exercise faith. The
          difficulty, with which we are confronted here, naturally does not
          exist for the small number of Reformed scholars who deny that baptism
          merely strengthens an antecedent condition of grace, and claim that it
          "is a means for the impartation of grace in a specific form, and for
          the specific end of our regeneration and ingrafting in Christ."61 All
          the others must, of course, face the problem. Luther also wrestled
          with that problem. He made the efficacy of baptism dependent on the
          faith of the recipient; but when he reflected on the fact that infants
          cannot exercise faith, he was inclined to believe that God by His
          prevenient grace wrought an incipient faith in them through baptism;
          and, finally, he referred the problem to the doctors of the Church.
          Reformed theologians solve the problem by calling attention to three
          things, which may be regarded as alternatives, but may also be
          combined. (1) It is possible to proceed on the assumption (not the
          certain knowledge) that the children offered for baptism are
          regenerated and are therefore in possession of the semen fidei (the
          seed of faith); and to hold that God through baptism in some mystical
          way, which we do not understand, strengthens this seed of faith in the
          child. (2) Attention may also be called to the fact that the operation
          of baptism as a means of grace is not necessarily limited to the
          moment of its administration any more than that of the Lord's Supper
          is limited to the time of its celebration. It may in that very moment
          serve in some mysterious way to increase the grace of God in the
          heart, if present, but may also be instrumental in augmenting faith
          later on, when the significance of baptism is clearly understood. This
          is clearly taught in both the Belgic and the Westminster Confession.
          (3) Again, it may be pointed out, as has been done by some theologians
          (e.g. Dabney and Vos) that infant baptism is also a means of grace for
          the parents who present their child for baptism. It serves to
          strengthen their faith in the promises of God, to work in them the
          assurance that the child for whom they stand sponsors has a right of
          property in the covenant of grace, and to strengthen in them the sense
          of responsibility for the Christian education of their child.

          e. The extension of baptism to children of unbelievers. Naturally,
          only children of believers are the proper subjects of infant baptism.
          In several ways, however, the circle has been enlarged. (1) Roman
          Catholics and Ritualists of the Anglican Church proceed on the
          assumption that baptism is absolutely essential to salvation, since it
          conveys a grace that can be obtained in no other way. Hence they
          consider it their duty to baptize all children that come within their
          reach, without inquiring as to the spiritual condition of their
          parents. (2) Some call attention to the fact that the promise applies
          to parents and children and children's children, even to the
          thousandth generation, Psa_105:7-10; Isa_59:21; Act_2:39. In view of
          these promises they maintain that children whose parents have left the
          Church have not thereby forfeited their privileges as children of the
          covenant. (3) There are those who externalize the covenant by making
          it co- extensive with the State in a State-Church. An English child,
          has, as such, just as much right to baptism as it has to State
          protection, irrespective of the question, whether the parents are
          believers or not. (4) Some have taken the position that the fact that
          parents are baptized, also assures their children of a title to
          baptism. They regard the personal relation of the parents to the
          covenant as quite immaterial. Churches have occasionally acted on that
          principle, and finally harbored a class of members who did not
          themselves assume the responsibility of the covenant, and yet sought
          the seal of the covenant for their children. In New England this was
          known as the half-way covenant. (5) Finally, the principle of adoption
          has been applied, in order to obtain baptism for children who were not
          entitled to it otherwise. If the parents were unfit or unwilling to
          vouch for the Christian education of their children, others could step
          in to guarantee this. The main ground for this was sought in
          Gen_17:12.

          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: What are the different meanings of the
          words bapto, baptizo, and louesthai? Did John the Baptist baptize by
          immersion? Was the eunuch (Act_8:38-39) baptized in that manner? Does
          the New Testament anywhere emphasize the necessity of one particular
          mode of baptism? Is the doctrine of infant baptism Biblical? Was its
          right ever called in question before the Reformation? What accounts
          for the rise of the Anabaptist denial at the time of the Reformation?
          What is the Baptist conception of the covenant with Abraham? How do
          they explain Rom_4:11 What do our confessional standards say as to the
          ground on which children are baptized? What is Calvin's position as to
          the ground on which both children and adults are baptized? What
          practical dangers are connected with the doctrine of presumptive
          regeneration? How about Dabney's position that baptism is a sacrament
          to the parent as well as to the child?
