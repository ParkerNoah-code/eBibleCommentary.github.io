        <p>V. The Final State</p>
        <p>
          The last judgment determines, and therefore naturally leads on to, the
          final state of those who appear before the judgment seat. Their final
          state is either one of everlasting misery or one of eternal
          blessedness.
        </p>
        <p>A. THE FINAL STATE OF THE WICKED.</p>
        <p>
          There are especially three points that call for consideration here:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE PLACE TO WHICH THE WICKED ARE CONSIGNED. In present day
          theology there is an evident tendency in some circles to rule out the
          idea of eternal punishment. The Annihilationists, which are still
          represented in such sects as Adventism and Millennial Dawnism, and the
          advocates of conditional immortality, deny the continued existence of
          the wicked, and thereby render a place of eternal punishment
          unnecessary. In modern liberal theology the word "hell" is generally
          regarded as a figurative designation of a purely subjective condition,
          in which men may find themselves even while on earth, and which may
          become permanent in the future. But these interpretations certainly do
          not do justice to the data of Scripture. There can be no reasonable
          doubt as to the fact that the Bible teaches the continued existence of
          the wicked, Mat_24:5; Mat_25:30; Mat_25:46; Luk_16:19-31. Moreover, in
          connection with the subject of "hell" the Bible certainly uses local
          terms right along. It calls the place of torment gehenna, a name
          derived from the Hebrew ge (land, or valley) and hinnom or beney
          hinnom, that is, Hinnom or sons of Hinnom. This name was originally
          applied to a valley southwest of Jerusalem. It was the place where
          wicked idolators sacrificed their children to Moloch by causing them
          to pass through the fire. Hence it was considered impure and was
          called in later days "the valley of tophet (spittle), as an utterly
          despised region. Fires were constantly burning there to consume the
          offal of Jerusalem. As a result it became a symbol of the place of
          eternal torment. Mat_18:9 speaks of ten geennan tou puros, the gehenna
          of fire, and this strong expression is used synonymously with to pur
          to aionion, the eternal fire, in the previous verse. The Bible also
          speaks of a "furnace of fire," Mat_13:42, and of a "lake of fire,"
          Rev_20:14-15, which forms a contrast with the "sea of glass like unto
          crystal," Rev_4:6. The terms "prison," 1Pe_3:19, "abyss," Luk_8:31,
          and "tartarus," 2Pe_2:4 are also used. From the fact that the
          preceding terms are all local designations, we may infer that hell is
          a place. Moreover, local expressions are generally used in connection
          with it. Scripture speaks of those who are excluded from heaven as
          being "outside," and as being "cast into hell." The description in
          Luk_16:19-31 is certainly altogether local.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE STATE IN WHICH THEY WILL CONTINUE THEIR EXISTENCE. It is
          impossible to determine precisely what will constitute the eternal
          punishment of the wicked, and it behooves us to speak very cautiously
          on the subject. Positively, it may be said to consist in (a) a total
          absence of the favor of God; (b) an endless disturbance of life as a
          result of the complete domination of sin; (c) positive pains and
          sufferings in body and soul; and (d) such subjective punishments as
          pangs of conscience, anguish, despair, weeping, and gnashing of teeth,
          Mat_8:12; Mat_13:50; Mar_9:43-44; Mar_9:47-48; Luk_16:23; Luk_16:28;
          Rev_14:10; Rev_21:8. Evidently, there will be degrees in the
          punishment of the wicked. This follows from such passages as
          Mat_11:22; Mat_11:24; Luk_12:47-48; Luk_20:17. Their punishment will
          be commensurate with their sinning against the light which they had
          received. But it will, nevertheless, be eternal punishment for all of
          them. This is plainly stated in Scripture, Mat_18:8; 2Th_1:9;
          Rev_14:11; Rev_20:10. Some deny that there will be a literal fire,
          because this could not affect spirits like Satan and his demons. But
          how do we know this? Our body certainly works on our soul in some
          mysterious way. There will be some positive punishment corresponding
          to our bodies. It is undoubtedly true, however, that a great deal of
          the language concerning heaven and hell must be understood
          figuratively.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE DURATION OF THEIR PUNISHMENT. The question of the eternity of
          the future punishment deserves more special consideration, however,
          because it is frequently denied. It is said that the words used in
          Scripture for "everlasting" and "eternal" may simply denote an "age"
          or a "dispensation," or any other long period of time. Now it cannot
          be doubted that they are so used in some passages, but this does not
          prove that they always have that limited meaning. It is not the
          literal meaning of these terms. Whenever they are so used, they are
          used figuratively, and in such cases their figurative use is generally
          quite evident from the connection. Moreover, there are positive
          reasons for thinking that these words do not have that limited meaning
          in the passages to which we referred. (a) In Mat_24:46 the same word
          describes the duration of both, the bliss of the saints and the
          penalty of the wicked. If the latter is not, properly speaking,
          unending, neither is the former; and yet many of those who doubt
          eternal punishment, do not doubt everlasting bliss. (b) Other
          expressions are used which cannot be set aside by the consideration
          mentioned in the preceding. The fire of hell is called an
          "unquenchable fire," Mar_9:43; and it is said of the wicked that
          "their worm dieth not," Mar_9:48. Moreover, the gulf that will
          separate saints and sinners in the future is said to be fixed and
          impassable, Luk_16:26.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE FINAL STATE OF THE RIGHTEOUS.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE NEW CREATION. The final state of believers will be preceded by
          the passing of the present world and the appearance of a new creation.
          Mat_19:28 speaks of "the regeneration," and Act_3:21, of "the
          restoration of all things." In Heb_12:27 we read: "And this word, Yet
          once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken
          (heaven and earth), as of things that are made, that those things
          which are not shaken (the kingdom of God) may remain." Peter says:
          "But according to His promise, we look for new heavens and a new
          earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness," 2Pe_3:13, cf. 2Pe_3:12; and
          John saw this new creation in a vision, Rev_21:1. It is only after the
          new creation has been established, that the new Jerusalem descends out
          of heaven from God, that the tabernacle of God is pitched among men,
          and that the righteous enter upon their eternal joy. The question is
          often raised, whether this will be an entirely new creation, or a
          renewal of the present creation. Lutheran theologians strongly favor
          the former position with an appeal to 2Pe_3:7-13; Rev_20:11; and
          Rev_21:1; while Reformed theologians prefer the latter idea, and find
          support for it in Psa_102:26-27; (Heb_1:10-12); and Heb_12:26-28.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE ETERNAL ABODE OF THE RIGHTEOUS. Many conceive of heaven also as
          a subjective condition, which men may enjoy in the present and which
          in the way of righteousness will naturally become permanent in the
          future. But here, too, it must be said that Scripture clearly presents
          heaven as a place. Christ ascended to heaven, which can only mean that
          He went from one place to another. It is described as the house of our
          Father with many mansions, Joh_14:1, and this description would hardly
          fit a condition. Moreover, believers are said to be within, while
          unbelievers are without, Mat_22:12-13; Mat_25:10-12. Scripture gives
          us reasons to believe that the righteous will not only inherit heaven,
          but the entire new creation, Mat_5:5; Rev_21:1-3.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE NATURE OF THEIR REWARD. The reward of the righteous is
          described as eternal life, that is, not merely an endless life, but
          life in all its fulness, without any of the imperfections and
          disturbances of the present, Mat_25:46; Rom_2:7. The fulness of this
          life is enjoyed in communion with God, which is really the essence of
          eternal life, Rev_21:3. They will see God in Jesus Christ face to
          face, will find full satisfaction in Him, will rejoice in Him, and
          will glorify Him. We should not think of the joys of heaven, however,
          as exclusively spiritual. There will be something corresponding to the
          body. There will be recognition and social intercourse on an elevated
          plane. It is also evident from Scripture that there will be degrees in
          the bliss of heaven, Dan_12:3; 2Co_9:6. Our good works will be the
          measure of our gracious reward, though they do not merit it.
          Notwithstanding this, however, the joy of each individual will be
          perfect and full.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: Why does the moral sense of mankind
          demand a future judgment? To what historical precursors of the final
          judgment does Scripture refer? Where will the final judgment take
          place? What encouragement is there for believers in the fact that
          Christ will be the Judge? Does not the expression that he who believes
          on the Son "shall not come into condemnation," Joh_5:24, prove that
          believers will not be judged? What works will come into consideration
          in the final judgment according to Scripture? If all believers inherit
          eternal life, in what sense is their reward determined by their works?
          Does the judgment serve the purpose of acquainting God better with
          men? What purpose does it serve? Will men be finally lost only for the
          sin of consciously rejecting Christ?
