        <h2>1. A PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE</h2>
        <p>
          Saint Paul, was falsely accused of sedition by Tertullus: “We have
          found this man a troublesome fellow, and a worker of sedition” (Act
          24.5). And so Paul makes an apology for himself before Festus and King
          Agrippa in Chapter 26 of the Book of Act.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul proves himself as an orator. He courts the king (1) by his
          gesture: he stretched forth his hands, as was the custom of orators;
          (2) by his manner of speech: “I think of myself as happy, king
          Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself before you, touching upon
          all the things of which I am accused” (Act 26.2).
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul then addresses three things, and in so deep a strain of rhetoric
          as almost to have converted King Agrippa:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) <b>He speaks of the manner of his life before his conversion</b>:
          “I lived as a Pharisee after the strictest sect of our religion”
          (v.5). During the time of his unregeneracy, he was zealous for
          traditions; his false fire of zeal was so hot that it scorched all who
          stood in his way; “I shut up many of the saints in prison” (v.10).
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) <b>He speaks of the manner of his conversion</b>: “I saw in the
          road a light from heaven, beyond the brightness of the sun” (v.13).
          This light was none other than what shone from Christ’s glorified
          body. “And I heard a voice speaking to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you
          persecute me?’” The body being hurt, the head in heaven cried out.
          Paul was amazed at this light and voice, and fell to the earth: “I
          said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said, ‘I am Jesus whom you
          persecute’” (v. 14-15). Paul was now departed from himself. All
          opinion of self-righteousness vanished and he grafted his hope of
          heaven upon the stock of Christ’s righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) <b>He speaks of the manner of his life after his conversion</b>:
          He who had been a persecutor before now became a preacher: “Arise, for
          I have appeared to you for this purpose: to make you a minister and a
          witness of those things which you have seen” (v. 16). When Paul, this
          “vessel of election,” was savingly worked upon, he labored to do as
          much good as previously he had done hurt. He had persecuted saints to
          death before; now he preached sinners to life. God first sent him to
          the Jews at Damascus and afterwards enlarged his commission to preach
          to the Gentiles. And the subject he preached was this, “That they
          should repent and turn to God, and do works fit for repentance” (v.
          20). A weighty and excellent subject!
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall not dispute the priority, whether faith or repentance goes
          first. Doubtless repentance shows itself first in a Christian’s life.
          Yet I am apt to think that the seeds of faith are first worked in the
          heart. When a burning taper is brought into a room, the light shows
          itself first, but the taper preceded the light. In the same way, we
          see the fruits of repentance first, but the beginnings of faith were
          there before.
        </p>
        <p>
          What inclines me to think that faith is seminally in the heart before
          repentance is because repentance, being a grace, must be exercised by
          someone who is living. Now, how does the soul live but by faith? “The
          just shall live by his faith” (Heb 10.38). Therefore, there must first
          be some seeds of faith in the heart of a penitent; otherwise it is
          dead repentance and of no value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether faith or repentance goes first, however, I am sure that
          repentance is of such importance that there can be no saving without
          it. After Paul’s shipwreck, he swam to shore on planks and broken
          pieces of the ship (Act 27.44). In Adam we all suffered shipwreck, and
          repentance is the only plank left us after shipwreck to swim to
          heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a great duty incumbent upon Christians to solemnly repent and
          turn to God: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Mat 3.2);
          “Repent therefore, and be converted so that your sins may be blotted
          out” (Act 3.19); “Repent of your wickedness” (Act 8.22). In the mouths
          of three witnesses this truth is confirmed. Repentance is a foundation
          grace: “Not laying again the foundation of repentance” (Heb 6.1). That
          religion which is not built upon this foundation must fall to the
          ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Repentance is a grace required under the gospel. Some think it legal;
          but the first sermon that Christ preached, indeed, the first word of
          his sermon, was “Repent” (Mat 4.17). And his farewell that he left
          when he was going to ascend was that “repentance should be preached in
          his name” (Luk 24.47). The apostles all beat upon this string: “They
          went out and preached that men should repent” (Mar 6.12).
        </p>
        <p>
          Repentance is a pure gospel grace. The covenant of works allowed no
          repentance; there it was: sin and die. Repentance came in by the
          gospel. Christ has purchased us with his blood so that repenting
          sinners shall be saved. The law required personal, perfect, and
          perpetual obedience. It cursed all who could not come up to this:
          “Cursed is everyone that does not continue to do all things which are
          written in the book of the law” (Gal 3.10). It does not say, “He that
          does not obey all things, let him repent;” instead, it says “let him
          be cursed.” Thus repentance is a doctrine that has been brought to
          light only by the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >How is repentance worked? The manner in which repentance is worked
            is this:</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>1. <b>Partly by the word</b></p>
        <p>
          “When they heard this, they were pricked in their heart” (Act 2.37).
          The word preached is the engine God uses to effect repentance. It is
          compared to a hammer, and to a fire (Jer 23.29), the one to break, the
          other to melt the heart. How great a blessing it is to have the word
          dispensed, which is of such virtue! Those who put out the lights of
          heaven will find it hard to escape hell!
        </p>
        <p>2. <b>By the Spirit</b></p>
        <p>
          Ministers are but the pipes and organs. It is the Holy Ghost breathing
          in them that makes their words effectual: “While Peter was still
          speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all those who heard the
          word” (Act 10.44). The Spirit in the word illuminates and converts.
          When the Spirit touches a heart, it dissolves with tears: “I will pour
          out upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace ... and they
          shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn” (Zec
          12.10). It is wonderful to consider what different effects the word
          has upon men. Some at a sermon are like Jonah: their heart is tender
          and they let tears fall. Others are no more affected by it than a deaf
          man with music. Some grow better by the word; others grow worse. The
          same earth which causes sweetness in the grape causes bitterness in
          the wormwood. What is the reason the word works so differently? It is
          because the Spirit of God carries the word to the conscience of one,
          and not to another. One has received the divine unction, and not the
          other (1Joh 2.20). O pray that the dew may fall with the manna: that
          the Spirit may go along with the word. The chariot of ordinances will
          not carry us to heaven unless the Spirit of God joins himself to this
          chariot (Act 8.29).
