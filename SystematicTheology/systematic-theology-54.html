        <p>II. Nature of the Church</p>
        <p>A. THE ESSENCE OF THE CHURCH.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CONCEPTION. The early Christians spoke of the
          Church as the communio sanctorum, and thus already, though without
          having thought the matter through, gave expression to the essence of
          the Church. But even as early as the end of the second century, as the
          result of the rise of heresies, the question as to the true Church
          forced itself upon them and caused them to fix their attention upon
          certain characteristics of the Church as an external institution. From
          the days of Cyprian down to the Reformation the essence of the Church
          was sought ever increasingly in its external visible organization. The
          Church Fathers conceived of the catholic Church as comprehending all
          true branches of the Church of Christ, and as bound together in an
          external and visible unity, which had its unifying bond in the college
          of bishops. The conception of the Church as an external organization
          became more prominent as time went on. There was an ever growing
          emphasis on the hierarchical organization of it, and the capstone was
          added with the institution of the Papacy. Roman Catholics now define
          the Church as: " The congregation of all the Faithful, who, being
          baptized, profess the same faith, partake of the same sacraments, and
          are governed by their lawful pastors, under one visible head on
          earth." They make a distinction between the ecclesia docens and the
          ecclesia audiens, that is, between "the Church consisting of those who
          rule, teach, and edify" and "the Church which is taught, governed, and
          receives the sacraments." In the strictest sense of the word it is not
          the ecclesia audiens but the ecclesia docens that constitutes the
          Church. The latter shares directly in the glorious attributes of the
          Church, but the former is adorned with them only indirectly. Catholics
          are willing to admit that there is an invisible side to the Church,
          but prefer to reserve the name "Church" for the visible communion of
          believers. They frequently speak of the "soul of the Church," but do
          not seem to be altogether agreed as to the exact connotation of the
          term. Devine defines the soul of the Church as "the society of those
          who are called to faith in Christ, and who are united to Christ by
          supernatural gifts and graces."8 Wilmers, however, finds it in "all
          those spiritual, supernatural graces which constitute the Church of
          Christ, and enable its members to attain their last end." Says he:
          "What we call soul in general is that pervading principle which gives
          life to a body and enables its members to perform their peculiar
          functions. To the soul of the Church belong faith, the common
          aspiration of all to the same end, the invisible authority of
          superiors, the inward grace of sanctification, the supernatural
          virtues, and other gifts of grace."9 The former writer finds the soul
          of the Church in certain qualified persons, while the latter regards
          it as an all-pervading principle, something like the soul in man. But
          whatever Roman Catholics may be ready to grant, they will not admit
          that what may be called "the invisible Church" logically precedes the
          visible. Moehler says: "The Catholics teach: the visible Church is
          first,â€” then comes the invisible: the former gives birth to the
          latter." This means that the Church is a mater fidelium (mother of
          believers) before she is a communio fidelium (community of believers).
          Moehler grants, however, that there is one sense in which "the
          internal Church" is prior to "the exterior one," namely in the sense
          that we are not living members of the latter until we belong to the
          former. He discusses the whole subject of the relation of those two to
          each other in his Symbolism or Doctrinal Differences.10 He stresses
          the identity of the visible Church with Christ: "Thus, the visible
          Church, from the point of view here taken, is the Son of God,
          everlastingly manifesting himself among men in a human form,
          perpetually renovated, and eternally young â€” the permanent
          incarnation of the same, as in Holy Writ, even the faithful are called
          'the body of Christ.'"11
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE GREEK ORTHODOX CONCEPTION. The Greek Orthodox conception of the
          Church is closely related to that of the Roman Catholics, and yet
          differs from it in some important points. That Church does not
          recognize the Roman Catholic Church as the true Church, but claims
          that honor for itself. There is but one true Church, and that Church
          is the Greek Orthodox. While it acknowledges with greater frankness
          than the Roman Catholics the two different aspects of the Church, the
          visible and the invisible, it nevertheless places the emphasis on the
          Church as an external organization. It does not find the essence of
          the Church in her as the community of the saints, but in the Episcopal
          hierarchy, which it has retained, while rejecting the Papacy. The
          infallibility of the Church is maintained, but this infallibility
          resides in the bishops, and therefore in the ecclesiastical councils
          and synods. "As invisible," says Gavin, "she (the Church) is the
          bearer of divine gifts and powers, and is engaged in transforming
          mankind into the Kingdom of God. As visible, she is constituted of men
          professing a common faith, observing common customs, and using visible
          means of grace." At the same time the idea is rejected of "an
          invisible and ideal Church, of which the various bodies of Christians
          formed into distinct organizations and calling themselves 'Churches,'
          are partial and incomplete embodiments." The Church is "an actual,
          tangible, visible entity, not an unrealized and unrealizable ideal."12
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE PROTESTANT CONCEPTION. The Reformationwas a reaction against
          the externalism of Rome in general, and in particular, also against
          its external conception of the Church. It brought the truth to the
          foreground once more that the essence of the Church is not found in
          the external organization of the Church, but in the Church as the
          communio sanctorum. For both Luther and Calvin the Church was simply
          the community of the saints, that is, the community of those who
          believe and are sanctified in Christ, and who are joined to Him as
          their Head. This is also the position taken in the Reformed
          confessional standards. Thus the Belgic Confession says: "We believe
          and profess one catholic or universal Church, which is a holy
          congregation of true Christian believers, all expecting their
          salvation in Jesus Christ, being washed by His blood, sanctified and
          sealed by the Holy Spirit."13 The Second Helvetic Confession expresses
          the same truth by saying that the Church is "a company of the
          faithful, called and gathered out of the world; a communion of all
          saints, that is, of them who truly know and rightly worship and serve
          the true God, in Jesus Christ the Saviour, by the word of the Holy
          Spirit, and who by faith are partakers of all those good graces which
          are freely offered through Christ."14 And the Westminster Confession,
          defining the Church from the point of view of election, says: "The
          catholic or universal Church, which is invisible, consists of the
          whole number of the elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered
          into one, under Christ the head thereof; and is the spouse, the body,
          the fulness of Him that filleth all in all."15 The Church universal,
          that is, the Church as it exists in the plan of God, and as it is
          realized only in the course of the ages, was conceived as consisting
          of the whole body of the elect, who are in course of time called unto
          life eternal. But the Church as it actually exists on earth was
          regarded as the community of the saints. And it was not only the
          invisible Church that was so regarded, but the visible Church as well.
          These are not two Churches but one, and therefore have but a single
          essence. The one as well as the other is essentially the communio
          sanctorum, but the invisible Church is the Church as God sees it, a
          Church which contains only believers, while the visible Church is the
          Church as man sees it, consisting of those who profess Jesus Christ
          with their children and therefore adjudged to be the community of the
          saints. This may and always does contain some who are not yet
          regenerated â€” there may be chaff among the wheat â€”, but may not
          tolerate public unbelievers and wicked persons. Paul addresses his
          Epistles to empirical churches, and does not hesitate to address them
          as "saints," but also insists on the necessity of putting away the
          wicked and those who give offense from among them, 1Co_5:1-13;
          2Th_3:6; 2Th_3:14; Tit_3:10. The Church forms a spiritual unity of
          which Christ is the divine Head. It is animated by one Spirit, the
          Spirit of Christ; it professes one faith, shares one hope, and serves
          one King. It is the citadel of the truth and God's agency in
          communicating to believers all spiritual blessings. As the body of
          Christ it is destined to reflect the glory of God as manifested in the
          work of redemption. The Church in its ideal sense, the Church as God
          intends it to be and as it will once become, is an object of faith
          rather than of knowledge. Hence the confession: "I believe one holy
          catholic Church."
        </p>
        <p>B. THE MANY-SIDED CHARACTER OF THE CHURCH.</p>
        <p>
          In speaking of the Church several distinctions come into
          consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THAT OF A MILITANT AND A TRIUMPHANT CHURCH. The Church in the
          present dispensation is a militant Church, that is, she is called
          unto, and is actually engaged in, a holy warfare. This, of course,
          does not mean that she must spend her strength in self- destroying
          internecine struggles, but that she is duty bound to carry on an
          incessant warfare against the hostile world in every form in which it
          reveals itself, whether in the Church or outside of it, and against
          all the spiritual forces of darkness. The Church may not spend all her
          time in prayer and meditation, however necessary and important these
          may be, nor may she rest on her oars in the peaceful enjoyment of her
          spiritual heritage. She must be engaged with all her might in the
          battles of her Lord, fighting in a war that is both offensive and
          defensive. If the Church on earth is the militant Church, the Church
          in heaven is the triumphant Church. There the sword is exchanged for
          the palm of victory, the battle-cries are turned into songs of
          triumph, and the cross is replaced by the crown. The strife is over,
          the battle is won, and the saints reign with Christ forever and ever.
          In these two stages of her existence the Church reflects the
          humiliation and exaltation of her heavenly Lord. Roman Catholics
          speak, not only of a militant and triumphant, but also of a suffering
          Church. This Church, according to them, includes all those believers
          who are no more on earth, but have not yet entered the joys of heaven,
          and are now being purified in purgatory of their remaining sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THAT BETWEEN A VISIBLE AND AN INVISIBLE CHURCH. This means that the
          Church of God is on the one hand visible, and on the other invisible.
          It is said that Luther was the first to make this distinction, but the
          other Reformers recognized and also applied it to the Church. This
          distinction has not always been properly understood. The opponents of
          the Reformers often accused them of teaching that there are two
          separate Churches. Luther perhaps gave some occasion for this charge
          by speaking of an invisible ecclesiola within the visible ecclesia.
          But both he and Calvin stress the fact that, when they speak of a
          visible and an invisible Church, they do not refer to two different
          Churches, but to two aspects of the one Church of Jesus Christ. The
          term "invisible" has been variously interpreted as applying (a) to the
          triumphant Church; (b) to the ideal and completed Church as it will be
          at the end of the ages; (c) to the Church of all lands and all places,
          which man cannot possibly see; and (d) to the Church as it goes in
          hiding in the days of persecution, and is deprived of the Word and the
          sacraments. Now it is undoubtedly true that the triumphant Church is
          invisible to those who are on earth, and that Calvin in his Institutes
          also conceives of this as included in the invisible Church, but the
          distinction was undoubtedly primarily intended to apply to the
          militant Church. As a rule it is so applied in Reformed theology. It
          stresses the fact that the Church as it exists on earth is both
          visible and invisible. This Church is said to be invisible, because
          she is essentially spiritual and in her spiritual essence cannot be
          discerned by the physical eye; and because it is impossible to
          determine infallibly who do and who do not belong to her. The union of
          believers with Christ is a mystical union; the Spirit that unites them
          constitutes an invisible tie; and the blessings of salvation, such as
          regeneration, genuine conversion, true faith, and spiritual communion
          with Christ, are all invisible to the natural eye; â€” and yet these
          things constitute the real forma (ideal character) of the Church. That
          the term "invisible" should be understood in this sense, is evident
          from the historical origin of the distinction between the visible and
          the invisible Church in the days of the Reformation. The Bible
          ascribes certain glorious attributes to the Church and represents her
          as a medium of saving and eternal blessings. Rome applied this to the
          Church as an external institution, more particularly to the ecclesia
          representativa or the hierarchy as the distributor of the blessings of
          salvation, and thus ignored and virtually denied the immediate and
          direct communion of God with His children, by placing a human
          mediatorial priesthood between them. This is the error which the
          Reformers sought to eradicate by stressing the fact that the Church of
          which the Bible says such glorious things is not the Church as an
          external institution, but the Church as the spiritual body of Jesus
          Christ, which is essentially invisible at present, though it has a
          relative and imperfect embodiment in the visible Church and is
          destined to have a perfect visible embodiment at the end of the ages.
          The invisible Church naturally assumes a visible form. Just as the
          human soul is adapted to a body and expresses itself through the body,
          so the invisible Church, consisting, not of mere souls but of human
          beings having souls and bodies, necessarily assumes a visible form in
          an external organization through which it expresses itself. The Church
          becomes visible in Christian profession and conduct, in the ministry
          of the Word and of the sacraments, and in external organization and
          government. By making this distinction between the invisible and the
          visible Church, McPherson says, "Protestantism sought to find the
          proper mean between the magical and supernatural externalism of the
          Romish idea and the extravagant depreciation of all outward rites,
          characteristic of fanatical and sectarian spiritualism."16 It is very
          important to bear in mind that, though both the invisible and the
          visible Church can be considered as universal, the two are not in
          every respect commensurate. It is possible that some who belong to the
          invisible Church never become members of the visible organization, as
          missionary subjects who are converted on their deathbeds, and that
          others are temporarily excluded from it, as erring believers who are
          for a time shut out from the communion of the visible Church. On the
          other hand there may be unregenerated children and adults who, while
          professing Christ, have no true faith in Him, in the Church as an
          external institution; and these, as long as they are in that
          condition, do not belong to the invisible Church. Good definitions of
          the visible and invisible Church may be found in the Westminster
          Confession.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THAT BETWEEN THE CHURCH AS AN ORGANISM AND THE CHURCH AS AN
          INSTITUTION. This distinction should not be identified with the
          preceding one, as is sometimes done. It is a distinction that applies
          to the visible Church and that directs attention to two different
          aspects of the Church considered as a visible body.17 It is a mistake
          to think that the Church becomes visible only in the offices, in the
          administration of the Word and the sacraments, and in a certain form
          of Church government. Even if all these things were absent, the Church
          would still be visible in the communal life and profession of the
          believers, and in their joint opposition to the world. But while
          emphasizing the fact that the distinction under consideration is a
          distinction within the visible Church, we should not forget that both
          the Church as an organism and the Church as an institution (also
          called apparitio and institutio) have their spiritual background in
          the invisible Church. However, though it is true that these are two
          different aspects of the one visible Church, they do represent
          important differences. The Church as an organism is the coetus
          fidelium the communion of believers, who are united in the bond of the
          Spirit, while the Church as an institution is the mater fidelium, the
          mother of believers, a Heilsanstalt a means of salvation, an agency
          for the conversion of sinners and the perfecting of the saints. The
          Church as an organism exists charismatic: in it all kinds of gifts and
          talents become manifest and are utilized in the work of the Lord. The
          Church as an institution, on the other hand, exists in an
          institutional form and functions through the offices and means which
          God has instituted. The two are co-ordinate in a sense, and yet there
          is also a certain subordination of the one to the other. The Church as
          an institution or organization (mater fidelium) is a means to an end,
          and this is found in the Church as an organism, the community of
          believers ( coetus fidelium ).
        </p>
        <p>C. VARIOUS DEFINITIONS OF THE CHURCH.</p>
        <p>
          The Church being a many-sided entity has naturally also been defined
          from more than one point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ELECTION. According to some theologians
          the Church is the community of the elect, the coetus electorum. This
          definition is apt to be somewhat misleading, however. It applies only
          to the Church ideally considered, the Church as it exists in the idea
          of God and as it will be completed at the end of the ages, and not to
          the Church as a present empirical reality. Election includes all those
          who belong to the body of Christ, irrespective of their present actual
          relation to it. But the elect who are yet unborn, or who are still
          strangers to Christ and outside of the pale of the Church, cannot be
          said to belong to the Church realiter.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF EFFECTUAL CALLING. To escape the
          objection raised to the preceding definition, it gradually became
          customary to define the Church from the point of view of some
          subjective spiritual characteristic of those who belong to it,
          especially effectual calling or faith, either by naming such a
          characteristic in addition to election, or by substituting it for
          election. Thus the Church was defined as the company of the elect who
          are called by the Spirit of God (coetus electorum vocatorum ), as the
          body of those who are effectually called (coetus vocatorum), or, even
          more commonly, as the community of the faithful or believers (coetus
          fidelium ). The first two of these definitions serve the purpose of
          designating the Church as to its invisible essence, but give no
          indication whatsoever of the fact that it also has a visible side.
          This is done, however, in the last named definition, for faith reveals
          itself in confession and conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF BAPTISM AND PROFESSION. From the point of
          view of baptism and profession the Church has been defined as the
          community of those who are baptized and profess the true faith; or as
          the community of those who profess the true religion together with
          their children. It will readily be seen that this is a definition of
          the Church according to its external manifestation. Calvin defines the
          visible Church as "the multitude of men diffused through the world,
          who profess to worship one God in Christ; are initiated into this
          faith by baptism; testify their unity in doctrine and charity by
          participating in the Supper; have consent in the Word of God, and for
          the preaching of that Word maintain the ministry ordained of
          Christ."18
        </p>
        <p>D. THE CHURCH AND THE KINGDOM OF GOD.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE IDEA OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD. The Kingdom of God is primarily an
          eschatological concept. The fundamental idea of the Kingdom in
          Scripture is not that of a restored theocratic kingdom of God in
          Christ â€” which is essentially a kingdom of Israelâ€”, as the
          Premillenarians claim; neither is it a new social condition, pervaded
          by the Spirit of Christ, and realized by man through such external
          means as good laws, civilization, education, social reforms, and so
          on, as the Modernists would have us believe. The primary idea of the
          Kingdom of God in Scripture is that of the rule of God established and
          acknowledged in the hearts of sinners by the powerful regenerating
          influence of the Holy Spirit, insuring them of the inestimable
          blessings of salvation, â€” a rule that is realized in principle on
          earth, but will not reach its culmination until the visible and
          glorious return of Jesus Christ. The present realization of it is
          spiritual and invisible. Jesus took hold of this eschatological
          concept and made it prominent in His teachings. He clearly taught the
          present spiritual realization and the universal character of the
          Kingdom. Moreover, He Himself effected that realization in a measure
          formerly unknown and greatly increased the present blessings of the
          Kingdom. At the same time He held out the blessed hope of the future
          appearance of that Kingdom in external glory and with the perfect
          blessings of salvation.

          2. HISTORICAL CONCEPTIONS OF THE KINGDOM. In the early Church Fathers
          the Kingdom of God, the greatest good, is primarily regarded as a
          future entity, the goal of the present development of the Church. Some
          of them regarded it as the coming millennial rule of the Messiah,
          though history does not bear out the exaggerated claims of some
          Premillenarian writers as to their number. Augustine viewed the
          kingdom as a present reality and identified it with the Church. For
          him it was primarily identical with the pious and holy, that is, with
          the Church as a community of believers; but he used some expressions
          which seem to indicate that he also saw it embodied in the episcopally
          organized Church. The Roman Catholic Church frankly identified the
          Kingdom of God with their hierarchical institution, but the Reformers
          returned to the view that it is in this dispensation identical with
          the invisible Church. Under the influence of Kant and especially of
          Ritschl it was robbed of its religious character and came to be
          regarded as an ethical kingdom of ends. It is often defined at present
          as a new principle introduced into society and destined to transform
          it in all its relations, or as the moral organization of mankind
          through action from the motive of love, the final end of creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND THE INVISIBLE CHURCH. While the Kingdom of
          God and the invisible Church are in a measure identical, they should
          nevertheless be carefully distinguished. Citizenship in the one and
          membership in the other are equally determined by regeneration. It is
          impossible to be in the Kingdom of God without being in the Church as
          the mystical body of Jesus Christ. At the same time it is possible to
          make a distinction between the point of view from which believers are
          called the Kingdom and that from which they are called the Church.
          They constitute a Kingdom in their relation to God in Christ as their
          Ruler, and a Church in their separateness from the world in devotion
          to God, and in their organic union with one another. As a Church they
          are called to be God's instrument in preparing the way for, and in
          introducing, the ideal order of things; and as a Kingdom they
          represent the initial realization of the ideal order among themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND THE VISIBLE CHURCH. Since the Roman
          Catholics insist indiscriminately on the identification of the Kingdom
          of God and the Church, their Church claims power and jurisdiction over
          every domain of life, such as science and art, commerce and industry,
          as well as social and political organizations. This is an altogether
          mistaken conception. It is also a mistake to maintain, as some
          Reformed Christians do, in virtue of an erroneous conception of the
          Church as an organism, that Christian school societies, voluntary
          organizations of younger or older people for the study of Christian
          principles and their application in life, Christian labor unions, and
          Christian political organizations, are manifestations of the Church as
          an organism, for this again brings them under the domain of the
          visible Church and under the direct control of its officers.
          Naturally, this does not mean that the Church has no responsibility
          with respect to such organizations. It does mean, however, that they
          are manifestations of the Kingdom of God, in which groups of
          Christians seek to apply the principles of the Kingdom to every domain
          of life. The visible Church and the Kingdom, too, may be identified to
          a certain extent. The visible Church may certainly be said to belong
          to the Kingdom, to be a part of the Kingdom, and even to be the most
          important visible embodiment of the forces of the Kingdom. It partakes
          of the character of the invisible Church (the two being one) as a
          means for the realization of the Kingdom of God. Like the visible
          Church, the Kingdom also shares in the imperfections to which a sinful
          world exposes it. This is quite evident from the parable of the wheat
          and the tares, and that of the fishnet. In so far as the visible
          Church is instrumental in the establishment and extension of the
          Kingdom, it is, of course, subordinate to this as a means to an end.
          The Kingdom may be said to be a broader concept than the Church,
          because it aims at nothing less than the complete control of all the
          manifestations of life. It represents the dominion of God in every
          sphere of human endeavor.
        </p>
        <p>E. THE CHURCH IN THE DIFFERENT DISPENSATIONS.</p>
        <p>
          1. IN THE PATRIARCHAL PERIOD. In the patriarchial period the families
          of believers constituted the religious congregations; the Church was
          best represented in the pious households, where the fathers served as
          priests. There was no regular cultus, though Gen_4:26 seems to imply a
          public calling upon the name of the Lord. There was a distinction
          between the children of God and the children of men, the latter
          gradually gaining the upper hand. At the time of the flood the Church
          was saved in the family of Noah, and continued particularly in the
          line of Shem. And when true religion was again on the point of dying
          out, God made a covenant with Abraham, gave unto him the sign of
          circumcision, and separated him and his descendants from the world, to
          be His own peculiar people. Up to the time of Moses the families of
          the patriarchs were the real repositories of the true faith, in which
          the fear of Jehovah and the service of the Lord was kept alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. IN THE MOSAIC PERIOD. After the exodus the people of Israel were
          not only organized into a nation, but were also constituted the Church
          of God. They were enriched with institutions in which not only family
          devotion or tribal faith but the religion of the nation could find
          expression. The Church did not yet obtain an independent organization,
          but had its institutional existence in the national life of Israel.
          The particular form which it assumed was that of a Church-State. We
          cannot say that the two coalesced altogether. There were separate
          civil and religious functionaries and institutions within the bounds
          of the nation. But at the same time the whole nation constituted the
          Church; and the Church was limited to the one nation of Israel, though
          foreigners could enter it by being incorporated into the nation. In
          this period there was a marked development of doctrine, an increase in
          the quantity of the religious truth known, and greater clearness in
          the apprehension of the truth. The worship of God was regulated down
          to the minutest details, was largely ritual and ceremonial, and was
          centered in one central sanctuary.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. The New Testament Church is essentially one
          with the Church of the old dispensation. As far as their essential
          nature is concerned, they both consist of true believers, and of true
          believers only. And in their external organization both represent a
          mixture of good and evil. Yet several important changes resulted from
          the accomplished work of Jesus Christ. The Church was divorced from
          the national life of Israel and obtained an independent organization.
          In connection with this the national boundaries of the Church were
          swept away. What had up to this time been a national Church now
          assumed a universal character. And in order to realize the ideal of
          world- wide extension, it had to become a missionary Church, carrying
          the gospel of salvation to all the nations of the world. Moreover, the
          ritual worship of the past made place for a more spiritual worship in
          harmony with the greater privileges of the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          The representation given in the preceding proceeds on the assumption
          that the Church existed in the old dispensation as well as in the new,
          and was essentially the same in both, in spite of acknowledged
          institutional and administrative differences. This is in harmony with
          the teachings of our confessional standards. The Belgic Confession
          says in Art. XXVII: "This Church has been from the beginning of the
          world, and will be to the end thereof; which is evident from the fact
          that Christ is an eternal King, which without subjects He cannot be."
          In full agreement with this the Heidelberg Catechism says in Lord's
          Day XXI: "That the Son of God, out of the whole human race, from the
          beginning to the end of the world, gathers, defends, and preserves for
          Himself, by His Spirit and Word, in the unity of the true faith, a
          Church chosen to everlasting life." The Church is essentially, as was
          pointed out in the preceding, the community of believers, and this
          community existed from the beginning of the old dispensation right
          down to the present time and will continue to exist on earth until the
          end of the world. On this point we cannot agree with those
          Premillenarians who, under the influence of a divisive
          dispensationalism, claim that the Church is exclusively a New
          Testament institution, which did not come into existence until the
          outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost and will be
          removed from the earth before the beginning of the millennium. They
          like to define the Church as "the body of Christ," which is a
          characteristically New Testament name, and seem to forget that it is
          also called "the temple of God" and "Jerusalem," which are very
          decidedly names with an Old Testament flavor, cf. 1Co_3:16-17;
          2Co_6:16; Eph_2:21; Gal_4:26; Heb_12:22. We should not close our eyes
          to the patent fact that the name "Church" (Heb.qahal rendered ekklesia
          in the Septuagint) is applied to Israel in the Old Testament
          repeatedly, Jos_8:35; Ezr_2:65; Joe_2:16. The fact that in our
          translations of the Bible the Old Testament rendering of the original
          is "gathering," "assembly," or "congregation," while the New Testament
          rendering of it is "Church," may have given rise to misunderstanding
          on this point; but the fact remains that in the Old Testament as well
          as in the New the original word denotes a congregation or an assembly
          of the people of God, and as such serves to designate the essence of
          the Church. Jesus on the one hand said that He would found the Church
          in the future, Mat_16:18, but also recognized it as an already
          existing institution, Mat_18:17. Stephen speaks of "the Church in the
          wilderness," Act_7:38. And Paul clearly testifies to the spiritual
          unity of Israel and the Church in Rom_11:17-21, and in Eph_2:11-16. In
          essence Israel constituted the Church of God in the Old Testament,
          though its external institution differed vastly from that of the
          Church in the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>F. THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE CHURCH.</p>
        <p>
          According to Protestants the attributes of the Church are ascribed
          primarily to the Church as an invisible organism, and only secondarily
          to the Church as an external institution. Roman Catholics, however,
          ascribe them to their hierarchical organization. The former speak of
          three attributes, but to these three the latter add a fourth.
        </p>
        <p>1. THE UNITY OF THE CHURCH.</p>
        <p>
          a. The Roman Catholic conception. Roman Catholics ordinarily recognize
          only the hierarchically organized ecclesia as the Church. The unity of
          this Church manifests itself in its imposing world-wide organization,
          which aims at including the Church of all nations. Its real center is
          not found in the believers, but in the hierarchy with its concentric
          circles. There is first of all the broad circle of the lower clergy,
          the priests and other inferior functionaries; then the smaller circle
          of the bishops; next the still narrower one of the archbishops; and,
          finally, the most restricted circle of the cardinals; â€” the entire
          pyramid being capped by the Pope, the visible head of the whole
          organization, who has absolute control of all those that are under
          him. Thus the Roman Catholic Church presents to the eye a very
          imposing structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The Protestant conception. Protestants assert that the unity of the
          Church is not primarily of an external, but of an internal and
          spiritual character. It is the unity of the mystical body of Jesus
          Christ, of which all believers are members. This body is controlled by
          one Head, Jesus Christ, who is also the King of the Church, and is
          animated by one Spirit, the Spirit of Christ. This unity implies that
          all those who belong to the Church share in the same faith, are
          cemented together by the common bond of love, and have the same
          glorious outlook upon the future. This inner unity seeks and also
          acquires, relatively speaking, outward expression in the profession
          and Christian conduct of believers, in their public worship of the
          same God in Christ, and in their participation in the same sacraments.
          There can be no doubt about the fact that the Bible asserts the unity,
          not only of the invisible, but also of the visible Church. The figure
          of the body, as it is found in 1Co_12:12-31, implies this unity.
          Moreover, in Eph_4:4-16, where Paul stresses the unity of the Church,
          he evidently also has the visible Church in mind, for he speaks of the
          appointment of office-bearers in the Church and of their labors in
          behalf of the ideal unity of the Church. Because of the unity of the
          Church one local church was admonished to supply the needs of another,
          and the council of Jerusalem undertook to settle a question that arose
          in Antioch. The Church of Rome strongly emphasized the unity of the
          visible Church and expressed it in its hierarchical organization. And
          when the Reformers broke with Rome, they did not deny the unity of the
          visible Church but maintained it. However, they did not find the bond
          of union in the ecclesiastical organization of the Church, but in the
          true preaching of the Word and the right administration of the
          sacraments. This is also the case in the Belgic Confession.19 We quote
          only the following statements from it: "We believe and profess one
          catholic or universal Church, which is a holy congregation of true
          believers, all expecting their salvation in Jesus Christ, being washed
          by His blood, sanctified and sealed by the Holy Spirit."20 The marks
          by which the true Church is known are these: "If the pure doctrine of
          the Gospel is preached therein; if it maintains the pure
          administration of the sacraments as instituted by Christ; if Church
          discipline is exercised in punishing sin; in short, if all things are
          managed according to the pure Word of God; all things contrary thereto
          rejected, and Jesus Christ acknowledged as the only Head of the
          Church. Hereby the true Church may certainly be known, from which no
          man has a right to separate himself."21 The unity of the visible
          Church was also taught by Reformed theologians of the post-Reformation
          period, and was always very strongly emphasized in Scottish theology.
          Walker even says: "True Churches of Christ, side by side with one
          another, forming separate organizations, with separate governments,
          seemed to them (Scottish theologians) utterly inadmissible, unless it
          might be in a very limited way, and for some reason of temporary
          expediency."22 In the Netherlands this doctrine was eclipsed in recent
          years in the measure in which the multi- or pluriformity of the
          Churches was emphasized in deference to the facts of history and the
          existing condition. At present it is again stressed in some of the
          current discussions. In view of the present divisions of the Church,
          it is quite natural that the question should arise, whether these do
          not militate against the doctrine of the unity of the visible Church.
          In answer to this it may be said that some divisions, such as those
          caused by differences of locality or of language, are perfectly
          compatible with the unity of the Church; but that others, such as
          those which originate in doctrinal perversions or sacramental abuses,
          do really impair that unity. The former result from the providential
          guidance of God, but the latter are due to the influence of sin: to
          the darkening of the understanding, the power of error, or the
          stubbornness of man; and therefore the Church will have to strive for
          the ideal of overcoming these. The question may still arise, whether
          the one invisible Church ought not to find expression in a single
          organization. It can hardly be said that the Word of God explicitly
          requires this, and history has shown this to be infeasible and also of
          questionable worth. The only attempt that was made so far to unite the
          whole Church in one great external organization, did not prove
          productive of good results, but led to externalism, ritualism, and
          legalism. Moreover, the multiformity of Churches, so characteristic of
          Protestantism, in so far as it resulted from the providential guidance
          of God and in a legitimate way, arose in the most natural manner, and
          is quite in harmony with the law of differentiation, according to
          which an organism in its development evolves from the homogeneous to
          the heterogeneous. It is quite possible that the inherent riches of
          the organism of the Church find better and fuller expression in the
          present variety of Churches than they would in a single external
          organization. This does not mean, of course, that the Church should
          not strive for a greater measure of external unity. The ideal should
          always be to give the most adequate expression to the unity of the
          Church. At the present time there is a rather strong Church union
          movement, but this movement, as it has developed up to this time,
          though undoubtedly springing from laudable motives on the part of
          some, is still of rather doubtful value. Whatever external union is
          effected must be the natural expression of an existing inner unity,
          but the present movement partly seeks to fabricate an external union
          where no inner unity is found, forgetting that "no artificial
          aggregation that seeks to unify natural disparities can afford a
          guarantee against the strife of parties within the aggregation." It is
          un-Scriptural in so far as it has been seeking unity at the expense of
          the truth and has been riding the wave of subjectivism in religion.
          Unless it changes colour and strives for greater unity in the truth,
          it will not be productive of real unity but only of uniformity, and
          while it may make the Church more efficient from a business point of
          view, it will not add to the true spiritual efficiency of the Church.
          Barth sounds the right note when he says: "The quest for the unity of
          the Church must in fact be identical with the quest for Jesus Christ
          as the concrete Head and Lord of the Church. The blessing of unity
          cannot be separated from Him who blesses, in Him it has its source and
          reality, through His Word and Spirit it is revealed to us, and only in
          faith can it become a reality among us."23
        </p>
        <p>2. THE HOLINESS OF THE CHURCH.</p>
        <p>
          a. The Roman Catholic conception. The Roman Catholic conception of the
          holiness of the Church is also primarily of an external character. It
          is not the inner holiness of the members of the Church through the
          sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, but the outer ceremonial holiness
          that is placed in the foreground. According to Father Devine the
          Church is holy first of all "in her dogmas, in her moral precepts, in
          her worship, in her discipline," in which "all is pure and
          irreproachable, all is of such a nature as is calculated to remove
          evil and wickedness, and to promote the most exalted virtue."24 Only
          secondarily is the holiness of the Church conceived of as moral.
          Father Deharbe says that the Church is also holy, "because there were
          in her at all times saints whose holiness God has also confirmed by
          miracles and extraordinary graces."25
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Protestant conception. Protestants, however, have quite a different
          conception of the holiness of the Church. They maintain that the
          Church is absolutely holy in an objective sense, that is, as she is
          considered in Jesus Christ. In virtue of the mediatorial righteousness
          of Christ, the Church is accounted holy before God. In a relative
          sense they also regard the Church as being subjectively holy, that is,
          as actually holy in the inner principle of her life and destined for
          perfect holiness. Hence she can truly be called a community of saints.
          This holiness is first of all a holiness of the inner man, but a
          holiness which also finds expression in the outer life. Consequently,
          holiness is also attributed, secondarily, to the visible Church. That
          Church is holy in the sense that it is separated from the world in
          consecration to God, and also in the ethical sense of aiming at, and
          achieving in principle, a holy conversation in Christ. Since visible
          local churches consist of believers and their seed, they are supposed
          to exclude all open unbelievers and wicked persons. Paul does not
          hesitate to address them as churches of the saints.
        </p>
        <p>3. THE CATHOLICITY OF THE CHURCH.</p>
        <p>
          a. Roman Catholic conception. The attribute of catholicity is
          appropriated by the Roman Catholic Church, as if it only has the right
          to be called catholic. Like the other attributes of the Church, it is
          applied by her to the visible organization. She claims the right to be
          considered as the one really catholic Church, because she is spread
          over the whole earth and adapts herself to all countries and to all
          forms of government; because she has existed from the beginning and
          has always had subjects and faithful children, while sects come and
          go; because she is in possession of the fulness of truth and grace,
          destined to be distributed among men; and because she surpasses in
          number of members all dissenting sects taken together.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Protestant conception. Protestants, again, apply this attribute
          primarily to the invisible Church, which can be called catholic in a
          far truer sense than any one of the existing organizations, not even
          the Church of Rome excepted. They justly resent the arrogance of the
          Roman Catholics in appropriating this attribute for their hierarchical
          organization, to the exclusion of all other Churches. Protestants
          insist that the invisible Church is primarily the real catholic
          Church, because she includes all believers on earth at any particular
          time, no one excepted; because, consequently, she also has her members
          among all the nations of the world that were evangelized; and because
          she exercises a controlling influence on the entire life of man in all
          its phases. Secondarily, they also ascribe the attribute of
          catholicity to the visible Church. In our discussion of the unity of
          the visible Church, it already became apparent that the Reformers and
          the Reformed Confessions expressed their belief in a catholic visible
          Church, and this opinion has been reiterated by Dutch, Scottish, and
          American Reformed theologians right up to the present time, though in
          recent years some in the Netherlands expressed doubt about this
          doctrine. It must be admitted that this doctrine presents many
          difficult problems, which still call for solution. It is not easy to
          point out with precision just where this one catholic visible Church
          is. Furthermore, such questions as these arise: (1) Does this doctrine
          carry with it a wholesale condemnation of denominationalism, as Dr.
          Henry Van Dyke seems to think? (2) Does it mean that some one
          denomination is the true Church, while all others are false or is it
          better to distinguish between Churches of more or less pure formation?
          (3) At what point does a local church or a denomination cease to be an
          integral part of the one visible Church? (4) Is a single external
          institution or organization essential to the unity of the visible
          Church, or not? These are some of the problems that still call for
          further study.

        <p>G. THE MARKS OF THE CHURCH.</p>
        <p>1. THE MARKS OF THE CHURCH IN GENERAL.</p>
        <p>
          a. The need of such marks. Little need was felt for such marks as long
          as the Church was clearly one. But when heresies arose, it became
          necessary to point to certain marks by which the true Church could be
          recognized. The consciousness of this need was already present in the
          early Church, was naturally less apparent in the Middle Ages, but
          became very strong at the time of the Reformation. At that time the
          one existing Church was not only divided into two great sections, but
          Protestantism itself was divided into several Churches and sects. As a
          result it was felt ever increasingly that it was necessary to point
          out some marks by which the true Church could be distinguished from
          the false. The very fact of the Reformation proves that the Reformers,
          without denying that God maintains His Church, were yet deeply
          conscious of the fact that an empirical embodiment of the Church may
          become subject to error, may depart from the truth, and may totally
          degenerate. They assumed the existence of a standard of truth to which
          the Church must correspond, and recognized as such the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The marks of the Church in Reformed theology. Reformed theologians
          differed as to the number of the marks of the Church. Some spoke of
          but one, the preaching of the pure doctrine of the Gospel (Beza,
          Alsted, Amesius, Heidanus, Maresius); others, of two, the pure
          preaching of the word and the right administration of the sacraments
          (Calvin, Bullinger, Zanchius, Junius, Gomarus, Mastricht, Ã  Marck)
          and still others added to these a third, the faithful exercise of
          discipline (Hyperius, Martyr, Ursinus, Trelcatius, Heidegger,
          Wendelinus). These three are also named in our Confession;26 but after
          making mention of them, the Confession combines them all into one by
          saying: "in short, if all things are managed according to the pure
          Word of God." In course of time a distinction was made, especially in
          Scotland, between those features which are absolutely necessary to the
          being of a Church, and those which are only necessary to its
          well-being. Some began to feel that, however necessary discipline
          might be to the health of the Church, it would be wrong to say that a
          church without discipline was no Church at all. Some even felt the
          same way about the right administration of the sacraments, since they
          did not feel free to unchurch either the Baptists or the Quakers. The
          effect of this is seen in the Westminster Confession, which mentions
          as the only thing that is indispensable to the being of the Church
          "the profession of the true religion," and speaks of other things,
          such as purity of doctrine or worship, and of discipline as excellent
          qualities of particular churches, by which the degree of their purity
          may be measured.27 Dr. Kuyper recognizes only the praedicatio verbi
          and the administratio sacramenti as real marks of the Church, since
          they only: (1) are specific, that is, are characteristics of the
          Church and of no other body; (2) are instruments through which Christ
          works with His grace and Spirit in the Church; and (3) are formative
          elements that go into the constitution of the Church. Discipline is
          also found elsewhere and cannot be co-ordinated with these two.
          Bearing this in mind, he has no objection, however, to regard the
          faithful exercise of discipline as one of the marks of the Church. Now
          it is undoubtedly true that the three marks usually named are not
          really co- ordinate. Strictly speaking, it may be said that the true
          preaching of the Word and its recognition as the standard of doctrine
          and life, is the one mark of the Church. Without it there is no
          Church, and it determines the right administration of the sacraments
          and the faithful exercise of Church discipline. Nevertheless, the
          right administration of the sacraments is also a real mark of the
          Church. And though the exercise of discipline may not be peculiar to
          the Church, that is, is not found in it exclusively, yet it is
          absolutely essential to the purity of the Church.
        </p>
        <p>2. THE MARKS OF THE CHURCH IN PARTICULAR.</p>
        <p>
          a. The true preaching of the Word. This is the most important mark of
          the Church. While it is independent of the sacraments, these are not
          independent of it. The true preaching of the Word is the great means
          for maintaining the Church and for enabling her to be the mother of
          the faithful. That this is one of the characteristics of the true
          Church, is evident from such passages as Joh_8:31-32; Joh_8:47;
          Joh_14:23; 1Jn_4:1-3; 2Jn_1:9. Ascribing this mark to the Church does
          not mean that the preaching of the Word in a Church must be perfect
          before it can be regarded as a true Church. Such an ideal is
          unattainable on earth; only relative purity of doctrine can be
          ascribed to any Church. A church may be comparatively impure in its
          presentation of the truth without ceasing to be a true church. But
          there is a limit beyond which a Church cannot go in the
          misrepresentation or denial of the truth, without losing her true
          character and becoming a false Church. This is what happens when
          fundamental articles of faith are publicly denied, and doctrine and
          life are no more under the control of the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The right administration of the sacraments. The sacraments should
          never be divorced from the Word, for they have no content of their
          own, but derive their content from the Word of God; they are in fact a
          visible preaching of the Word. As such they must also be administered
          by lawful ministers of the Word, in accordance with the divine
          institution, and only to properly qualified subjects, the believers
          and their seed. A denial of the central truths of the gospel will
          naturally affect the proper administration of the sacraments; and the
          Church of Rome certainly departs from the right mode, when it divorces
          the sacraments from the Word, ascribing to them a sort of magical
          efficacy; and when it allows midwives to administer baptism in time of
          need. That the right administration of the sacraments is a
          characteristic of the true Church, follows from its inseparable
          connection with the preaching of the Word and from such passages as
          Mat_28:19; Mat_16:15-16; Act_2:42; 1Co_11:23-30.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The faithful exercise of discipline. This is quite essential for
          maintaining the purity of doctrine and for guarding the holiness of
          the sacraments. Churches that are lax in discipline are bound to
          discover sooner or later within their circle an eclipse of the light
          of the truth and an abuse of that which is holy. Hence a Church that
          would remain true to her ideal in the measure in which this is
          possible on earth, must be diligent and conscientious in the exercise
          of Christian discipline. The Word of God insists on proper discipline
          in the Church of Christ, Mat_18:18; 1Co_5:1-5; 1Co_5:13; 1Co_14:33;
          1Co_14:40; Rev_2:14-15; Rev_2:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: What is the meaning of the word ekklesia
          in Mat_16:18; Mat_18:17? When and how did the term kuriake come into
          use for the Church? How do the Dutch words 'kerk' and 'gemeente'
          differ, and how are they related to the Greek term? Are there passages
          in Scripture in which the word ekklesia is undoubtedly used to denote
          as a unity the whole body of those throughout the world who outwardly
          profess Christ? Is the word ever used as the designation of a group of
          churches under a common government, such as we call a denomination?
          Does the visibility of the Church consist merely in the visibility of
          its members? If not, in what does it become visible? Does the visible
          Church stand in any other than a mere outward relation to Christ, and
          does it enjoy any other than mere outward promises and privileges?
          Does the essence of the visible Church differ from that of the
          invisible Church? What objections have been raised to the distinction
          between the Church as an institution and the Church as an organism?
          What is the fundamental difference between the Roman Catholic and the
          Reformed conception of the Church?
