        <p>III. The Unipersonality of Christ</p>
        <p>
          In the year 451 A.D. the Council of Chalcedon met and formulated the
          faith of the Church respecting the person of Christ, and declared Him
          "to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably,
          indivisibly, inseperably; the distinction of the natures being in no
          wise taken away by the union, but rather the property of each nature
          being preserved, and concurring in one Person and one Subsistence, not
          parted or divided into two persons." This formulation is mainly
          negative, and simply seeks to guard the truth against various
          heretical views. It clearly states the faith of the early Church
          respecting the person of Christ, but makes no attempt to explain the
          mystery involved, a mystery that is not susceptible of a natural
          explanation. The great central miracle of history was permitted to
          stand forth in all its grandeur, the supreme paradox, to use Barthian
          language, God and man in one person. We are simply told what Jesus is,
          without any attempt to show how He became what He is. The great truth
          enunciated is that the eternal Son of God took upon Himself our
          humanity, and not, as Brunner reminds us, that the man Jesus acquired
          divinity. The deliverance of the Council of Chalcedon testifies to a
          movement from God to man, rather than vice versa. Centuries have gone
          by since that time, but, barring certain explications, the Church has
          really never gotten beyond the formula of Chalcedon. It has always
          recognized the incarnation as a mystery which defies explanation. And
          so it will remain, because it is the miracle of miracles. Several
          attempts have been made in course of time to give a psychological
          explanation of the person of Jesus Christ, but they were all bound to
          fail, because He is the Son of God, Himself very God, and a
          psychological explanation of God is out of the question. The following
          paragraphs are intended as a brief statement of the doctrine of the
          Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. STATEMENT OF THE CHURCH'S VIEW RESPECTING THE PERSON OF CHRIST.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. DEFINITION OF THE TERMS "NATURE" AND "PERSON." With a view to the
          proper understanding of the doctrine, it is necessary to know the
          exact meaning of the terms "nature" and "person," as used in this
          connection. The term "nature" denotes the sum- total of all the
          essential qualities of a thing, that which makes it what it is. A
          nature is a substance possessed in common, with all the essential
          qualities of such a substance. The term "person" denotes a complete
          substance endowed with reason, and, consequently, a responsible
          subject of its own actions. Personality is not an essential and
          integral part of a nature, but is, as it were, the terminus to which
          it tends. A person is a nature with something added, namely,
          independent subsistence, individuality. Now the Logos assumed a human
          nature that was not personalized, that did not exist by itself.
        </p>
        <p>2. PROPOSITIONS IN WHICH THE VIEW OF THE CHURCH MAY BE STATED.</p>
        <p>
          a. There is but one person in the Mediator, the unchangeable Logos.
          The Logos furnishes the basis for the personality of Christ. It would
          not be correct, however, to say that the person of the mediator is
          divine only. The incarnation constituted Him a complex person,
          constituted of two natures. He is the Godman.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The human nature of Christ as such does not constitute a human
          person. The Logos did not adopt a human person, so that we have two
          persons in the Mediator, but simply assumed a human nature. Brunner
          declares that it is the mystery of the person of Jesus Christ that at
          the point where we have a sinful person, He has, or rather is, the
          divine person of the Logos.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. At the same time it is not correct to speak of the human nature of
          Christ as impersonal. This is true only in the sense that this nature
          has no independent subsistence of its own. Strictly speaking, however,
          the human nature of Christ was not for a moment impersonal. The Logos
          assumed that nature into personal subsistence with Himself. The human
          nature has its personal existence in the person of the Logos. It is
          in-personal rather than impersonal.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. For that very reason we are not warranted to speak of the human
          nature of Christ as imperfect or incomplete. His human nature is not
          lacking in any of the essential qualities belonging to that nature,
          and also has individuality, that is, personal subsistence, in the
          person of the Son of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. This personal subsistence should not be confused with consciousness
          and free will. The fact that the human nature of Christ, in and by
          itself, has no personal subsistence, does not mean that it has no
          consciousness and will. The Church has taken the position that these
          belong to the nature rather than to the person.
        </p>
        <p>
          f. The one divine person, who possessed a divine nature from eternity,
          assumed a human nature, and now has both. This must be maintained over
          against those who, while admitting that the divine person assumed a
          human nature, jeopardize the integrity of the two natures by
          conceiving of them as having been fused or mixed into a tertium quid,
          a sort of divine-human nature.
        </p>
        <p>B. SCRIPTURAL PROOF FOR THE UNIPERSONALITY OF CHRIST.</p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of the two natures in one person transcends human reason.
          It is the expression of a supersensible reality, and of an
          incomprehensible mystery, which has no analogy in the life of man as
          we know it, and finds no support in human reason, and therefore can
          only be accepted by faith on the authority of the Word of God. For
          that reason it is doubly necessary to pay close attention to the
          teachings of Scripture on this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. NO EVIDENCE OF A DUAL PERSONALITY IN SCRIPTURE. In the first place
          there is a negative consideration of considerable importance. If there
          had been a dual personality in Jesus, we would naturally expect to
          find some traces of it in Scripture; but there is not a single trace
          of it. There is no distinction of an "I" and a "Thou" in the inner
          life of the Mediator, such as we find in connection with the triune
          Being of God, where one person addresses the other, Psa_2:7;
          Psa_40:7-8; Joh_17:1; Joh_17:4-5; Joh_17:21-24. Moreover, Jesus never
          uses the plural in referring to Himself, as God does in Gen_1:26;
          Gen_3:22; Gen_11:7. It might seem as if Joh_3:11 were a case in point.
          The plural is peculiar, but in all probability refers to Jesus and
          those who were associated with Him, in opposition to Nicodemus and the
          group which he represented.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. BOTH NATURES ARE REPRESENTED IN SCRIPTURE AS UNITED IN ONE PERSON.
          There are passages of Scripture which refer to both natures in Christ,
          but in which it is perfectly evident that only one person is intended,
          Rom_1:3-4; Gal_4:4-5; Php_2:6-11. In several passages both natures are
          set forth as united. The Bible nowhere teaches that divinity in the
          abstract, or some divine power, was united to, or manifested in, a
          human nature; but always that the divine nature in the concrete, that
          is, the divine person of the Son of God, was united to a human nature,
          Joh_1:14; Rom_8:3; Gal_4:4; Gal_4:9; 1Ti_3:16; Heb_2:11-14; 1Jn_4:2-3.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE ONE PERSON IS SPOKEN OF IN TERMS TRUE OF EITHER ONE OF THE
          NATURES. Repeatedly the attributes of one nature are predicated of the
          person, while that person is designated by a title derived from the
          other nature. On the one hand human attributes and actions are
          predicated of the person while he is designated by a divine title,
          Act_20:28; 1Co_2:8; Col_1:13-14. And on the other hand divine
          attributes and actions are predicated of the person while he is
          designated by a human title, Joh_3:3; Joh_6:62; Rom_9:5.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE EFFECTS OF THE UNION OF THE TWO NATURES IN ONE PERSON.</p>
        <p>
          1. NO ESSENTIAL CHANGE IN THE DIVINE NATURE. The doctrine of creation
          and the doctrine of the incarnation always constituted a problem in
          connection with the immutability of God. This was already pointed out
          in the discussion of that attribute. However this problem may be
          solved, it should be maintained that the divine nature did not undergo
          any essential change in the incarnation. This also means that it
          remained impassible, that is, incapable of suffering and death, free
          from ignorance, and insusceptible to weakness and temptation. It is
          well to stress the fact that the incarnation was a personal act. It is
          better to say that the person of the Son of God became incarnate than
          to say that the divine nature assumed human flesh. If Reformed
          theologians do occasionally speak of the divine nature as incarnate,
          they speak of it "not immediately but mediately," to use the language
          of scholastic theology; they consider this nature not absolutely and
          in itself, but in the person of the Son of God. The result of the
          incarnation was that the divine Saviour could be ignorant and weak,
          could be tempted, and could suffer and die, not in His divine nature,
          but derivatively, by virtue of His possession of a human nature.
        </p>
        <p>2. A THREEFOLD COMMUNICATION RESULTED FROM THE INCARNATION.</p>
        <p>
          a.A communicatio idiomatum, or communication of properties. This means
          that the properties of both, the human and the divine natures, are now
          the properties of the person, and are therefore ascribed to the
          person. The person can be said to be almighty, omniscient,
          omnipresent, and so on, but can also be called a man of sorrows, of
          limited knowledge and power, and subject to human want and miseries.
          We must be careful not to understand the term to mean that anything
          peculiar to the divine nature was communicated to the human nature, or
          vice versa; or that there is an interpenetration of the two natures,
          as a result of which the divine is humanized, and the human is deified
          (Rome). The deity cannot share in human weaknesses; neither can man
          participate in any of the essential perfections of the Godhead.
        </p>
        <p>
          b.A communicatio apotelesmatum or operationum. This means that the
          redemptive work of Christ, and particularly the final result of that
          work, the apotelesma, bears a divine-human character. Analyzing this,
          we can say that it means: (1) that the efficient cause of the
          redemptive work of Christ is the one undivided personal subject in
          Christ; (2) that it is brought about by the co-operation of both
          natures; (3) that each of these natures works with its own special
          energeia; and (4) that, notwithstanding this, the result forms an
          undivided unity, because it is the work of a single person.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. A communicatio charismatum or gratiarum. This means that the human
          nature of Christ, from the very first moment of its existence, was
          adorned with all kinds of rich and glorious gifts, as for instance,
          (1) the gratia unionis cum persona tou Logou, that is, the grace and
          glory of being united to the divine Logos, also called the gratia
          eminentiae, by which the human nature is elevated high above all
          creatures, and even becomes the object of adoration; and (2) the
          gratia habitualis, consisting of those gifts of the Spirit,
          particularly of the intellect, of the will, and of power, by which the
          human nature of Christ was exalted high above all intelligent
          creatures. His impeccability, the non posse peccare, especially should
          be mentioned here.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE GOD-MAN IS THE OBJECT OF PRAYER. Another effect of the union
          is, that the Mediator just as He now exists, that is, in both natures,
          is the object of our prayer. It should be borne in mind that the honor
          adorationis does not belong to the human nature as such, but belongs
          to it only in virtue of its union with the divine Logos, who is in His
          very nature adorabilis. We must distinguish between the object and the
          ground of this adoration. The object of our religious worship is the
          God-man Jesus Christ, but the ground on which we adore Him lies in the
          person of the Logos.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE UNIPERSONALITY OF CHRIST A MYSTERY.</p>
        <p>
          The union of the two natures in one person is a mystery which we
          cannot grasp, and which for that very reason is often denied. It has
          sometimes been compared with the union of body and soul in man; and
          there are some points of similarity. In man there are two substances,
          matter and spirit, most closely united and yet not mixed; so also in
          the Mediator. In man the principle of unity, the person, does not have
          its seat in the body but in the soul; in the Mediator, not in the
          human, but in the divine nature. As the influence of the soul on the
          body and of the body on the soul is a mystery, so also the connection
          of the two natures in Christ and their mutual influence on each other.
          Everything that happens in the body and in the soul is ascribed to the
          person; so all that takes place in the two natures of Christ is
          predicated of the person. Sometimes a man is denominated according to
          his spiritual element, when something is predicated of him that
          applies more particularly to the body, and vice versa. Similarly
          things that apply only to the human nature of Christ are ascribed to
          Him when He is named after His divine nature, and vice versa. As it is
          an honor for the body to be united with the soul, so it is an honor
          for the human nature of Christ to be united with the person of the
          Logos. Of course, the comparison is defective. It does not illustrate
          the union of the divine and the human, of the infinite and the finite.
          It does not even illustrate the unity of two spiritual natures in a
          single person. In the case of man the body is material and the soul is
          spiritual. It is a wonderful union, but not as wonderful as the union
          of the two natures in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>E. THE LUTHERAN DOCTRINE OF THE COMMUNICATION OF ATTRIBUTES.</p>
        <p>
          1. STATEMENT OF THE LUTHERANPOSITION. The Lutherans differ from the
          Reformed in their doctrine of the communicatio idiomatum. They teach
          that the attributes of one nature are ascribed to the other on the
          basis of an actual transference, and feel that it is only by such a
          transference that the real unity of the person can be secured. This
          position does not involve a denial of the fact that the attributes of
          both natures can be ascribed to the person, but adds something to that
          in the interest, as they see it, of the unity of the person. They did
          not always state their doctrine in the same form. Luther and some of
          the early Lutherans occasionally spoke of a communication in both
          directions, from the divine nature to the human, and also from the
          human to the divine. In the subsequent development of the doctrine,
          however, the communication from the human nature to the divine soon
          receded from sight, and only that from the divine to the human nature
          was stressed. A still greater limitation soon followed. Lutheran
          scholastics distinguished between the operative attributes of God
          (omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience), and His quiescent
          attributes (infinitude, eternity, etc.), and taught that only the
          former were transferred to the human nature. They were all agreed that
          the communication took place at the time of the incarnation. But the
          question naturally arose how this could be squared with the picture of
          Christ in the Gospels, which is not the picture of an omniscient and
          omnipresent man. This gave rise to a difference of opinion. According
          to some, Christ necessarily exercised these attributes during His
          humiliation, but did it secretly; but according to others their
          exercise was subject to the will of the divine person, who voluntarily
          left them inoperative during the period of His humiliation. Opposition
          to this doctrine repeatedly manifested itself in the Lutheran Church.
          It was pointed out that it is inconsistent with the idea of a truly
          human development in the life of Christ, so clearly taught by Luther
          himself. The great Reformer's insistence on the communication of
          attributes finds its explanation partly in his mystical tendencies,
          and partly in his teachings respecting the physical presence of Christ
          in the Lord's Supper.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. OBJECTIONS TO THIS LUTHERAN DOCTRINE. There are serious objections
          to the Lutheran doctrine of the communicatio idiomatum.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. It has no Scriptural foundation. If it is inferred from such a
          statement as that in Joh_3:13, then, in consistency, it ought also to
          be concluded from 1Co_2:8 that the ability to suffer was communicated
          to the divine nature. Yet the Lutherans shrink back from that
          conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. It implies a fusion of the divine and the human natures in Christ.
          Lutherans speak as if the attributes can be abstracted from the
          nature, and can be communicated while the natures remain separate, but
          substance and attributes cannot be so separated. By a communication of
          divine attributes to the human nature that nature as such ceases to
          exist. Omnipresence and omniscience are not compatible with humanity.
          Such a communication results in a mixture of the divine and the human,
          which the Bible keeps strictly separate.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. In the form in which the doctrine is now generally accepted by the
          Lutherans, the doctrine suffers from inconsistency. If the divine
          attributes are communicated to the human nature, the human must also
          be communicated to the divine. And if some attributes are
          communicated, they must all be communicated. But the Lutherans
          evidently do not dare to go the full length, and therefore stop half
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. It is inconsistent with the picture of the incarnate Christ during
          the time of His humiliation, as we find it in the Gospels. This is not
          the picture of a man who is omnipresent and omniscient. The Lutheran
          explanations of this inconsistency failed to commend themselves to the
          mind of the Church in general, and even to some of the followers of
          Luther.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. It virtually destroys the incarnation. Lutherans distinguish
          between the incarnatio and the exinanitio. The Logos is the subject
          only of the former. He makes the human nature receptive for the
          inhabitation of the fulness of the Godhead and communicates to it some
          of the divine attributes. But by doing this He virtually abrogates the
          human nature by assimilating it to the divine. Thus only the divine
          remains.
        </p>
        <p>
          f. It also practically obliterates the distinction between the state
          of humiliation and the state of exaltation. Brenz even says that these
          were not successive states, but states that co-existed during the
          earthly life of Christ. To escape the difficulty here, the Lutherans
          brought in the doctrine of the exinanitio, of which not the Logos but
          the God-man is the subject, to the effect that He practically emptied
          Himself, or laid aside the divine attributes. Some spoke of a constant
          but secret, and others of an intermittent use of them.
        </p>
        <p>F. THE KENOSIS DOCTRINE IN VARIOUS FORMS.</p>
        <p>
          About the middle of the nineteenth century a new form of Christology
          made its appearance in the Kenotic theories. It found favor especially
          among the Lutherans, but also with some Reformed theologians. It
          represents part of an attempt to bring the Lutheran and the Reformed
          sections of the Church closer together. The advocates of this new view
          desired to do full justice to the reality and integrity of the manhood
          of Christ, and to stress the magnitude of His self-denial and
          self-sacrifice.

          1. STATEMENT OF THE DOCTRINE. The term "kenosis" is used in a two-fold
          sense in theology. Originally it was used by Lutheran theologians to
          denote the self-limitation, not of the Logos, but of the God-man,
          whereby He, in the interest of His humiliation, laid aside the actual
          use of His divine attributes. In the teachings of the Kenoticists,
          however, it signalized the doctrine that the Logos at the incarnation
          was denuded of His transitive or of all His attributes, was reduced to
          a mere potentiality, and then, in union with the human nature,
          developed again into a divine-human person. The main forms in which
          this doctrine were taught are the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The theory of Thomasius, Delitzsch and Crosby. Thomasius
          distinguishes between the absolute and essential attributes of God,
          such as absolute power, holiness, truth, and love, and His relative
          attributes, which are not essential to the Godhead, such as
          omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience; and maintains that the
          Logos while retaining His divine self-consciousness, laid the latter
          aside, in order to take unto Himself veritable human nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The theory of Gess and H. W. Beecher. This is far more
          thorough-going. La Touche speaks of it as "incarnation by divine
          suicide." The Logos so depotentiated Himself of all His divine
          attributes that He literally ceased from His cosmic functions and His
          eternal consciousness during the years of His earthly life. His
          consciousness became purely that of a human soul, and consequently He
          could and did take the place of the human soul in Christ. Thus the
          true manhood of Christ, even to the extent of His peccability, was
          secured.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The theory of Ebrard. Ebrard agrees with Gess in making the
          incarnate Logos take the place of the human soul. The eternal Son gave
          up the form of eternity, and in full self-limitation assumed the
          existence-form of a human life-center. But with him this self-
          reduction does not amount to a complete depotentiation of the Logos.
          The divine properties were retained, but were possessed by the God-man
          in the time-form appropriate to a human mode of existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. The theory of Martensen and Gore. Martensen postulated the
          existence of a double life in the incarnate Logos from two
          non-communicating life-centers. As being in the bosom of God, He
          continued to function in the trinitarian life and also in His cosmic
          relations to the world as Creator and Sustainer. But at the same time
          He, as the depotentiated Logos, united with a human nature, knew
          nothing of His trinitarian and cosmic functions, and only knew Himself
          to be God in such a sense as that knowledge is possible to the
          faculties of manhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. SUPPOSED SCRIPTURAL BASIS FOR THE DOCTRINE. The Kenotics seek
          Scriptural support for their doctrine, especially in Php_2:6-8, but
          also in 2Co_8:9 and Joh_17:5. The term "kenosis" is derived from the
          main verb in Php_2:7, ekenosen. This is rendered in the American
          Revised Version, "emptied Himself." Dr. Warfield calls this a
          mistranslation.8 The verb is found in only four other New Testament
          passages, namely, Rom_4:14; 1Co_1:17; 1Co_9:15; 2Co_9:3. In all of
          these it is used figuratively and means "to make void," "of no
          effect," "of no account," "of no reputation."9 If we so understand the
          word here, it simply means that Christ made Himself of no account, of
          no reputation, did not assert His divine prerogative, but took the
          form of a servant. But even if we take the word in its literal sense,
          it does not support the Kenosis theory. It would, if we understood
          that which He laid aside to be the morphe theou (form of God), and
          then conceived of morphe strictly as the essential or specific
          character of the Godhead. In all probability morphe must be so
          understood, but the verb ekenosen does not refer to morphe theou, but
          to einai isa theoi (dat.) that is, His being on an equality with God.
          The fact that Christ took the form of a servant does not involve a
          laying aside of the form of God. There was no exchange of the one for
          the other. Though He pre-existed in the form of God, Christ did not
          count the being on an equality with God as a prize which He must not
          let slip, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant. Now what
          does His becoming a servant involve? A state of subjection in which
          one is called upon to render obedience. And the opposite of this is a
          state of sovereignty in which one has the right to command. The being
          on an equality with God does not denote a mode of being, but a state
          which Christ exchanged for another state.10
        </p>
        <p>3. OBJECTIONS TO THE KENOSIS DOCTRINE.</p>
        <p>
          a. The theory is based on the pantheistic conception that God and man
          are not so absolutely different but that the one can be transformed
          into the other. The Hegelian idea of becoming is applied to God, and
          the absolute line of demarcation is obliterated.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. It is altogether subversive of the doctrine of the immutability of
          God, which is plainly taught in Scripture, Mal_3:6; Jas_1:17, and
          which is also implied in the very idea of God. Absoluteness and
          mutability are mutually exclusive; and a mutable God is certainly not
          the God of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. It means a virtual destruction of the Trinity, and therefore takes
          away our very God. The humanized Son, self-emptied of His divine
          attributes, could no longer be a divine subsistence in the trinitarian
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. It assumes too loose a relation between the divine mode of
          existence, the divine attributes, and the divine essence, when it
          speaks of the former as if they might very well be separated from the
          latter. This is altogether misleading, and involves the very error
          that is condemned in connection with the Roman Catholic doctrine of
          transubstantiation.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. It does not solve the problem which it was intended to solve. It
          desired to secure the unity of the person and the reality of the
          Lord's manhood. But, surely, the personal unity is not secured by
          assuming a human Logos as co-existent with a human soul. Nor is the
          reality of the manhood maintained by substituting for the human soul a
          depotentiated Logos. The Christ of the Kenotics is neither God nor
          man. In the words of Dr. Warfield His human nature is "just shrunken
          deity."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Kenotic theory enjoyed great popularity in Germany for a while,
          but has now practically died out there. When it began to disappear in
          Germany, it found supporters in England in such scholars as D. W.
          Forrest, W. L. Walker, P. T. Forsyth, Ch. Gore, R. L. Ottley, and H.
          R. Mackintosh. It finds very little support at the present time.
        </p>
        <p>G. THE THEORY OF GRADUAL INCARNATION.</p>
        <p>
          Dorner was one of the first and the greatest of the opponents of the
          Kenosis doctrine. He set himself the task of suggesting another theory
          which, while escaping the errors of Kenoticism, would do full justice
          to the humanity of Christ. He proposed to solve the problem by the
          theory of a gradual or progressive incarnation. According to him the
          incarnation was not an act consummated at the moment of the conception
          of Jesus, but a gradual process by which the Logos joined Himself in
          an ever-increasing measure to the unique and representative Man
          (virtually a new creation), Christ Jesus, until the full union was
          finally consummated at the time of the resurrection. The union
          resulted in the God-man with a single consciousness and a single will.
          In this God-man the Logos does not supply the personality, but gives
          it its divine quality. This theory finds no support in Scripture,
          which always represents the incarnation as a momentary fact rather
          than as a process. It logically leads to Nestorianism or the doctrine
          of two persons in the Mediator. And since it finds the real seat of
          the personality in the man Jesus, it is utterly subversive of the real
          pre-existence of our Lord. Rothe and Bovon are two of the most
          important supporters of this doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crucial difference between the ancient and the really modern
          theories respecting the person of Christ, lies in the fact that the
          latter, as appears also from the theory of Dorner, distinguish the
          person of the Logos, conceived as a special mode of the personal life
          of God, from the personality of Christ as a concrete human person
          uniquely divine in quality. According to modern views it is not the
          Logos but the man Jesus that constitutes the ego in Christ. The
          personality of Jesus is human in type of consciousness and also in
          moral growth, but at the same time uniquely receptive for the divine,
          and thus really the climax of an incarnation of which humanity itself
          is the general cosmic expression. This is true also of the theory
          suggested by Sanday in his Christologies Ancient and Modern, a theory
          which seeks to give a psychological explanation of the person of
          Jesus, which will do justice to both the human and the divine in
          Jesus. He stresses the fact that the subliminal consciousness is the
          proper seat of all divine indwelling, or divine action upon the human
          soul; and holds that the same or a corresponding subliminal self is
          also the proper seat or locus of the deity of the incarnate Christ.
          The ordinary consciousness of Jesus was the human consciousness, but
          there appeared in Him occasionally an uprush of the divine
          consciousness from the subliminal self. This theory has rightly been
          criticized severely. It ascribes a significance to the subliminal in
          the life of man which it does not possess, wrongly supposes that the
          deity can be located in some particular place in the person of Christ,
          and suggests a picture of Christ, as being only intermittently
          conscious of His deity, which is not in harmony with the data of
          Scripture. It reveals once more the folly of trying to give a
          psychological explanation of the person of Christ. Besides Sanday some
          of the more influential representatives of modern Christology are
          Kunze, Schaeder, Kaehler, Moberly, and Du Bose.

          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY. What change did the eighteenth century
          effect in Christology? What causes contributed to the present
          widespread denial of the deity of Christ? How do negative critics deal
          with the Scriptural proofs for the deity of Christ? Did the
          Liberal-Jesus-School succeed in presenting a tolerable picture of
          Jesus, which really squares with the facts? What is the distinction
          between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith, and what purpose
          did it serve? What about the argument aut Deus auto homo non bonus?
          How is the reality of Christ's manhood sometimes endangered? Was there
          a single or a double self-consciousness in Christ? One or two wills?
          On what grounds is the Messianic consciousness of Jesus denied? How
          can it be defended? Did Jesus regard the Messiahship merely as a
          dignity that would be His in the future? Has the eschatological school
          any advantages over the liberal school? How do the Reformed, the
          Lutheran, and the Roman Catholic conceptions of the union of the two
          natures in Christ differ? What does the Formula Concordiae teach on
          this point? What was the Giessen-Tuebingen controversy? How did Kant,
          Hegel, and Schleiermacher conceive of this union? In what respect do
          the Kenosis theories reveal the influence of Hegel? How did the modern
          conception of the immanence of God affect more recent Christologies?
          Is Sanday's psychological theory an acceptable construction?
