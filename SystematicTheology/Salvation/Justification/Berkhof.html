        <a href="#tbref-1">A. THE SCRIPTURAL TERMS FOR JUSTIFICATION AND THEIR MEANING.</a>
      </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        1. THE OLD TESTAMENT TERM. The Hebrew term for “to justify” is hitsdik, which in the great
        majority of cases means “to declare judicially that one’s state is in harmony with the demands of
        the law, Ex. 23:7; Deut. 25:1; Prov. 17:15; Isa. 5:23. The piel tsiddek occasionally has the same
        meaning, Jer. 3:11; Ezek. 16:50,51. The meaning of these words is therefore strictly forensic or
        legal. Since Roman Catholics, such representatives of the moral influence theory of the
        atonement as John Young of Edinburgh and Horace Bushnell, and also the Unitarians and
        modern liberal theologians, deny the legal meaning of the term “to justify,” and ascribe to it the
        moral sense of “to make just or righteous,” it becomes important to take careful notice of the
        considerations that may be urged in favor of the legal meaning. That this is the proper
        denotation of the word appears (a) from the terms placed in contrast with it, as, for instance
        “condemnation,” Deut. 25:1; Prov. 17:15; Isa. 5:23; (b) from the correlative terms placed in
        juxtaposition with it and which often imply a process of judgment, Gen. 18:25; Ps. 143:2; (c)
        from the equivalent expressions that are sometimes used, Gen. 15:6; Ps. 32:1,2; and (d) from the
        fact that a passage like Prov. 17:15 would yield an impossible sense, if the word meant “to make
        just.” The meaning would then be: He who morally improves the life of the wicked is an
        abomination to the Lord. There are a couple of passages, however, in which the word means
        more than simply “to declare righteous,” namely, Isa. 53:11; Dan. 12:3. But even in these cases
        the sense is not “to make good or holy,” but rather “to alter the condition so that man can be
        considered righteous.”</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        2. THE NEW TESTAMENT TERMS AND THEIR USE. Here we have:</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        a. The verb dikaio-o. This verb means in general “to declare a person to be just. Occasionally it
        refers to a personal declaration that one’s moral character is in conformity with the law, Matt.
        12:37; Luke 7:29; Rom. 3:4. In the Epistles of Paul the soteriological meaning of the term is
        clearly in the foreground. It is “to declare forensically that the demands of the law as a condition
        of life are fully satisfied with regard to a person, Acts 13:39; Rom. 5:1,9; 8:30-33; I Cor. 6:11;
        Gal. 2:16; 3:11. In the case of this word, just as in that of hitsdik, the forensic meaning of the
        term is proved by the following facts: (a) in many instances it can bear no other sense, Rom.
        3:20-28; 4:5-7; 5:1; Gal. 2:16; 3:11; 5:4; (b) it is placed in antithetic relation to “condemnation”
        in Rom. 8:33,34; (c) equivalent and interchangeable expressions convey a judicial or legal idea,
        John 3:18; 5:24; Rom. 4:6,7; II Cor. 5:19; and (d) if it does not bear this meaning, there is no
        distinction between justification and sanctification.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        b. The word dikaios. This word, connected with the verb just discussed, is peculiar in that it
        never expresses what a thing is in itself, but always what it is in relation to something else, to
        some standard outside of it, to which it ought to correspond. In that respect it differs from
        agathos. In classical Greek, for instance, dikaios is applied to a wagon, a horse, or something
        else to indicate that it is fit for its intended use. Agathos expresses the idea that a thing in itself

        answers to the ideal. In Scripture a man is called dikaios when, in the judgment of God, his
        relation to the law is what it ought to be, or when his life is such as is required by his judicial
        relation to God. This may include the idea that he is good, but only from a certain point of view,
        namely, that of his judicial relation to God.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        c. The noun dikaiosis, justification. This is found in only two places in the New Testament,
        namely, Rom. 4:25; 5:18. It denotes the act of God’s declaring men free from guilt and
        acceptable to Him. The resulting state is denoted by the word dikaiosune.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        3. The resulting idea of justification. Our word justification (from the Latin justificare,
        composed of justus and facere, and therefore meaning “to make righteous”), just as the Holland
        rechtvaardigmaking, is apt to give the impression that justification denotes a change that is
        brought about in man, which is not the case. In the use of the English word the danger is not so
        great, because the people in general do not understand its derivation, and in the Holland
        language the danger may be averted by employing the related words rechtvaardigen and
        rechtvaardiging. “To justify” in the Scriptural sense of the word, is to effect an objective
        relation, the state of righteousness, by a judicial sentence. This can be done in a twofold way: (a)
        by bringing into account the actual subjective condition of a person (to justify the just or the
        righteous), Jas. 2:21; or (b) by imputing to a person the righteousness of another, that is, by
        accounting him righteous though he is inwardly unrighteous. The latter is the usual sense of
        justification in the New Testament.</p>



      <p id="tb-2" class="tab">
        <a href="#tbref-2">B. THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION IN HISTORY.</a>
      </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>


        The doctrine of justification by faith was not always clearly understood. In fact, it did not find its
        classical expression until the days of the Reformation. We shall briefly consider:</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        1. THE DOCTRINE BEFORE THE REFORMATION. Some of the earliest Church Fathers
        already speak of justification by faith, but it is quite evident that they had no clear
        understanding of it and of its relation to faith. Moreover, they did not sharply distinguish
        between regeneration and justification. A rather common representation was that regeneration
        takes place in baptism and includes the forgiveness of sins. Even Augustine does not seem to
        have had an accurate understanding of justification as a legal act, as distinguished from the
        moral process of sanctification, though it is quite evident from the whole tenor of his teachings
        and also from separate statements, that he regarded the grace of God in the redemption of
        sinners as free, sovereign, and efficacious, and in no way dependent on any merits of men. The
        confounding of justification and sanctification continued into the Middle Ages and gradually
        acquired a more positive and doctrinal aspect. According to the prevailing teachings of the
        Scholastics, justification includes two elements: man’s sins are forgiven, and he is made just or
        righteous. There was a difference of opinion as to the logical order of these two elements, some
        reversing the order just indicated. This was also done by Thomas Aquinas, and his view became
        the prevalent one in the Roman Catholic Church. Grace is infused in man. whereby he is made
        just, and partly on the basis of this infused grace, his sins are pardoned. This was already an
        approach to the evil doctrine of merit, which was gradually developed in the Middle Ages in
        connection with the doctrine of justification. The idea found favor ever-increasingly that man is
        justified in part on the basis of his own good works. The confounding of justification and
        sanctification also led to divergent opinions on another point. Some of the Scholastics speak of
        justification as an instantaneous act of God, while others describe it as a process. In the Canons

        and Decrees of the Council of Trent we find the following in Chap. XVI, Canon IX: “If any one
        saith, that by faith alone the impious is justified in such wise as to mean, that nothing else is
        required to co-operate in order to the obtaining of the grace of justification, and that it is not in
        any way necessary, that he be prepared and disposed by the movement of his own will: let him
        be anathema.” And Canon XXIV speaks of an increase in justification and therefore conceives of
        it as a process: “If any one saith, that the justice received is not preserved and also increased
        before God through good works; but that the said works are merely the fruits and signs of
        justification obtained, but not a cause of the increase thereof: let him be anathema.”</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        2. THE DOCTRINE AFTER THE REFORMATION. The doctrine of justification was the great
        material principle of the Reformation. With respect to the nature of justification the Reformers
        corrected the error of confounding justification with sanctification by stressing its legal
        character and representing it as an act of God’s free grace, whereby He pardons our sins and
        accepts us as righteous in His sight, but does not change us inwardly. As far as the ground of
        justification is concerned, they rejected the idea of Rome that this lies, at least in part, in the
        inherent righteousness of the regenerate and in good works, and substituted for it the doctrine
        that it is found only in the imputed righteousness of the Redeemer. And in connection with the
        means of justification they emphasized the fact that man is justified freely by that faith which
        receives and rests in Christ only for salvation. Moreover, they rejected the doctrine of a
        progressive justification, and held that it was instantaneous and complete, and did not depend
        for its completion on some further satisfaction for sin. They were opposed by the Socinians, who
        held that sinners obtain pardon and acceptance with God, through His mercy, on the ground of
        their own repentance and reformation. The Arminians do not all agree on the subject, but in
        general it may be said that they limit the scope of justification, so as to include only the
        forgiveness of sins on the basis of the passive obedience of Christ, and to exclude the adoption of
        the sinner in favor by God or the basis of the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ. The sinner
        is accounted righteous only on the basis of his faith or his life of obedience. The Neonomians in
        England were in general agreement with them on this point. For Schleiermacher and Ritschl
        justification meant little more than the sinner’s becoming conscious of his mistake in thinking
        that God was angry with him. And in modern liberal theology we again meet with the idea that
        God justifies the sinner by the moral improvement of his life. This conception of it is found, for
        instance, in Bushnell’s Vicarious Sacrifice and in Macintosh’s Theology as an Empirical
        Science.</p>

      <p id="tb-3" class="tab">
        <a href="#tbref-3">C. THE NATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF JUSTIFICATION</a>
      </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>Justification is a
        judicial act of God, in which He declares, on the basis of the righteousness of Jesus Christ, that
        all the claims of the law are satisfied with respect to the sinner. It is unique in the application of
        the work of redemption in that it is a judicial act of God, a declaration respecting the sinner, and
        not an act or process of renewal, such as regeneration, conversion, and sanctification. While it
        has respect to the sinner, it does not change his inner life. It does not affect his condition, but his
        state, and in that respect differs from all the other principal parts of the order of salvation. It
        involves the forgiveness of sins, and restoration to divine favor. The Arminian holds that it
        includes only the former, and not the latter; but the Bible clearly teaches that the fruit of
        justification is much more than pardon. They who are justified have “peace with God,”
        “assurance of salvation,” Rom. 5:1-10, and an “inheritance among them that are sanctified,” Acts
        26:18. The following points of difference between justification and sanctification should be
        carefully noted:
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        1. Justification removes the guilt of sin and restores the sinner to all the filial rights involved in
        his state as a child of God, including an eternal inheritance. Sanctification removes the pollution
        of sin and renews the sinner ever-increasingly in conformity with the image of God.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        2. Justification takes place outside of the sinner in the tribunal of God, and does not change his
        inner life, though the sentence is brought home to him subjectively. Sanctification, on the other
        hand, takes place in the inner life of man and gradually affects his whole being.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        3. Justification takes place once for all. It is not repeated, neither is it a process; it is complete at
        once and for all time. There is no more or less in justification; man is either fully justified, or he
        is not justified at all. In distinction from it sanctification is a continuous process, which is never
        completed in this life.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        4. While the meritorious cause of both lies in the merits of Christ, there is a difference in the
        efficient cause. Speaking economically, God the Father declares the sinner righteous, and God
        the Holy Spirit sanctifies him.</p>


      <p id="tb-4" class="tab">
        <a href="#tbref-4">D. THE ELEMENTS OF JUSTIFICATION.</a>
      </p>


      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        We distinguish two elements in justification, the one negative, and the other positive.
        1. The negative element. There is first of all a negative element in justification, namely, the
        remission of sins on the ground of the atoning work of Jesus Christ. This element is based more
        particularly, though not exclusively, on the passive obedience of the Saviour. Calvin and some of
        the older Reformed theologians occasionally speak as if this were the whole of justification. This
        is partly due to the Old Testament representation, in which this side of justification is decidedly
        in the foreground, Ps. 32:1; Isa. 43:25; 44:22; Jer. 31:34, and partly to their reaction against
        Rome, which did not do justice to the element of grace and free pardon. In opposition to
        Arminianism, however, Reformed theology has always maintained that justification is more
        than pardon. That the forgiveness of sins is an important element in justification is evident, not
        only from the Old, but also from the New Testament, as appears from such passages as Rom.
        4:5-8; 5:18,19; Gal. 2:17.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        The pardon granted in justification applies to all sins, past, present, and future, and thus
        involves the removal of all guilt and of every penalty. This follows from the fact that justification
        does not admit of repetition, and from such passages as Rom. 5:21; 8:1,32-34; Heb. 10:14; Ps.
        103:12; Isa. 44:22, which assure us that no one can lay anything to the charge of the justified
        man, that he is exempt from condemnation, and that he is constituted an heir of eternal life. It is
        also implied in the answer to the 60th question of our Heidelberg Catechism. This conception of
        justification, though eminently Scriptural, is not devoid of difficulty. Believers continue to sin
        after they are justified, Jas. 3:2; I John 1:8, and, as Scripture examples clearly show, frequently
        fall into grievous sins. Hence it is no wonder that Barth likes to stress the fact that the justified
        man remains a sinner, though a justified sinner. Christ taught His disciples to pray daily for the
        forgiveness of sins, Matt. 6:12, and the Bible saints are often pleading for pardon and obtaining
        it, Ps. 32:5; 51:1-4; 130:3,4. Consequently it is not surprising that some felt constrained to speak
        of a repeated justification. The Church of Rome infers from the data to which we called attention
        that believers must in some way atone for sins committed after baptism, and therefore also
        believes in an increasing justification. Antinomians, on the other hand, desiring to honour the

        unlimited pardoning grace of God, maintain that the sins of believers are not accounted as such
        to the new man but only to the old, and that it is quite unnecessary for them to pray for the
        forgiveness of sins. For fear of this Antinomian position even some Reformed theologians had
        scruples about teaching that the future sins of believers are also pardoned in justification, and
        spoke of a repeated and even daily justification.[Cf. Brakel, Redelijke Godsdienst I, pp. 876
        ff.] The usual position of Reformed theology, however, is that in justification God indeed
        removes the guilt, but not the culpability of sin, that is, He removes the sinner’s just amenability
        to punishment, but not the inherent guiltiness of whatever sins he may continue to perform. The
        latter remains and therefore always produces in believers a feeling of guilt, of separation from
        God, of sorrow, of repentance, and so on. Hence they feel the need of confessing their sins, even
        the sins of their youth, Ps. 25:7: 51:5-9. The believer who is really conscious of his sin feels
        within him an urge to confess it and to seek the comforting assurance of forgiveness. Moreover,
        such confession and prayer is not only a subjectively felt need, but also an objective necessity.
        Justification is essentially an objective declaration respecting the sinner in the tribunal of God,
        but it is not merely that; it is also an actus transiens, passing into the consciousness of the
        believer. The divine sentence of acquittal is brought home to the sinner and awakens the joyous
        consciousness of the forgiveness of sins and of favor with God. Now this consciousness of
        pardon and of a renewed filial relationship is often disturbed and obscured by sin, and is again
        quickened and strengthened by confession and prayer, and by a renewed exercise of faith.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        2. THE POSITIVE ELEMENT. There is also a positive element in justification which is based
        more particularly on the active obedience of Christ. Naturally they who, like Piscator and the
        Arminians, deny the imputation of the active obedience of Christ to the sinner, thereby also deny
        the positive element in justification. According to them justification leaves man without any
        claim on life eternal, simply places him in the position of Adam before the fall, though according
        to the Arminians under a different law, the law of evangelical obedience, and leaves it to man to
        merit acceptance with God and eternal life by faith and obedience. But it is quite evident from
        Scripture that justification is more than mere pardon. Unto Joshua, the high priest, who stood,
        as the representative of Israel, with filthy garments before the Lord, Jehovah said: “Behold, I
        have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee (negative element), and I will clothe thee with rich
        apparel” (positive element), Zech. 3:4. According to Acts 26:18 we obtain by faith “remission of
        sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified.” Romans 5:1,2 teaches us that
        justification by faith brings not only peace with God, but also access to God and joy in the hope
        of glory. And according to Gal. 4:5 Christ was born under the law also “that we might receive
        the adoption of sons.” In this positive element two parts may be distinguished:</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        a. The adoption of children. Believers are first of all children of God by adoption. This implies, of
        course, that they are not children of God by nature, as modern liberals would have us believe, for
        one cannot well adopt his own children. This adoption is a legal act, whereby God places the
        sinner in the status of a child, but does not change him inwardly any more than parents by the
        mere act of adoption change the inner life of an adopted child. The change that is effected
        concerns the relation in which man stands to God. By virtue of their adoption believers are as it
        were initiated into the very family of God, come under the law of filial obedience, and at the
        same time become entitled to all the privileges of sonship. The sonship by adoption should be
        carefully distinguished from the moral sonship of believers, their sonship by regeneration and
        sanctification. They are not only adopted to be children of God, but are also born of God.
        Naturally these two cannot be separated. They are mentioned together in John 1:12; Rom.
        8:15.16; Gal. 3:26,27; 4:5,6. In Rom. 8:15 the term huiothesia (from huios and tithenai) is used,

        which literally means “placing as a son,” and in classical Greek is always employed to denote an
        objective placing in the status of a child. The following verse contains the word tekna (from
        tikto, “to beget”), which designates believers as those who are begotten of God. In John 1:12 the
        idea of adoption is expressed by the words, “But as many as received Him, to them gave He the
        right (exousian edoken) to become children of God.” The Greek expression here used means “to
        give legal right.” Immediately thereafter, in the 13th verse, the writer speaks of ethical sonship
        by regeneration. The connection between the two is clearly brought out in Gal. 4:5,6 . . . “that we
        might receive the adoption of sons. And because ye are sons (by adoption), God sent forth the
        Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.” That Spirit regenerates and sanctifies us
        and prompts us to address God full of confidence as Father.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        b. The right to eternal life. This element is virtually included in the preceding one. When sinners
        are adopted to be children of God, they are invested with all the legal filial rights, and become
        heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, Rom. 8:17. This means first of all that they become heirs
        of all the blessings of salvation in the present life, the most fundamental of which is described in
        the words, “the promise of the Spirit,” that is, the promised blessing in the form of the Spirit,
        Gal. 3:14; and in the slightly different phrase, “the Spirit of His Son,” Gal. 4:6. And in and with
        the Spirit they receive all the gifts of Christ. But this is not all; their inheritance also includes the
        eternal blessings of the future life. The glory of which Paul speaks in Rom. 8:17 follows after the
        sufferings of the present time. According to Rom. 8:23 the redemption of the body, which is
        there called “the adoption,” also belongs to the future inheritance. And in the ordo salutis of
        Rom. 8:29,30 glorification connects up immediately with justification. Being justified by faith,
        believers are heirs of life eternal.</p>

        <a href="#tbref-5">E. THE SPHERE IN WHICH JUSTIFICATION OCCURS.</a>
      </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>


        The question as to the sphere in which justification occurs, must be answered with
        discrimination. It is customary to distinguish between an active and a passive, also called an
        objective and a subjective, justification, each having its own sphere.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        1. ACTIVE OR OBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION. This is justification in the most fundamental
        sense of the word. It is basic to what is called subjective justification, and consists in a
        declaration which God makes respecting the sinner, and this declaration is made in the tribunal
        of God. This declaration is not a declaration in which God simply acquits the sinner, without
        taking any account of the claims of justice, but is rather a divine declaration that, in the case of
        the sinner under consideration, the demands of the law are met. The sinner is declared
        righteous in view of the fact that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to him. In this
        transaction God appears, not as an absolute Sovereign who simply sets the law aside, but as a
        righteous Judge, who acknowledges the infinite merits of Christ as a sufficient basis for
        justification, and as a gracious Father, who freely forgives and accepts the sinner. This active
        justification logically precedes faith and passive justification. We believe the forgiveness of sins.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        2. PASSIVE OR SUBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION. Passive or subjective justification takes place in
        the heart or conscience of the sinner. A purely objective justification that is not brought home to
        the sinner would not answer the purpose. The granting of a pardon would mean nothing to a
        prisoner, unless the glad tidings were communicated to him and the doors of the prison were
        opened. Moreover, it is exactly at this point that the sinner learns to understand better than
        anywhere else that salvation is of free grace. When the Bible speaks of justification, it usually

        refers to what is known as passive justification. It should be borne in mind, however, that the
        two cannot be separated. The one is based on the other. The distinction is simply made to
        facilitate the proper understanding of the act of justification. Logically, passive justification
        follows faith; we are justified by faith.</p>

      <p id="tb-6" class="tab">
        <a href="#tbref-6">F. THE TIME OF JUSTIFICATION.</a>
      </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Some theologians separate active and passive justification temporally. The active justification is
        then said to have taken place in eternity or in the resurrection of Christ, while passive
        justification takes place by faith and therefore, it is said, follows the other in a temporal sense.
        We shall consider successively justification from eternity, justification in the resurrection of
        Christ, and justification by faith.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        1. JUSTIFICATION FROM ETERNITY. The Antinomians held that the justification of the sinner
        took place in eternity, or in the resurrection of Christ. They either confounded it with the eternal
        decree of election, or with the objective justification of Christ when He was raised from the dead.
        They did not properly distinguish between the divine purpose in eternity and its execution in
        time, nor between the work of Christ in procuring, and that of the Holy Spirit in applying the
        blessings of redemption. According to this position we are justified even before we believe,
        though we are unconscious of it, and faith simply conveys to us the declaration of this fact.
        Moreover, the fact that our sins were imputed to Christ made Him personally a sinner, and the
        imputation of His righteousness to us makes us personally righteous, so that God can see no sin
        in believers at all. Some Reformed theologians also speak of justification from eternity, but at
        the same time refuse to subscribe to the Antinomian construction of this doctrine. The grounds
        on which they believe in justification from eternity deserve brief consideration.
        a. Grounds for the doctrine of justification from eternity.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        (1) Scripture speaks of a grace or mercy of God which is from ever-lasting, Ps. 25:6; 103:17. Now
        all grace or mercy that is from eternity must have as its judicial or legal basis a justification that
        is from eternity. But in answer to this it may be said that there are eternal mercies and
        lovingkindnesses of God which are not based on any justification of the sinner, as, for instance,
        His plan of redemption, the gift of His Son, and the willing suretyship of Christ in the pactum
        salutis.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        (2) In the pactum salutis the guilt of the sins of the elect was transferred to Christ, and the
        righteousness of Christ was imputed to them. This means that the burden of sin was lifted from
        their shoulders and that they were justified. Now there is no doubt about it that there was a
        certain imputation of the righteousness of Christ to the sinner in the counsel of redemption, but
        not all imputation can be called justification in the Scriptural sense of the term. We must
        distinguish between what was merely ideal in the counsel of God and what is realized in the
        course of history.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        (3) The sinner receives the initial grace of regeneration on the basis of the imputed
        righteousness of Christ. Consequently, the merits of Christ must have been imputed to him
        before his regeneration. But while this consideration leads to the conclusion that justification
        logically precedes regeneration, it does not prove the priority of justification in a temporal sense.

        The sinner can receive the grace of regeneration on the basis of a justification, ideally existing in
        the counsel of God and certain to be realized in the life of the sinner.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        (4) Children also need justification, in order to be saved, and yet it is quite impossible that they
        should experience justification by faith. But though it is perfectly true that children, who have
        not yet come to maturity, cannot experience passive justification, they can be actively justified in
        the tribunal of God and thus be in possession of that which is absolutely essential.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        (5) Justification is an immanent act of God, and as such must be from eternity. It is hardly
        correct, however, to speak of justification as an actus immanens in God; it is rather an actus
        transiens, just as creation, incarnation, and so on. The advocates of justification from eternity
        feel the weight of this consideration, and therefore hasten to give us the assurance that they do
        not mean to teach that the elect are justified from eternity actualiter, but only in the intention of
        God, in the divine decree. This leads us back to the usual distinction between the counsel of God
        and its execution. If this justification in the intention of God warrants our speaking of a
        justification from eternity, then there is absolutely no reason why we should not speak of a
        creation from eternity as well.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        b. Objections against the doctrine of justification from eternity.
        (1) The Bible teaches uniformly that justification takes place by faith or out of faith. This, of
        course, applies to passive or subjective justification, which, however, cannot be separated
        temporally from active or objective justification except in the case of children. But if justification
        takes place by faith, it certainly does not precede faith in a temporal sense. Now it is true that
        the advocates of a justification from eternity also speak of a justification by faith. But in their
        representation this can only mean that man by faith becomes conscious of what God has done in
        eternity.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        (2) In Rom. 8:29,30, where we find some of the scalae of the ordo salutis, justification stands
        between two acts of God in time, namely, calling and glorification, which begins in time but is
        completed in a future eternity. And these three together are the result of two others which are
        explicitly indicated as eternal. Dr. Kuyper is not warranted in saying that Rom. 8:30 refers to
        what took place with the regenerated before they were born, as even Dr. De Moor, who also
        believes in a justification from eternity, is quite willing to admit.[Cf. his De
        Rechtvaardigmaking Van Eeuwigheid, p. 20.]</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        (3) In teaching justification from eternity, the decree of God respecting the justification of the
        sinner, which is an actus immanens, is identified with justification itself, which is an actus
        transiens. This only leads to confusion. What took place in the pactum salutis cannot be
        identified with what results from it. All imputation is not yet justification. Justification is one of
        the fruits of Christ’s redemptive work, applied to believers by the Holy Spirit. But the Spirit did
        not and could not apply this or any other fruit of the work of Christ from eternity.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        2. JUSTIFICATION IN THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST. The idea that sinners are in some
        sense of the word justified in the resurrection of Christ was stressed by some Antinomians, is
        taught by those Reformed theologians who believe in a justification from eternity, and is also
        held by some other Reformed scholars. This view is based on the following grounds:
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        a. By His atoning work Christ satisfied all the demands of the law for His people. In the
        resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead the Father publicly declared that all the requirements
        of the law were met for all the elect and thereby justified them. But here too careful distinction is
        required. Even though it be true that there was an objective justification of Christ and of the
        whole body of Christ in His resurrection, this should not be confounded with the justification of
        the sinner of which Scripture speaks. It is not true that, when Christ rendered full satisfaction to
        the Father for all His people, their guilt naturally terminated. A penal debt is not like a
        pecuniary debt in this respect. Even after the payment of a ransom, the removal of guilt may
        depend on certain conditions, and does not follow as a matter of course. The elect are not
        personally justified in the Scriptural sense until they accept Christ by faith and thus appropriate
        His merits.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        b. In Rom. 4:25 we read that Christ was “raised up for (dia, causal, on account of) our
        justification,” that is, to effect our justification. Now it is undoubtedly true that dia with the
        accusative is causal here. At the same time it need not be retrospective, but can also be
        prospective and therefore mean “with a view to our justification,” which is equivalent to saying,
        “in order that we may be justified.” The retrospective interpretation would be in conflict with the
        immediately following context, which clearly shows (1) that Paul is not thinking of the objective
        justification of the whole body of Christ, but of the personal justification of sinners; and (2) that
        he conceives of this as taking place through faith.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        c. In II Cor. 5:19 we read: “God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not reckoning
        unto them their trespasses.” From this passage the inference is drawn that the objective
        reconciliation of the world in Christ involves the non-imputation of sin to the sinner. But this
        interpretation is not correct. The evident meaning of the apostle is: God was in Christ
        reconciling the world unto Himself, as appears from the fact that He does not impute to men
        their sins, and that He has entrusted to His servants the word of reconciliation. Notice that me
        logizomenos (present tense) refers to what is constantly going on. This cannot be conceived as a
        part of the objective reconciliation, for then the following clause, “and having committed to us
        the word of reconciliation,” would also have to be so interpreted, and this is quite impossible.
        In connection with this matter it may be said that we can speak of a justification of the body of
        Christ as a whole in His resurrection, but this is purely objective and should not be confounded
        with the personal justification of the sinner.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        3. JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        a. The relation of faith to justification. Scripture says that we are justified dia pisteos, ek pisteos,
        or pistei (dative), Rom. 3:25,28,30; 5:1; Gal. 2:16; Phil. 3:9. The preposition dia stresses the fact
        that faith is the instrument by which we appropriate Christ and His righteousness. The
        preposition ek indicates that faith logically precedes our personal justification, so that this, as it
        were, originates in faith. The dative is used in an instrumental sense. Scripture never says that
        we are justified dia ten pistin, on account of faith. This means that faith is never represented as
        the ground of our justification. If this were the case, faith would have to be regarded as a
        meritorious work of man. And this would be the introduction of the doctrine of justification by
        works, which the apostle opposes consistently, Rom. 3:21,27,28; 4:3,4; Gal. 2:16,21; 3:11. We are
        told indeed that Abraham’s faith was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Rom. 4:3,9,22; Gal.
        3:6, but in view of the whole argument this surely cannot mean that in his case faith itself as a

        work took the place of the righteousness of God in Christ. The apostle does not leave it doubtful
        that, strictly speaking, only the righteousness of Christ imputed to us, is the ground of our
        justification. But faith is so thoroughly receptive in the appropriation of the merits of Christ, that
        it can be put figuratively for the merits of Christ which it receives. “Faith” then is equivalent to
        the contents of faith, that is, to the merits or the righteousness of Christ.
        It is often said, however, that the teachings of James conflict with those of Paul on this point,
        and clearly support the doctrine of justification by works in Jas. 2:14-26. Various attempts have
        been made to harmonize the two. Some proceed on the assumption that both Paul and James
        speak of the justification of the sinner, but that James stresses the fact that a faith which does
        not manifest itself in good works is no true faith, and therefore is not a faith that justifies. This is
        undoubtedly true. The difference between the representations of Paul and James is
        unquestionably due partly to the nature of the adversaries with which they had to deal. Paul had
        to contend with legalists who sought to base their justification, at least in part, on the works of
        the law. James, on the other hand, joined issue with Antinomians, who claimed to have faith,
        but whose faith was merely an intellectual assent to the truth (2:19), and who denied the
        necessity of good works. Therefore he stresses the fact that faith without works is a dead faith,
        and consequently not at all a faith that justifies. The faith that justifies is a faith that is fruitful in
        good works. But it may be objected that this does not explain the whole difficulty, since James
        explicitly says in verse 24 that a man is justified by works and not only by faith, and illustrates
        this by the example of Abraham, who was “justified by works in that he offered up Isaac” (verse
        21). “Thou seest,” says he in verse 24, “that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith
        made perfect.” It is quite evident, however, that in this case the writer is not speaking of the
        justification of the sinner, for Abraham the sinner was justified long before he offered up Isaac
        (cf. Gen. 15), but of a further justification of the believing Abraham. True faith will manifest
        itself in good works, and these works will testify before men of the righteousness (that is, the
        righteousness of life) of him that possesses such a faith. The justification of the just by works
        confirms the justification by faith. If James actually meant to say in this section of his letter that
        Abraham and Rahab were justified with the justificatio peccatoris, on the basis of their good
        works, he would not only be in conflict with Paul, but would also be self-contradictory, for he
        explicitly says that Abraham was justified by faith.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        b. Theological terms to express the relation of faith to justification. There are especially three
        terms that come into consideration here.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        (1) Instrumental cause. This name was very generally used at first, but afterwards met with
        considerable opposition. The question was raised, whether it was God’s instrument or man’s.
        And it was said: It cannot be God’s, since the faith referred to is not God’s faith; neither can it be
        man’s, for justification is not a deed of man, but of God. We should bear in mind, however, (a)
        that according to the plain teaching of the Bible we are justified by faith, dia pisteos, and that
        this dia can only be understood in an instrumental sense, Rom. 3:28; Gal. 3:8; (b) that the Bible
        explicitly says that God justifies the sinner by faith, and therefore represents faith as God’s
        instrument, Rom. 3:30; and (c) that faith is also represented as the instrument of man, as the
        means by which he receives justification, Gal. 2:16. Faith can be regarded as the instrument of
        God in a twofold sense. It is a gift of God wrought in the sinner unto justification. Moreover, by
        working faith in the sinner, God carries the declaration of pardon into his heart or conscience.
        But faith is also an instrument of man by which he appropriates Christ and all His precious gifts,
        Rom. 4:5; Gal. 2:16. This is also the representation of the matter which we find in the Belgic

        Confession,[Art. XXII.] and in the Heidelberg Catechism.[Questions 60 and 61.] By faith we
        embrace Christ and remain in contact with Him who is our righteousness. The name
        “instrumental cause” is regularly used in Protestant Confessions. Yet some Reformed
        theologians prefer to avoid it, in order to guard themselves against the danger of giving the
        impression that justification is in any way dependent on faith as a work of man.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        (2) Appropriating organ. This name expresses the idea that by faith the sinner appropriates the
        righteousness of Christ and establishes a conscious union between himself and Christ. The
        merits of Christ constitute the dikaioma, the legal basis on which the formal declaration of God
        in justification rests. By faith the sinner appropriates the righteousness of the Mediator already
        imputed to him ideally in the pactum salutis; and on the basis of this he is now formally justified
        before God. Faith justifies in so far as it takes possession of Christ. The name “appropriating
        organ” includes the instrumental idea, and is therefore perfectly in harmony with the statements
        found in our confessional standards. It has an advantage over the more common name in that it
        excludes the idea that faith is in any sense the basis for justification. It can be called an
        appropriating organ in a twofold sense: (a) It is the organ by which we lay hold on and
        appropriate the merits of Christ, and accept these as the meritorious ground of our justification.
        As such it logically precedes justification. (b) It is also the organ by which we consciously
        apprehend our justification and obtain possession of subjective justification. In this sense it
        logically follows justification. On the whole this name deserves preference, though it should be
        borne in mind that, strictly speaking, faith is the organ by which we appropriate the
        righteousness of Christ as the ground of our justification, rather than the organ by which we
        appropriate justification itself.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        (3) Conditio sine qua non. This name, suggested by some Reformed theologians, did not meet
        with great favor. It expresses the idea, which is perfectly true in itself, that man is not justified
        apart from faith, and that faith is an indispensable condition of justification. The name
        expresses nothing positive, and is, moreover, liable to misunderstanding.</p>

      <p id="tb-7" class="tab">
        <a href="#tbref-7">G. THE GROUND OF JUSTIFICATION.</a>
      </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>


        One of the most important points of controversy between the Church of Rome and the
        Reformers, and between Reformed theology and the Arminians, concerned the ground of
        justification. With respect to this the Reformers taught:</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        1. Negatively, that this cannot be found in any virtue of man, nor in his good works. This
        position must also be maintained at present over against Rome and the Pelagianizing tendencies
        of various Churches. Rome teaches that the sinner is justified on the basis of the inherent
        righteousness that has been infused into his heart, and which, in turn, is the fruit of the cooperation of the
        human will with prevenient grace. This applies to what is called the first
        justification; in all following justification the good works of man come into consideration as the
        formal cause or ground of justification. It is impossible, however, that the inherent
        righteousness of the regenerate man and his good works should constitute the ground of his
        justification, for (a) this righteousness is and remains during this life a very imperfect
        righteousness; (b) it is itself already the fruit of the righteousness of Christ and of the grace of
        God; and (c) even the best works of believers are polluted by sin. Moreover, Scripture teaches us
        very clearly that man is justified freely by the grace of God, Rom. 3:24, and that he cannot
        possibly be justified by the works of the law, Rom. 3:28; Gal. 2:16; 3:11.
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        2. Positively, that the ground of justification can be found only in the perfect righteousness of
        Jesus Christ, which is imputed to the sinner in justification. This is plainly taught in several
        passages of Scripture, such as Rom. 3:24; 5:9,19; 8:1; 10:4; I Cor. 1:30; 6:11; II Cor. 5:21; Phil.
        3:9. In the passive obedience of Christ, who became a curse for us (Gal. 3:13) we find the ground
        for the forgiveness of sins; and in His active obedience, by which He merited all the gifts of
        grace, including eternal life, the ground for the adoption of children, by which sinners are
        constituted heirs of life eternal. The Arminian goes contrary to Scripture when he maintains that
        we are accepted in favor by God only on the ground of our faith or evangelical obedience.</p>


      <p id="tb-8" class="tab">
        <a href="#tbref-8">H. OBJECTIONS TO THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION.</a>
      </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Modern liberal theology, with its rationalizing tendencies, raises several objections to the
        doctrine of justification as such, which deserve brief consideration.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        1. Some, who still believe in salvation by grace, ostensibly object to justification in the interest of
        the recognition of the grace of God. Justification, it is said, is a legal transaction and as such
        excludes grace, while the Bible clearly teaches that the sinner is saved by grace. But it can easily
        be shown that justification with all its antecedents and consequents is a gracious work of God.
        The substitute allowed for guilty sinners, the vicarious sufferings and obedience of Christ, the
        imputation of His righteousness to unworthy transgressors, and God’s dealing with believers as
        righteous, — it is all free grace from start to finish.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        2. Justification is sometimes called an impious procedure, because it declares sinners to be
        righteous contrary to fact. But this objection does not hold, because the divine declaration is not
        to the effect that these sinners are righteous in themselves, but that they are clothed with the
        perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ. This righteousness wrought by Christ, is freely imputed to
        them. It is not the personal subjective righteousness of Christ, but His vicarious covenant
        righteousness, that is imputed to those who are in themselves unrighteous, and all to the glory of
        God.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        3. It is often said this doctrine is ethically subversive, because it leads to licentiousness. But
        there is no truth in this whatsoever, as even the lives of the justified clearly show. In justification
        the sure foundation is laid for that vital spiritual union with Christ which secures our
        sanctification. It really leads right on to the only conditions under which we can be truly holy in
        principle. The man who is justified also receives the spirit of sanctification, and is the only one

        <a href="#tbref-9">I. DIVERGENT VIEWS OF JUSTIFICATION.</a>
      </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        1. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC VIEW. The Roman Catholic view confounds justification and
        sanctification. It includes the following elements in justification (a) the expulsion of indwelling
        sin; (b) the positive infusion of divine grace; and (c) the forgiveness of sins. The sinner is
        prepared for justification by prevenient grace, without any merits on his part. This prevenient
        grace leads the sinner to a fides informis, to conviction of sin, to repentance, to a confident
        reliance on the grace of God in Christ, to the beginnings of a new life, and to a desire for
        baptism. Justification really consists in the infusion of new virtues after the pollution of sin has
        been removed in baptism. After the expulsion of indwelling sin, the forgiveness of sin or the
        removal of the guilt of sin necessarily follows. And after that the Christian advances from virtue

        to virtue, is able to perform meritorious works, and receives as a reward a greater measure of
        grace and a more perfect justification. The grace of justification can be lost, but can also be
        restored by the sacrament of penance.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        2. THE VIEW OF PISCATOR. Piscator taught that only the passive obedience of Christ is
        imputed to the sinner in justification, unto the forgiveness of sins; and that His active obedience
        could not possibly be imputed to him, unto the adoption of children and an eternal inheritance,
        because the man Christ Jesus owed this to God for Himself. Moreover, if Christ had fulfilled the
        law for us, we could no more be held responsible for the keeping of the law. Piscator regarded
        the bearing of the penalty of sin and the keeping of the law as alternatives, of which the one
        excludes the other. He left the door open for regarding the sinner’s own personal obedience as
        the only ground of his future hope. This view is very much like that of the Arminians, and is
        quite in line with the doctrine of Anselm in the Middle Ages.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        3. THE VIEW OF OSIANDER. Osiander revealed a tendency to revive in the Lutheran Church
        the essentials of the Roman Catholic conception of justification, though with a characteristic
        difference. He asserted that justification does not consist in the imputation of the vicarious
        righteousness of Christ to the sinner, but in the implanting of a new principle of life. According
        to him the righteousness by which we are justified is the eternal righteousness of God the
        Father, which is imparted to or infused into us by His Son Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        4. THE ARMINIAN VIEW. The Arminians hold that Christ did not render strict satisfaction to
        the justice of God, but yet offered a real propitiation for sin, which was graciously accepted and
        acted on as satisfactory by God in pardoning sin and thus justifying the sinner. While this only
        squares past accounts, God also makes provision for the future. He just as graciously imputes
        the believer’s faith to him for righteousness, that faith, namely, as including the entire religious
        life of the believer, — his evangelical obedience. On this view faith is no more the mere
        instrument of the positive element of justification, but the graciously admitted ground on which
        it rests. Justification, then, is not a judicial but a sovereign act of God.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        5. THE BARTHIAN VIEW. While Barth does speak of justification as a momentary act, yet he
        does not regard it as an act accomplished once for all, and which is then followed by
        sanctification. According to him justification and sanctification go hand in hand all along the
        line. Pauck says that according to Barth justification is not a growth or an ethical development;
        it occurs ever anew, whenever man has reached the point of complete despair as to the beliefs
        and values upon which he has built his life. Thurneysen also rejects the view that justification
        takes place once for all, calls it the view of Pietism, and claims that it is fatal to the doctrine of
        the Reformation.</p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: What does the verb dikaio-o mean in classical Greek? Is
        justification a creative or a declarative act? Is it possible to think of justification with respect to
        past sins in any other sense than that of a judicial acquittal? Should justification be thought of
        exclusively as something objective and external to man? What is meant in theology by the
        formal cause of justification? How do the Romanists and Protestants differ on this point? Is the
        justification of the Roman Catholics by the fides formata really a justification by faith, or a
        justification by love under the guise of faith? What is the Antinomian doctrine of justification
        from eternity? Is the distinction made by Buchanan and Cunningham between active and
        passive justification as being actual and declarative justification correct or not? Can we say that

        in declarative justification (passive justification) God simply declares the sinner to be what he
        is? What becomes of the doctrine of justification in Schleiermacher, Ritchl, and modern liberal
        theology?</p>
