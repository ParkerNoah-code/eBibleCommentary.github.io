          <span class="tab"></span> <b>1.</b> Those whom God effectually calls,
          he also freely justifies,<sup>1</sup> not by infusing righteousness
          into them, but by pardoning their sins, and by accounting and
          accepting their persons as righteous;<sup>2</sup> not for anything
          wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ's sake alone;<sup
            >3</sup
          >
          not by imputing faith itself, the act of believing, or any other
          evangelical obedience to them, as their righteousness; but by imputing
          Christ's active obedience unto the whole law, and passive obedience in
          his death for their whole and sole righteousness by faith,<sup>4</sup>
          which faith they have not of themselves; it is the gift of God.<sup
            >5</sup
          >
          (<sup>1</sup>Rom 3:24, 8:30; <sup>2</sup>Rom 4:5-8, Eph 1:7;
          <sup>3</sup>1Cor 1:30-31, Rom 5:17-19; <sup>4</sup>Phil 3:8-9; Eph
          2:8-10; <sup>5</sup>Jhn 1:12, Rom 5:17;)
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> <b>2.</b> Faith thus receiving and resting
          on Christ and his righteousness, is the alone instrument of
          justification;<sup>6</sup> yet is not alone in the person justified,
          but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead
          faith, but works by love.<sup>7</sup> (<sup>6</sup> Rom 3:28;
          <sup>7</sup> Gal 5:6, James 2:17, 22, 26;)
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> <b>3.</b> Christ, by his obedience and
          death, did fully discharge the debt of all those who are justified;
          and did, by the sacrifice of himself in the blood of his cross,
          undergoing in their stead the penalty due to them, make a proper,
          real, and full satisfaction to God's justice in their behalf;<sup
            >8</sup
          >
          yet, in as much as he was given by the Father for them, and his
          obedience and satisfaction accepted in their stead, and both freely,
          not for anything in them,<sup>9</sup> their justification is only of
          free grace, that both the exact justice and rich grace of God might be
          glorified in the justification of sinners.<sup>10</sup>
          (<sup>8</sup>Heb 10:14, 1 Pet 1:18-19, Isaiah 53:5-6; <sup>9</sup>Rom
          8:32, 2 Cor 5:21; <sup>10</sup>Rom 3:26, Eph 1:6-7, 2:7;)
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> <b>4.</b> God did from all eternity decree
          to justify all the elect,<sup>11</sup> and Christ did in the fullness
          of time die for their sins, and rise again for their
          justification;<sup>12</sup> nevertheless, they are not justified
          personally, until the Holy Spirit in time does actually apply Christ
          to them.<sup>13</sup> (<sup>11</sup>Gal 3:8, 1 Pet 1:2, 1 Tim 2:6;
          <sup>12</sup>Rom 4:25; <sup>13</sup>Col 1:21-22, Titus 3:4-7;)
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> <b>5.</b> God continues to forgive the sins
          of those that are justified,<sup>14</sup> and although they can never
          fall from the state of justification,<sup>15</sup> yet they may, by
          their sins, fall under God's fatherly displeasure;<sup>16</sup> and in
          that condition they usually do not have the light of his countenance
          restored to them, until they humble themselves, beg pardon, and renew
          their faith and repentance.<sup>17</sup> (<sup>14</sup>Mat 6:12, 1 Jhn
          1:7, 9; <sup>15</sup>Jhn 10:28; <sup>16</sup>Ps 89:31-33;
          <sup>17</sup>Ps 32:5, Ps 51, Mat 26:75;)
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> <b>6.</b> The justification of believers
          under the Old Testament was, in all these respects, one and the same
          with the justification of believers under the New Testament.<sup
