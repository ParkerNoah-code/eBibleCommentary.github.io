        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>DEFINITION</h2>
        <p>
          Justification is a judicial act of God, in which He declares, on the
          basis of the righteousness of Jesus Christ, that all the claims of the
          law are satisfied with respect to the sinner. It is unique in the
          application of the work of redemption in that it is a judicial act of
          God, a declaration respecting the sinner, and not an act or process of
          renewal, such as regeneration, conversion, and sanctification. While
          it has respect to the sinner, it does not change his inner life. It
          does not affect his condition, but his state, and in that respect
          differs from all the other principal parts of the order of salvation.
          It involves the forgiveness of sins, and restoration to divine favor.
        </p>
        <h2>THE WORD</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Old Testament:</b> Hitsdik. This is the Hebrew term for “to
          justify” which, in the great majority of cases, means “to declare
          judicially that one’s state is in harmony with the demands of the law
          (Ex 23:7; Deut 25:1; Prov 17:15; Isa 5:23). The
          <em>piel tsiddek</em> occasionally has the same meaning (Jer 3:11;
          Ezek 16:50,51). The meaning of these words is therefore strictly
          forensic or legal. Since Roman Catholics, such representatives of the
          moral influence theory of the atonement as John Young of Edinburgh and
          Horace Bushnell, and also the Unitarians and modern liberal
          theologians, deny the legal meaning of the term “to justify,” and
          ascribe to it the moral sense of “to make just or righteous,” it
          becomes important to take careful notice of the considerations that
          may be urged in favor of the legal meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          That this is the proper denotation of the word appears (a) from the
          terms placed in contrast with it, as, for instance “condemnation,”
          (Deut 25:1; Prov 17:15; Isa 5:23); (b) from the correlative terms
          placed in juxtaposition with it and which often imply a process of
          judgment (Gen 18:25; Ps 143:2); (c) from the equivalent expressions
          that are sometimes used (Gen 15:6; Ps 32:1,2); and (d) from the fact
          that a passage like Prov 17:15 would yield an impossible sense, if the
          word meant “to make just.” The meaning would then be: He who morally
          improves the life of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord. There
          are a couple of passages, however, in which the word means more than
          simply “to declare righteous,” namely, Isa 53:11; Dan 12:3. But even
          in these cases the sense is not “to make good or holy,” but rather “to
          alter the condition so that man can be considered righteous.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>New Testament:</b> Dikaio-o. This verb means in general “to declare
          a person to be just. Occasionally it refers to a personal declaration
          that one’s moral character is in conformity with the law (Mat 12:37;
          Lk 7:29; Rom 3:4). In the Epistles of Paul the soteriological meaning
          of the term is clearly in the foreground. It is “to declare
          forensically that the demands of the law as a condition of life are
          fully satisfied with regard to a person (Acts 13:39; Rom 5:1,9;
          8:30-33; I Cor 6:11; Gal 2:16; 3:11). In the case of this word, just
          as in that of <em>hitsdik</em>, the forensic meaning of the term is
          proved by the following facts: (a) in many instances it can bear no
          other sense (Rom 3:20-28; 4:5-7; 5:1; Gal 2:16; 3:11; 5:4;) (b) it is
          placed in antithetic relation to “condemnation” in Rom. 8:33,34; (c)
          equivalent and interchangeable expressions convey a judicial or legal
          idea (Jn 3:18; 5:24; Rom 4:6,7; II Cor 5:19); and (d) if it does not
          bear this meaning, there is no distinction between justification and
          sanctification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dikaios. This word, connected with the verb just discussed, is
          peculiar in that it never expresses what a thing is in itself, but
          always what it is in relation to something else, to some standard
          outside of it, to which it ought to correspond. In that respect it
          differs from agathos. In classical Greek, for instance, dikaios is
          applied to a wagon, a horse, or something else to indicate that it is
          fit for its intended use. Agathos expresses the idea that a thing in
          itself answers to the ideal. In Scripture a man is called
          <em>dikaios</em>
          when, in the judgment of God, his relation to the law is what it ought
          to be, or when his life is such as is required by his judicial
          relation to God. This may include the idea that he is good, but only
          from a certain point of view, namely, that of his judicial relation to
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dikaiosis. The word for justification. This is found in only two
          places in the New Testament, namely, Rom 4:25; 5:18. It denotes the
          act of God’s declaring men free from guilt and acceptable to Him. The
          resulting state is denoted by the word dikaiosune.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Conclusion:</b> The resulting idea of justification then, in the
          Scriptural sense of the word, is to effect an objective relation, the
          state of righteousness, by a judicial sentence. This can be done in a
          twofold way: (a) by bringing into account the actual subjective
          condition of a person (to justify the just or the righteous), James
          2:21; or (b) by imputing to a person the righteousness of another,
          that is, by accounting him righteous though he is inwardly
          unrighteous. The latter is the usual sense of justification in the New
          Testament and the meaning here.
        </p>
        <h2>GROUND</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Negatively:</b> This cannot be found in any virtue of man, nor in
          his good works. This position must also be maintained at present over
          against Rome and the Pelagianizing tendencies of various Churches.
          Rome teaches that the sinner is justified on the basis of the inherent
          righteousness that has been infused into his heart, and which, in
          turn, is the fruit of the co-operation of the human will with
          prevenient grace. This applies to what is called the first
          justification; in all following justification the good works of man
          come into consideration as the formal cause or ground of
          justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is impossible, however, that the inherent righteousness of the
          regenerate man and his good works should constitute the ground of his
          justification, for (a) this righteousness is and remains during this
          life a very imperfect righteousness; (b) it is itself already the
          fruit of the righteousness of Christ and of the grace of God; and (c)
          even the best works of believers are polluted by sin. Moreover,
          Scripture teaches us very clearly that man is justified freely by the
          grace of God, Rom. 3:24, and that he cannot possibly be justified by
          the works of the law, Rom. 3:28; Gal. 2:16; 3:11.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Positively:</b> The ground of justification can be found only in
          the perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ, which is imputed to the
          sinner in justification. This is plainly taught in several passages of
          Scripture, such as Rom. 3:24; 5:9,19; 8:1; 10:4; I Cor. 1:30; 6:11; II
          Cor. 5:21; Phil. 3:9. In the passive obedience of Christ, who became a
          curse for us (Gal. 3:13) we find the ground for the forgiveness of
          sins; and in His active obedience, by which He merited all the gifts
          of grace, including eternal life, the ground for the adoption of
          children, by which sinners are constituted heirs of life eternal. The
          Arminian goes contrary to Scripture when he maintains that we are
          accepted in favor by God only on the ground of our faith or
          evangelical obedience.
        </p>
        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Early Church:</b> Some of the earliest Church Fathers already speak
          of justification by faith, but it is quite evident that many had no
          clear understanding of it and of its relation to faith. Moreover, they
          did not sharply distinguish between regeneration and justification. A
          rather common representation was that regeneration takes place in
          baptism and includes the forgiveness of sins. Even Augustine does not
          seem to have had an accurate understanding of justification as a legal
          act, as distinguished from the moral process of sanctification, though
          it is quite evident from the whole tenor of his teachings and also
          from separate statements, that he regarded the grace of God in the
          redemption of sinners as free, sovereign, and efficacious, and in no
          way dependent on any merits of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Middle Ages:</b> The confounding of justification and
          sanctification continued into the Middle Ages and gradually acquired a
          more positive and doctrinal aspect. According to the prevailing
          teachings of the Scholastics, justification includes two elements:
          man’s sins are forgiven, and he is made just or righteous. There was a
          difference of opinion as to the logical order of these two elements,
          some reversing the order just indicated. This was also done by Thomas
          Aquinas, and his view became the prevalent one in the Roman Catholic
          Church. Grace is infused in man, whereby he is made just, and partly
          on the basis of this infused grace, his sins are pardoned. This was
          already an approach to the evil doctrine of merit, which was gradually
          developed in the Middle Ages in connection with the doctrine of
          justification. The idea found favor ever-increasingly that man is
          justified in part on the basis of his own good works.
        </p>
        <p>
          The confounding of justification and sanctification also led to
          divergent opinions on another point. Some of the Scholastics speak of
          justification as an instantaneous act of God, while others describe it
          as a process. In the Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent we
          find the following in Chap. XVI, Canon IX: “If any one saith, that by
          faith alone the impious is justified in such wise as to mean, that
          nothing else is required to co-operate in order to the obtaining of
          the grace of justification, and that it is not in any way necessary,
          that he be prepared and disposed by the movement of his own will: let
          him be anathema.” And Canon XXIV speaks of an increase in
          justification and therefore conceives of it as a process: “If any one
          saith, that the justice received is not preserved and also increased
          before God through good works; but that the said works are merely the
          fruits and signs of justification obtained, but not a cause of the
          increase thereof: let him be anathema.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Reformation:</b> The doctrine of justification was the great
          material principle of the Reformation. With respect to the nature of
          justification the Reformers corrected the error of confounding
          justification with sanctification by stressing its legal character and
          representing it as an act of God’s free grace, whereby He pardons our
          sins and accepts us as righteous in His sight, but does not change us
          inwardly. As far as the ground of justification is concerned, they
          rejected the idea of Rome that this lies, at least in part, in the
          inherent righteousness of the regenerate and in good works, and
          substituted for it the doctrine that it is found only in the imputed
          righteousness of the Redeemer. And in connection with the means of
          justification they emphasized the fact that man is justified freely by
          that faith which receives and rests in Christ only for salvation.
          Moreover, they rejected the doctrine of a progressive justification,
          and held that it was instantaneous and complete, and did not depend
          for its completion on some further satisfaction for sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Post-Reformation:</b> The reformers were opposed by the Socinians,
          who held that sinners obtain pardon and acceptance with God, through
          His mercy, on the ground of their own repentance and reformation. The
          Arminians do not all agree on the subject, but in general it may be
          said that they limit the scope of justification, so as to include only
          the forgiveness of sins on the basis of the passive obedience of
          Christ, and to exclude the adoption of the sinner in favor by God or
          the basis of the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ. The sinner is
          accounted righteous only on the basis of his faith or his life of
          obedience. The Neonomians in England were in general agreement with
          them on this point. For Schleiermacher and Ritschl justification meant
          little more than the sinner’s becoming conscious of his mistake in
          thinking that God was angry with him. And in modern liberal theology
          we again meet with the idea that God justifies the sinner by the moral
          improvement of his life. This conception of it is found, for instance,
          in Bushnell’s Vicarious Sacrifice and in Macintosh’s Theology as an
          Empirical Science.
