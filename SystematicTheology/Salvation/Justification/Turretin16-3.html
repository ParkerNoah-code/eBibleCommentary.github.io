          THIRD QUESTION
          <br />
          <em
            >Is the righteousness and obedience of Christ imputed to us the
            meritorious cause and foundation of our justification with God? We
            affirm against the Romanists and Socinians.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The false and pretended impelling and meritorious cause of our
          justification (which is placed by the Romanists in inherent
          righteousness) having been rejected, the true and genuine cause must
          now be exhibited from the Scriptures (to wit, the righteousness and
          obedience of Christ imputed to us by God). That the truth and mode of
          this may be the more clearly seen and more strongly retained against
          the cavils of our opponents, the following things must be premised.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >The opinion of the orthodox concerning the imputation of Christ’s
            righteousness.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          II. First, we suppose that justification is a forensic act of God (as
          has already been proved), not as a creditor and a private person, but
          as a ruler and Judge giving sentence concerning us at his bar. (2)
          Justification is the act not of a subordinate Judge, who is bound to
          the formula of the law, but of a supreme magistrate and prince, to
          whom alone belongs, in virtue of his autocratic (autokratoriko) right,
          the showing of favor to the guilty and the relaxation of the rigor of
          established laws. (3) That God does not here sit on the throne of
          justice that he may act according to the strict justice of the law
          (kata to akribodikaion nomou), but on the throne of grace that he may
          act according to the gospel forbearance (epieikeian). (4) That he so
          acts from mercy as not to do injury to his justice, which (since it
          cannot suffer his laws to be violated with impunity and sin to go
          unpunished) necessarily requires some satisfaction (lytron) to be made
          to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Hence it follows (5) that God cannot show favor to, nor justify
          anyone without a perfect righteousness. For since the judgment of God
          is according to truth, he cannot pronounce anyone just who is not
          really just. However, since no mortal after sin has such a
          righteousness in himself (nay, by sin he has been made a child of
          wrath and become exposed to death), it must be sought out of us in
          another, by the intervention of which man (sinful and wicked) may be
          justified without personal righteousness. Human courts often justify
          the guilty, either through ignorance (when the wickedness is not known
          and lies concealed) or by injury (when it is not attended to) or by
          iniquity (when it is approved). But in the divine court (in which we
          deal with the most just Judge, who neither holds the guilty as
          innocent, nor the innocent as guilty) this cannot occur. Therefore he
          who is destitute of personal righteousness ought to have another’s, by
          which to be justified. For although God (as the supreme arbiter of
          affairs and the sovereign Lord of all) has the power to remit the
          punishment of sinners, still he cannot (because he is most just) thus
          favor the sinner, unless a satisfaction is first made by which both
          his justice may be satisfied and punishment taken of sin. Since this
          could not come from us who are guilty, it was to be sought in another,
          who (constituted a surety in our place by receiving upon himself the
          punishment due to us) might bestow the righteousness (dikaiOma) of
          which we were destitute.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The gospel teaches that what could not be found in us and was to
          be sought in another, could be found nowhere else than in Christ, the
          God-man (theanthropo); who taking upon himself the office of surety
          most fully satisfied the justice of God by his perfect obedience and
          thus brought to us an everlasting righteousness by which alone we can
          be justified before God; in order that covered and clothed with that
          garment as though it were of our first-born (like Jacob), we may
          obtain under it the eternal blessing of our heavenly Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Further, as long as Christ is outside of us and we are out of
          Christ, we can receive no fruit from another’s righteousness. God
          willed to unite us to Christ by a twofold bond—one natural, the other
          mystical—in virtue of which both our evils might be transferred to
          Christ and the blessings of Christ pass over to us and become ours.
          The former is the communion of nature by the incarnation. By this,
          Christ, having assumed our flesh, became our brother and true Goel and
          could receive our sins upon himself and have the right to redeem us.
          The latter is the communion of grace by mediation. By this, having
          been made by God a surety for us and given to us for a head, he can
          communicate to us his righteousness and all his benefits. Hence it
          happens that as he was made of God sin for us by the imputation of our
          sins, so in turn we are made the righteousness of God in him by the
          imputation of his obedience (2 Cor. 5:21).
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Just as Christ sustains a twofold relation (schesin) to us of
          surety and head (of surety, to take away the guilt of sin by a payment
          made for it; of head, to take away its power and corruption by the
          efficacy of the Spirit), so in a twofold way Christ imparts his
          blessings to us, by a forensic imputation, and a moral and internal
          infusion. The former flows from Christ as surety and is the foundation
          of our justification. The latter depends upon him as head, and is the
          principle of sanctification. For on this account, God justifies us
          because the righteousness of our surety, Christ, is imputed to us. And
          on this account we are renewed because we derive the Spirit from our
          head, Christ, who renews us after the image of Christ and bestows upon
          us inherent righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. However, because we treat here of the imputed righteousness of
          Christ, we must remark further that the word “impute” (which is in
          Hebrew chshbh; in Greek logizesthai or ellogein) can be taken in two
          ways, either properly or improperly. That is said to be imputed to
          anyone improperly which he himself has done or has, when on that
          account a reward or punishment is decreed to him. As sin is said “to
          be imputed” to the wicked (2 S. 19:19), when the reward of iniquity is
          imputed to them; and the judgment exercised by Phinehas “was counted
          unto him for righteousness” (Ps. 106:31), i.e., it was pleasing to God
          and gained for him the praise of holy zeal and the covenant of a
          perpetual priesthood. Properly is to hold him who has not done a
          thing, as if he had done it. In turn not to impute is to hold him who
          has done a thing as if he had not done it; as Paul desires the fault
          of Onesimus to be imputed to him (which he himself had not committed,
          Philem. 18) and asks that the fault should not be laid to the charge
          of those who forsook him (which they had committed, 2 Tim. 4:16). From
          this twofold acceptation of the word, a twofold imputation arises
          (about which Paul speaks)—of grace (kata charin) and of debt (kat’
          opheiléma): “Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of
          grace, but of debt. But to him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith
          is counted for righteousness” (Rom. 4:4, 5), viz., of grace. For the
          foundation of imputation is either in the merit and dignity of the
          person, to whom a thing is imputed; or it is out of it in the grace
          and mercy alone of the one imputing. The first is the legal mode, the
          other is the evangelical. Hence we gather that this word is forensic.
          It is not to be understood physically of an infusion of righteousness,
          but judicially and relatively, of gratuitous acceptance in the
          judgment of God (which also appears from the force of the word
          logizesthai and ellogein, which is drawn from accountants).
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. But here we must accurately distinguish between imputed and
          putative or fictitious in order to meet the calumny of our opponents
          who traduce this imputation as a mere fiction of the mind about a
          thing not existing. For it is a thing no less real in its own order
          (to wit, judicial and forensic) than infusion in a moral or physical
          order; as the imputation of a payment made by a surety to the debtor
          is in the highest degree real (to wit, by which he is freed from the
          debt and delivered from the right which the creditor had over him).
          Hence it is evident that this judicial act of God does not lack truth
          because he does not pronounce us righteous in ourselves (which would
          be false), but in Christ (which is perfectly true); nor does it lack
          justice because there is granted a communion between us and Christ,
          which is the solid foundation of this imputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Therefore when we say that the righteousness of Christ is imputed
          to us for justification and that we are just before God through
          imputed righteousness and not through any righteousness inherent in
          us, we mean nothing else than that the obedience of Christ rendered in
          our name to God the Father is so given to us by God that it is
          reckoned to be truly ours and that it is the sole and only
          righteousness on account of and by the merit of which we are absolved
          from the guilt of our sins and obtain a right to life; and that there
          is in us no righteouness or good works by which we can deserve such
          great benefits which can bear the severe examination of the divine
          court, if God willed to deal with us according to the rigor of his
          law; that we can oppose nothing to it except the merit and
          satisfaction of Christ, in which alone, terrified by the consciousness
          of sin, we can find a safe refuge against the divine wrath and peace
          for our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Now although we hold that there is nothing in us which can be
          opposed at the bar of God for justification, still one would
          improperly conclude from this what our opponents falsely and
          slanderously charge upon us—that we recognize no inherent
          righteousness in believers and by reason of which they are truly
          reckoned righteous and holy with God. Thus that we teach that
          believers always remain wicked and unjust in themselves, and that the
          righteousness of Christ is imputed to us solely to cover our sins and
          not to take them away. Hence they take occasion to traduce our
          doctrine concerning the imputation of Christ’s righteousness as
          impious and execrable. As we just now said, however, we hold these two
          benefits to be inseparable: that no one is justified by Christ who is
          not also sanctified and gifted with inherent righteousness (from which
          believers can truly be denominated holy and righteous although not
          perfectly in this life).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Statement of the question.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. From these principles, the state of the question can be readily
          gathered. First, against the Socinians it is inquired, Are the
          righteousness, obedience and satisfaction of Christ imputed to us for
          righteousness? For as they deny that the obedience and satisfaction of
          Christ were rendered for us, so they reject the imputation and
          application of that obedience and satisfaction and explode it as a
          human invention (Socinus, “Tractatus de Justificatione,” Opera omnia
          [1656], 1:601—27; Ostorodt, Unterrichtung ... hauptpuncten der
          Christlichen Religion 36, 37 [1612], pp. 294-328; Smalcius, “De
          Justificatione,” Refutatio Thesium D. Wolfgangi Frantzii, Disp. TV
          [1614], pp. 91-154). The orthodox, however, think the obedience and
          satisfaction of Christ are imputed to us for righteousness inasmuch as
          they are reckoned ours by the gratuitous mercy of God and on account
          of them we are absolved from sin in God’s court and pronounced just.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>And with the Romanists.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. But against the Romanists, the question is not: (1) Is the
          righteousness of Christ the formal cause of our justification (i.e.,
          is it the form by which man is constituted just inherently, as the
          Romanists understand it describing justification by the infusion of
          righteousness)? For since we have already proved that it is a
          forensic, not a physical act, the question regarding the internal
          formal cause is fruitless (which pertains to the blessing of
          sanctification). Rather the question concerns the meritorious and
          impulsive cause of the divine judgment or our absolving sentence. Not,
          Is the righteousness of Christ our formal and inherent righteousness
          subjectively? But, Is our righteousness real and sufficient
          imputatively, by which, if we are not formally righteous by inherent
          righteousness, still we are formally justified by the imputation of
          it, so that apart from it there is no other material of our
          righteousness before God?
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. (2) The question is not Is the righteousness and merit of Christ
          imputed to us? For this the Romanists do not dare to deny. The Council
          of Trent says, “Christ by his most holy suffering on the cross merited
          justification for us, and satisfied God, the Father for us, and no one
          can be just, unless he to whom the merits of the suffering of our Lord
          Jesus Christ are communicated” (Session 6.7*, Schroeder, p. 33). Hence
          Vasquez says, “We grant there are imputed to us for a certain effect,
          not only those things that are in us, as sin, faith and righteousness,
          but also some things that are without us, as the merit and obedience
          of Christ, because not only the things that are in us, but also those
          without, in view of which something is given to us are said to be
          reckoned among our things for some effect, as if they were truly ours”
          (Commentariorum ac Disputationum in primam secundce ... Thomae, II,
          Disp. 222.1 [1631], p. 637). Bellarmine also acknowledges this: “Tf
          the Protestants mean only this that the merits of Christ are imputed
          to us because they are given to us of God, and we can offer them to
          the Father for our sins, since Christ undertook the burden of
          satisfying for us, and reconciling us to God, the Father, their
          opinion is correct” (“De Justificatione,” 2.7 Opera [1858], 4:518).
          And yet we mean nothing else; for what he adds (“that we wish the
          righteousness of Christ to be so imputed to us that by it we are
          called, and are formally righteous,” ibid.), he supposes falsely and
          gratuitously from his perverse and preposterous hypothesis concerning
          moral justification. But the question is To what is that imputation
          made? To justification and life, as we maintain; or only to the
          infusion of internal grace and inherent righteousness, as they hold?
          That is, are the merits of Christ so imputed and communicated to us as
          to be the sole meritorious cause of our justification and that there
          is no other righteousness on account of which we are acquitted in the
          sight of God (which we contend for); or are they so imputed as to be
          the conditions of a formal cause that is of inherent righteousness, so
          that man can be gifted with it; or of an extrinsic cause which
          deserves the infusion of righteousness by which man is justified, so
          that not the merit of Christ properly, but inherent righteousness
          acquired by the merit of Christ is the proper and true cause on
          account of which man is justified (which they maintain)? They so limit
          the benefit of the imputation of Christ’s merits to obtaining the
          effect of infused grace that this imputation is made for no other end
          than to merit for us infused grace, in virtue of which we obey the law
          and, being righteous in ourselves, are justified; as Vasquez, in the
          passage cited, observes—cf. Commentariorum ac Disputationum in primam
          secundae ... Thomae, Il, Disp. 222.3 [1631], pp. 639-42). Hence
          Bonaventure denies that the causality of justification or of the
          remission of sins properly belongs to the death or resurrection of
          Christ, but only “by way of intervening merit,” which is reduced to
          the material cause, while he determines the formal cause to be infused
          love (“Liber III. Sententiarum,” Dist. 19, Art. 1, Q. 1 in Opera
          Theologica Selecta [1941], 3:392—94). From these it is evident that
          the question here is Are the righteousness and satisfaction of Christ
          so imputed to us by God as to be the only foundation and meritorious
          cause in view of which alone we are acquitted before God of our sins
          and obtain a right to life? Our opponents deny; we affirm.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. However, there is no need to remark that by the righteousness of
          Christ we do not understand here the “essential righteousness of God”
          dwelling in us (as Osiander with Schwenkfeld dreamed, opposing himself
          to Stancar his colleague, who acknowledged Christ as Mediator only
          according to his human nature—which error was exploded and perished
          with its author). That righteouness could not be communicated to us
          subjectively and formally which is an essential attribute of God
          without our becoming gods also. And the Scripture everywhere refers
          the righteousness of Christ, which is imputed to us, to the obedience
          of his life and the suffering of his death, by which he answered the
          demands of the law and perfectly fulfilled it. If we had need of an
          infinite righteousness, it should not be such in essence, but only in
          value and merit. If Christ is Jehovah, our righteousness, and if he is
          made to us righteousness by the Father, this is not said with respect
          to essential righteousness, but to the obedience which is imputed to
          us for righteousness. This is called the righteousness of God because
          it belongs to divine person and so is of infinite value and is highly
          pleasing and acceptable to God. By this righteousness then, we
          understand the entire obedience of Christ—of his life as well as of
          his death, active as well as passive (as we have already proved, Topic
          XIV, Question 13).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Imputed righteousness is proved: (1) from Rom. 5:18, 19.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. Now that this righteousness of Christ is the foundation and
          meritorious cause of our justification, we prove: (1) because by the
          righteousness and obedience of one, Christ, we are consitituted
          righteous—“As by the offense of one” (supply “guilt”) “came upon all
          men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one” (di’ henos
          dikaidmatos) (supply “the blessing redounded”) “upon all men unto
          justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made
          sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous”
          (Rom. 5:18, 19). Here it is clear that the one transgression (hen
          paraptoma) is opposed to the one righteousness (heni dikaiOmati) and
          the disobedience of one man (by which men are constituted sinners and
          guilty before God by the imputation of that sin) is opposed to the
          obedience of one, Christ, by which the elect are constituted righteous
          (i.e., are justified before God; not assuredly by inhesion, but by
          imputation). (a) The act of one cannot be made the act of many, except
          by imputation. (b) The righteousness (dikaidma) upon which
          justification of life (dikaidsis z0és) rests, demands a perfect and
          absolute righteousness (which cannot be said of inherent
          righteousness). (c) The condemnation (katakrima) to which the
          justification of life (dikaidsis zoés) is opposed, is not a physical,
          but a forensic and judicial act. In vain does Bellarmine maintain that
          the obedience of Christ is indeed the efficient but not the formal
          cause of justification, as the disobedience of Adam constituted us
          sinners, not formally but efficiently. We are not treating of an
          infusion of righteousness or of renovation (as we have just said), but
          of a juridical constitution which cannot take place except by
          imputation (since it is of another’s, not of a personal
          righteousness). Again, Bellarmine himself testifies the contrary when
          he says, “The sin of Adam is so imputed to his posterity, as if we had
          all committed the same sin” (“De amissione gratiae,” 4.10 Opera
          [1858], 4:160). And: “The sin of Adam is communicated to us in the
          manner in which what passes over can be communicated, to wit, by
          imputation; for it is imputed to all who are born of Adam” (ibid.,
          5.17, p. 227). Nor if we are constitued unrighteous and guilty by sin
          propagated from Adam, ought we at once to be justified by inherent
          righteousness communicated to us through regeneration by Christ
          because there is a very different reason for each. And Paul here
          institutes the comparison between the first and second Adam in the
          thing and not as to the manner of the thing.

          XVI. Second, faith is said to be imputed to us for righteousness.
          “Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness”
          (Rom. 4:3); not the faith itself or the act of believing formally, as
          if it were righteousness with God (as the Remonstrants hold, against
          whom we will dispute hereafter) because thus justification would not
          be without works, since faith itself is a work; but objectively and
          relative to the righteousness of Christ, which faith apprehends and
          applies to itself. The apostle calls this “the righteousness of faith
          which is through the faith of Christ” (Phil. 3:9) “in which alone he
          wishes to be found” (viz., at the bar of God). For it is to be sought
          nowhere else than in Christ, who is Jehovah our righteousness, and who
          of God is made unto us righteousness. It is confirmed by this—that
          Paul in the same place explains the imputation of faith for
          righteousness by “the imputation of righteousness without works” (Rom.
          4:6). Hence it is surely evident: (a) that justification consists in
          the imputation of righteousness, that no one may suppose this phrase
          was invented by us; (b) that this righteousness cannot be inherent,
          given to us by infusion, both because it is said to be without works
          and because what is inherent is opposed to what is imputed. On that
          account, it is opposed by Paul to his own righteousness which is of
          the law (Phil. 3:9) and is elsewhere called “the righteousness of
          God,” which is manifested without the law (Rom. 3:21, 22). This is so
          because it is subjectively in a divine person and so of infinite
          value; and originally because it is from God, since it is given to us
          freely by God; and terminatively because it leads to God and is
          approved by him and can alone sustain the examination of his judgment.
          Therefore whoever by faith applies that righteousness to himself is
          said not to come into judgment, but to have already passed from death
          to life (Jn. 5:24), i.e., to be justified.

        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. Third, Christ is the righteousness by which we are justified.
          For on this account he is said to “be made of God unto us
          righteousness” (1 Cor. 1:30) and we are said to be made the
          righteousness of God in him: “God hath made him to be sin for us, who
          knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him” (2
          Cor. 5:21). From this it is evident: (a) that Christ is our
          righteousness before God, not surely inherently (because the
          righteousness of one cannot pass over into another), but imputatively;
          (b) we are made the righteousness of God in him, just as he is made
          sin for us. Now Christ was made sin for us, not inherently or
          subjectively (because he knew no sin), but imputatively (because God
          imputed to him our sins and made the iniquities of us all to meet on
          him, Is. 53:6). Therefore, we also are made righteousness, not by
          infusion, but by imputation. Augustine well expresses this: “He,
          therefore, was sin, that we might be righteousness, nor ours, but
          God’s, nor in us, but in him, as he demonstrated sin, not his own, but
          ours, nor in himself, but in us constituted in the likeness of sinful
          flesh, in which he was crucified” (Enchiridion 13 [41] [FC 2:406—7; PL
          40.253]). The objection is fruitless that “Christ is said to have been
          made righteousness, as he was made wisdom and sanctification, not
          surely imputatively, but effectively.” For even if he was equally made
          to us of God all these as to merit because he acquired all these
          blessings for us, still he was not made in the same manner as to
          bestowal, but diversely according to the diversity of the gifts (even
          the nature of the thing demands this). For if he was made
          righteousness in no other way than sanctification (i.e., effectively),
          Paul would be guilty of tautology, since in this way justification and
          sanctification would not differ. Therefore he is made wisdom and
          sanctification to us effectively by illuminating and regenerating us;
          but righteousness imputatively by imputing to us his righteousness.
          Bellarmine cannot deny this when he says that Christ can rightly be
          said to be made righteousness meritoriously “because he satisfied the
          Father for us, and gives and communicates that satisfaction to us,
          when he justifies us, so that he can be called our satisifaction and
          righteousness, as if we ourselves had satisfied God” (“De
          Justificatione,” 2.10 Opera [1858], 4:523). This he confirms on 2 Cor.
          5:21: “The righteousness of Christ is imputed to us as to the
          satisfaction, which he made for us” (ibid., p. 524). Nor can that
          which our opponent adds in the same place help his cause when he says:
          “But not on this account can we be reckoned righteous, if the stains
          and corruption of sins truly inhere in us” (ibid.). For if the
          righteousness of Christ is imputed to us (as he had already
          confessed), then certainly we are considered righteous in him; for no
          one imputes righteousness to him whom he does not count righteous. And
          if the satisfaction of Christ is imputed to us, then our debts for
          which he satisfied are not imputed, but are remitted. Falsely also he
          holds “that the righteousness inhering in us is here called the
          righteousness of God because it is given to us of God; or also because
          it is the image and effect of the righteousness of God” (ibid.). For
          the little clause “in him” stands in the way; for how could it be said
          to be in Christ, if it was in us? Contarini acknowledges this: “The
          righteousness of God in him, since his righteousness is made ours, is
          given and imputed to us” (cf. “De Justificatione,” Casparis Contareni
          Cardinalis Opera [1571], p. 592).

          <b>4. From the suretyship of Christ.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. Fourth, justification takes place on account of the suretyship
          of Christ and the payment made for us by him—which cannot be done
          without imputation. For as a payment made by a surety for a debtor
          cannot help him except by imputation (inasmuch as the payment made by
          a surety is applied to him as if it had been made by himself), the
          cancelling of the debt follows and the deliverance of the debtor. Thus
          since Christ undertook to be our surety and paid in our place, who
          does not see that the payment made by him and the ransom (lytron)
          given is imputed to us for full absolution (i.e., is considered by God
          as if it had been given by us)? In this sense, we are said to be
          “justified by the death and blood of Christ” (Rom. 5:9) because the
          merit of his obedience and death was that in view of which God was
          reconciled and gave to us the pardon of sin. In the same sense, he is
          said “to have been made a curse and sin for us, that we might be made
          a blessing and righteousness in him” (Gal. 3:13; 2 Cor. 5:21) because
          the curse, and punishment of sin which he received upon himself in our
          stead secures to us blessing and righteousness with God in virtue of
          that most strict union between us and him by which, as our sins are
          imputed to him, so in turn his obedience and righteousness are imputed
          to us. Just as under the law the punishment which the victims suffered
          in the place of sinners was imputed to them for the expiation of sin
          and their liberation.

          <b>5. From Rom. 8:3.</b>

        <p>
          XIX. Fifth, Christ justifies us by that by which he frees us from the
          condemnation of the law and fulfills in us its right to life. “For
          what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God
          sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
          condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be
          fulfilled in us” (namely, our justification by the law having become
          impossible through sin, God restored this benefit to us in Christ).
          Being made like to sinful flesh (yet without sin), he offered himself
          for us as a victim for sin and having made a most full satisfaction
          condemned sin (i.e., perfectly expiated it) in the flesh for this
          end—that the condemnation of sin might give place to our justification
          and the righteousness of the law (to dikaidma nomou) (i.e., the right
          which it has) whether as to obedience or as to punishment is fulfilled
          in us (not inherently, but imputatively); while what Christ did and
          suffered in our place is ascribed to us as if we had done that very
          thing. Thus we are considered in Christ to have fulfilled the whole
          righteousness of the law because in our name he most perfectly
          fulfilled the righteousness of the law as to obedience as well as to
          punishment.

          XX. Sixth, our justification is “a justification of the ungodly but to
          him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the
          ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness” (Rom. 4:5). A
          justification of the ungodly cannot be made by infusion, but by
          imputation. For although he that is justified does not remain wicked,
          but is renewed by the grace of Christ, he cannot be said to be
          justified by that renovation (which is the effect following
          justification, not the cause which precedes it). And faith, by which
          man is justified and is made righteous in Christ, does not prevent him
          from being and being called wicked in himself, inasmuch as he is
          opposed to the one working as he who has nothing upon which he can
          rely before the divine tribunal for his justification and so is
          “ungodly,” partly antecedently, partly with respect to justification;
          not however concomitantly, still less consequently.

          XXI. Various testimonies of the fathers could be gathered together
          here. By their vote, they approve our opinion, but we omit them from a
          desire to be brief. It will be sufficient to quote the words of
          Bernard because he often asserted this saving doctrine with exceeding
          skill: “Another’s righteousness is assigned to him who wanted a
          personal righteousness” (Contra ... Errorum Abelardi Epistola CXC 6.15
          [PL 182.1065]). And a little after: “If one died for all, therefore
          all are dead; that the satisfaction of one might be imputed to all, as
          that one bore the sins of all” (ibid.). And: “My merit then is the
          compassion of the Lord; I am not wholly destitute of merit, as long as
          he is not wanting in mercy” (“Sermon 61 [5],” Song of Solomon [trans.
          S.J. Eales, 1984 rep.], p. 368; PL 183.1073). And a little after:
          “Shall I sing of my righteousness? O Lord, I will make mention of thy
          righteousness alone, which is also mine. Shall I fear that one
          righteousness is not enough for both? It is not a short garment which
          according to the prophet cannot cover two” (ibid.). And: “Not to sin
          is the righteousness of God; the righteousness of man is the
          indulgence of God” (“Sermon 23* [15],” ibid., p. 141; PL 183.892).

          XXII. Christ ought not only to restore the goods lost in Adam, but
          also to remove the evils contracted through Adam. Now there were
          two—guilt and corruption of nature—to which two goods should be
          opposed: the imputation of righteousness to take away guilt before
          God; and a renovation of nature to heal inherent corruption. Again,
          Christ not only restored the lost goods, but in a far more excellent
          way. We lost mutable righteousness, but an immutable righteousness is
          restored to us. We lost only an inherent righteousness and there is
          given us an imputed righteousness with an inherent, without which we
          could not be made partakers of the inherent. Otherwise if nothing was
          restored in Christ than what had been lost in Adam, pardon of sin
          would not be given to us in Christ because it was not lost in Adam.

          XXIII. What is imputed to anyone by a mere gracious acceptation, that
          is not really paid, but is considered as paid; but what is imputed on
          account of a true payment made by another supposes the thing to be
          paid. Now the imputation of the righteousness of Christ (of which we
          speak) is not to be understood in the first sense (the improper sense,
          for an imputation which takes place without any payment at all whether
          of the debtor or of the surety); but is to be understood in the latter
          sense inasmuch as it is founded in another’s payment (that of Christ
          the surety).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIV. Although we are justified by the imputed righteousness of
          Christ, it does not follow that we are no less righteous than Christ
          and are thus considered like Christ, saviors and redeemers of the
          world; and that Christ on account of our unrighteousness imputed to
          him can be called a sinner. The dignity of the head ought always to
          remain his own, that the members may be conformed to the head; but in
          their order and not that they should become the head. Thus although as
          to imputation we are truly righteous in the sight of God, still Christ
          is righteous in a far more perfect manner. We are such relatively in
          him and indeed precariously and dependently; Christ, however, is such
          infinitely, originally, inherently and subjectively. (2) Indeed we can
          (on account of Christ’s righteousness imputed to us) be said to be
          redeemed and saved passively, but not to be redeemers actively because
          he alone can be a Redeemer whose righteousness is imputed to another;
          not he who needs the imputation of another. (3) Christ cannot (on
          account of our sin having been imputed to him) be called a sinner
          (which implies inherent corruption), but only a victim for sin, who
          received on himself the punishment due to sin. Thus guilt was to be
          taken away, not its pollution.

        <p>
          XXV. Where two contrary physical forms and qualities exist under the
          Same genus, there it is certain that the denomination should be made
          from the intrinisic (which affect the subject more), than from the
          extrinsic. Now inherent righteousness and imputed righteousness are
          not under the same genus. The former indeed is in the class of
          relation, but the latter is under the class of quality. Thus nothing
          is to hinder the subject from being denominated from both under a
          different respect (schesei). For when the inherent quality is
          regarded, he is said to be a sinner and wicked; but when the external
          and forensic relation is considered, he is said to be righteous in
          Christ. It is indeed true that no one can be called righteous
          inherently by another’s righteousness because if it is inherent, it is
          no longer another’s. But still he can be said to be justified
          imputatively, since every day among men a debtor (on account of the
          payment made by a surety) is said to be free and discharged. Augustine
          beautifully explains this: “It is surely just, that they whom the
          devil held as debtors, should be discharged believing in him whom he
          killed without any debt” (The Trinity 13*.14 [FC 45:395; PL 42.1028]).
          Hence it is evident that the example of the Ethiopian adduced by
          Bellarmine (who is to be denominated rather from the blackness of his
          body than from the whiteness of his garments) is improper
          (aprosdionyson) since we are not speaking here of an inherent quality
          or of an adhering garment, but of a juridical relation given to him by
          the Judge. Besides, the Ethiopian always remains an Ethiopian in the
          same manner; yet the believer does not remain wicked, but is
          converted.

          XXVI. Although God justifies us on account of the imputed
          righteousness of Christ, his judgment does not cease to be according
          to truth because he does not pronounce us righteous in ourselves
          subjectively (which would be false), but in another imputatively and
          relatively (which is perfectly true). Thus God truly estimates the
          thing and judges it as it is; not in itself and in its own nature, but
          in Christ.

          XXVII. The spouse is said to be “all fair” (Cant. 4:7) in two ways:
          (1) in her head and husband imputatively, when all her pollutions are
          so covered by his righteousness that there is no more condemnation in
          her; nor does God see in her anything as to practical and penal
          knowledge which he can reprehend; (2) in herself inherently because
          she has been perfectly renewed by the Spirit, if not with a perfection
          of degrees, still with a perfection of parts and of grace which will
          at length be crowned by a perfection of glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVIII. Although the imputed righteousness of Christ is maintained by
          us to be the foundation of our justification before God, it does not
          on that account cease to be purely gratuitous on our part. It is a
          mere gift of God’s mercy because the sponsor is given to us of God and
          was substituted in our place and because his obedience and
          righteousness (which we ourselves ought to have rendered from the
          rigor of the law) is reckoned ours and imputed to us by God. And what
          is more, the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us (Rom. 8:4)
          and justification thus ceases to be of the works of the law performed
          by us, that still it is not made against it, but in accordance with it
          and the law is not only not made void but is rather established by
          faith (Rom. 3:31).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIX. Although justification can be called extrinsic objectively
          (inasmuch as it is the imputation of righteousness which is formally
          without us), still it is ours terminatively. Nor is it more absurd for
          the righteousness of Christ to be extrinsic to us and yet to be
          imputed to us than it is absurd for our sins to be extrinsic to Christ
          and yet to be imputed to Christ for punishment; or (ad hominem) than
          it is absurd for the satisfaction of saints to be imputed to others,
          as the Romanists maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXX. As the disobedience of Adam truly consitituted us sinners by
          imputation, so also the righteousness of Christ truly justifies us by
          imputation. Thus “imputed” is properly opposed to “inherent,” but not
          to “true” because we do not invent an imputation consisting in a mere
          opinion and fiction of law; but one which is in the highest sense real
          and true. Yet this truth belongs to imputation, not to infusion; is
          juridical, not moral.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXI. The righteousness of Christ is rightly said to be imputed to us
          for righteousness, not that it may be reckoned righteousness (which
          was already so before), but that what was before another’s may be made
          ours and that on account of it we may be pronounced righteous and
          received to eternal life.
