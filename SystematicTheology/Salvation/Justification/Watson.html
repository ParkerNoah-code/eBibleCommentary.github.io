        <p><b>3. Of Justification</b></p>
        <p>
          <em>Being justified freely by his grace</em>. (Rom 3:24) <br /><br />
          <b>QXXXIII: WHAT IS JUSTIFICATION?</b>
          <br /><br />
          A: It is an act of God's free grace, whereby he pardons all our sins,
          and accepts us as righteous in his sight, only for the righteousness
          of Christ, imputed to us, and received by faith alone.
          <br /><br />
          Justification is the very hinge and pillar of Christianity. An error
          about justification is dangerous, like a defect in a foundation.
          Justification by Christ is a spring of the water of life. To have the
          poison of corrupt doctrine cast into this spring is damnable. It was a
          saying of Luther, 'that after his death the doctrine of justification
          would be corrupted.' In these latter times, the Arminians and
          Socinians have cast a dead fly into this box of precious ointment.
          <br /><br />
          I shall endeavour to follow the star of Scripture to light me through
          this mysterious point.
          <br /><br />
          <b>What is meant by justification?</b>
          <br /><br />
          It is <em>verbum forense</em>, a word borrowed from law-courts,
          wherein a person arraigned is pronounced righteous, and is openly
          absolved. God, in justifying a person, pronounces him to be righteous,
          and looks upon him as if he had not sinned. <br /><br />
          <b>What is the source of justification?</b>
          <br /><br />
          The <em>causa</em>, the inward impellant motive or ground of
          justification, is the free grace of God: 'being justified freely by
          his grace.' Ambrose expounds this, as 'not of the grace wrought within
          us, but the free grace of God.' The first wheel that sets all the rest
          running is the love and favour of God; as a king freely pardons a
          delinquent. Justification is a merry spun out of the bowels of free
          grace. God does not justify us because we are worthy, but by
          justifying us makes us worthy. <br /><br />
          <b>What is the ground, or that by which a sinner is justified?</b>
          <br /><br />
          The ground of our justification is Christ's satisfaction made to his
          Father. If it be asked, how can it stand with God's justice and
          holiness to pronounce us innocent when we are guilty- the answer is,
          that Christ having made satisfaction for our fault, God may, in equity
          and justice, pronounce us righteous. It is a just thing for a creditor
          to discharge a debtor of the debt, when a satisfaction is made by the
          surety.
          <br /><br />
          <b
            >But how was Christ's satisfaction meritorious, and so sufficient to
            justify?</b
          >
          <br /><br />
          In respect of the divine nature. As he was man he suffered, as God he
          satisfied. By Christ's death and merits, God's justice is more
          abundantly satisfied than if we had suffered the pains of hell for
          ever.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Wherein lies the method of our justification?</b>
          <br /><br />
          In the imputation of Christ's righteousness to us. 'This is the name
          whereby he shall be called,' <em>Jehovah Tzidkennu</em>, 'THE LORD OUR
          RIGHTEOUSNESS.' (Jer 23:6). 'He is made to us righteousness.' (1 Cor
          1:30). This righteousness of Christ, which justifies us, is a better
          righteousness than the angels'; for theirs is the righteousness of
          creatures, this of God. <br /><br />
          <b>What is the means or instrument of our justification?</b>
          <br /><br />
          Faith. 'Being justified by faith.' (Rom 5:1). The dignity is not in
          faith as a grace, but relatively, as it lays hold on Christ's merits.
          <br /><br />
          <b>What is the efficient cause of our justification?</b>
          <br /><br />
          The whole Trinity. All the persons in the blessed Trinity have a hand
          in the justification of a sinner:
          <em>opera Trinitatis ad extra sunt indivisa</em>. God the Father is
          said to justify. 'It is God that justifieth.' (Rom 8:33). God the Son
          is said to justify. 'By him all that believe are justified.' (Acts
          13:39). God the Holy Ghost is said to justify. 'But ye are justified
          by the Spirit of our God.' (1 Cor 6:2). God the Father justifies, as
          he pronounces us righteous; God the Son justifies, as he imputes his
          righteousness to us; and God the Holy Ghost justifies, as he clears up
          our justification, and seals us up to the day of redemption.
          <br /><br />
          <b>What is the end of our justification?</b>
          <br /><br />
          The end is, (1.) That God may inherit praise. 'To the praise of the
          glory of his grace.' (Eph 1:6). Hereby God raises the everlasting
          trophies of his own honour. How will the justified sinner proclaim the
          love of God, and make heaven ring with his praises!
          <br /><br />
          (2.) That the justified person may inherit glory. 'Whom he justified,
          them he also glorified.' (Rom 8:30). God in justifying, not only
          absolves a soul from guilt, but advances him to dignity: as Joseph was
          not only loosed from prison, but made lord of the kingdom.
          Justification is crowned with glorification.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Are we justified from eternity?</b>
          <br /><br />
          No: for, (1.) By nature we are under a sentence of condemnation. (Jhn
          3:18). We could never have been condemned, if we were justified from
          eternity.
          <br /><br />
          (2.) The Scripture confines justification to those who believe and
          repent. 'Repent, that your sins may be blotted out.' (Acts 3:19).
          Therefore their sins were uncancelled, and their persons unjustified,
          till they did repent. Though God does not justify us for our
          repentance, yet not without it. The Antinomians erroneously hold, that
          we are justified from eternity. This doctrine is a key which opens the
          door to all licentiousness; for what sins do they care not to commit,
          so long as they hold they are <em>ab aterno</em> justified whether
          they repent or not? <br /><br />
          <b
            >Before I come to the uses, l shall lay down four maxims or
            positions about justification.</b
          >
          <br /><br />
          [1] That justification confers a real benefit upon the person
          justified. The acquitting and discharging of the debtor, by virtue of
          the satisfaction made by the surety, is a real benefit to the debtor.
          A robe of righteousness, and a crown of righteousness, are real
          benefits.
          <br /><br />
          [2] All believers are alike justified:
          <em>justificatio non recipit magis et minus</em>. [Justification does
          not apply to some more than to others.] Though there are degrees in
          grace, yet not in justification; one is not justified more than
          another; the weakest believer is as perfectly justified as the
          strongest; Mary Magdalene is as much justified as the Virgin Mary.
          This may be a cordial to a weak believer. Though thou hast but a
          drachm of faith, thou art as truly justified as he who is of the
          highest stature in Christ. <br /><br />
          [3] Whomsoever God justifies, he sanctifies. 'But ye are sanctified,
          but ye are justified.' (1 Cor 6:2). The Papists caluminate
          Protestants; they report them to hold that men continuing in sin are
          justified; whereas all our Protestant writers affirm, that
          righteousness imputed, for justification, and righteousness inherent,
          for sanctification, must be inseparably united. Holiness indeed is not
          the cause of our justification, but it is the attendant; as the heat
          in the sun is not the cause of its light, but it is the attendant. It
          is absurd to imagine that God should justify a people, and they should
          still go on in sin. If God should justify a people and not sanctify
          them, he would justify a people whom he could not glorify. A holy God
          cannot lay a sinner in his bosom. The metal is first refined, before
          the king's stamp is put upon it; so the soul is first refined with
          holiness, before God puts the royal stamp of justification upon it.
          <br /><br />
          [4] Justification is <em>inamissibilis</em>; it is a fixed permanent
          thing, it can never be lost. The Arminians hold an apostasy from
          justification; today justified, tomorrow unjustified; today a Peter,
          tomorrow a Judas; today a member of Christ, tomorrow a limb of Satan.
          This is a most uncomfortable doctrine. Justified persons may fall from
          degrees of grace, they may leave their first love, they may lose God's
          favour for a time, but not lose their justification. If they are
          justified they are elected; and they can no more fall from their
          justification than from their election. If they are justified they
          have union with Christ;, and can a member of Christ be broken off? If
          one justified person may fall away from Christ, all may; and so Christ
          would be a head without a body. <br /><br />
          <b>Use one:</b> See from hence, that there is nothing within us that
          could justify, but something without us; not any righteousness
          inherent, but imputed. We may as well look for a star in the earth as
          for justification in our own righteousness. The Papists say we are
          justified by works; but the apostle confutes it, for he says, 'not of
          works, lest any man should boast.' (Eph 2:9). The Papists say, 'the
          works done by an unregenerate man indeed cannot justify him, but works
          done by a regenerate man may justify.' This is most false, as may be
          proved both by example and reason. <br /><br />
          (1.) By example. Abraham was a regenerate man; but Abraham was not
          justified by works, but by faith. Abraham 'believed God, and it was
          counted to him for righteousness.' (Rom 4:3). <br /><br />(2.) By
          reason. How can those works justify us which defile us? 'Our
          righteousnesses are as filthy rags.' (Isa 64:6).
          <em
            >Bona opera non prcecedunt just ficationem, sed sequuntur
            justfcatum</em
          >: good works are not an usher to go before justification, but a
          handmaid to follow it. <br /><br />
          <b
            >But does not the apostle James say that Abraham was justified by
            works?</b
          >
          <br /><br />
          The answer is easy. Works declare us to be righteous before men; but
          they do not make us righteous before God. Works are evidences of our
          justification, not causes. The only name graven upon the golden plate
          of Christ our High Priest must be, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Use two:</b> Of exhortation. (1.) Adore the infinite wisdom and
          goodness of God that found out a way to justify us by 'rich grace and
          precious blood.' We were all involved in guilt; none of us could plead
          not guilty; and being guilty, we lay under a sentence of death. Now
          that the judge himself should find out a way to justify us, and the
          creditor himself contrive a way to have the debt paid, and not
          distress the debtor, should fill us with wonder and love. The angels
          admire the mystery of free grace in this new way of justifying and
          saving lost man, (1 Pet 1:12), and should not we, who are nearly
          concerned in it, and on whom the benefit is devolved, cry out with the
          apostle, 'O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge
          of God!' <br /><br />
          (2.) Labour for this high privilege of justification. There is balm in
          Gilead; Christ has laid down his blood as the price of our
          justification; and he offers himself and all his merits to us, to
          justify; he invites us to come to him; he has promised to give his
          Spirit, to enable us to do what is required. Why then, sinners, will
          ye not look after this great privilege of justification? Why starve in
          the midst of plenty? Why perish when there is a remedy to save you?
          Would not he be thought to be distracted, who having a pardon offered
          him, only upon the acknowledgment of his fault, and promising
          amendment, should bid the prince keep his pardon to himself; for his
          part, he was in love with his chains and fetters, and would die? Thou
          who neglectest justification offered thee freely by Christ in the
          gospel art this infatuated person. Is the love of Christ to be
          slighted? Is thy soul, is heaven worth nothing? Oh then look after
          justification through Christ's blood!
          <br /><br />
          Consider (i) The necessity of being justified. If we are not
          justified, we cannot be glorified. 'Whom he justified, them he also
          glorified.' (Rom 8:30). He who is outlawed, and all his goods
          confiscated, must be brought into favour with his prince before he can
          be restored to his former rights and liberties; so, we must have our
          sins forgiven, and be brought into God's favour by justification,
          before we can be restored to the liberty of the sons of God, and have
          a right to that happiness we forfeited in Adam.
          <br /><br />
          (ii) The utility and benefit. By justification we enjoy peace in our
          conscience; a richer jewel than any prince wears in his crown. 'Being
          justified by faith, we have peace with God.' (Rom 5:1). Peace can
          sweeten all our afflictions, it turns our water into wine. How happy
          is a justified person who has the power of God to guard him, and the
          peace of God to comfort him! Peace flowing from justification is an
          antidote against the fear of death and hell. 'It is God that
          justifieth, who is he that condemneth? (Rom 8:33-34). Therefore labour
          for this justification by Christ. This privilege is obtained by
          believing in Christ. 'By him all that believe are justified.' (Acts
          13:39). 'Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
          his blood.' (Rom 3:25). Faith unites us to Christ; and having union
          with his person we partake of his merits, and the glorious salvation
          which comes by him.
          <br /><br />
          <b>Use three:</b> Comfort to the justified. (1.) It is comfort in case
          of failings. Alas! how defective are the godly! they come short in
          every duty; but though believers should be humbled under their
          defects, they should not despond. They are not to be justified by
          their duties or graces, but by the righteousness of Christ. Their
          duties are mixed with sin, but that righteousness which justifies them
          is a perfect righteousness. <br /><br />
          (2.) Comfort in case of hard censures. The world censures the people
          of God as proud and hypocritical, and the troublers of Israel; but
          though men censure and condemn the godly, yet God has justified them,
          and as he has now justified them, so at the day of judgment he will
          openly justify them, and pronounce them righteous before men and
          angels. God is so just and holy a judge, that having once justified
          his people he will never condemn them. Pilate justified Christ,
          saying, 'I find no fault in him;' yet after this he condemned him; but
          God having publicly justified his saints, he will never condemn them;
          for 'whom he justified, them he also glorified.'
