          I. I think I have already explained, with sufficient care, how that
          men, being subject to the curse of the law, have no means left of
          attaining salvation but through faith alone; and also what faith
          itself is, what Divine blessings it confers on man, and what effects
          it produces in him. The substance of what I have advanced is, that
          Christ, being given to us by the goodness of God, is apprehended and
          possessed by us by faith, by a participation of whom we receive
          especially two benefits. In the first place, being by his innocence
          reconciled to God, we have in heaven a propitious father instead of a
          judge; in the next place, being sanctified by his Spirit, we devote
          ourselves to innocence and purity of life. Of regeneration, which is
          the second benefit, I have said what I thought was sufficient. The
          method of justification has been but slightly touched, because it was
          necessary, first to understand that the faith, by which alone we
          attain gratuitous justification through the Divine mercy, is not
          unattended with good works, and what is the nature of the good works
          of the saints, in which part of this question consists. The subject of
          justification, therefore, must now be fully discussed, and discussed
          with the recollection that it is the principal hinge by which religion
          is supported, in order that we may apply to it with the greater
          attention and care. For unless we first of all apprehend in what
          situation we stand with respect to God, and what his judgment is
          concerning us, we have no foundation either for a certainty of
          salvation, or for the exercise of piety towards God. But the necessity
          of knowing this subject will be more evident from the knowledge
          itself.

          <span class="tab"></span>
          II. But that we may not stumble at the threshold, (which would be the
          case were we to enter on a disputation concerning a subject not
          understood by us,) let us first explain the meaning of these
          expressions. To be justified in the sight of God, To be justified by
          faith or by works. He is said to be justified in the sight of God who
          in the Divine judgment is reputed righteous, and accepted on account
          of his righteousness; for as iniquity is abominable to God, so no
          sinner can find favour in his sight, as a sinner, or so long as he is
          considered as such. Wherever sin is, therefore, it is accompanied with
          the wrath and vengeance of God. He is justified who is considered not
          as a sinner, but as a righteous person, and on that account stands in
          safety before the tribunal of God, where all sinners are confounded
          and ruined. As, if an innocent man be brought under an accusation
          before the tribunal of a just judge, when judgment is passed according
          to his innocence, he is said to be justified or acquitted before the
          judge, so he is justified before God, who, not being numbered among
          sinners, has God for a witness and asserter of his righteousness. Thus
          he must be said, therefore, to be justified by works, whose life
          discovers such purity and holiness, as to deserve the character of
          righteousness before the throne of God; or who, by the integrity of
          his works, can answer and satisfy the divine judgment. On the other
          hand, he will be justified by faith, who, being excluded from the
          righteousness of works, apprehends by faith the righteousness of
          Christ, invested in which, he appears, in the sight of God, not as a
          sinner, but as a righteous man. Thus we simply explain justification
          to be an acceptance, by which God receives us into his favour, and
          esteems us as righteous persons; and we say that it consists in the
          remission of sins and the imputation of the righteousness of Christ.

          <span class="tab"></span>
          III. For the confirmation of this point there are many plain
          testimonies of Scripture. In the first place, that this is the proper
          and most usual signification of the word, cannot be denied. But since
          it would be too tedious to collect all the passages and compare them
          together, let it suffice to have suggested it to the reader; for he
          will easily observe it of himself. I will only produce a few places,
          where this justification, which we speak of, is expressly handled.
          First, where Luke relates that “the people that heard Christ justified
          God;” and where Christ pronounces that “wisdom is justified of all her
          children.” To justify God, in the former passage, does not signify to
          confer righteousness, which always remains perfect in him, although
          the whole world endeavour to rob him of it; nor, in the latter
          passage, does the justifying of wisdom denote making the doctrine of
          salvation righteous, which is so of itself; but both passages imply an
          ascription to God and to his doctrine of the praise which they
          deserve. Again, when Christ reprehends the Pharisees for “justifying
          themselves,” he does not mean that they attained righteousness by
          doing what was right, but that they ostentatiously endeavoured to gain
          the character of righteousness, of which they were destitute. This is
          better understood by persons who are skilled in the Hebrew language;
          which gives the appellation of sinners, not only to those who are
          conscious to themselves of sin, but to persons who fall under a
          sentence of condemnation. For Bathsheba, when she says, “I and my son
          Solomon shall be counted offenders,” or sinners, confesses no crime,
          but complains, that she and her son will be exposed to the disgrace of
          being numbered among condemned criminals. And it appears from the
          context, that this word, even in the translation, cannot be understood
          in any other than a relative sense, and that it does not denote the
          real character. But with respect to the present subject, where Paul
          says, “The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the heathen
          through faith,” what can we understand, but that God imputes
          righteousness through faith? Again, when he says that God “justifieth
          the ungodly which believeth in Jesus,” what can be the meaning, but
          that he delivers him by the blessing of faith from the condemnation
          deserved by his ungodliness? He speaks still more plainly in the
          conclusion, when he thus exclaims: “Who shall lay any thing to the
          charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that
          condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again,
          who also maketh intercession for us.” For it is just as if he had
          said, Who shall accuse them whom God absolves? Who shall condemn those
          for whom Christ intercedes? Justification, therefore, is no other than
          an acquittal from guilt of him who was accused, as though his
          innocence had been proved. Since God, therefore, justifies us through
          the mediation of Christ, he acquits us, not by an admission of our
          personal innocence, but by an imputation of righteousness; so that we,
          who are unrighteous in ourselves, are considered as righteous in
          Christ. This is the doctrine preached by Paul in the thirteenth
          chapter of the Acts: “Through this man is preached unto you the
          forgiveness of sins; and by him all that believe are justified from
          all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.”
          We see that after remission of sins, this justification is mentioned,
          as if by way of explanation: we see clearly that it means an
          acquittal; that it is separated from the works of the law; that it is
          a mere favour of Christ; that it is apprehended by faith: we see,
          finally, the interposition of a satisfaction, when he says that we are
          justified from sins by Christ. Thus, when it is said, that the
          publican “went down to his house justified,” we cannot say that he
          obtained righteousness by any merit of works. The meaning therefore
          is, that after he had obtained the pardon of his sins, he was
          considered as righteous in the sight of God. He was righteous,
          therefore, not through any approbation of his works, but through God's
          gracious absolution. Wherefore Ambrose beautifully styles confession
          of sins, a legitimate justification.

          <span class="tab"></span>
          IV. But leaving all contention about the term, if we attend to the
          thing itself, as it is described to us, every doubt will be removed.
          For Paul certainly describes justification as an acceptance, when he
          says to the Ephesians, “God hath predestinated us to the adoption of
          children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of
          his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath
          made us accepted.” The meaning of this passage is the same as when in
          another place we are said to be “justified freely by his grace.” But
          in the fourth chapter to the Romans, he first mentions an imputation
          of righteousness, and immediately represents it as consisting in
          remission of sins. “David,” says he, “describeth the blessedness of
          the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, saying,
          Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven,” &c. He there, indeed,
          argues not concerning a branch, but the whole of justification. He
          also adduces the definition of it given by David, when he pronounces
          them to be blessed who receive the free forgiveness of their sins;
          whence it appears, that this righteousness of which he speaks is
          simply opposed to guilt. But the most decisive passage of all on this
          point, is where he teaches us that the grand object of the ministry of
          the gospel is, that we may “be reconciled to God,” because he is
          pleased to receive us into his favour through Christ, “not imputing”
          our “trespasses unto” us. Let the reader carefully examine the whole
          context; for when, by way of explanation, he just after adds, in order
          to describe the method of reconciliation, that Christ, “who knew no
          sin,” was “made sin for us,” he undoubtedly means by the term
          “reconciliation,” no other than justification. Nor would there be any
          truth in what he affirms in another place, that we are “made righteous
          by the obedience of Christ,” unless we are reputed righteous before
          God, in him, and out of ourselves.

        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          V. But since Osiander has introduced I know not what monstrous notion
          of essential righteousness, by which, though he had no intention to
          destroy justification by grace, yet he has involved it in such
          obscurity as darkens pious minds, and deprives them of a serious sense
          of the grace of Christ,—it will be worth while, before I pass to any
          thing else, to refute this idle notion. In the first place, this
          speculation is the mere fruit of insatiable curiosity. He accumulates,
          indeed, many testimonies of Scripture, to prove that Christ is one
          with us, and we one with him, of which there is no proof necessary;
          but for want of observing the bond of this union, he bewilders
          himself. For us, however, who hold that we are united to Christ by the
          secret energy of his Spirit, it will be easy to obviate all his
          sophisms. He had conceived a notion similar to what was held by the
          Manichæans, so that he wished to transfuse the Divine essence into
          men. Hence another discovery of his, that Adam was formed in the image
          of God, because, even antecedently to the fall, Christ had been
          appointed the exemplar of the human nature. But for the sake of
          brevity, I shall only insist on the subject now before us. He says
          that we are one with Christ. This we admit; but we at the same time
          deny that Christ's essence is blended with ours. In the next place, we
          assert that this principle—that Christ is our righteousness because he
          is the eternal God, the fountain of righteousness, and the essential
          righteousness of God—is grossly perverted to support his fallacies.
          The reader will excuse me, if I now just hint at these things, which
          the order of the treatise requires to be deferred to another place.
          But though he alleges, in vindication of himself, that by the term
          essential righteousness he only intends to oppose the opinion that we
          are reputed righteous for the sake of Christ, yet he manifestly shows,
          that, not content with that righteousness which has been procured for
          us by the obedience and sacrificial death of Christ, he imagines that
          we are substantially righteous in God, by the infusion of his essence
          as well as his character. For this is the reason why he so vehemently
          contends, that not only Christ, but the Father and the Holy Spirit
          also dwell in us; which, though I allow it to be a truth, yet I
          maintain that he has grossly perverted. For he ought to have fully
          considered the nature of this inhabitation; namely, that the Father
          and the Spirit are in Christ; and that as “all the fulness of the
          Godhead dwelleth in him,” so in him we possess the whole Deity.
          Whatever, therefore, he advances concerning the Father and the Spirit
          separately, has no other tendency but to seduce the simple from
          Christ. In the next place, he introduces a mixture of substances, by
          which God, transfusing himself into us, makes us, as it were, a part
          of himself. For he considers it as of no importance, that the power of
          the Holy Spirit unites us to Christ, so that he becomes our head and
          we become his members, unless his essence be blended with ours. But
          when speaking of the Father and the Spirit, he more openly betrays his
          opinion; which is, that we are not justified by the sole grace of the
          Mediator, and that righteousness is not simply or really offered to us
          in his person; but that we are made partakers of the Divine
          righteousness when God is essentially united with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          VI. If he had only said, that Christ in justifying us becomes ours by
          an essential union, and that he is our head not only as man, but that
          the essence of his Divine nature also is infused into us,—he might
          have entertained himself with his fancies with less mischief, nor
          perhaps would so great a contention have been excited about this
          reverie. But as this principle is like a cuttlefish, which, by the
          emission of black and turbid blood, conceals its many tails, there is
          a necessity for a vigorous opposition to it, unless we mean to submit
          to be openly robbed of that righteousness which alone affords us any
          confidence concerning our salvation. For throughout this discussion,
          the terms righteousness and justify are extended by him to two things.
          First, he understands that “to be justified” denotes not only to be
          reconciled to God by a free pardon, but also to be made righteous; and
          that righteousness is not a gratuitous imputation, but a sanctity and
          integrity inspired by the Divine essence which resides in us.
          Secondly, he resolutely denies that Christ is our righteousness, as
          having, in the character of a priest, expiated our sins and appeased
          the Father on our behalf, but as being the eternal God and everlasting
          life. To prove the first assertion, that God justifies not only by
          pardoning, but also by regenerating, he inquires whether God leaves
          those whom he justifies in their natural state, without any
          reformation of their manners. The answer is very easy; as Christ
          cannot be divided, so these two blessings, which we receive together
          in him, are also inseparable. Whomsoever, therefore, God receives into
          his favour, he likewise gives them the Spirit of adoption, by whose
          power he renews them in his own image. But if the brightness of the
          sun be inseparable from his heat, shall we therefore say that the
          earth is warmed by his light, and illuminated by his heat? Nothing can
          be more apposite to the present subject than this similitude. The
          beams of the sun quicken and fertilize the earth, his rays brighten
          and illuminate it. Here is a mutual and indivisible connection. Yet
          reason itself prohibits us to transfer to one what is peculiar to the
          other. In this confusion of two blessings which Osiander obtrudes on
          us, there is a similar absurdity. For as God actually renews to the
          practice of righteousness those whom he gratuitously accepts as
          righteous, Osiander confounds that gift of regeneration with this
          gracious acceptance, and contends that they are one and the same. But
          the Scripture, though it connects them together, yet enumerates them
          distinctly, that the manifold grace of God may be the more evident to
          us. For that passage of Paul is not superfluous, that “Christ is made
          unto us righteousness and sanctification.” And whenever he argues,
          from the salvation procured for us, from the paternal love of God, and
          from the grace of Christ, that we are called to holiness and purity,
          he plainly indicates that it is one thing to be justified, and another
          thing to be made new creatures. When Osiander appeals to the
          Scripture, he corrupts as many passages as he cites. The assertion of
          Paul, that “to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
          justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness,” is
          explained by Osiander to denote making a man righteous. With the same
          temerity he corrupts the whole of that fourth chapter to the Romans,
          and hesitates not to impose the same false gloss on the passage just
          cited, “Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is
          God that justifieth;” where it is evident that the apostle is treating
          simply of accusation and absolution, and that his meaning wholly rests
          on the antithesis. His folly, therefore, betrays itself both in his
          arguments and in his citations of Scripture proofs. With no more
          propriety does he treat of the word righteousness, when he says, “that
          faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness,” because that after
          having embraced Christ, (who is the righteousness of God, and God
          himself,) he was eminent for the greatest virtues. Whence it appears,
          that of two good parts, he erroneously makes one corrupt whole; for
          the righteousness there mentioned does not belong to the whole course
          of Abraham's life; but rather the Spirit testifies that,
          notwithstanding the singular eminence of Abraham's virtues, and his
          laudable and persevering advancement in them, yet he did not please
          God any otherwise than in receiving by faith the grace offered in the
          promise. Whence it follows, that in justification there is no regard
          paid to works, as Paul conclusively argues in that passage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          VII. His objection, that the power of justifying belongs not to faith
          of itself, but only as it receives Christ, I readily admit. For if
          faith were to justify of itself, or by an intrinsic efficacy, as it is
          expressed, being always weak and imperfect, it never could effect this
          but in part; and thus it would be a defective justification, which
          would only confer on us a partial salvation. Now, we entertain no such
          notion as the objection supposes; on the contrary, we affirm that,
          strictly speaking, “it is God that justifies;” and then we transfer
          this to Christ, because he is given to us for righteousness. Faith we
          compare to a vessel; for unless we come empty with the mouth of our
          soul open to implore the grace of Christ, we cannot receive Christ.
          Whence it may be inferred, that we do not detract from Christ the
          power of justifying, when we teach that faith receives him before it
          receives his righteousness. Nevertheless, I cannot admit the intricate
          comparisons of this sophist, when he says that faith is Christ; as
          though an earthen vessel were a treasure, because gold is concealed in
          it. For faith, although intrinsically it is of no dignity or value,
          justifies us by an application of Christ, just as a vessel full of
          money constitutes a man rich. Therefore I maintain that faith, which
          is only the instrument by which righteousness is received, cannot
          without absurdity be confounded with Christ, who is the material
          cause, and at once the author and dispenser of so great a benefit. We
          have now removed the difficulty as to the sense in which the word
          faith ought to be understood, when it is applied to justification.

          VIII. Respecting the reception of Christ, he goes still greater
          lengths; asserting that the internal word is received by the ministry
          of the external word, by which he would divert us from the priesthood
          of Christ and the person of the Mediator, to his eternal divinity. We
          do not divide Christ, but we maintain that the same person, who, by
          reconciling us to the Father in his own flesh, has given us
          righteousness, is the eternal Word of God; and we confess that he
          could not otherwise have discharged the office of Mediator, and
          procured righteousness for us, if he were not the eternal God. But the
          opinion of Osiander is, that since Christ is both God and man, he is
          made righteousness to us, in respect of his Divine, not his human
          nature. Now, if this properly belong to the Divinity, it will not be
          peculiar to Christ, but common also to the Father and the Spirit;
          since the righteousness of one is the same as that of the others.
          Besides, what has been naturally eternal, cannot with propriety be
          said to be “made unto us.” But though we grant that God is made
          righteousness unto us, how will it agree with the clause which is
          inserted, that “of God,” he “is made unto us righteousness?” This is
          certainly peculiar to the character of the Mediator, who, though he
          contains in himself the Divine nature, yet is designated by this
          appropriate title, by which he is distinguished from the Father and
          the Spirit. But he ridiculously triumphs in that single expression of
          Jeremiah, where he promises that “the Lord,” Jehovah, will be “our
          righteousness.” He can deduce nothing from this, but that Christ, who
          is our righteousness, is God manifested in the flesh. We have
          elsewhere recited from Paul's sermon, that “God hath purchased the
          Church with his own blood.” If any should infer from this, that the
          blood by which our sins were expiated, was Divine, and part of the
          Divine nature, who could bear so monstrous an error? But Osiander
          thinks he has gained every thing by this very puerile cavil; he
          swells, exults, and fills many pages with his swelling words, though
          the passage is simply and readily explained, by saying that Jehovah,
          when he should become the seed of David, would be the righteousness of
          the pious; and in the same sense Isaiah informs us, “by his knowledge
          shall my righteous servant justify many.” Let us remark, that the
          speaker here is the Father; that he attributes to his Son the office
          of justifying; that he adds as a reason, that he is righteous; and
          that he places the mode or means of effecting this, in the doctrine by
          which Christ is made known. For it is more suitable to understand the
          word דעת in a passive sense. Hence I conclude, first, that Christ was
          made righteousness when he assumed the form of a servant; secondly,
          that he justifies us by his own obedience to the Father; and,
          therefore, that he does this for us, not according to his Divine
          nature, but by reason of the dispensation committed to him. For though
          God alone is the fountain of righteousness, and we are righteous only
          by a participation of him, yet, because we have been alienated from
          his righteousness through the unhappy breach occasioned by the fall,
          we are under the necessity of descending to this inferior remedy, to
          be justified by Christ, by the efficacy of his death and resurrection.

          <span class="tab"></span>
          IX. If Osiander object, that the excellence of this work surpasses the
          nature of man, and therefore can be ascribed only to the Divine
          nature,—the former part of the objection I admit, but in the latter I
          maintain that he is grossly mistaken. For although Christ could
          neither purify our souls with his blood, nor appease the Father by his
          sacrifice, nor absolve us from guilt, nor, in short, perform the
          functions of a priest, if he were not truly God, because human power
          would have been unequal to so great a burden, yet it is certain that
          he performed all these things in his human nature. For if it be
          inquired, How are we justified? Paul replies, “By the obedience” of
          Christ. But has he obeyed in any other way than by assuming the form
          of a servant? Hence we infer, that righteousness is presented to us in
          his flesh. In the other passage also, which I much wonder that
          Osiander is not ashamed to quote so frequently, Paul places the source
          of righteousness wholly in the humanity of Christ. “He hath made him
          to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the
          righteousness of God in him.” Osiander lays great stress on “the
          righteousness of God,” and triumphs as though he had evinced it to be
          his notion of essential righteousness; whereas the words convey a very
          different idea,—that we are righteous through the expiation effected
          by Christ. That “the righteousness of God” means that which God
          approves, ought to have been known to the youngest novices; just as in
          John “the praise of God” is opposed to “the praise of men.” I know
          that “the righteousness of God” sometimes denotes that of which he is
          the author, and which he bestows upon us; but, without any observation
          of mine, the judicious reader will perceive that the meaning of this
          passage is only, that we stand before the tribunal of God supported by
          the atoning death of Christ. Nor is the term of such great importance,
          provided that Osiander coincides with us in this, that we are
          justified in Christ, inasmuch as he was made an expiatory sacrifice
          for us; which is altogether incompatible with his Divine nature. For
          this reason, when Christ designs to seal the righteousness and
          salvation which he has presented to us, he exhibits a certain pledge
          of it in his flesh. He calls himself, indeed, “living bread;” but
          adds, by way of explanation, “my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is
          drink indeed.” This method of instruction is discovered in the
          sacraments; which, although they direct our faith to the whole of the
          person of Christ, not to a part of him only, yet at the same time
          teach that the matter of justification and salvation resides in his
          human nature; not that he either justifies or vivifies, of himself as
          a mere man, but because it has pleased God to manifest in the Mediator
          that which was incomprehensible and hidden in himself. Wherefore I am
          accustomed to say, that Christ is, as it were, a fountain opened to
          us, whence we may draw what were otherwise concealed and useless in
          that secret and deep fountain which flows to us in the person of the
          Mediator. In this manner, and in this sense, provided he will submit
          to the clear and forcible arguments which I have adduced, I do not
          deny that Christ justifies us, as he is God and man, and that this
          work is common also to the Father and the Spirit; and, finally, that
          the righteousness of which Christ makes us partakers, is the eternal
          righteousness of the eternal God.

          <span class="tab"></span>
          X. Moreover, that his cavils may not deceive the inexperienced, I
          confess that we are destitute of this incomparable blessing, till
          Christ becomes ours. I attribute, therefore, the highest importance to
          the connection between the head and members; to the inhabitation of
          Christ in our hearts; in a word, to the mystical union by which we
          enjoy him, so that being made ours, he makes us partakers of the
          blessings with which he is furnished. We do not, then, contemplate him
          at a distance out of ourselves, that his righteousness may be imputed
          to us; but because we have put him on, and are ingrafted into his
          body, and because he has deigned to unite us to himself, therefore we
          glory in a participation of his righteousness. Thus we refute the
          cavil of Osiander, that faith is considered by us as righteousness; as
          though we despoiled Christ of his right, when we affirm, that by faith
          we come to him empty, that he alone may fill us with his grace. But
          Osiander, despising this spiritual connection, insists on a gross
          mixture of Christ with believers; and therefore invidiously gives the
          appellation of Zuinglians to all who do not subscribe to his fanatical
          error concerning essential righteousness; because they are not of
          opinion that Christ is substantially eaten in the sacred supper. As
          for myself, indeed, I consider it the highest honour to be thus
          reproached by a man so proud and so absorbed in his own delusions;
          although he attacks not me alone, but other writers well known in the
          world, whom he ought to have treated with modest respect. But this
          does not at all affect me, who am supporting no private interest;
          wherefore I the more unreservedly advocate this cause, conscious that
          I am free from every sinister motive. His great importunity in
          insisting on essential righteousness, and an essential inhabitation of
          Christ in us, goes to this length—first, that God transfuses himself
          into us by a gross mixture of himself with us, as he pretends that
          there is a carnal eating in the sacred supper; secondly, that God
          inspires his righteousness into us, by which we are really righteous
          with him, since, according to this man, such righteousness is as
          really God himself, as the goodness, or holiness, or perfection of
          God. I shall not take much trouble to refute the testimonies adduced
          by him, which he violently perverts from the celestial to the present
          state. By Christ, says Peter, “are given unto us exceeding great and
          precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the Divine
          nature.” As though we were now such as the gospel promises we shall be
          at the second advent of Christ; nay, John apprizes us, that then “we
          shall be like God; for we shall see him as he is.” I have thought
          proper to give the reader only a small specimen, and endeavoured to
          pass over these impertinences, not that it is difficult to refute
          them, but because I am unwilling to be tedious in labouring to no
          purpose.

          <span class="tab"></span>
          XI. There is yet more latent poison in the second particular, in which
          he maintains, that we are righteous together with God. I think I have
          already sufficiently demonstrated, that although this dogma were not
          so pestiferous, yet because it is weak and unsatisfactory, and
          evaporates through its own inanity, it ought justly to be rejected by
          all judicious and pious readers. But this is an impiety not to be
          tolerated—under the pretext of a twofold righteousness to weaken the
          assurance of salvation, and to elevate us above the clouds, that we
          may not embrace by faith the grace of expiation, and call upon God
          with tranquillity of mind. Osiander ridicules those who say that
          justification is a forensic term, because it is necessary for us to be
          actually righteous: nor is there any thing that he more dislikes than
          the doctrine that we are justified by gratuitous imputation. Now, if
          God do not justify by absolving and pardoning us, what is the meaning
          of this declaration of Paul? “God was in Christ, reconciling the world
          unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. For he hath
          made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
          righteousness of God in him.” First I find, that they are accounted
          righteous who are reconciled to God: the manner is specified, that God
          justifies by pardoning; just as, in another passage, justification is
          opposed to accusation; which antithesis clearly demonstrates, that the
          form of expression is borrowed from the practice of courts. Nor is
          there any one, but tolerably versed in the Hebrew language, provided
          at the same time that he be in his sound senses, who can be ignorant
          that this is the original of the phrase, and that this is its import
          and meaning. Now, let Osiander answer me whether, where Paul says that
          “David describeth righteousness without works, saying, Blessed are
          they whose iniquities are forgiven,” whether, I say, this be a
          complete definition or a partial one. Certainly Paul does not adduce
          the testimony of the Psalmist, as teaching that pardon of sins is a
          part of righteousness, or concurs to the justification of a man; but
          he includes the whole of righteousness in a free remission,
          pronouncing, “Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and
          whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not
          impute sin.” He thence estimates and judges of the felicity of such a
          man, because in this way he becomes righteous, not actually, but by
          imputation. Osiander objects, that it would be dishonourable to God,
          and contrary to his nature, if he justified those who still remain
          actually impious. But it should be remembered that, as I have already
          observed, the grace of justification is inseparable from regeneration,
          although they are distinct things. But since it is sufficiently known
          from experience, that some relics of sin always remain in the
          righteous, the manner of their justification must of necessity be very
          different from that of their renovation to newness of life. For the
          latter God commences in his elect, and as long as they live carries it
          on gradually, and sometimes slowly, so that they are always obnoxious
          at his tribunal to the sentence of death. He justifies them, however,
          not in a partial manner, but so completely, that they may boldly
          appear in heaven, as being invested with the purity of Christ. For no
          portion of righteousness could satisfy our consciences, till we have
          ascertained that God is pleased with us, as being unexceptionably
          righteous before him. Whence it follows, that the doctrine of
          justification is perverted and totally overturned, when doubts are
          injected into the mind, when the confidence of salvation is shaken,
          when bold and fearless worship is interrupted, and when quiet and
          tranquillity with spiritual joy are not established. Whence Paul
          argues from the incompatibility of things contrary to each other, that
          the inheritance is not of the law, because then faith would be
          rendered vain; which, if it be fixed upon works, must inevitably fall;
          since not even the most holy of all saints will find them afford any
          ground of confidence. This difference between justification and
          regeneration (which Osiander confounds together, and denominates a
          twofold righteousness) is beautifully expressed by Paul; for, speaking
          of his real righteousness, or of the integrity which he possessed, to
          which Osiander gives the appellation of essential righteousness, he
          sorrowfully exclaims, “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me
          from the body of this death?” But resorting to the righteousness which
          is founded in the Divine mercy alone, he nobly triumphs over life, and
          death, and reproaches, and famine, and the sword, and all adverse
          things and persons. “Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's
          elect? It is God that justifieth. For I am persuaded, that nothing
          shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
          Jesus our Lord.” He plainly declares himself to be possessed of that
          righteousness, which alone is fully sufficient for salvation in the
          sight of God; so that the miserable servitude, in a consciousness of
          which he was just before bewailing his condition, neither diminishes,
          nor in the smallest degree interrupts, the confidence with which he
          triumphs. This diversity is sufficiently known, and is even familiar
          to all the saints, who groan under the burden of their iniquities, and
          yet with victorious confidence rise superior to every fear. But the
          objection of Osiander, that it is incongruous to the nature of God,
          recoils upon himself; for, although he invests the saints with a
          twofold righteousness, as with a garment covered with skins, he is,
          notwithstanding, constrained to acknowledge that no man can please God
          without the remission of his sins. If this be true, he should at least
          grant that they who are not actually righteous, are accounted
          righteous in proportion, as it is expressed, to the degree of
          imputation. But how far shall a sinner extend this gracious
          acceptance, which is substituted in the place of righteousness? Shall
          he estimate it by the weight? Truly he will be in great uncertainty to
          which side to incline the balance; because he will not be able to
          assume to himself as much righteousness as may be necessary to his
          confidence. It is well that he, who would wish to prescribe laws to
          God, is not the arbiter of this cause. But this address of David to
          God will remain: “That thou mightest be justified when thou speakest,
          and be clear when thou judgest.” And what extreme arrogance it is to
          condemn the supreme Judge when he freely absolves, and not to be
          satisfied with this answer, “I will show mercy on whom I will show
          mercy!” And yet the intercession of Moses, which God checked with this
          reply, was not that he would spare none, but that, though they were
          guilty, he would remove their guilt and absolve them all at once. We
          affirm, therefore, that those who were undone are justified before God
          by the obliteration of their sins; because, sin being the object of
          his hatred, he can love none but those whom he justifies. But this is
          a wonderful method of justification, that sinners, being invested with
          the righteousness of Christ, dread not the judgment which they have
          deserved; and that, while they justly condemn themselves, they are
          accounted righteous out of themselves.

          XII. But the readers must be cautioned to pay a strict attention to
          the mystery which Osiander boasts that he will not conceal from them.
          For, after having contended with great prolixity, that we do not
          obtain favour with God solely through the imputation of the
          righteousness of Christ, because it would be impossible for him to
          esteem those as righteous who are not so, (I use his own words,) he at
          length concludes, that Christ is given to us for righteousness, not in
          respect of his human, but of his Divine nature; and that, though this
          righteousness can only be found in the person of the Mediator, yet it
          is the righteousness, not of man, but of God. He does not combine two
          righteousnesses, but evidently deprives the humanity of Christ of all
          concern in the matter of justification. It is worth while, however, to
          hear what arguments he adduces. It is said in the passage referred to,
          that “Christ is made unto us wisdom,” which is applicable only to the
          eternal Word. Neither, therefore, is Christ, considered as man our
          righteousness. I reply, that the only begotten Son of God was indeed
          his eternal wisdom; but this title is here ascribed to him by Paul in
          a different sense, because “in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom
          and knowledge.” What, therefore, he had with the Father, he has
          manifested to us; and so what Paul says, refers not to the essence of
          the Son of God, but to our benefit, and is rightly applied to the
          humanity of Christ; because, although he was a light shining in
          darkness before his assumption of the flesh, yet he was a hidden light
          till he appeared in the nature of man “as the Sun of righteousness;”
          wherefore he calls himself “the light of the world.” Osiander betrays
          his folly likewise in objecting, that justification exceeds the power
          of angels and men; since it depends not upon the dignity of any
          creature, but upon the appointment of God. If angels were desirous to
          offer a satisfaction to God, it would be unavailing; because they have
          not been appointed to it. This was peculiar to the man Christ, who was
          “made under the law, to redeem us from the curse of the law.” He
          likewise very unjustly accuses those who deny that Christ is our
          righteousness according to his Divine nature, of retaining only one
          part of Christ, and (what is worse) making two Gods; because, though
          they acknowledge that God dwells in us, yet they flatly deny that we
          are righteous through the righteousness of God. For if we call Christ
          the author of life in consequence of his having suffered death, “that
          he might destroy him that had the power of death,” it is not to be
          inferred that we deny this honour to his complete person, as God
          manifested in the flesh: we only state with precision the means by
          which the righteousness of God is conveyed to us, so that we may enjoy
          it. In this, Osiander has fallen into a very pernicious error. We do
          not deny, that what is openly exhibited to us in Christ flows from the
          secret grace and power of God; nor do we refuse to admit, that the
          righteousness conferred on us by Christ is the righteousness of God as
          proceeding from him; but we constantly maintain that we have
          righteousness and life in the death and resurrection of Christ. I pass
          over that shameful accumulation of passages, with which, without any
          discrimination, and even without common sense, he has burdened the
          reader, in order to evince, that wherever mention is made of
          righteousness, it ought to be understood of this essential
          righteousness; as where David implores the righteousness of God to
          assist him; which as he does above a hundred times, Osiander hesitates
          not to pervert such a great number of passages. Nor is there any thing
          more solid in his other objection, that the term “righteousness” is
          properly and rightly applied to that by which we are excited to
          rectitude of conduct, and that God alone “worketh in us both to will
          and to do.” Now, we do not deny, that God renews us by his Spirit to
          holiness and righteousness of life; but it should first be inquired,
          whether he does this immediately by himself, or through the medium of
          his Son, with whom he has deposited all the plenitude of his Spirit,
          that with his abundance he might relieve the necessities of his
          members. Besides, though righteousness flows to us from the secret
          fountain of the Divinity, yet it does not follow that Christ, who in
          the flesh sanctified himself for our sakes, is our righteousness with
          respect to his Divine nature. Equally frivolous is his assertion, that
          Christ himself was righteous with the righteousness of God; because,
          if he had not been influenced by the will of the Father, not even he
          could have performed the part assigned him. For though it has been
          elsewhere observed, that all the merit of Christ himself flows from
          the mere favour of God, yet this affords no countenance to the
          fanciful notion with which Osiander fascinates his own eyes and those
          of the injudicious. For who would admit the inference, that because
          God is the original source of our righteousness, we are therefore
          essentially righteous, and have the essence of the Divine
          righteousness residing in us? In redeeming the Church (Isaiah says)
          God “put on righteousness as a breastplate;” but was it to spoil
          Christ of the armour which he had given him, and to prevent his being
          a perfect Redeemer? The prophet only meant that God borrowed nothing
          extrinsic to himself, and had no assistance in the work of our
          redemption. Paul has briefly intimated the same in other words, saying
          that he has given us salvation in order “to declare his
          righteousness.” Nor does this at all contradict what he states in
          another place, “that by the obedience of one we are made righteous.”
          To conclude: whoever fabricates a twofold righteousness, that wretched
          souls may not rely wholly and exclusively on the Divine mercy, makes
          Christ an object of contempt, and crowns him with platted thorns.

          XIII. But as many persons imagine righteousness to be composed of
          faith and works, let us also prove, before we proceed, that the
          righteousness of faith is so exceedingly different from that of works,
          that if one be established, the other must necessarily be subverted.
          The apostle says, “I count all things but dung, that I may win Christ,
          and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of
          the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
          righteousness which is of God by faith.” Here we see a comparison of
          two opposites, and an implication that his own righteousness must be
          forsaken by him who wishes to obtain the righteousness of Christ.
          Wherefore, in another place, he states this to have been the cause of
          the ruin of the Jews, that, “going about to establish their own
          righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the
          righteousness of God.” If, by establishing our own righteousness, we
          reject the righteousness of God, then, in order to obtain the latter,
          the former must doubtless be entirely renounced. He conveys the same
          sentiment when he asserts, that “boasting is excluded. By what law? of
          works? Nay; but by the law of faith.” Whence it follows, that as long
          as there remains the least particle of righteousness in our works, we
          retain some cause for boasting. But if faith excludes all boasting,
          the righteousness of works can by no means be associated with the
          righteousness of faith. To this purpose he speaks so clearly in the
          fourth chapter to the Romans, as to leave no room for cavil or
          evasion. “If Abraham (says he) were justified by works, he hath
          whereof to glory.” He adds, “but” he hath “not” whereof to glory
          “before God.” It follows, therefore, that he was not justified by
          works. Then he advances another argument from two opposites. “To him
          that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.” But
          righteousness is attributed to faith through grace. Therefore it is
          not from the merit of works. Adieu, therefore, to the fanciful notion
          of those who imagine a righteousness compounded of faith and works.

          XIV. The sophists, who amuse and delight themselves with perversion of
          the Scripture and vain cavils, think they have found a most excellent
          subterfuge, when they explain works, in these passages, to mean those
          which men yet unregenerate perform without the grace of Christ, merely
          through the unassisted efforts of their own free-will; and deny that
          they relate to spiritual works. Thus, according to them, a man is
          justified both by faith and by works, only the works are not properly
          his own, but the gifts of Christ and the fruits of regeneration. For
          they say that Paul spoke in this manner, only that the Jews, who
          relied on their own strength, might be convinced of their folly in
          arrogating righteousness to themselves, whereas it is conferred on us
          solely by the Spirit of Christ, not by any exertion properly our own.
          But they do not observe, that in the contrast of legal and evangelical
          righteousness, which Paul introduces in another place, all works are
          excluded, by what title soever they may be distinguished. For he
          teaches that this is the righteousness of the law, that he who has
          fulfilled the command of the law shall obtain salvation; but that the
          righteousness of faith consists in believing that Christ has died and
          is risen again. Besides, we shall see, as we proceed, in its proper
          place, that sanctification and righteousness are separate blessings of
          Christ. Whence it follows, that even spiritual works are not taken
          into the account, when the power of justifying is attributed to faith.
          And the assertion of Paul, in the place just cited, that Abraham has
          not whereof to glory before God, since he was not justified by works,
          ought not to be restricted to any literal appearance or external
          display of virtue, or to any efforts of free-will; but though the life
          of the patriarch was spiritual, and almost angelic, yet his works did
          not possess sufficient merit to justify him before God.

          XV. The errors of the schoolmen, who mingle their preparations, are
          rather more gross; but they instil into the simple and incautious a
          doctrine equally corrupt, while under the pretext of the Spirit and of
          grace, they conceal the mercy of God, which alone can calm the terrors
          of the conscience. We confess, indeed, with Paul, that “the doers of
          the law are justified before God;” but since we are all far from being
          observers of the law, we conclude, that those works which should be
          principally available to justification, afford us no assistance,
          because we are destitute of them. With respect to the common Papists,
          or schoolmen, they are in this matter doubly deceived; both in
          denominating faith a certainty of conscience in expecting from God a
          reward of merit, and in explaining the grace of God to be, not an
          imputation of gratuitous righteousness, but the Spirit assisting to
          the pursuit of holiness. They read in the apostle, “He that cometh to
          God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
          diligently seek him.” But they do not consider the manner of seeking
          him. And that they mistake the sense of the word “grace,” is evident
          from their writings. For Lombard represents justification by Christ as
          given us in two ways. He says, “The death of Christ justifies us,
          first, because it excites charity in our hearts, by which we are made
          actually righteous; secondly, because it destroys sin, by which the
          devil held us in captivity, so that now it cannot condemn us.” We see
          how he considers the grace of God in justification to consist in our
          being directed to good works by the grace of the Holy Spirit. He
          wished, indeed, to follow the opinion of Augustine; but he follows him
          at a great distance, and even deviates considerably from a close
          imitation of him; for whatever he finds clearly stated by him, he
          obscures, and whatever he finds pure in him, he corrupts. The schools
          have always been running into worse and worse errors, till at length
          they have precipitated themselves into a kind of Pelagianism. Nor,
          indeed, is the opinion of Augustine, or at least his manner of
          expression, to be altogether admitted. For though he excellently
          despoils man of all the praise of righteousness, and ascribes the
          whole to the grace of God, yet he refers grace to sanctification, in
          which we are regenerated by the Spirit to newness of life.

          <span class="tab"></span>
          XVI. The Scripture, when speaking of the righteousness of faith, leads
          us to something very different. It teaches us, that being diverted
          from the contemplation of our own works, we should regard nothing but
          the mercy of God and the perfection of Christ. For it states this to
          be the order of justification; that from the beginning God deigns to
          embrace sinful man with his pure and gratuitous goodness,
          contemplating nothing in him to excite mercy, but his misery; (for God
          beholds him utterly destitute of all good works;) deriving from
          himself the motive for blessing him, that he may affect the sinner
          himself with a sense of his supreme goodness, who, losing all
          confidence in his own works, rests the whole of his salvation on the
          Divine mercy. This is the sentiment of faith, by which the sinner
          comes to the enjoyment of his salvation, when he knows from the
          doctrine of the gospel that he is reconciled to God; that having
          obtained remission of sins, he is justified by the intervention of the
          righteousness of Christ; and though regenerated by the Spirit of God,
          he thinks on everlasting righteousness reserved for him, not in the
          good works to which he devotes himself, but solely in the
          righteousness of Christ. When all these things shall have been
          particularly examined, they will afford a perspicuous explication of
          our opinion. They will, however, be better digested in a different
          order from that in which they have been proposed. But it is of little
          importance, provided they are so connected with each other, that we
          may have the whole subject rightly stated and well confirmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          XVII. Here it is proper to recall to remembrance the relation we have
          before stated between faith and the gospel; since the reason why faith
          is said to justify, is, that it receives and embraces the
          righteousness offered in the gospel. But its being offered by the
          gospel absolutely excludes all consideration of works. This Paul very
          clearly demonstrates on various occasions; and particularly in two
          passages. In his Epistle to the Romans, contrasting the law and the
          gospel, he says, “Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the
          law, that the man which doeth those things shall live by them. But the
          righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise: That if thou
          shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in
          thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be
          saved.” Do you perceive how he thus discriminates between the law and
          the gospel, that the former attributes righteousness to works, but the
          latter bestows it freely, without the assistance of works? It is a
          remarkable passage, and may serve to extricate us from a multitude of
          difficulties, if we understand that the righteousness which is given
          us by the gospel is free from all legal conditions. This is the reason
          why he more than once strongly opposes the promise to the law. “If the
          inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise;” and more in the
          same chapter to the same purpose. It is certain that the law also has
          its promises. Wherefore, unless we will confess the comparison to be
          improper, there must be something distinct and different in the
          promises of the gospel. Now, what can that be, but that they are
          gratuitous and solely dependent on the Divine mercy, whilst the
          promises of the law depend on the condition of works? Nor let any one
          object, that it is only the righteousness which men would obtrude on
          God from their own natural powers and free-will that is rejected;
          since Paul teaches it as a universal truth, that the precepts of the
          law are unprofitable, because, not only among the vulgar, but even
          among the very best of men, there is not one who can fulfil them. Love
          is certainly the principal branch of the law: when the Spirit of God
          forms us to it, why does it not constitute any part of our
          righteousness, but because even in the saints it is imperfect, and
          therefore of itself deserves no reward?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          XVIII. The other passage is as follows: “That no man is justified by
          the law in the sight of God, it is evident; for, The just shall live
          by faith. And the law is not of faith; but, The man that doeth them
          shall live in them.” How could this argument be supported, unless it
          were certain that works do not come into the account of faith, but are
          to be entirely separated from it? The law, he says, differs from
          faith. Why? Because works are required to the righteousness of the
          law. It follows, therefore, that works are not required to the
          righteousness of faith. From this statement it appears, that they who
          are justified by faith, are justified without the merit of works, and
          beyond the merit of works; for faith receives that righteousness which
          the gospel bestows; and the gospel differs from the law in this
          respect, that it does not confine righteousness to works, but rests it
          entirely on the mercy of God. He argues in a similar manner to the
          Romans, that “Abraham had not whereof to glory; for he believed God,
          and it was counted unto him for righteousness;” and by way of
          confirmation he subjoins, that then there is room for the
          righteousness of faith when there are no works which merit any reward.
          He tells us, that where there are works, they receive a reward “of
          debt,” but that what is given to faith is “of grace;” for this is the
          clear import of the language which he there uses. When he adds, a
          little after, “Therefore it is of faith” that we obtain the
          inheritance, in order “that it might be by grace,” he infers that the
          inheritance is gratuitous, because it is received by faith: and why is
          this, but because faith, without any assistance of works, depends
          wholly on the Divine mercy? And in the same sense undoubtedly he
          elsewhere teaches us, that “the righteousness of God without the law
          is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;” because,
          by excluding the law, he denies that righteousness is assisted by
          works, or that we obtain it by working, but asserts that we come empty
          in order to receive it.

        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          XIX. The reader will now discover, with what justice the sophists of
          the present day cavil at our doctrine, when we say that a man is
          justified by faith only. That a man is justified by faith, they do not
          deny, because the Scripture so often declares it; but since it is
          nowhere expressly said to be by faith only, they cannot bear this
          addition to be made. But what reply will they give to these words of
          Paul, where he contends that “righteousness is not of faith unless it
          be gratuitous?” How can any thing gratuitous consist with works? And
          by what cavils will they elude what he asserts in another place, that
          in the gospel “is the righteousness of God revealed?” If righteousness
          is revealed in the gospel, it is certainly not a mutilated and
          partial, but a complete and perfect one. The law, therefore, has no
          concern in it. And respecting this exclusive particle, only, they rest
          on an evasion which is not only false, but glaringly ridiculous. For
          does not he most completely attribute every thing to faith alone, who
          denies every thing to works? What is the meaning of these expressions
          of Paul? “Righteousness is manifested without the law,” “justified
          freely by his grace,” “justified without the deeds of the law.” Here
          they have an ingenious subterfuge, which, though it is not of their
          own invention, but borrowed from Origen and some of the ancients, is
          nevertheless very absurd. They pretend that the works excluded are the
          ceremonial works of the law, not the moral works. They have made such
          a proficiency by their perpetual disputations, that they have
          forgotten the first elements of logic. Do they suppose the apostle to
          have been insane, when he adduced these passages in proof of his
          doctrine? “The man that doeth them shall live in them;” and “Cursed is
          every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the
          book of the law to do them.” If they be in their sober senses, they
          will not assert that life was promised to the observers of ceremonies,
          and the curse denounced merely on the transgressors of them. If these
          places are to be understood of the moral law, it is beyond a doubt,
          that moral works likewise are excluded from the power to justify. To
          the same purpose are these arguments which he uses: “For by the law is
          the knowledge of sin;” consequently not righteousness. “Because the
          law worketh wrath,” therefore not righteousness. Since the law cannot
          assure our consciences, neither can it confer righteousness. Since
          faith is counted for righteousness, consequently righteousness is not
          a reward of works, but is gratuitously bestowed. Since we are
          justified by faith, boasting is precluded. “If there had been a law
          given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have
          been by the law. But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that
          the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that
          believe.” Let them idly pretend, if they dare, that these are
          applicable to ceremonies, not to morals; but even children would
          explode such consummate impudence. We may therefore be assured, that
          when the power of justifying is denied to the law, the whole law is
          included.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          XX. If any one should wonder why the apostle does not content himself
          with simply mentioning works, but says works of the law, the reason is
          obvious. For though works are so greatly esteemed, they derive their
          value from the Divine approbation rather than from any intrinsic
          excellence. For who can dare to boast to God of any righteousness of
          works, but what he has approved? Who can dare to claim any reward as
          due to them, but what he has promised? It is owing, therefore, to the
          Divine favour, that they are accounted worthy both of the title and of
          the reward of righteousness; and so they are valuable, only when they
          are intended as acts of obedience to God. Wherefore the apostle, in
          another place, in order to prove that Abraham could not be justified
          by works, alleges, that “the law was four hundred and thirty years
          after the covenant was confirmed.” Ignorant persons would ridicule
          such an argument, because there might have been righteous works before
          the promulgation of the law; but knowing that works have no such
          intrinsic worth, independently of the testimony and esteem of God, he
          has taken it for granted that, antecedently to the law, they had no
          power to justify. We know why he expressly mentions “the works of the
          law,” when he means to deny justification by works; it is because they
          alone can furnish any occasion of controversy. However, he likewise
          excludes all works, without any limitation, as when he says, “David
          describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth
          righteousness without works.” They cannot, therefore, by any
          subtleties prevent us from retaining this general exclusive particle.
          It is in vain, also, that they catch at another frivolous subtlety,
          alleging that we are justified only by that “faith which worketh by
          love;” with a view to represent righteousness as depending on love. We
          acknowledge, indeed, with Paul, that no other faith justifies, except
          that “which worketh by love;” but it does not derive its power to
          justify from the efficacy of that love. It justifies in no other way
          than as it introduces us into a participation of the righteousness of
          Christ. Otherwise there would be no force in the argument so
          strenuously urged by the apostle. “To him that worketh,” says he, “is
          the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh
          not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is
          counted for righteousness.” Was it possible for him to speak more
          plainly than by thus asserting, that there is no righteousness of
          faith, except where there are no works entitled to any reward; and
          that faith is imputed for righteousness, only when righteousness is
          conferred through unmerited grace?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          XXI. Now, let us examine the truth of what has been asserted in the
          definition, that the righteousness of faith is a reconciliation with
          God, which consists solely in remission of sins. We must always return
          to this axiom—That the Divine wrath remains on all men, as long as
          they continue to be sinners. This Isaiah has beautifully expressed in
          the following words: “The Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot
          save; neither is his ear heavy, that it cannot hear; but your
          iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have
          hid his face from you, that he will not hear.” We are informed, that
          sin makes a division between man and God, and turns the Divine
          countenance away from the sinner. Nor can it be otherwise; because it
          is incompatible with his righteousness to have any communion with sin.
          Hence the apostle teaches, that man is an enemy to God, till he be
          reconciled to him through Christ. Whom, therefore, the Lord receives
          into fellowship, him he is said to justify; because he cannot receive
          any one into favour or into fellowship with himself, without making
          him from a sinner to be a righteous person. This, we add, is
          accomplished by the remission of sins. For if they, whom the Lord has
          reconciled to himself, be judged according to their works, they will
          still be found actually sinners; who, notwithstanding, must be
          absolved and free from sin. It appears, then, that those whom God
          receives, are made righteous no otherwise than as they are purified by
          being cleansed from all their defilements by the remission of their
          sins; so that such a righteousness may, in one word, be denominated a
          remission of sins.

          <span class="tab"></span>
          XXII. Both these points are fully established by the language of Paul,
          which I have already recited. “God was in Christ, reconciling the
          world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
          committed unto us the word of reconciliation.” Then he adds the
          substance of his ministry: “He hath made him to be sin for us, who
          knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”
          The terms “righteousness” and “reconciliation” are here used by him
          indiscriminately, to teach us that they are mutually comprehended in
          each other. And he states the manner of obtaining this righteousness
          to consist in our transgressions not being imputed to us. Wherefore we
          can no longer doubt how God justifies, when we hear that he reconciles
          us to himself by not imputing our sins to us. Thus, in the Epistle to
          the Romans, the apostle proves, that “God imputeth righteousness
          without works,” from the testimony of David, who declares, “Blessed
          are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
          Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.” By
          “blessedness,” in this passage, he undoubtedly means righteousness;
          for since he asserts it to consist in remission of sins, there is no
          reason for our adopting any other definition of it. Wherefore
          Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist, places “the knowledge of
          salvation” in “the remission of sins.” And Paul, observing the same
          rule in the sermon which he preached to the people of Antioch on the
          subject of salvation, is stated by Luke to have concluded in the
          following manner: “Through this man is preached unto you the
          forgiveness of sins; and by him all that believe are justified from
          all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.”
          The apostle thus connects “forgiveness of sins” with “justification,”
          to show that they are identically the same; whence he justly argues,
          that this righteousness which we obtain through the favour of God is
          gratuitously bestowed upon us. Nor should it be thought a strange
          expression, that believers are justified before God, not by their
          works, but by his gracious acceptance of them; since it occurs so
          frequently in the Scripture, and sometimes also in the fathers.
          Augustine says, “The righteousness of the saints, in this world,
          consists rather in the remission of their sins than in the perfection
          of their virtues.” With which corresponds the remarkable observation
          of Bernard: “Not to sin at all, is the righteousness of God; but the
          righteousness of man is the Divine grace and mercy.” He had before
          asserted, “that Christ is righteousness to us in absolution, and
          therefore that they alone are righteous who have obtained pardon
          through his mercy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          XXIII. Hence, also, it is evident, that we obtain justification before
          God, solely by the intervention of the righteousness of Christ. Which
          is equivalent to saying, that a man is righteous, not in himself, but
          because the righteousness of Christ is communicated to him by
          imputation; and this is a point which deserves an attentive
          consideration. For it supersedes that idle notion, that a man is
          justified by faith, because faith receives the Spirit of God by whom
          he is made righteous; which is too repugnant to the foregoing
          doctrine, ever to be reconcilable to it. For he must certainly be
          destitute of all righteousness of his own, who is taught to seek a
          righteousness out of himself. This is most clearly asserted by the
          apostle, when he says, “He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no
          sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” We see
          that our righteousness is not in ourselves, but in Christ; and that
          all our title to it rests solely on our being partakers of Christ; for
          in possessing him, we possess all his riches with him. Nor does any
          objection arise from what he states in another place, that “God,
          sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
          condemned sin in the flesh; that the righteousness of the law might be
          fulfilled in us;” where he intends no other fulfilment than what we
          obtain by imputation. For the Lord Christ so communicates his
          righteousness to us, that, with reference to the Divine judgment, he
          transfuses its virtue into us in a most wonderful manner. That the
          apostle intended no other, abundantly appears from another
          declaration, which he had made just before: “As by one man's
          disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall
          many be made righteous.” What is placing our righteousness in the
          obedience of Christ, but asserting, that we are accounted righteous
          only because his obedience is accepted for us as if it were our own?
          Wherefore Ambrose appears to me to have very beautifully exemplified
          this righteousness in the benediction of Jacob; that as he, who had on
          his own account no claim to the privileges of primogeniture, being
          concealed in his brother's habit, and invested with his garment, which
          diffused a most excellent odour, insinuated himself into the favour of
          his father, that he might receive the benediction to his own
          advantage, under the character of another; so we shelter ourselves
          under the precious purity of Christ our elder brother, that we may
          obtain the testimony of righteousness in the sight of God. The words
          of Ambrose are, “That Isaac smelled the odour of the garments, perhaps
          indicates, that we are justified not by works, but by faith; since the
          infirmity of the flesh is an impediment to works, but the brightness
          of faith, which merits the pardon of sin, conceals the error of our
          actions.” And such is indeed the real fact; for that we may appear
          before the face of God to salvation, it is necessary for us to be
          perfumed with his fragrance, and to have all our deformities concealed
          and absorbed in his perfection.

            >Chapter XII. A Consideration Of The Divine Tribunal, Necessary To A
            Serious Conviction Of Gratuitous Justification.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          I. Though it appears, from the plainest testimonies, that all these
          things are strictly true, yet we shall not clearly discover how
          necessary they are, till we shall have taken a view of what ought to
          be the foundation of all this argument. In the first place, therefore,
          we should reflect that we are not treating of the righteousness of a
          human court, but of that of the heavenly tribunal; in order that we
          may not apply any diminutive standard of our own, to estimate the
          integrity of conduct required to satisfy the Divine justice. But it is
          wonderful, with what temerity and presumption this is commonly
          decided; and it is even observable, that no men give us more confident
          or pompous declamations concerning the righteousness of works, than
          those who are notoriously guilty of open sins or addicted to secret
          vices. This arises from their never thinking of the righteousness of
          God, the smallest sense of which would prevent them from treating it
          with such contempt. And certainly it is exceedingly undervalued, if it
          be not acknowledged to be so perfect that nothing can be acceptable to
          it but what is absolutely complete and immaculate, such as it never
          was, nor ever will be, possible to find in fallen man. It is easy for
          any one in the cloisters of the schools, to indulge himself in idle
          speculations on the merit of works to justify men; but when he comes
          into the presence of God, he must bid farewell to these amusements,
          for there the business is transacted with seriousness, and no
          ludicrous logomachy practised. To this point, then, must our attention
          be directed, if we wish to make any useful inquiry concerning true
          righteousness; how we can answer the celestial Judge, when he shall
          call us to an account. Let us place that Judge before our eyes, not
          according to the spontaneous imaginations of our minds, but according
          to the descriptions given of him in the Scripture; which represents
          him as one whose refulgence eclipses the stars, whose power melts the
          mountains, whose anger shakes the earth, whose wisdom takes the subtle
          in their own craftiness, whose purity makes all things appear
          polluted, whose righteousness even the angels are unable to bear, who
          acquits not the guilty, whose vengeance, when it is once kindled,
          penetrates even to the abyss of hell. Let him seat himself, I say, on
          the tribunal, to examine the actions of men: who will present himself
          fearless before his throne? “Who shall dwell with the devouring fire?”
          saith the prophet. “Who shall dwell with everlasting burnings? He that
          walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly,” &c. Now let him come
          forward, whoever he is. But this answer causes not one to appear. For,
          on the contrary, we hear this fearful speech, “If thou, Lord, shouldst
          mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?” In truth, all must speedily
          perish, as it is written in another place, “Shall mortal man be more
          just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker? Behold, he put
          no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly; how
          much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in
          the dust, which are crushed before the moth? They are destroyed from
          morning to evening.” Again: “Behold, he putteth no trust in his
          saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight; how much more
          abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?” I
          confess that in the Book of Job mention is made of a righteousness
          which is superior to the observance of the law. And it will be of use
          to remember this distinction; because, though any one could satisfy
          the law, he could not even then stand the scrutiny of that
          righteousness which exceeds all comprehension. Therefore, though Job
          is conscious of his own integrity, yet he is mute with astonishment,
          when he sees that God could not be pleased even with the sanctity of
          angels, if he were to enter into a strict examination of their works.
          I shall, therefore, now pass over that righteousness to which I have
          alluded, because it is incomprehensible, and content myself with
          asserting, that we must be worse than stupid, if, on an examination of
          our lives by the rule of the written law, we are not tormented with
          awful dread in consequence of so many maledictions, which God has
          designed to arouse us, and among the rest this general one: “Cursed be
          he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them.” In
          short, this whole controversy will be uninteresting and useless,
          unless every one present himself as a criminal before the celestial
          Judge, and voluntarily prostrate and humble himself in deep solicitude
          concerning his absolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          II. To this point our eyes ought to have been raised, that we might
          learn rather to tremble through fear, than to indulge in vain
          exultation. It is easy, indeed, while the comparison is made only
          between men, for every man to imagine himself to be possessed of
          something which others ought not to contemn; but when we ascend to the
          contemplation of God, that confidence is immediately lost. And the
          case of our soul with respect to God is similar to that of our body
          with respect to the visible heavens; for the eye, as long as it is
          employed in beholding adjacent objects, receives proofs of its own
          perspicacity; but if it be directed towards the sun, dazzled and
          confounded with his overpowering brightness, it feels no less debility
          in beholding him, than strength in the view of inferior objects. Let
          us not, then, deceive ourselves with a vain confidence, although we
          consider ourselves equal or superior to other men. That is nothing to
          God, to whose decision this cause must be submitted. But if our
          insolence cannot be restrained by these admonitions, he will reply to
          us in the language which he addressed to the Pharisees: “Ye are they
          which justify yourselves before men; but that which is highly esteemed
          among men, is abomination in the sight of God.” Go now, and among men
          proudly glory in your righteousness, while the God of heaven
          abominates it. But what is the language of the servants of God, who
          are truly taught by his Spirit? One says, “Enter not into judgment
          with thy servant; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.”
          And another, though in a sense somewhat different, “How should man be
          just with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one
          of a thousand.” Here we are plainly informed respecting the
          righteousness of God, that it is such as no human works can satisfy;
          and such as renders it impossible for us, if accused of a thousand
          crimes, to exculpate ourselves from one of them. The same idea of this
          righteousness had very properly been entertained by Paul, that “chosen
          vessel” of God, when he professed, “I am conscious to myself of
          nothing; yet am I not hereby justified.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          III. Nor is it only in the sacred Scriptures that such examples are
          found. All pious writers discover similar sentiments. Thus Augustine
          says, “The only hope of all the pious, who groan under this burden of
          corruptible flesh, and amidst the infirmities of this life, is, that
          we have a Mediator, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the
          propitiation for our sins.” What is the meaning of this observation?
          If this is their only hope, where is any confidence in works? For when
          he asserts this to be the only one, he precludes every other. Bernard
          also says, “And in fact where can be found safe and solid rest and
          security for the weak, but in the wounds of the Saviour? There I dwell
          with the greater security, in proportion to his power to save. The
          world rages, the body oppresses, the devil lies in wait to destroy. I
          do not fall, because my foundation is on a firm rock. I have committed
          heinous sin. My conscience is disturbed, but shall not fall into
          despair, because I shall recall to remembrance the wounds of the
          Lord.” From these considerations he afterwards concludes, “My merit,
          therefore, is the compassion of the Lord: I am clearly not destitute
          of merit, as long as he is not destitute of compassions. But if the
          mercies of the Lord be a multitude of mercies, my merits are likewise
          equally numerous. Shall I sing of my own righteousness? O Lord, I will
          remember thy righteousness alone. For it is mine also, since he is
          made of God righteousness unto me.” Again, in another place: “This is
          the whole merit of man—to fix all his hope on him who saves the whole
          man.” Likewise in another place, retaining peace to himself, and
          ascribing the glory to God, he says, “To thee let the glory remain
          undiminished. It is happy for me, if I have peace. The glory I
          entirely renounce; lest, if I usurp what is not mine, I lose also that
          which is offered me.” In another place he is still more explicit: “Why
          should the Church be solicitous about merits, while it has a stronger
          and more secure reason for glorying in the designs of God? You need
          not inquire on account of what merits we hope for blessings,
          especially when you read in the prophet, ‘Thus saith the Lord God; I
          do not this for your sakes, but for mine holy name's sake.’ It
          suffices with respect to merit, to know that merits are not
          sufficient; but as it suffices for merit not to presume on merits, so
          to be destitute of merits is sufficient cause of condemnation.” We
          must excuse his custom of freely using the word merits for good works.
          But his ultimate design was to terrify hypocrites, who indulge
          themselves in a licentious course of sin against the grace of God; as
          he presently declares: “Happy is the Church which wants neither merits
          without presumption, nor presumption without merits. It has some
          ground of presumption, but not merits. It has merits, but in order to
          deserve, not to presume. Is not the absence of presumption itself a
          merit? Therefore the Church presumes the more securely, because it
          does not presume, having ample cause for glorying in the multitude of
          the Divine mercies.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          IV. This is the real truth. The troubled conscience finds this to be
          the only asylum of safety, where it can enjoy any tranquillity, when
          it has to do with the Divine justice. For if the stars, which appeared
          most brilliant during the night, lose their splendour on the rising of
          the sun, what can we suppose will be the case with the most excellent
          innocence of man, when compared with the purity of God? For that will
          be an examination inconceivably severe, which shall penetrate into all
          the most secret thoughts of the heart, and, as Paul says, “bring to
          light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of
          the hearts;” which shall constrain the reluctant conscience to confess
          all those things which have now passed away even from our own
          remembrance. We shall be urged by an accusing devil, who has been
          privy to all the crimes which he has impelled us to perpetrate. There
          the external appearance of good works, which now is the sole object of
          esteem, will be of no avail; sincerity of heart is all that will be
          required. Wherefore hypocrisy, not only that by which a man, conscious
          of his guilt before God, affects ostentation before men, but that also
          by which every man imposes on himself before God, for we are all prone
          to self-complacency and adulation; hypocrisy in all its forms will
          then be overwhelmed with confusion, however it may now be intoxicated
          with presumption and pride. Persons who never look forward to such a
          spectacle, may, indeed, delightfully and complacently compose for
          themselves a temporary righteousness, of which they will immediately
          be stripped at the Divine judgment; just as immense riches,
          accumulated by us in a dream, vanish as soon as we awake. But they who
          inquire seriously, and as in the presence of God, respecting the true
          standard of righteousness, will certainly find that all the actions of
          men, if estimated according to their intrinsic worth, are utterly
          defiled and polluted; that what is commonly considered as
          righteousness, is, in the Divine view, nothing but iniquity; that what
          is accounted integrity, is mere pollution; and that what is reputed
          glory, is real ignominy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          V. From this contemplation of the Divine perfection, let us not be
          unwilling to descend to take a view of ourselves, without adulation or
          blind self-love. For it is not to be wondered at, if we are so
          extremely blind in this respect, since not one of us is sufficiently
          cautious of that pestilent self-indulgence, which the Scripture
          declares to be naturally inherent in us all. “Every way of man,” says
          Solomon, “is right in his own eyes.” Again: “All the ways of a man are
          clean in his own eyes.” But what follows from this? Is he absolved
          from guilt by this delusion? Not at all; but, as is immediately added,
          “the Lord weigheth the spirits;” that is, while men are congratulating
          themselves on account of the external mask of righteousness which they
          wear, the Lord is at the same time weighing in his own balance the
          latent impurity of their hearts. Since we are so far from deriving any
          advantage, therefore, from such blandishments, let us not voluntarily
          delude ourselves to our own perdition. That we may examine ourselves
          properly, it is necessary for us to summon our conscience to the
          tribunal of God. For we have the greatest need of his light in order
          to detect the recesses of our depravity, which otherwise are too
          deeply concealed. For then only shall we clearly perceive the force of
          this language: “How can man be justified with God—man, who is”
          corruption and “a worm, abominable and filthy, and who drinketh
          iniquity like water?” “Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?
          Not one.” Then also we shall experience what Job said concerning
          himself: “If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me; if I
          say I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.” For the complaint,
          which the prophet formerly made respecting Israel, “All we like sheep
          have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;” is
          applicable not only to one period of time, but to all ages. For he
          there comprehends all to whom the grace of redemption was to extend;
          and the rigour of this examination ought to proceed till it shall have
          filled us with complete consternation, and thus prepared us to receive
          the grace of Christ. For he is deceived who supposes himself capable
          of this enjoyment, without having first been truly humbled. It is a
          well-known observation, that “God resisteth the proud, and giveth
          grace to the humble.”
        </p>
        <p>

          VI. But what means have we of humbling ourselves, except by
          submitting, all poor and destitute, to the Divine mercy? For I do not
          call it humility, if we suppose that we have any thing left. And
          hitherto they have taught a pernicious hypocrisy, who have connected
          these two maxims—that we should entertain humble thoughts of ourselves
          before God, and that we should attach some dignity to our own
          righteousness. For if we address to God a confession which is contrary
          to our real sentiments, we are guilty of telling him an impudent
          falsehood; but we cannot think of ourselves as we ought to think,
          without utterly despising every thing that may be supposed an
          excellence in us. When we hear, therefore, from the Psalmist, that
          “God will save the afflicted people, but will bring down high looks,”
          let us consider, first, that there is no way of salvation till we have
          laid aside all pride, and attained sincere humility; secondly, that
          this humility is not a species of modesty, consisting in conceding to
          God a small portion of what we might justly claim, as they are called
          humble among men, who neither haughtily exalt themselves nor behave
          with insolence to others, while they nevertheless entertain some
          consciousness of excellence: this humility is the unfeigned submission
          of a mind overwhelmed with a weighty sense of its own misery and
          poverty; for such is the uniform description of it in the word of God.
          When the Lord speaks thus in Zephaniah, “I will take away out of the
          midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride; I will also leave in the
          midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in
          the name of the Lord;” does he not clearly show who are truly humble?
          even such as are afflicted with a knowledge of their own poverty. On
          the contrary, he describes the proud as persons “rejoicing,” because
          this is the usual consequence of prosperity. But to the humble, whom
          he intends to save, he leaves nothing but that “they trust in the name
          of the Lord.” Thus also in Isaiah, “To this man will I look, even to
          him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.”
          Again: “Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,
          whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also
          that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the
          humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.” By the
          contrition so frequently mentioned, we must understand a wounded
          heart, which prevents a man from rising when humbled in the dust. With
          such contrition must our heart be wounded, if we desire, according to
          the declaration of the Lord, to be exalted with the humble. If this be
          not the case, we shall be abased by the powerful hand of God to our
          shame and disgrace.

          <span class="tab"></span>
          VII. And, not content with mere precepts, our excellent Master, in a
          parable, as in a picture, has presented us with an example of genuine
          humility. For he introduces a publican, who, “standing afar off, would
          not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his
          breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.” We must not conclude
          these circumstances—his not presuming to look upwards, standing afar
          off, smiting upon his breast, and confessing himself a sinner—to be
          marks of feigned modesty; we may be certain that they were sincere
          evidences of the disposition of his heart. To him our Lord opposes a
          Pharisee, who said, “God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are,
          extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast
          twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.” He openly
          confesses the righteousness which he has, to be the gift of God; but
          because he confides in his being righteous, he departs from the
          presence of God unacceptable and hateful to him. The publican,
          acknowledging his iniquity, is justified. Hence we may see how very
          pleasing our humiliation is in the sight of God; so that the heart is
          not open for the reception of his mercy unless it be divested of all
          idea of its own dignity. When this notion has occupied the mind, it
          precludes the admission of Divine mercy. That no one might have any
          doubt of this, Christ was sent by his Father into the world with a
          commission, “to preach good tidings unto the meek; to bind up the
          broken-hearted; to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening
          of the prison to them that are bound; to comfort all that mourn; to
          give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the
          garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.” In pursuance of this
          commission, he invites to a participation of his benefits none but
          those who “labour and are heavy laden.” And in another place he says,
          “I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          VIII. Therefore, if we would obey the call of Christ, let us dismiss
          all arrogance and carelessness from our minds. The former arises from
          a foolish persuasion of our own righteousness, when a man supposes
          himself to be possessed of any thing, the merit of which can recommend
          him to God; the latter may exist without any consideration of works.
          For multitudes of sinners, inebriated with criminal pleasures, and
          forgetful of the Divine judgment, are in a state, as it were, of
          lethargic insensibility, so that they never aspire after the mercy
          which is offered to them. But it is equally necessary for us to shake
          off such stupidity, and to reject all confidence in ourselves, in
          order that, being freed from every incumbrance, we may hasten to
          Christ, all destitute and hungry, to be filled with his blessings. For
          we shall never have sufficient confidence in him, unless we entirely
          lose all confidence in ourselves; we shall never find sufficient
          encouragement in him, unless we are previously dejected in ourselves;
          we shall never enjoy sufficient consolation in him, unless we are
          utterly disconsolate in ourselves. We are prepared, therefore, to seek
          and obtain the grace of God, discarding at the same time all
          confidence in ourselves, and relying solely on the assurance of his
          mercy, “when,” as Augustine says, “forgetting our own merits, we
          embrace the free gifts of Christ; because, if he sought merits in us,
          we should not come to his free gifts.” With him Bernard fully agrees,
          when he compares proud men, that arrogate ever so little to their own
          merits, to unfaithful servants, because they unjustly claim the praise
          of the grace which passes through them; just as though a wall should
          say that it produces the sunbeams which it receives through a window.
          But not to dwell any longer on this, we may lay it down as a brief,
          but general and certain maxim, that he is prepared for a participation
          of the benefits of Divine mercy, who has wholly divested himself, I
          will not say of his righteousness, which is a mere nullity, but of the
          vain and airy phantom of righteousness; for as far as any man is
          satisfied with himself, so far he raises an impediment to the exercise
          of the grace of God.

            Justification.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          I. Here are two things to which we must always be particularly
          attentive; to maintain the glory of the Lord unimpaired and
          undiminished, and to preserve in our own consciences a placid
          composure and serene tranquillity with regard to the Divine judgment.
          We see how frequently and solicitously the Scripture exhorts us to
          render ascriptions of praise to God alone, when it treats of
          justification. And, indeed, the apostle assures us that the design of
          the Lord in conferring righteousness upon us in Christ, is to manifest
          his own righteousness. The nature of that manifestation he immediately
          subjoins: it is, “that he might be just, and the justifier of him
          which believeth in Jesus.” The righteousness of God, we see, is not
          sufficiently illustrious, unless he alone be esteemed righteous, and
          communicate the grace of justification to the unworthy. For this
          reason it is his will “that every mouth be stopped, and all the world
          become guilty before him;” because, as long as man has any thing to
          allege in his own defence, it detracts something from the glory of
          God. Thus in Ezekiel he teaches us how greatly we glorify his name by
          an acknowledgment of our iniquity: “Ye shall remember your ways,
          (saith he,) and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye
          shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye
          have committed. And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have
          wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked
          ways, nor according to your corrupt doings.” If these things are
          contained in the true knowledge of God, that, humbled with a
          consciousness of our iniquity, we should consider him as indulging us
          with blessings of which we are unworthy, why do we attempt, to our own
          serious injury, to pilfer the smallest particle of the praise due to
          his gratuitous goodness? Thus also when Jeremiah proclaims, “Let not
          the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in
          his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches; but let him that
          glorieth glory in the Lord;” does he not suggest that the glory of God
          sustains some diminution, if any man glory in himself? To this use
          these words are clearly applied by Paul, when he states, that all the
          branches of our salvation are deposited with Christ, that we may not
          glory except in the Lord. For he intimates, that they who suppose
          themselves to have even the least ground for glorying in themselves,
          are guilty of rebelling against God, and obscuring his glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          II. The truth, then, is, that we never truly glory in him, till we
          have entirely renounced all glory of our own. On the converse, this
          may be admitted as an axiom universally true, that they who glory in
          themselves, glory in opposition to God. For Paul is of opinion that
          the world is not “subject to the judgment of God,” till men are
          deprived of all foundation for glorying. Therefore Isaiah, when he
          announces, that “in the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be
          justified,” adds also, “and shall glory;” as though he had said, that
          the end of God in justifying the elect was, that they might glory in
          himself, and in no other. But how we should glory in the Lord, he had
          stated in the preceding verse: “Surely, shall one say, in the Lord
          have I righteousness and strength.” Let us observe, that what is
          required is not a simple confession, but a confession confirmed by an
          oath; that we may not suppose any fictitious pretence of humility to
          be sufficient. Here let no one plead that he does not glory at all,
          when without arrogance he recognizes his own righteousness; for such
          an opinion cannot exist without generating confidence, nor confidence
          without being attended with glorying. Let us remember, therefore, in
          the whole controversy concerning righteousness, that this end must be
          kept in view, that all the praise of it may remain perfect and
          undiminished with the Lord; because, according to the apostle's
          testimony, he has bestowed his grace on us in order “to declare his
          righteousness; that he might be just, and the justifier of him which
          believeth in Jesus.” Wherefore, in another place, after having
          declared that the Lord has conferred salvation on us in order to
          display “the praise of the glory of his grace,”2000 repeating, as it
          were, the same sentiment, he adds, “By grace are ye saved through
          faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of
          works, lest any man should boast.”2001 And when Peter admonishes us
          that we are called to the hope of salvation, “that we should show
          forth the praises (or virtues) of him who hath called us out of
          darkness into his marvellous light,”2002 he evidently means that the
          praises of God alone should resound in the ears of believers, so as to
          impose total silence on all the presumption of the flesh. The
          conclusion of the whole is, that man cannot without sacrilege arrogate
          to himself the least particle of righteousness, because it is so much
          detracted and diminished from the glory of the righteousness of God.

          <span class="tab"></span>
          III. Now, if we inquire by what means the conscience can obtain peace
          before God, we shall find no other than our reception of gratuitous
          righteousness from his free gift. Let us always remember the inquiry
          of Solomon—“Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my
          sin?”2003 It is certain that there is no man who is not covered with
          infinite pollution. Let a man of the most perfect character, then,
          retire into his own conscience, and enter into a scrutiny of his
          actions, and what will be the result? Will he feel a high degree of
          satisfaction, as though there were the most entire agreement between
          God and him? or will he not rather be lacerated with terrible agonies,
          on perceiving in himself such ample cause for condemnation, if he be
          judged according to his works? If the conscience reflect on God, it
          must either enjoy a solid peace with his judgment, or be surrounded
          with the terrors of hell. We gain nothing, therefore, in our
          discussions of this point, unless we establish a righteousness, the
          stability of which will support our souls under the scrutiny of the
          Divine judgment. When our souls shall possess what will enable them to
          appear with boldness in the presence of God, and to await and receive
          his judgment without any fear, then, and not before, we may be assured
          that we have found a righteousness which truly deserves the name. It
          is not without reason, therefore, that this subject is so largely
          insisted on by the apostle, whose words I prefer to my own: “For if
          they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the
          promise is made of none effect.”2004 He first infers, that faith is
          annulled and superseded, if the promise of righteousness respect the
          merit of our works, or depend on our observance of the law. For no man
          could ever securely rely on it, since he never would be able to
          determine with certainty for himself that he had fulfilled the law, as
          in fact no man ever does completely satisfy it by any works of his
          own. Not to seek far for testimonies of this fact, every individual
          may be his own witness of it, who will enter unprejudiced into an
          examination of himself. And hence it appears in what deep and dark
          recesses hypocrisy buries the minds of men, while they indulge
          themselves in such great security, and hesitate not to oppose their
          self-adulation to the judgment of God, as though they would stop the
          proceedings of his tribunal. But believers, who sincerely examine
          themselves, are troubled and distressed with a solicitude of a very
          different nature. The minds of men universally, therefore, ought to
          feel first hesitation, and then despair, while considering, every one
          for himself, the magnitude of the debt with which they are still
          oppressed, and their immense distance from the conditions prescribed
          to them. Behold their confidence already broken and extinguished; for
          to confide is not to fluctuate, to vary, to be hurried hither and
          thither, to hesitate, to be kept in suspense, to stagger, and finally
          to despair; but it is, to strengthen the mind with content, certainty,
          and solid security, and to have somewhat upon which to stand and to
          rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          IV. He adds likewise another consideration, that the promise would be
          void and of none effect. For if the fulfilment of it depend on our
          merit, when shall we have made such a progress as to deserve the
          favour of God? Besides, this second argument is a consequence of the
          former, since the promise will be fulfilled to those alone who shall
          exercise faith in it. Therefore, if faith be wanting, the promise will
          retain no force. “Therefore the inheritance is of faith, that it might
          be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the
          seed.”2005 For it is abundantly confirmed, when it depends solely on
          the Divine mercy; because mercy and truth are connected by an
          indissoluble bond, and whatever God mercifully promises, he also
          faithfully performs. Thus David, before he implores salvation for
          himself according to the word of God, first represents it as
          originating in his mercy: “According to thy word unto thy servant, let
          thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live.”2006 And for this
          there is sufficient reason, since God has no other inducement to
          promise than what arises from his mere mercy. Here, then, we must
          place, and, as it were, deeply fix, all our hopes, without regarding
          our own works, or seeking any assistance from them. Nor must it be
          supposed that we are advancing a new doctrine, for the same conduct is
          recommended by Augustine. “Christ,” says he, “will reign in his
          servants for ever. God has promised this, God has said it; if that be
          insufficient, God has sworn it. Since the promise, therefore, is
          established, not according to our merits, but according to his mercy,
          no man ought to speak with anxiety of that which he cannot doubt.”
          Bernard also says, “The disciples of Christ asked, Who can be saved?
          He replied, With men this is impossible, but not with God. This is all
          our confidence, this our only consolation, this the whole foundation
          of our hope. But certain of the possibility, what think we of his
          will? Who knows whether he deserve love or hatred?2007 Who has known
          the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counsellor?2008 Here, now,
          we evidently need faith to help us, and his truth to assist us; that
          what is concealed from us in the heart of the Father, may be revealed
          by the Spirit, and that the testimony of the Spirit may persuade our
          hearts that we are sons of God; that he may persuade us by calling and
          justifying us freely by faith; in which there is, as it were, an
          intermediate passage from eternal predestination to future glory.” Let
          us draw the following brief conclusion: The Scripture declares that
          the promises of God have no efficacy, unless they be embraced by the
          conscience with a steady confidence; and whenever there is any doubt
          or uncertainty, it pronounces them to be made void. Again, it asserts
          that they have no stability if they depend on our works. Either,
          therefore, we must be for ever destitute of righteousness, or our
          works must not come into consideration, but the ground must be
          occupied by faith alone, whose nature it is to open the ears and shut
          the eyes; that is, to be intent only on the promise, and to avert the
          thoughts from all human dignity or merit. Thus is accomplished that
          remarkable prophecy of Zechariah: “I will remove the iniquity of that
          land in one day. In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall ye call
          every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig-tree;”2009 in
          which the prophet suggests that believers enjoy no true peace till
          after they have obtained the remission of their sins. For this analogy
          must be observed in the prophets, that when they treat of the kingdom
          of Christ, they exhibit the external bounties of God as figures of
          spiritual blessings. Wherefore also Christ is denominated “the Prince
          of peace,” and “our Peace;”2010 because he calms all the agitations of
          the conscience. If we inquire, by what means; we must come to the
          sacrifice by which God is appeased. For no man will ever lose his
          fears who shall not be assured that God is propitiated solely by that
          atonement which Christ has made by sustaining his wrath. In short, we
          must seek for peace only in the terrors of Christ our Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          V. But why do I use such an obscure testimony? Paul invariably denies
          that peace or tranquillity can be enjoyed in the conscience, without a
          certainty that we are justified by faith.2011 And he also declares
          whence that certainty proceeds; it is “because the love of God is shed
          abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost;”2012 as though he had said
          that our consciences can never be satisfied without a certain
          persuasion of our acceptance with God. Hence he exclaims in the name
          of all believers, “Who shall separate us from the love of God which is
          in Christ?”2013 For till we have reached that port of safety, we shall
          tremble with alarm at every slightest breeze; but while God shall
          manifest himself as our Shepherd, we shall fear no evil even in the
          valley of the shadow of death.2014 Whoever they are, therefore, who
          pretend that we are justified by faith, because, being regenerated, we
          are righteous by living a spiritual life, they have never tasted the
          sweetness of grace, so as to have confidence that God would be
          propitious to them. Whence also it follows, that they know no more of
          the method of praying aright, than the Turks or any other profane
          nations. For according to the testimony of Paul, faith is not genuine
          unless it dictate and suggest that most delightful name of Father, and
          unless it open our mouth freely to cry, “Abba, Father;”2015 which he
          in another place expresses still more clearly: “In Christ we have
          boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.”2016 This
          certainly arises not from the gift of regeneration; which, being
          always imperfect in the present state, contains in itself abundant
          occasion of doubting. Wherefore it is necessary to come to this
          remedy; that believers should conclude that they cannot hope for an
          inheritance in the kingdom of heaven on any other foundation, but
          because, being ingrafted into the body of Christ, they are
          gratuitously accounted righteous. For with respect to justification,
          faith is a thing merely passive, bringing nothing of our own to
          conciliate the favour of God, but receiving what we need from Christ.
