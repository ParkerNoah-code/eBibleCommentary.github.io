          FIFTH QUESTION: THE REMISSION OF SINS
          <br />

          <em
            >Does remission of sins consist in an absolute removal of them? Or
            in the pardon of them? And after the guilt is remitted is a certain
            punishment retained? Or is it wholly remitted? The former we deny;
            the latter we affirm against the Romanists</em
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Because various questions are wont to be agitated concerning the
          remission of sins, we must touch briefly upon them under three
          propositions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >The first proposition, concerning the remission of sins, which is
            not the abolition of them, against the Romanists.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The first: remission of sins does not consist in a removal of the
          corruption or depraved quality, but in a gratuitous pardon of the
          criminality and guilt arising from it. This is opposed to the
          Romanists, who, to support their hypothesis concerning physical
          justification by infusion, maintain that remission of sin consists in
          a real taking away of it, as to corruption as well as to guilt. Thus
          an infusion of righteousness always succeeds remission, as light
          always follows the scattering of the clouds of darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But the following arguments prove the falsehood of this opinion.
          (1) The mode of speaking and the proper signification of remission
          among men, which does not imply the extinction of sin, but only the
          pardoning of it (as a prince, by remitting a crime, does not take it
          away, but only pardons it and frees it from the punishment due on
          account of it). (2) The synonymous phrases of Scripture teach the same
          thing when remission is expressed by a “covering” (Ps. 32:1). Not that
          they are not, but that in the sight of God the Judge, they do not come
          into condemnation. For this reason, we ought to put on Christ that his
          righteousness may cover our sins before God. By a “not imputing” (Ps.
          31:2) that on account of them we may not be punished as we deserve. By
          a “not remembering” (Jer. 31:34) that God may not deal with them
          practically according to his justice in punishing them. By a “blotting
          out” (Pss. 51:1; 103:12; Acts 3:19; Col. 2:14) not of the corruption
          but of the guilt, as a creditor expunges from his account book a debt
          from which he wishes to release the debtor by destroying and blotting
          out the very handwriting that it may no longer have any force. Even so
          God destroys the sins which are written in his book and for which we
          are accountable (hypodikoi) when he pardons them by freeing us from
          the guilt which attached to us on account of them. By a “casting of
          them behind his back” and “throwing them into the sea” (Mic. 7:19)
          that they may no more come into judgment. By a “purging” by way of
          propitiation and of offering (hilasmou, Heb. 1:3; 9:14) that the guilt
          of sin (which makes us hateful and abominable to God) may be cleansed;
          in allusion to the sprinkling (rhantismon) of the old sacrifices,
          which did not take away inherent pollution, but adhering guilt. By a
          “turning away” of “his face” (Ps. 51:9) and a “putting away” (2 S.
          12:13) and similar phrases which rightly mean a juridical pardoning of
          guilt, not a real removal of pollution.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. (3) If remission of sin was the taking away of inherent
          corruption, as the former is perfect, so also the latter ought to be
          perfect (which is repugnant to Scripture, which testifies that sin
          always remains in us and belongs to the experience of saints, who
          always complain of the struggles of the flesh and the Spirit). (4) If
          not to impute sin is to expel it and to infuse righteousness; from the
          opposite, to impute sin will be to infuse sin. The falsity of this
          appears from the case of Christ, to whom sin was imputed, but not
          infused.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Sources of explanation.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Although by remission of sins actual guilt or the obligation to
          punishment is taken away, potential guilt is not immediately taken
          away or the intrinsic merit of sin (which flows from its inherent
          corruption) because remission consists only in this—that the guilty
          person is freed by the Judge from the actual punishment due to him,
          not however immediately from all vitiosity. Hence Paul indeed says
          there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ (Rom. 8:1), but
          he does not say there is nothing condemnable or worthy of
          condemnation. For as long as sin remains in us (now it remains as long
          as we live), there is always something condemnable, although on
          account of the interceding grace of the Judge it does not any more
          actually condemn us.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. There is a theoretical covering of sinners which belongs to
          omniscience, according to which it is certain that nothing can be
          covered by God except what he wholly destroys and abolishes; another
          practical (which has respect to the exercise of justice and thus can
          be covered by him)— what is still in the subject, when God does not
          see it so as to notice it, is blotted out of his book so that it may
          not come into account. Thus sins are said to be covered before God not
          because they are absolutely taken away (as they are not), but because
          they are not allotted to punishment. Hence Augustine says, “Therefore,
          why does he say his sins are covered? In order that they might not be
          seen. For what was it for God to see sins except to punish them?”
          (“Sermo ad Plebem,” Ennaratio in Psalmum XXXI: II [PL 36.264]).
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. Although the remission of sins is expressed by various phrases
          (which denote a real taking away), it does not follow that they imply
          a total abolition of sin because in remission there is something real,
          since by it the actual obligation to punishment and the punishment
          itself are really and truly taken away from the person. Again, these
          phrases (such as “to take away,” “to bear away,” “to remove,” “to wash
          out,” “to purge sins”) are partly explained by others which signify
          the removal of guilt (not however the nonexistence of sin) and are
          partly drawn from the effect of sacrifices, which was the propitiation
          and purgation of sin; not by a removal of its corruption, but by a
          taking away of the guilt and a giving away (condonationem) of the
          punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Although we do not deny that sin is really abolished in those to
          whom it is remitted, it does not follow on that account that remission
          itself consists in that abolition. The former is concerned only with
          the guilt of sin, the latter with its pollution; the former considers
          sin with its relation or obligation to punishment, the latter as a
          quality inherent in the subject; that is performed at the same time
          and at once, this little by little and successively. Nor does an
          infusion of righteousness forthwith follow remission of sin from the
          nature of the thing, as he who remits another’s debt ought not at once
          to give a new sum of money to him. We pardon the sins of others, nor
          on that account do we expel them from them, since there is one action
          which is done concerning someone and about him objectively, another
          which is done in someone subjectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Second proposition: remission is total with respect to guilt as
            well as to punishment.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Second proposition: remission of sin is total and absolute with
          respect to guilt as well as to punishment. This is also against the
          Romanists, who urge a partial and not a total remission of guilt, but
          not of punishment; or of eternal, but not of temporal punishment. “If
          anyone says that after justification is received, criminality is so
          remitted to any penitent sinner and the guilt of eternal punishment
          destroyed, that no exposedness to temporal punishment to be taken away
          either in this world or in the future remains, before he can gain
          access into the kingdom of heaven, let him be accursed” (Council of
          Trent, Session 6, Canon 30, Schroeder, p. 46).
        </p>
        <p>
          X. For guilt to be remitted while the punishment is not remitted is
          absurd (asystaton) because there is no punishment without guilt and
          remission of guilt is nothing else than deliverance from punishment.
          (2) It is repugnant to Scripture which nowhere speaks of the remission
          of sin except on the supposition that no punishment of it is exacted;
          otherwise a great disturbance would be introduced into the Scriptures
          and nothing could be considered fixed and certain in them. Also great
          darkness would be poured over both the divine promises and
          threatenings, as often as either remission of sin is promised or
          denied (whether it is only of the guilt or also of the punishment; and
          whether of all or of a certain part of each). Again, how could God be
          said to cast behind his back, not to impute, to destroy, not to
          remember, if he still exacts the punishment of them (i.e., recollects
          and imputes them to punishment)? (3) The common manner of speaking
          does not suffer it to be said that his sin has been remitted from whom
          some punishment of sin is exacted. For thus anyone might be said at
          the same time and at once “to let go” (aphienai) and “to keep hold”
          (kratein) of something (which is a contradiction); as no one would say
          that a debt had been remitted to a person from whom the payment of it
          is still required. (4) The nature of remission, which is entirely
          gratuitous, cannot allow this because what is obtained by the payment
          of any price, cannot be called gratuitous. (5) The justified cannot
          have peace with God according to Paul (Rom. 5:1), if they are still to
          be disturbed in life or after death. (6) In believers after the
          reception of justification, there is no condemnation (Rom. 8:1).
          Therefore no punishment remains, since condemnation is the devoting to
          punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. (7) This hypothesis supposes either that Christ has not fully
          satisfied for us or that God demands the payment of the same debt
          twice (both of which are impious and blasphemous). Nor can it be
          replied, “Subordinates are not at variance because the satisfactions
          of men depend upon Christ’s satisfaction, and from it have the power
          of satisfying; that Christ satisfied immediately for the guilt and
          exposedness to eternal death, mediately, however, for temporal
          punishment also, inasmuch as he furnishes the grace by which we
          ourselves make satisfaction to God.” (a) It is gratuitously supposed
          that our satisfactions can be subordinated to Christ’s satisfaction,
          since they are expressly opposed to it. For if righteousness came by
          the law then Christ is dead in vain (Gal. 2:21). (b) This mediate
          satisfaction is unheard-of in Scripture, which never says that Christ
          satisfied that he might acquire for us the power to satisfy, but by
          himself (di’ heautou) made expiation for sins, and thus reconciled us
          to God and freed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for
          us. Now how could Christ be said to have borne our sins in his own
          body on the tree (i.e., their punishment) and to have freed us from
          the curse and to have blotted out and taken out of the way the
          handwriting which was against us (Col. 2:14) and by one offering to
          have perfected forever them that are sanctified (Heb. 10:14), if
          believers are still bound by the guilt of some punishments for which
          they are yet to make satisfaction? Finally, the mode of speaking does
          not suffer it to be said that he made satisfaction for us, unless he
          has cancelled our debt with his own money.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. No less absurd is the answer “Our satisfactions are required that
          the satisfaction of Christ and the remission acquired by him may be
          applied to us.” Although the satisfaction of Christ must be applied to
          particular believers to avail them, this ought to be done by the word
          and sacraments externally, by the Spirit and faith internally; but it
          cannot be done by satisfactions which ought to be offered to God, not
          to men. Nor have we ever heard it said that the remission of a debt is
          applied by an exaction of it and that this rests upon the debtor in
          order that he may enjoy the payment made for him by his security, so
          that the money which the sponsor paid for him, he also should pay out
          of his own funds to the creditor afterwards (or certainly some part of
          it). Again, if (in order that Christ’s satisfaction for temporal
          punishments may be applied to us) our satisfactions are required, why
          are they not equally necessary in order that the same may be applied
          for guilt and eternal punishment? Or if they confess that they are not
          required for that application, why should they be required for the
          other, since no reason for the difference can be assigned? Finally, if
          Christ’s satisfaction ought to be applied by our satisfaction, our
          satisfaction again would have to be applied by another satisfaction
          and so on to infinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. What Scripture sometimes says of the exercise of judgment
          against the church and believers (1 Pet. 4:17; 1 Cor. 11:32 and
          elsewhere) does not favor the error of the Romanists. The judgment of
          a vindictive judge is one thing; the judgment of paternal chastisement
          is another. The one is legal, the other evangelical; the one
          proceeding from wrath and hatred, the other from love and mercy; the
          one for destruction and death, the other for correction and salvation;
          the one is exercised against the wicked and rebels, the other towards
          the pious and believers, not to destroy, but to teach and make them
          more cautious afterwards. Hence Augustine says, “What you bewail is
          medicine, not a punishment; chastisement not condemnation; be
          unwilling to repel the rod, if you do not wish to be repelled from the
          inheritance” (Psalm 103* [102].17 [20] [NPNF1, 8:508; PL 37.1332]).
          The former is incompatible (asystaton) with remission, not the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. Although afflictions of themselves and in their own nature are
          truly the punishment of sin according to the threatening of the law
          (Lev. 26), still on account of our gratuitous reconciliation with God
          in Christ they cease to be punishments (timoriai). They become either
          fatherly chastisement (1 Cor. 11:32; Heb. 12:8); or necessary
          evidences (dokimasiai) that we may be manifested to ourselves and to
          others (Jam. 1:2, 3); or witnesses (martyria) or testimonies
          concerning the truth of doctrine (Acts 5:41). On this account, they
          are reckoned even among the blessings of God (Ps. 94:12; Job 5:17;
          Phil. 1:29; Heb. 12:6, 7). They are connected with joy (Acts 5:41;
          Jam. 1:2; Heb. 12:11). They have glorying as an attendant (Rom. 5:2,
          3). Therefore if they are still called punishments after the remission
          of sin, this is not said properly because they are without the formal
          reason of punishment (to wit, that it should be inflicted from the
          wrath of the Judge as the avenging of sin and the destruction of the
          sinner). Rather it is said improperly, both because they were of
          themselves the punishments of sin and because they tend to the
          destruction of the flesh and of the old man.
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. This full and total remission of sins being established, the
          treasury of papal indulgences sinks and that most foul trafficking of
          the mystery of iniquity is swept away. For if the remission granted to
          believers is entire and total, freeing them from all guilt and
          punishment, why are necessary satisfactions further invented (either
          personal or another’s) for the taking away of punishment, if not
          eternal at least temporal? I dismiss the various arguments, which
          prove not only the weakness but also the falsity of that error
          (concerning which we will speak in the proper place) from which it
          will appear that this comment is not only unwritten (agraphon), but
          also contrary to what is written (antigraphon) and unreasonable
          (alogon) and filled with innumerable contradictions and impieties.
          Hence it should not seem amazing if this occasioned (as is well known)
          the work of the Reformation in the year 1519 at Zurich by Zwingli; in
          the year 1517 at Wittenberg by Luther, who could not endure that most
          disgraceful traffic in sacred things.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. Nor ought we to recur to the indulgences of the fathers, which
          have nothing in common with the modern papal indulgences (as they
          cannot be ignorant who have any knowledge of the ancient discipline).
          Since it is evident that in the ancient church very severe canonical
          punishments and satisfactions were imposed upon public sinners by
          penitential canons, specimens of which can be seen not only in the
          canons of the councils of Elvira, Ancyra and Nicea, but also in the
          decrees of Burchard, Ivo and Gratian (which were not rendered properly
          to God in the court of heaven as a Satisfactory punishment for their
          sins, but only to the church itself for the extinction and reparation
          of the scandal by which it was injured). But since on account of that
          rigor many were reduced to desperation and relapsed into Gentilism, a
          modification of indulgences was introduced, which sinners obtained
          either by the intercession of martyrs or received from their bishops
          (their serious grief being regarded lest they should be swallowed up
          of sadness), by which, the severity being relaxed, they were restored
          to communion before the time required by the canons and a dispensation
          of canonical punishments was granted to them, as may be seen in
          Cyprian, Letters 15, 16, 17 (ACW 43:90-98); Canons 5 and 11 of the
          Council of Nicea (cf. Hefele, 1:386—87, 416-17); Canons 21 and 22 of
          the Council of Ancyra (a.b. 314) (Hefele, 1:220—21); and Canon 37 of
          the Council of Agathensis (Agde/Agatha, a.p. 506) (Hefele, 4:82).
          Afterwards most persons withdrawing from the yoke of the penitential
          canons, partly changes and partly redemptions of canonical
          satisfactions were introduced. Hence a fast of three days was redeemed
          by a recitation of fifty psalms, and by the feeding of some destitute
          person, or by three denarii from him who did not know the psalms
          (Burchard, Decretorum 19 [“Ex Poenitentiali Romano”] [PL
          140.949-1014]). This gate of redemptions, however, being once opened,
          the sale of indulgences at length began in the eleventh century under
          Urban II. To make them of greater importance, various comments were
          devised concerning their value and efficacy, not only in the court of
          earth (as to canonical punishment), but also in the court of heaven
          and as to the satisfaction to be rendered to divine justice for sins.
          Hence it is evident how much these indulgences differ from the
          ancient, which were nothing else than relaxations of canonical
          punishments and dispensations from their severity for the consolation
          of private persons and the common edification of the church. However
          the modern are held to be relaxations of the satisfactory punishments
          of divine justice.

          <b>Third proposition: remission ts extended to all sins.</b>
        </p>

          XVII. Third proposition: “Remission is extended to all the sins
          entirely of believers, of whatever kind they may be, future as well as
          past and present, but in their own order.” This question is moved with
          regard to future sins— are they also remitted at the same time and at
          once with the past and present sins? For there are some even of our
          theologians of great reputation who think that in the justification of
          the sinner all his sins (the future equally with the past) are at the
          same time and at once remitted, both because the righteousness of
          Christ, which is the foundation of our justification, is wholly
          (however great it is) imputed at once and at the same time to us and
          because justification ought to leave no room for condemnation (Rom.
          8:1). Nay, being justified, they have peace with God (Rom. 5:1) and
          are called blessed (Ps. 32:1). This could not be said if they could
          still be subjected to condemnation on account of future sins not
          remitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. We think the difficulty can be overcome by a distinction. All
          sins (future as well as past) cannot be said to be remitted at the
          same time and once formally and explicitly because as they are not
          accidents of a nonentity, so as long as the sin is not, punishment is
          not due to it; and since it is not due, it cannot be remitted (as a
          debt not yet contracted cannot be cancelled). Besides for the
          remission of sin there is required a confession and repentance of it,
          which cannot be made unless it has been committed. Hence we are
          ordered to seek remission of sins every day, which is to be applied to
          sins committed, not to anticipate their perpetration. But because in
          justification the righteousness of Christ is applied to us (which is
          the foundation upon which the remission of all our sins rests) and
          because from the covenant of grace God promises that he will not
          remember our sins, nothing prevents us from saying that in this sense
          sins are remitted eminently and virtually because in the righteousness
          of Christ imputed to us is the foundation of that remission. And thus
          all our sins are remitted by God, whether past or present or future,
          but with respect to the time in which they are committed; so that past
          and present are actually remitted, the future when they are committed
          will most certainly be remitted according to God’s promise. Thus the
          state of justification remaining undisturbed and the acceptation of
          the person remaining uninterrupted and the general remission of sins
          already committed, the following and future as to particular
          absolution are not actually pardoned before their commission; nay,
          before they have been repented of either generally or particularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. I confess if we regard the eternal purpose of God in which all
          things, even the future, appeared to God as present (Acts 15:18) and
          the merit and acquisition of Christ, who offered to God a perfectly
          sufficient ransom (lytron) for the expiation of all our sins, so that
          as to the promise given by God in the covenant of grace concerning
          their remission, remission under this relation (schesei) can be said
          to be extended to all sins whether past or future. But if the actual
          remission itself is regarded, which is made by an intimation of the
          absolving sentence in the heart of the believer and penitent, it can
          be referred only to sins already committed. Thus to take away the
          guilt of subsequent sins, there is required a particular application
          of remission, not only as to the sense and assurance of remission, but
          also as to the true and real forgiveness itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          XX. As the person whose sins are pardoned can be considered, either as
          to the state of grace (in which he is constituted by justification) or
          as to the particular acts (which he can afterwards commit), so
          remission can be viewed in two aspects: either generally as to state
          (according to which God receives the believing and penitent sinner
          into grace on account of Christ and bestows upon him the pardon of all
          the sins of which he is guilty); or specially as to particular acts of
          sin into which he afterwards falls, for taking away the guilt of which
          a particular absolution is needed. Not that the state of justification
          into which he is translated can be dissolved or remission once
          bestowed be abrogated, because God remains always his Father, but a
          Father angry on account of sins recently committed (which although
          they cannot constitute him a “child of wrath” on account of the
          immutability of calling and justification, still they make him a
          “child under wrath,” so that he deservedly incurs the fatherly
          indignation of God and has need forthwith of a new justification or
          particular remission of these sins through faith and repentance).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. Although the justified believer has not as yet the formal
          remission of future sins, he does not cease to be happy and free from
          actual condemnation because he has the foundation from which he can
          infer with positive certainty that it is prepared for him according to
          God’s promise. If the whole righteousness of Christ is at the same
          time imputed, its entire fruit does not flow out to us at once, but
          successively in proportion to the inrushings of sin (for the remission
          of which the believer ought to apply that ransom [lytron] to himself
          every day).
