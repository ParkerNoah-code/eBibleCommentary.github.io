          EIGHTH QUESTION:
          <br />
          <em>Does faith alone justify? We affirm against the Romanists</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. This question also lies between us and the Romanists, who not only
          corrupt the true mode of the justification of faith by making the
          instrumental cause meritorious or at least dispositive, but by
          connecting with it the other virtues both as attendants and companions
          in this act. Hence arose the controversy concerning “faith alone
          justifying” (sole Fide Justificante), which as it is of no less
          importance than the preceding, so it is agitated with no less warmth
          of spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Origin of the question.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This question is not of recent birth. Even from the very beginning
          of the Christian religion, this was asserted by the false apostles or
          Judaizing Christians. They did not with full front attack the faith as
          the Pharisees, but on the side by a deadly mixture associating the law
          with the gospel, Moses with Christ and faith with works in the matter
          of justification, so that man should be justified not by faith alone,
          but at the same time by works also. Against them the apostle disputes
          in his epistles to the Galatians, Philippians and Colossians. This is
          urged by the Romanists of this day, who hold that with faith, fear,
          hope, love, penitence, the purpose of a new life concurs to
          justification. “If anyone shall say that the wicked are justified by
          faith alone, so as to understand that nothing else is required to
          cooperate for the obtainment of the grace of justification and is
          necessary from no part, that he should be prepared and disposed by a
          motion of his own will, let him be accursed” (Council of Trent,
          Session 6, Canon 9, Schroeder, p. 43). This is more fully set forth in
          chapters 5 and 6, where the mode and necessity of preparation for
          justification are treated (ibid., pp. 31-33).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Statement of the question.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But that the state of the question may be the more easily
          understood, we must remark that a twofold trial can be entered into by
          God with man: either by the law (inasmuch as he is viewed as guilty of
          violating the law by sin and thus comes under the accusation and
          condemnation of the law); or by the gospel (inasmuch as he is accused
          by Satan of having violated the gospel covenant and so is supposed to
          be an unbeliever and impenitent or a hypocrite, who has not testified
          by works the faith he has professed with his mouth). Now to this
          twofold trial a twofold justification ought to answer; not in the
          Romish sense, but in a very different sense. The first is that by
          which man is absolved from the guilt of sin on account of the
          righteousness of Christ imputed to us and apprehended by faith; the
          other is that by which he is freed from the charge of unbelief and
          hypocrisy and declared to be a true believer and child of God; one who
          has fulfilled the gospel covenant (if not perfectly as to degree,
          still sincerely as to parts) and answered to the divine call by the
          exercise of faith and piety. The first is justification properly so
          called; the other is only a declaration of it. That is justification
          of cause a priori; this is justification of sign or of effect a
          posteriori, declaratively. In that, faith alone can have a place
          because it alone apprehends the righteousness of Christ, by whose
          merit we are freed from the condemnation of the law; in this, works
          also are required as the effects and signs of faith, by which its
          truth and sincerity are declared against the accusation of unbelief
          and hypocrisy. For as faith justifies a person, so works justify
          faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The question does not concern justification a posteriori and
          declaratively in the fatherly and gospel trial—whether faith alone
          without works concurs to it (for we confess that works come in here
          with faith; yea, that works only are properly regarded because it is
          concerned with the justification of faith, which can be gathered from
          no other source more certainly than by works as its effects and
          indubitable proofs). Rather the question concerns justification a
          priori, which frees us from the legal trial, which is concerned with
          the justification of the wicked and the perfect righteousness, which
          can be opposed to the curse of the law and acquire for us a right to
          life—whether works come into consideration here with faith (as the
          Romanists hold) or whether faith alone (as we maintain).
        </p>
        <p>
          V. (2) The question is not whether faith alone justifies to the
          exclusion either of the grace of God or the righteousness of Christ or
          the word and sacraments (by which the blessing of justification is
          presented and sealed to us on the part of God), which we maintain are
          necessarily required here; but only to the exclusion of every other
          virtue and habit on our part. Hence the Romanists have no reason for
          accusing us of confusion (akatastasias) in this argument as if we
          ascribed justification at one time to the grace of God, at another to
          the blood of Christ and then again to faith. For all these as they are
          mutually subordinated in a different class of cause, consist with each
          other in the highest degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. (3) The question is not whether solitary faith (i.e., separated
          from the other virtues) justifies (which we grant could not easily be
          the case, since it is not even true and living faith); but whether it
          “alone” (sola) concurs to the act of justification (which we assert);
          as the eye alone sees, but not when torn out of the body. Thus the
          particle “alone” (sola) does not determine the subject, but the
          predicate (i.e., “faith only does not justify” [sola fides non
          justificat], but “faith justifies alone” [fides justificat sola]). The
          coexistence of love in him who is justified is not denied; but its
          coefficiency or cooperation in justification is denied. (4) The
          question is not whether the faith “which justifies” (quae justificat)
          works by love (for otherwise it would not be living but dead); rather
          the question is whether faith “by which it justifies’ (qua justificat)
          or in the act itself of justification, is to be considered under such
          a relation (schesei) (which we deny).
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. Hence the question returns to this—Does faith justify, not as it
          is objectively the doctrine of salvation, but subjectively as it
          assents to that saving doctrine and applies it to itself; not as the
          promise to do something, but as we rest upon the promises in Christ as
          sufficient; alone (sola), not by reason of existence (i.e., solitary
          without faith and love), but in respect to function or efficiency; not
          by way of preparation with other virtues or of merit, but relatively
          after the manner of an instrument, apprehending the satisfaction of
          Christ and fiducially applying it. The Romanists deny; we assert.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Proof that faith alone justifies: (1) from Rom. 3:28.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. First, man is justified by faith without works; therefore by
          faith alone. The reason of the consequence is manifest because there
          are not more modes of justifying than these two—by faith and by works.
          Thus, one being removed, the other must not only necessarily be left,
          but also left alone. Otherwise the enumeration would not be
          legitimate. Now why would the apostle so often and so expressly
          institute an antithesis between faith and works in this matter, if
          works could concur with faith in any way to the act of justification?
          Would he not in this particular have occasioned believers to err by
          removing works absolutely and simply from it, if they contribute
          anything towards it? Let the various passages in which exclusives are
          employed be carefully examined and the thing will be clearer than the
          midday sun: “We conclude that a man is justified by faith without the
          deeds of the law” (Rom. 3:28); “By grace are ye saved, through faith;
          and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works” (Eph.
          2:8); and more clearly, “knowing that a man is not justified by the
          works of the law, but by the faith [ean mé dia pisteds] of Jesus
          Christ” (Gal. 2:16). Here it is certain that the particle (eimé) is
          adversative and exclusive (as often elsewhere, Mt. 12:4; 24:36; Mk.
          13:32; Jn. 17:12; Rev. 9:4; 21:27) from the force of the immediate
          opposition of faith and works, which mutually displace each other. Nor
          can the Romanists themselves deny this. Estius says the most learned
          interpreters follow this opinion (which Salmeron, Justiniani and
          others confirm). To no purpose, therefore, do others pretend that ean
          mé is here exceptive, with the meaning that a man is not justified by
          works, except as faith in Christ approaches to works. This is the very
          thing which Paul opposes against the false apostles, who maintained
          that not works alone could justify a man, but faith mingled with works
          (so that justification might be ascribed partly to faith and partly to
          works, which Paul frequently asserts is inconsistent [asystaton]—as
          Salmeron and Estius acknowledge). No better is the explanation of
          Cornelius a Lapide, who thinks that only the works of the law are
          excluded here, but not the works of hope, fear and love, which faith
          begets and produces, and which are under faith as daughters under a
          mother. We have seen above that all works are entirely excluded by
          Paul; not only the ceremonial, but also moral; not only those
          performed before grace, but also those performed from grace in the
          renewed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. Because it alone apprehends the righteousness of Christ.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Second, by that alone are we justified by which the righteousness
          of Christ is applied to us, who satisfied the law for us. Now this is
          done by faith alone; nor does it belong to love or to hope. Not to
          hope, which does not apprehend, but expects the thing promised. Not to
          love, which is concerned with the fulfillment of a command, not with
          the apprehension of a promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>3. Because Abraham was justified by faith alone.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Third, we also are justified in the same way in which Abraham, the
          father of believers, was justified because what was written concerning
          him pertains not only to him, but to us also (Rom. 4:24). And yet
          Abraham was justified by faith alone: “Abraham believed in the Lord;
          and he counted it to him for righteousness” (Gen. 15:6), not of debt,
          on account of works preceding faith or subsequent to it, but of grace
          so that he might not have wherein to glory. For if “Abraham were
          justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God”
          (Rom. 4:2), to wit, he has no matter for glorying (kauchéma) (which is
          to be drawn from the preceding verses). The argument is from the
          destruction of the consequent to the destruction of the antecedent. If
          Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory in himself as
          if he had contributed something of his own to which a reward was due
          in the judgment of God. And yet he hath not whereof he can glory in
          himself before God. Therefore he was not justified by works. Nor can
          it be said here that works preceding faith are excluded; not those
          done from faith on account of which he could have had glory before
          God, as he is called a friend of God. For this is to gainsay openly
          and to contradict Paul to his face, who expressly testifies that
          Abraham had not whereof to glory before God. For it is gratuitously
          and most falsely supposed that only works antecedent to faith are
          excluded. But he excludes all works entirely without distinction and
          indeed the works of Abraham not only as an unbeliever, but also a
          believer (since this was said of him when he was already a believer
          and renewed). Again, he excludes all debt (v. 4); therefore, he also
          excludes every work. Finally, if he had not wished to exclude works
          done from faith, he ought not to have opposed “one working” to “one
          believing” simply, but one working without faith to one working from
          faith (which, however, he nowhere does).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>4. From Rom. 3:24, 25.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Fourth, we are justified gratuitously and by the grace of God;
          therefore by faith alone because faith alone can consist with grace
          (Rom. 3:24, 25). Nor is Bellarmine to be listened to, who wishes the
          particle “freely” not to exclude merits absolutely, but proper merits
          (or those which are from us, not from God). For merits arising from
          prevenient grace (which are called by them merits of congruity) are
          not opposed to grace, unless we wish grace to contend with grace. Nor
          does it follow hence that a man who is justified freely is justified
          by faith alone because as gratuitous justification does not exclude
          faith (because it is by grace), so neither ought it to exclude
          repentance and love, which are from grace. For as we have already
          remarked, the particle “freely” excludes entirely all merits; for
          whatever is freely given, that is acquired by no merit. Nor can the
          grace which is undue subsist with merit, which makes the pay due: “If
          by grace, then it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more
          grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work
          is no more work” (Rom. 11:6). Now although faith is not excluded in
          justification, it is not on that account excluded from grace (for thus
          works done from grace would not have to be excluded). But because it
          alone above other virtues has a power receptive of and applicatory to
          the righteousness of Christ (and so supposes man to be a sinner and
          destitute of all righteousness), it excludes all merit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>5. From Rom. 1:17.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Fifth, “the righteousness of God is said to be revealed from
          faith to faith; as it is written, The just shall live by faith’ (Rom.
          1:17). Here the apostle intends to prove that the gospel is the power
          of God (i.e., the sole most efficacious instrument for salvation) in
          opposition to the weakness of the law (Rom. 8:3; Heb. 7:19) because in
          it is the righteousness of God— not formally and subjectively (which
          is in God), but effectively (which is given to us by God); not
          inherent, because it is said to be manifested without the law by faith
          (Rom. 3:21), and to be imputed without works (Rom. 4:6), but imputed
          (which is opposed to man’s righteousness and his own works, Rom. 10:3,
          4; Phil. 3:9). Thus the most perfect righteousness of Christ (which
          alone can bear the scrutiny of the divine trial as being divine and
          infinite, which is the cause and foundation of life and salvation) is
          revealed from faith to faith (i.e., is announced by the gospel, so as
          to be apprehended by faith alone because nothing besides faith can
          concur in the reception of it). Hence he does not say “from faith to
          works,” but “from faith to faith” so that to faith alone this office
          is wholly ascribed. That Paul may prove this doctrine to be neither
          absurd nor new, he confirms it by the prophecy of Habakkuk where he
          says, “The just shall live by his faith” (2:4). Now although this
          prophecy refers also to a temporal blessing (viz., deliverance from
          the Babylonian captivity, which they would obtain by the intervention
          of faith in the divine promise; hence it is referred to by Paul in
          Heb. 10:38 to support believers in afflictions), still because the
          declaration of the prophet is general concerning faith in the promises
          of God, it is rightly applied specially to faith in Christ; and on
          this account the more— that the prophets and pious Jews regarded the
          promise of the Messiah as the foundation of all promises. Hence Paul
          (as best knowing the mind of the Holy Spirit) refers it (in Gal. 3:11
          and in this place) to justification in order to teach that by faith
          alone man obtains the righteousness which brings eternal life to him.
          “The just shall live by faith,” whether the “by faith” (to ek pisteos)
          be referred to the just with this meaning—he who by faith is just —or
          to life, meaning—the just lives by faith. They amount to the same
          thing and each is true—that both he who by faith is just, obtains
          salvation; and again he who is just, obtains salvation by faith. In
          vain, therefore, is it said that Paul understands a living faith and
          that it alone is not such, but with works. Although living faith is
          never alone in the person who is justified, still it is alone in the
          very act of justification—to the production of which the other virtues
          can contribute nothing, faith alone claiming this privilege for itself
          (as we have said before). No better do others wish that life to be
          referred to the works by which faith proves itself alive. The design
          of the prophet is to teach that faith alone is the means of obtaining
          salvation, both temporal and spiritual. And Paul says that this
          righteousness by faith is manifested without the law; which cannot be
          said of the righteousness of works, but only of the righteousness of
          faith; which is said of the man believing, not of one working.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Sources of explanation.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. It is one thing for love and works to be required in the person
          who is justified (which we grant); another in the act itself or
          causality of justification (which we deny). If works are required as
          concomitants of faith, they are not on that account determined to be
          causes of justification with faith or to do the very thing which faith
          does in this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. Although the whole force of justifying on the part of man is in
          faith as to the act of apprehension (so that other virtues contribute
          nothing to it with faith), it does not follow that faith can justify
          when they are absent as well as when they are present—yea, even when
          the opposite vices are present. It is one thing to justify without
          virtues (i.e., separated from them —which we deny); another for it to
          justify alone, but not separated from them. As it does not follow, the
          hand alone writes and the eye alone sees— therefore as much when tom
          from the head and the other members as in the body; the sole force of
          respiration is in the lungs—therefore the lungs can respire torn out
          from the liver and other viscera as well as when connected with them
          (which everyone sees to be absurd). There are hundreds of things of
          this kind which have a certain proper efficacy and effect, which
          still, when separated from their adjuncts, lose all their power.
          Natural potencies are connected as to existence, but disjoined as to
          operation. Light and heat in the sun are most closely connected
          together, but still the light alone illuminates, the heat alone warms.
          Therefore, although the other virtues do not justify with faith, still
          faith cannot justify in their absence, much less the opposite vices
          being present. For faith cannot be true except in connection with the
          virtues (which if they do not contribute to justification, still
          contribute to the existence and life of faith, which the presence of
          vices would destroy).

          XV. It is one thing for the love of the sinner to be the cause of the
          remission of sins a priori; another to be the effect and proof a
          posteriori. The latter is affirmed in Lk. 7:47, not the former. We
          gather this: (1) from the scope of the parable, which is to
          demonstrate which of two debtors, whose debt the creditor had
          cancelled, ought to love the creditor most (to wit, in token of
          gratitude); (2) from the answer of Peter, “I suppose that he, to whom
          he forgave most,” where love is placed as following, not as going
          before remission; (3) from the end, where a small remission is put as
          the cause of a small degree of love, “To whom little is forgiven, the
          same loveth little” (v. 47); (4) from v. 50, where salvation is
          ascribed to the faith, not to the love, of this woman, “Thy faith hath
          saved thee.” Nor does the particle hoti stand in the way because (as
          is known) it is so often only ratiocinative, not causal—the cause of
          the consequent, not of the consequence, so as to intimate that thence
          is known and gathered that many sins were forgiven her because she
          loved much.

          XVI. When John says, “We know that we have passed from death unto
          life, because we love the brethren” (1 Jn. 3:14), he teaches that love
          is a proof and sign of our justification from which we know that we
          have passed from death unto life. For he who is in love is in God (who
          is love) and he who is in God, cannot be in death. But he does not
          mean that love is the cause of that translation (which is elsewhere
          ascribed to faith, Jn. 5:24). Hence Lorinus and Gagnaeus on this
          passage well remark that “the causal article denotes the cause, not of
          the thing but of the knowledge.” On this account even the more, that
          since God loved us first (not we God, 1 Jn. 4:10), the justification
          by which God loved us ought to precede our love.

        <p>
          XVII. Christ promises “the love of the Father” to those who love him
          (Jn. 14:23), not affectively and as to its beginning (as if the love
          of the Father then begins, since he loved us before, 1 Jn. 4:10), but
          effectively and as to continuance and increase because he will prove
          his love by distinguished blessings and console them by a new
          manifestation of himself. But this has nothing to do with
          justification because to love Christ and to keep his commands belongs
          to a man already constituted in grace and justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. The “fear of the Lord” (to wit, filial and reverential) is a
          consequence of justification, not a previous disposition to it. It is
          not called “the beginning of wisdom” (Ps. 111:10) as if it initially
          disposes to wisdom, but because it is its head and perfection, as it
          is said to be in Ecc. 12:13, which begins from it (Prov. 9:10) and
          ends in it. If it is said apotheisthai hamartémata (Sir. 1:21), this
          ought not to be understood of a positive expulsion (as if it
          introduced either meritoriously or dispositively remission of sins),
          but of a negative expulsion because he who fears God does not indulge
          in sins, nor give ear to their solicitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. It is one thing for hope to concur to salvation; another for it
          to concur to justification. The former is asserted in Rom. 5:5 and
          8:24 when hope is said not to make us ashamed; yea, also to save us.
          For the expectation of salvation is founded upon a hope so certain to
          be fulfilled in its own time, as if we already possessed salvation
          itself. But not the latter because the object of hope is not the
          remission of sins, but the fulfillment of the promised salvation.

          XX. Although remission of sins is promised to repentance (because it
          ought to accompany faith and be in him who is justified as a certain
          condition requisite from him because God cannot pardon sin to an
          impenitent), it does not follow that it can be said to justify with
          faith because it contributes nothing (neither meritoriously, nor
          instrumentally) to the act of justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. It is one thing for eternal life and the heavenly inheritance to
          be referred to works as meritorious or instrumental causes of our
          justification; another as effects of faith and qualities and
          dispositions requisite in the subject to be glorified. As it is one
          thing to seek “why” (quare) life is given to believers; another “upon
          what” (quibus) or “upon what qualities” (qualibus) it depends. The
          former we deny because our works of whatever kind cannot merit life,
          nor have they the relation of an instrument for apprehending it. But
          the latter we grant. Nor is anything different gathered from Mt.
          25:34, 35, where works are not adduced by the Judge as “the
          foundations of the right” which they obtain to eternal life. The
          proper cause of that right is indicated in the preceding verses, when
          they are called “ye blessed of my Father,” who ought “to inherit
          (kléronomein) the kingdom” (i.e., possess it by a title of
          inheritance). Rather they are adduced as arguments and testimonies
          indubitable a posteriori, from which the truth of their faith could be
          proved, and the equity of the sentence pronounced (as the particle gar
          is not causal [aitiologike], but only ratiocinative).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXII. Since Paul and James were inspired by the same Spirit, they
          cannot be said to oppose each other on the doctrine of justification,
          so that one should ascribe justification to faith alone and the other
          to works also. The reconciliation is not difficult, if the design of
          each be considered and the natures of faith and of justification
          (concerning which both treat) be attended. Paul disputes against the
          Pharisees, who urged the merits of works; James disputes against the
          Libertines and Epicureans, who, content with a profession of faith
          alone, denied not only the merits of works, but also their necessity.
          Against the former, Paul rightly urges faith alone for justification.
          Against the latter, James properly commends the necessity of works for
          the confirmation of justification. Paul speaks of a living and
          efficacious faith; James of an idle and dead faith which cannot be
          demonstrated by works (2:18); Paul of justification a priori and
          constitutively; James of the same a posteriori and declaratively; Paul
          properly constitutes the former in faith alone; James rightly places
          the latter in works, by which the reality of our faith and
          justification is declared not only before men, but also before God.
          Therefore, when faith is said “to have wrought with works in Abraham,
          and by works to have been made perfect” (v. 22), this ought to be
          understood in relation to the efficacy of faith, which exerted itself
          by works and by which also it was consummated and made perfect. It
          ought not to be understood essentially, for this it has by its own
          nature (but declaratively) because it is proven to be perfect and
          sincere; just as “the power of God” is said to be “made perfect in our
          weakness” (2 Cor. 12:9), i.e., known and declared to be perfect. See
          what else belongs to this point in our “Disputatio ... De Concordia
          Pauli et Jacobi,” Opera (1848), 4:731-52.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIII. It is one thing for works to be connected with faith in the
          person of the justified; another, however, in the matter of
          justification. The former we acknowledge and will afterwards prove,
          when we discuss the necessity of good works; but the latter we deny
          with Paul—nay, we maintain that they are wholly incompatible
          (asystata) with faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIV. Augustine says rightly, “Good works do not precede the one to be
          justified, but follow the one justified” (Faith and Works 14 [FC
          27:247; PL 40.211]). A person is justified freely by faith without
          works (Rom. 3:24); yea, justification is of the wicked (Rom. 4:5;
          5:6). No good works can be granted which precede his justification as
          causes, but only which follow as the effects and fruits springing from
          the faith of remission (Lk. 7:47; 1 Tim. 1:5). If calling (by which
          faith and holiness are infused) is prior to justification, it does not
          follow that holiness no less than faith is prior to it because
          holiness is indeed infused, but in its own order and by faith (Acts
          15:9). Faith however concurs to justification before it does to
          sanctification. If remission is sometimes promised to repentance, this
          is indeed promised to it as a condition not antecedent or concomitant
          by reason of contrition, but only consequent as to new obedience.
