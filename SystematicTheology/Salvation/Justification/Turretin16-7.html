          SEVENTH QUESTION: THE JUSTIFICATION OF FAITH
          <br />

          <em
            >Does faith justify us properly and by itself or only relatively and
            instrumentally? The former we deny; the latter we affirm against the
            Socinians, Remonstrants and Romanists</em
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Justification—active and passive.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Since justification can be viewed either actively (on the part of
          God who justifies) or passively (on the part of man who is justified),
          a twofold handling of it can also be adopted: either with respect to
          the benefit itself conferred upon us by God and of the righteousness
          imputed to us; or with respect to its reception and application made
          by faith (of which we now treat).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Statement of the question.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          II. However, it is not controverted whether faith justifies—for
          Scripture so clearly asserts this that no one dares to deny it. Rather
          we inquire regarding the manner in which it justifies, in describing
          which there is an amazing discrepancy of opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The opinion of the Socinians.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          III. All our opponents agree in this—that faith justifies properly and
          by itself and so is our very righteousness—but with some differences.
          For the Socinians maintain that faith or the act of believing is the
          cause of our justification so that there is no other immediate and
          formal righteousness by which we are just before God than our faith;
          also justification is a universal affection of faith—‘“Not because it
          is considered such by the gracious acceptation of God; by which it
          pleased him to reckon faith for perfect righteousness, or for a
          perfect fulfillment of the law, no otherwise than formally under the
          legal covenant, the perfect obedience of the law was that universal
          righteousness upon which life depended” (as Socinus, De lesu Christo
          Servatore [1594] frequently expresses it; Smalcius, Refutatio Thesium
          D. Wolfgang Frantzii [1614]; Volkelius, De vera Religione 4.3 [1630],
          pp. 175-84). The Remonstrants agree with them on this point in their
          Confession, c. 21+ (cf. The Confession or Declaration of the ...
          Remonstrants 18* [1676], p. 211).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>And of the Romanists.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The Romanists hold that faith is the disposing and cause sine qua
          non, which not only disposes to righteousness, but also begins and
          merits righteousness itself. “If anyone says that the wicked are
          justified by faith alone, so that he understands nothing else to be
          required to cooperate for obtaining the grace of justification and is
          necessary from no part, to be prepared and disposed with the motion of
          his own will, let him be accursed” (Council of Trent, Session 6, Canon
          9*, Schroeder, p. 43). Bellarmine says, “Faith justifies as the
          beginning and root of justification because it is the first motion
          towards God, for it behooves one approaching God to believe that God
          is” (“De Justificatione,” 1.13 Opera [1858], 4:479). This opinion is
          founded upon a false hypothesis—as if justification consists in an
          infusion of righteousness and is a certain physical motion which
          demands previous dispositions in the subject before the introduction
          of the form.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The opinion of the orthodox.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          V. However the orthodox differ wholly from them. They teach that faith
          is the organic and instrumental cause of our justification and that
          justification is ascribed to it, not properly and by itself (inasmuch
          as it is a work or as if it was the righteousness itself by which we
          are justified before God; or as if by its own worth or by the
          indulgence of God it deserves justification in whole or in part), but
          improperly and metonymically (inasmuch as Christ’s righteousness,
          which faith apprehends, is the foundation and meritorious cause on
          account of which we are justified). So that it is said to justify
          relatively and organically: relatively because the object of faith is
          our true righteousness before God; organically because faith is the
          instrument for receiving on our part and for applying to ourselves,
          that righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Proof that the act of believing is not our righteousness. </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Two things therefore must be done by us here. First, negatively
          (kat’ arsin), the false mode of the justification of faith (introduced
          by the Socinians and Romanists) must be removed. Second, affirmatively
          (kata thesin) the true and genuine sense must be established. As to
          the former, faith or the act of believing is not considered as our
          righteousness with God by a gracious acceptation: (a) because what is
          only the instrument for receiving righteousness cannot be our
          righteousness itself formally. Now faith holds here only the relation
          (schesin) of an instrument, as is evident both from its proper act
          (which is instrumental and consists in the reception of Christ [Jn.
          1:12] and the acceptance of righteousness [Rom. 5:17] and of the
          remission of sins [Acts 26:18]); and from the subordination of the
          causes of justification to the same effect (to wit, the grace of God,
          the redemption of Christ and faith). This is alluded to by Paul in
          Rom. 3:24 where faith cannot sustain any other meaning than that of an
          instrument, since the grace of God holds the relation of an efficient
          principle and the redemption of Christ that of the meritorious cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. (b) Because faith is distinguished from the righteousness itself
          which is imputed to us, both because it is said to be “of faith” and
          “by faith” (Rom. 1:17; 3:22; Phil. 3:9) and because Christ with his
          obedience and satisfaction is that righteousness which is imputed to
          us (Is. 53:11; Jer. 23:6; 1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 5:21; Gal. 3:13, 14),
          which faith indeed apprehends as its object, but with which it cannot
          be identified. Hence Scripture nowhere says that God willed to count
          our faith for righteousness, but that he made Christ unto us
          righteousness; that he is Jehovah our righteousness and that we are
          the righteousness of God in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. (c) Because we are not justified except by a perfect
          righteousness. For we have to deal with the strict justice of God,
          which cannot be deceived. Now no faith here is perfect. Nor can it be
          said that it is not indeed a perfect righteousness of itself, but is
          admitted as such by God and considered such by a gratuitous lowering
          of the law’s demands. For in the court of divine justice (which
          demands an adequate and absolutely perfect payment), there cannot be
          room for a gracious acceptation which is an imaginary payment. Again,
          since our justification is a forensic and judicial act (where God
          shows himself just, Rom. 3:25), it does not admit of a gracious
          acceptation (which never proceeds from the authority and sentence of
          the Judge, but from the voluntary and private stipulation of the
          parties).
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. (d) If faith is counted for righteousness, we will be justified by
          works because thus faith cannot but have the relation of a work which
          justifies. And yet it is clear that in this business Paul always
          opposes faith to works as incompatible (asystata) and two antagonistic
          (antidiéremena) means by which man is justified either by his own
          obedience and in himself, by the law, or by another’s obedience by the
          gospel. Nor does the difference between these modes of justification
          consist in this—that in the former a perfect obedience and in the
          latter an imperfect is accepted of God as perfect, since the mode of
          justification would be always the same—by works. Rather the difference
          consists in this—that since in both cases a perfect righteousness is
          required, in the former from the strictness (akribodikaio) of the law
          God demands a personal righteousness, here from the forbearance
          (epieikeia) of the gospel he admits another’s (to wit, the
          righteousness of Christ). Thus faith cannot be said to justify
          properly and by itself unless we slide back to the old covenant and
          returm to legal justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. “The faith of Abraham,” it is said, “was imputed to him for
          righteousness” (Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3). Not properly because in this way
          he would have been justified by works (which the apostle denies in the
          same place). But (1) relatively and metonymically, so that faith is
          taken for its object (Gal. 3:25), i.e., for that which faith believes
          (to wit, that the promise concerning the seed [from Gal. 3:16], not so
          much bodily as spiritual, which he received by faith, was the
          foundation of his justification). This is confirmed by the
          circumstance that what does not inhere and what is contradistinguished
          from works is here said to be imputed. Thus in this sense faith is
          said to be imputed for righteousness by a hypallage because
          righteousness is imputed by faith, as the apostle declares in
          equivalent terms (Gal. 3:5, 6; Rom. 3:22). Nor is this to wrest the
          Scriptures and to express coldly the power and efficacy of faith, as
          Forbes falsely charges upon our theologians (A Treatise Tending to
          Clear the Doctrine of Justification 4 [1616], p. 10). Nay, no more
          clearly and truly can the genuine sense of that imputation be set
          forth. For since that thing which is imputed to us for righteousness
          ought to be our righteousness before God (i.e., that on account of
          which God justifies us); nor can faith be that (as we have already
          said and as he himself does not deny when he recognizes it to be the
          instrumental cause); it is clear that this phrase cannot be taken
          properly, but only metonymically with regard to the object. Nor is
          anything more usual in Scripture than for a faculty to be taken for
          its object. This does not prevent (2) faith from being said to be
          imputed for righteousness organically because it is the instrumental
          cause which apprehends the righteousness of Christ by a metonymy of
          the effect for the efficient, as it is elsewhere called eternal life
          (Jn. 17:3; 12:50), i.e., the instrumental cause of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. In vain, however, does Arminius contend that the righteousness of
          Christ is not imputed for righteousness, since it is that very
          righteousness itself (to wit, supposing that is not properly
          righteousness which is imputed to us for righteousness). He falsely
          confounds to impute for righteousness by gracious acceptation that
          which is not a righteousness and to impute to a person for
          righteousness that which he did not have. The first sense has no place
          here, only the latter. Accordingly what Abraham had not is said to be
          imputed to him for righteousness and the righteousness of Christ is
          imputed to us (i.e., reckoned ours), which was not ours. Thus
          imputation does not deny the truth of the thing or the perfection of
          the righteousness, but only the truth of the possession by ascribing
          to a person what was not properly his.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. What is said concerning anyone in Scripture ought to be
          altogether in him, but according to the manner which it teaches
          itself. Now the manner in which justification and salvation are
          ascribed to faith, does not consist in its own proper efficiency (as
          if our faith wrought or effected them), but they are placed only in
          its fiducial apprehension and application. Nor otherwise are we said
          to please God by faith (Heb. 11:6) and to be purged of sin (Acts
          15:9), than because it applies to us the righteousness and blood of
          Christ, who purges us from sins and makes us acceptable to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. It is one thing for blessings to be conferred according to faith
          (i.e., under the condition of faith) under which they are promised in
          the word and which we acknowledge with the Scriptures; another for
          faith to justify properly and by itself or to count faith itself for
          righteousness and thus to impute it for righteousness to the believer.
          There faith holds the relation of an instrument. Here, however, it
          holds that of a principal cause and foundation (which we deny).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. Faith does not justify dispositively. </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. Second, against the Romanists we prove that faith does not
          justify dispositively or meritoriously, as the beginning and root of
          righteousness. (1) The Holy Spirit nowhere ascribes to faith the
          beginning or only a part or disposition to justification, but the
          whole and entire justification. (2) Thus the antithesis of the apostle
          between works and faith would not hold good, since faith would always
          justify like a work. (3) Justification, as being a forensic act, takes
          place at once and in a moment (en atom0); nor can it admit of a
          beginning and progress. (4) Thus we could be said to be justified “on
          account of faith” (dia tén pistin). The Scripture never says this, but
          always either “by faith” (pistei) or “through faith” (dia tés pisteds,
          ek pisteos) as by an instrument. If in various passages these
          prepositions —“by” and “through’—have a causality properly so called
          (as when they are connected with the death and blood of Christ), it
          does not follow that they have the same force when used concerning the
          justification of faith. Nay, since it is evident that a man cannot be
          justified by two righteousnesses (one in himself, the other in
          Christ), if the righteousness and blood of Christ is the proper cause
          of his justification, this cannot be ascribed to faith, but only the
          instrumental cause. (5) This opinion falsely supposes that
          justification is a physical motion inhering in the subject, which
          needs previous dispositions by which it may be acquired so as to be
          introduced into the subject. But this is false since it is a forensic
          act (as was proved before) to which man holds himself objectively, not
          subjectively. And although faith is required on the part of man for
          receiving this benefit, it does not follow that it has the relation of
          a disposition by which the sinner is disposed to the infusion of
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Sources of explanation. </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. Faith is viewed in different lights: either in the act itself of
          justification or in the person of the justified or in the effect of
          justification. In the person of the justified, it is well called “the
          beginning of righteousness”; not imputed but inherent because it is
          the root of all virtues. Thus in the effect of justification, it is
          the principle and cause of new obedience; but in the act of
          justification, it can be nothing else than an instrument apprehending
          and applying to man that which justifies. Thus he is justified not by
          the merit of faith, but only by it as a means.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. Although justification is drawn away from works as to merit and a
          properly so-called efficiency, it does not follow that the same is
          ascribed to faith in the same manner. Nay, because it is taken away
          from works, it cannot for the same reason be ascribed to faith because
          it would thus justify as a work; nor could we be said to be justified
          without works. It therefore suffices (in order to save the opposition
          of the apostle) that faith should be substituted by him in the place
          of works because by faith we most surely obtain what the Jews in vain
          sought in works (although it acts here not meritoriously, but only
          instrumentally).
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. Faith is said to save us (Lk. 7:50), not by meriting something
          in order to justification, but only receptively and organically
          because it was the instrument receptive of that benefit. Nothing is
          more frequent than by a metalepsis to ascribe to an instrument the
          effect of the principal cause (as when “the gospel” is said “to be the
          power of God unto salvation,” Rom. 1:16; the diligent hand is said to
          increase the house; the plough to enrich the farmer; the hand of the
          giver to relieve the poor; and the like). If elsewhere the greatness
          of the faith of the Canaanite woman to whom Christ granted the
          sought-for blessing is extolled (Mt. 15:28), its merit and efficiency
          is not on that account denoted. Believing, she was certainly healed
          because, faith being the medium, God bestowed this blessing upon her;
          but believing, he healed her, not on account of the fact that faith
          properly speaking effected or merited the healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. Therefore the true mode of the justification of faith is no
          other than instrumental. (1) Its proper act consists in the reception
          of Christ and his righteousness, as was said before. (2) It justifies
          in no other manner than by its being directed to the death and
          obedience of Christ (to wit, by apprehending and applying Christ to
          itself as a ransom [antilytron] given for us and a propitiation
          [hilasmon] for sin, 1 Jn. 2:2). (3) Faith in the Scriptures is
          described by “eating,” “looking” and “touching,” which have only an
          instrumental causality, not a proper efficiency (as the looking at a
          serpent did not cure per se, but relatively to the brazen serpent; nor
          does eating nourish except by food thrown into the mouth). (4)
          Justifying faith stands related in no other way to justification than
          as the faith of miracles stands related to the working of miracles;
          not effectively, but organically by apprehending the special promise
          given concerning them.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. Not without reason, however, is this ascribed above all other
          things to the believer because it alone of all the virtues can subsist
          with grace as consisting in the mere reception and apprehension of an
          object placed beyond itself. Hence it is said to be “of faith, that it
          might be by grace” (Rom. 4:16), to wit, as man owes this entire
          blessing to God, he has no reason for glorying in himself. For if he
          were justified by works or inherent righteousness, he would seem to
          have something in which to glory; but when he is justified by faith
          (which gives nothing to God, but only receives) all glorying is
          excluded. This Toletus well explains when he gives the reason why the
          Scripture ascribes justification to faith alone: “Namely, because in
          faith it is more manifested that man is justified not by his own
          virtue, but by the merit of Christ. For as in beholding the serpent
          God placed healing in the desert, because the looking indicated more
          that the men were healed by the virtue of the serpent, not of any
          personal work or medicine; so faith shows that sinners are justified
          by the virtue and merit of Christ, in whom believing they are saved,
          not by any virtue and merit of their own. And it is the reason why
          justification is ascribed to faith especially by Paul, who strives to
          exclude from justification the works of the law, and human merit or
          efficacy, and to place it in the virtue and merit of Christ alone.
          Therefore he makes mention of faith in Christ. This neither
          repentance, nor love, nor hope have, for faith is carried more
          immediately and distinctly to it, by whose virtue we are justified”
          (Commentarii et annotationes in epistolam ... ad Romanos, Annot. 17
          [1602], p. 177 on Rom. 3:22).
        </p>
        <p>
          XX. Although the sacraments are external means and instruments
          applying (on the part of God) the promise of grace and justification,
          this does not hinder faith from being called the internal instrument
          and means on the part of man for receiving this benefit offered in the
          word and sealed by the sacraments.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. What justifies as an instrument does not forthwith justify as a
          work, although that instrument is a work. It is one thing for it to be
          a work and another to justify as a work. What justifies as a work
          ought to be the meritorious cause of justification, but what justifies
          as an instrument does not justify meritoriously, but only
          apprehensively and receptively; not by giving, but by receiving.
          Therefore the action of faith justifies us, but not as an action
          simply (as if it were our righteousness with God), but in relation to
          its object inasmuch as it receives Christ. As the extension of the
          beggar’s hand is indeed the act of the beggar prescribed by the rich
          man, still as an act it does not enrich the beggar, but insofar as in
          this way he applies the gift of the rich man to himself and makes it
          his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXII. Although faith is called “the work of God” (Jn. 6:29), it does
          not follow that it justifies as a work. Although it is enjoined by God
          (and in this sense is called the work of God and is due from man that
          he may obtain life), it is not on this account due as the meritorious
          cause of that life, but only as a means and instrument receptive of
          the righteousness of Christ, which is the true cause of life. And thus
          it is so called by Christ imitatively (mimétikos) and by allusion to
          the Jewish sense, who sought life by the works of the law: “What must
          we do,” said they, “that we may work the works of God?” To this legal
          question Jesus answers, not legally, but evangelically (yet in a legal
          style, taking the legal phrase from the expression of the Jews and
          applying it to his discourse): “This is the work of God that ye
          believe”—intimating that no further work was necessary to acquire
          salvation, but that faith was substituted in the place of all works
          for the reception of it (as if he said, work earnestly, only
          believe—this is work, this is labor). Evidently as to a sick man
          seeking by what medicine he is about to be healed, if the physician
          answers, this is the medicine which I prescribe to you; keep quiet and
          confide in me—he does not wish to intimate that that rest and
          confidence are any remedies to cure him, but he means only this—there
          is no need of medicine. Thus the Scripture often ascribes the names of
          things (to which men attribute falsely a great efficacy and value) to
          those things which are truly efficacious and valuable; as the gospel
          is called law because what the law sought, the gospel gives; what the
          Jews vainly sought in the law is obtained by the gospel. Thus
          regeneration is called circumcision (Phil. 3:3); believers are called
          sons of Abraham; love and piety are called fasting (Is. 58:6, 7); and
          faith is called a work.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIII. But we think it ought not to be anxiously inquired whether
          faith stands here in the relation of an instrument or also of a
          condition, as some think. Both may be ascribed to it, provided the
          condition is not understood as that in view of which God justifies man
          in the legal covenant. For in this sense, it cannot be called a
          condition, unless we agree with the Socinians and Remonstrants, who
          hold that faith or the act of believing is admitted by God by a
          gracious acceptation for a perfect righteousness (which we have just
          now refuted). Rather it is taken broadly for all that is required on
          our part to obtain this benefit—whether it has the relation of a cause
          properly so called or only instrumental. For thus as that condition
          has the relation (schesin) of an instrument, so the instrument has the
          relation of a condition on our part without which justification cannot
          be granted. Moreover concerning the manner in which faith concurs to
          justification and concerning its threefold act—dispository,
          justificatory and consolatory—see what was said in Topic XV, Question
          12, Section 4.

          EIGHTH QUESTION:
          <br />
          <em>Does faith alone justify? We affirm against the Romanists</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. This question also lies between us and the Romanists, who not only
          corrupt the true mode of the justification of faith by making the
          instrumental cause meritorious or at least dispositive, but by
          connecting with it the other virtues both as attendants and companions
          in this act. Hence arose the controversy concerning “faith alone
          justifying” (sole Fide Justificante), which as it is of no less
          importance than the preceding, so it is agitated with no less warmth
          of spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Origin of the question.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This question is not of recent birth. Even from the very beginning
          of the Christian religion, this was asserted by the false apostles or
          Judaizing Christians. They did not with full front attack the faith as
          the Pharisees, but on the side by a deadly mixture associating the law
          with the gospel, Moses with Christ and faith with works in the matter
          of justification, so that man should be justified not by faith alone,
          but at the same time by works also. Against them the apostle disputes
          in his epistles to the Galatians, Philippians and Colossians. This is
          urged by the Romanists of this day, who hold that with faith, fear,
          hope, love, penitence, the purpose of a new life concurs to
          justification. “If anyone shall say that the wicked are justified by
          faith alone, so as to understand that nothing else is required to
          cooperate for the obtainment of the grace of justification and is
          necessary from no part, that he should be prepared and disposed by a
          motion of his own will, let him be accursed” (Council of Trent,
          Session 6, Canon 9, Schroeder, p. 43). This is more fully set forth in
          chapters 5 and 6, where the mode and necessity of preparation for
          justification are treated (ibid., pp. 31-33).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Statement of the question.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But that the state of the question may be the more easily
          understood, we must remark that a twofold trial can be entered into by
          God with man: either by the law (inasmuch as he is viewed as guilty of
          violating the law by sin and thus comes under the accusation and
          condemnation of the law); or by the gospel (inasmuch as he is accused
          by Satan of having violated the gospel covenant and so is supposed to
          be an unbeliever and impenitent or a hypocrite, who has not testified
          by works the faith he has professed with his mouth). Now to this
          twofold trial a twofold justification ought to answer; not in the
          Romish sense, but in a very different sense. The first is that by
          which man is absolved from the guilt of sin on account of the
          righteousness of Christ imputed to us and apprehended by faith; the
          other is that by which he is freed from the charge of unbelief and
          hypocrisy and declared to be a true believer and child of God; one who
          has fulfilled the gospel covenant (if not perfectly as to degree,
          still sincerely as to parts) and answered to the divine call by the
          exercise of faith and piety. The first is justification properly so
          called; the other is only a declaration of it. That is justification
          of cause a priori; this is justification of sign or of effect a
          posteriori, declaratively. In that, faith alone can have a place
          because it alone apprehends the righteousness of Christ, by whose
          merit we are freed from the condemnation of the law; in this, works
          also are required as the effects and signs of faith, by which its
          truth and sincerity are declared against the accusation of unbelief
          and hypocrisy. For as faith justifies a person, so works justify
          faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The question does not concern justification a posteriori and
          declaratively in the fatherly and gospel trial—whether faith alone
          without works concurs to it (for we confess that works come in here
          with faith; yea, that works only are properly regarded because it is
          concerned with the justification of faith, which can be gathered from
          no other source more certainly than by works as its effects and
          indubitable proofs). Rather the question concerns justification a
          priori, which frees us from the legal trial, which is concerned with
          the justification of the wicked and the perfect righteousness, which
          can be opposed to the curse of the law and acquire for us a right to
          life—whether works come into consideration here with faith (as the
          Romanists hold) or whether faith alone (as we maintain).
        </p>
        <p>
          V. (2) The question is not whether faith alone justifies to the
          exclusion either of the grace of God or the righteousness of Christ or
          the word and sacraments (by which the blessing of justification is
          presented and sealed to us on the part of God), which we maintain are
          necessarily required here; but only to the exclusion of every other
          virtue and habit on our part. Hence the Romanists have no reason for
          accusing us of confusion (akatastasias) in this argument as if we
          ascribed justification at one time to the grace of God, at another to
          the blood of Christ and then again to faith. For all these as they are
          mutually subordinated in a different class of cause, consist with each
          other in the highest degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. (3) The question is not whether solitary faith (i.e., separated
          from the other virtues) justifies (which we grant could not easily be
          the case, since it is not even true and living faith); but whether it
          “alone” (sola) concurs to the act of justification (which we assert);
          as the eye alone sees, but not when torn out of the body. Thus the
          particle “alone” (sola) does not determine the subject, but the
          predicate (i.e., “faith only does not justify” [sola fides non
          justificat], but “faith justifies alone” [fides justificat sola]). The
          coexistence of love in him who is justified is not denied; but its
          coefficiency or cooperation in justification is denied. (4) The
          question is not whether the faith “which justifies” (quae justificat)
          works by love (for otherwise it would not be living but dead); rather
          the question is whether faith “by which it justifies’ (qua justificat)
          or in the act itself of justification, is to be considered under such
          a relation (schesei) (which we deny).
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. Hence the question returns to this—Does faith justify, not as it
          is objectively the doctrine of salvation, but subjectively as it
          assents to that saving doctrine and applies it to itself; not as the
          promise to do something, but as we rest upon the promises in Christ as
          sufficient; alone (sola), not by reason of existence (i.e., solitary
          without faith and love), but in respect to function or efficiency; not
          by way of preparation with other virtues or of merit, but relatively
          after the manner of an instrument, apprehending the satisfaction of
          Christ and fiducially applying it. The Romanists deny; we assert.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Proof that faith alone justifies: (1) from Rom. 3:28.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. First, man is justified by faith without works; therefore by
          faith alone. The reason of the consequence is manifest because there
          are not more modes of justifying than these two—by faith and by works.
          Thus, one being removed, the other must not only necessarily be left,
          but also left alone. Otherwise the enumeration would not be
          legitimate. Now why would the apostle so often and so expressly
          institute an antithesis between faith and works in this matter, if
          works could concur with faith in any way to the act of justification?
          Would he not in this particular have occasioned believers to err by
          removing works absolutely and simply from it, if they contribute
          anything towards it? Let the various passages in which exclusives are
          employed be carefully examined and the thing will be clearer than the
          midday sun: “We conclude that a man is justified by faith without the
          deeds of the law” (Rom. 3:28); “By grace are ye saved, through faith;
          and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works” (Eph.
          2:8); and more clearly, “knowing that a man is not justified by the
          works of the law, but by the faith [ean mé dia pisteds] of Jesus
          Christ” (Gal. 2:16). Here it is certain that the particle (eimé) is
          adversative and exclusive (as often elsewhere, Mt. 12:4; 24:36; Mk.
          13:32; Jn. 17:12; Rev. 9:4; 21:27) from the force of the immediate
          opposition of faith and works, which mutually displace each other. Nor
          can the Romanists themselves deny this. Estius says the most learned
          interpreters follow this opinion (which Salmeron, Justiniani and
          others confirm). To no purpose, therefore, do others pretend that ean
          mé is here exceptive, with the meaning that a man is not justified by
          works, except as faith in Christ approaches to works. This is the very
          thing which Paul opposes against the false apostles, who maintained
          that not works alone could justify a man, but faith mingled with works
          (so that justification might be ascribed partly to faith and partly to
          works, which Paul frequently asserts is inconsistent [asystaton]—as
          Salmeron and Estius acknowledge). No better is the explanation of
          Cornelius a Lapide, who thinks that only the works of the law are
          excluded here, but not the works of hope, fear and love, which faith
          begets and produces, and which are under faith as daughters under a
          mother. We have seen above that all works are entirely excluded by
          Paul; not only the ceremonial, but also moral; not only those
          performed before grace, but also those performed from grace in the
          renewed.

          <b>2. Because it alone apprehends the righteousness of Christ.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Second, by that alone are we justified by which the righteousness
          of Christ is applied to us, who satisfied the law for us. Now this is
          done by faith alone; nor does it belong to love or to hope. Not to
          hope, which does not apprehend, but expects the thing promised. Not to
          love, which is concerned with the fulfillment of a command, not with
          the apprehension of a promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>3. Because Abraham was justified by faith alone.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Third, we also are justified in the same way in which Abraham, the
          father of believers, was justified because what was written concerning
          him pertains not only to him, but to us also (Rom. 4:24). And yet
          Abraham was justified by faith alone: “Abraham believed in the Lord;
          and he counted it to him for righteousness” (Gen. 15:6), not of debt,
          on account of works preceding faith or subsequent to it, but of grace
          so that he might not have wherein to glory. For if “Abraham were
          justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God”
          (Rom. 4:2), to wit, he has no matter for glorying (kauchéma) (which is
          to be drawn from the preceding verses). The argument is from the
          destruction of the consequent to the destruction of the antecedent. If
          Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory in himself as
          if he had contributed something of his own to which a reward was due
          in the judgment of God. And yet he hath not whereof he can glory in
          himself before God. Therefore he was not justified by works. Nor can
          it be said here that works preceding faith are excluded; not those
          done from faith on account of which he could have had glory before
          God, as he is called a friend of God. For this is to gainsay openly
          and to contradict Paul to his face, who expressly testifies that
          Abraham had not whereof to glory before God. For it is gratuitously
          and most falsely supposed that only works antecedent to faith are
          excluded. But he excludes all works entirely without distinction and
          indeed the works of Abraham not only as an unbeliever, but also a
          believer (since this was said of him when he was already a believer
          and renewed). Again, he excludes all debt (v. 4); therefore, he also
          excludes every work. Finally, if he had not wished to exclude works
          done from faith, he ought not to have opposed “one working” to “one
          believing” simply, but one working without faith to one working from
          faith (which, however, he nowhere does).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>4. From Rom. 3:24, 25.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Fourth, we are justified gratuitously and by the grace of God;
          therefore by faith alone because faith alone can consist with grace
          (Rom. 3:24, 25). Nor is Bellarmine to be listened to, who wishes the
          particle “freely” not to exclude merits absolutely, but proper merits
          (or those which are from us, not from God). For merits arising from
          prevenient grace (which are called by them merits of congruity) are
          not opposed to grace, unless we wish grace to contend with grace. Nor
          does it follow hence that a man who is justified freely is justified
          by faith alone because as gratuitous justification does not exclude
          faith (because it is by grace), so neither ought it to exclude
          repentance and love, which are from grace. For as we have already
          remarked, the particle “freely” excludes entirely all merits; for
          whatever is freely given, that is acquired by no merit. Nor can the
          grace which is undue subsist with merit, which makes the pay due: “If
          by grace, then it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more
          grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work
          is no more work” (Rom. 11:6). Now although faith is not excluded in
          justification, it is not on that account excluded from grace (for thus
          works done from grace would not have to be excluded). But because it
          alone above other virtues has a power receptive of and applicatory to
          the righteousness of Christ (and so supposes man to be a sinner and
          destitute of all righteousness), it excludes all merit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>5. From Rom. 1:17.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Fifth, “the righteousness of God is said to be revealed from
          faith to faith; as it is written, The just shall live by faith’ (Rom.
          1:17). Here the apostle intends to prove that the gospel is the power
          of God (i.e., the sole most efficacious instrument for salvation) in
          opposition to the weakness of the law (Rom. 8:3; Heb. 7:19) because in
          it is the righteousness of God— not formally and subjectively (which
          is in God), but effectively (which is given to us by God); not
          inherent, because it is said to be manifested without the law by faith
          (Rom. 3:21), and to be imputed without works (Rom. 4:6), but imputed
          (which is opposed to man’s righteousness and his own works, Rom. 10:3,
          4; Phil. 3:9). Thus the most perfect righteousness of Christ (which
          alone can bear the scrutiny of the divine trial as being divine and
          infinite, which is the cause and foundation of life and salvation) is
          revealed from faith to faith (i.e., is announced by the gospel, so as
          to be apprehended by faith alone because nothing besides faith can
          concur in the reception of it). Hence he does not say “from faith to
          works,” but “from faith to faith” so that to faith alone this office
          is wholly ascribed. That Paul may prove this doctrine to be neither
          absurd nor new, he confirms it by the prophecy of Habakkuk where he
          says, “The just shall live by his faith” (2:4). Now although this
          prophecy refers also to a temporal blessing (viz., deliverance from
          the Babylonian captivity, which they would obtain by the intervention
          of faith in the divine promise; hence it is referred to by Paul in
          Heb. 10:38 to support believers in afflictions), still because the
          declaration of the prophet is general concerning faith in the promises
          of God, it is rightly applied specially to faith in Christ; and on
          this account the more— that the prophets and pious Jews regarded the
          promise of the Messiah as the foundation of all promises. Hence Paul
          (as best knowing the mind of the Holy Spirit) refers it (in Gal. 3:11
          and in this place) to justification in order to teach that by faith
          alone man obtains the righteousness which brings eternal life to him.
          “The just shall live by faith,” whether the “by faith” (to ek pisteos)
          be referred to the just with this meaning—he who by faith is just —or
          to life, meaning—the just lives by faith. They amount to the same
          thing and each is true—that both he who by faith is just, obtains
          salvation; and again he who is just, obtains salvation by faith. In
          vain, therefore, is it said that Paul understands a living faith and
          that it alone is not such, but with works. Although living faith is
          never alone in the person who is justified, still it is alone in the
          very act of justification—to the production of which the other virtues
          can contribute nothing, faith alone claiming this privilege for itself
          (as we have said before). No better do others wish that life to be
          referred to the works by which faith proves itself alive. The design
          of the prophet is to teach that faith alone is the means of obtaining
          salvation, both temporal and spiritual. And Paul says that this
          righteousness by faith is manifested without the law; which cannot be
          said of the righteousness of works, but only of the righteousness of
          faith; which is said of the man believing, not of one working.

          XIII. It is one thing for love and works to be required in the person
          who is justified (which we grant); another in the act itself or
          causality of justification (which we deny). If works are required as
          concomitants of faith, they are not on that account determined to be
          causes of justification with faith or to do the very thing which faith
          does in this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. Although the whole force of justifying on the part of man is in
          faith as to the act of apprehension (so that other virtues contribute
          nothing to it with faith), it does not follow that faith can justify
          when they are absent as well as when they are present—yea, even when
          the opposite vices are present. It is one thing to justify without
          virtues (i.e., separated from them —which we deny); another for it to
          justify alone, but not separated from them. As it does not follow, the
          hand alone writes and the eye alone sees— therefore as much when tom
          from the head and the other members as in the body; the sole force of
          respiration is in the lungs—therefore the lungs can respire torn out
          from the liver and other viscera as well as when connected with them
          (which everyone sees to be absurd). There are hundreds of things of
          this kind which have a certain proper efficacy and effect, which
          still, when separated from their adjuncts, lose all their power.
          Natural potencies are connected as to existence, but disjoined as to
          operation. Light and heat in the sun are most closely connected
          together, but still the light alone illuminates, the heat alone warms.
          Therefore, although the other virtues do not justify with faith, still
          faith cannot justify in their absence, much less the opposite vices
          being present. For faith cannot be true except in connection with the
          virtues (which if they do not contribute to justification, still
          contribute to the existence and life of faith, which the presence of
          vices would destroy).

        <p>
          XV. It is one thing for the love of the sinner to be the cause of the
          remission of sins a priori; another to be the effect and proof a
          posteriori. The latter is affirmed in Lk. 7:47, not the former. We
          gather this: (1) from the scope of the parable, which is to
          demonstrate which of two debtors, whose debt the creditor had
          cancelled, ought to love the creditor most (to wit, in token of
          gratitude); (2) from the answer of Peter, “I suppose that he, to whom
          he forgave most,” where love is placed as following, not as going
          before remission; (3) from the end, where a small remission is put as
          the cause of a small degree of love, “To whom little is forgiven, the
          same loveth little” (v. 47); (4) from v. 50, where salvation is
          ascribed to the faith, not to the love, of this woman, “Thy faith hath
          saved thee.” Nor does the particle hoti stand in the way because (as
          is known) it is so often only ratiocinative, not causal—the cause of
          the consequent, not of the consequence, so as to intimate that thence
          is known and gathered that many sins were forgiven her because she
          loved much.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. When John says, “We know that we have passed from death unto
          life, because we love the brethren” (1 Jn. 3:14), he teaches that love
          is a proof and sign of our justification from which we know that we
          have passed from death unto life. For he who is in love is in God (who
          is love) and he who is in God, cannot be in death. But he does not
          mean that love is the cause of that translation (which is elsewhere
          ascribed to faith, Jn. 5:24). Hence Lorinus and Gagnaeus on this
          passage well remark that “the causal article denotes the cause, not of
          the thing but of the knowledge.” On this account even the more, that
          since God loved us first (not we God, 1 Jn. 4:10), the justification
          by which God loved us ought to precede our love.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. Christ promises “the love of the Father” to those who love him
          (Jn. 14:23), not affectively and as to its beginning (as if the love
          of the Father then begins, since he loved us before, 1 Jn. 4:10), but
          effectively and as to continuance and increase because he will prove
          his love by distinguished blessings and console them by a new
          manifestation of himself. But this has nothing to do with
          justification because to love Christ and to keep his commands belongs
          to a man already constituted in grace and justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. The “fear of the Lord” (to wit, filial and reverential) is a
          consequence of justification, not a previous disposition to it. It is
          not called “the beginning of wisdom” (Ps. 111:10) as if it initially
          disposes to wisdom, but because it is its head and perfection, as it
          is said to be in Ecc. 12:13, which begins from it (Prov. 9:10) and
          ends in it. If it is said apotheisthai hamartémata (Sir. 1:21), this
          ought not to be understood of a positive expulsion (as if it
          introduced either meritoriously or dispositively remission of sins),
          but of a negative expulsion because he who fears God does not indulge
          in sins, nor give ear to their solicitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. It is one thing for hope to concur to salvation; another for it
          to concur to justification. The former is asserted in Rom. 5:5 and
          8:24 when hope is said not to make us ashamed; yea, also to save us.
          For the expectation of salvation is founded upon a hope so certain to
          be fulfilled in its own time, as if we already possessed salvation
          itself. But not the latter because the object of hope is not the
          remission of sins, but the fulfillment of the promised salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          XX. Although remission of sins is promised to repentance (because it
          ought to accompany faith and be in him who is justified as a certain
          condition requisite from him because God cannot pardon sin to an
          impenitent), it does not follow that it can be said to justify with
          faith because it contributes nothing (neither meritoriously, nor
          instrumentally) to the act of justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. It is one thing for eternal life and the heavenly inheritance to
          be referred to works as meritorious or instrumental causes of our
          justification; another as effects of faith and qualities and
          dispositions requisite in the subject to be glorified. As it is one
          thing to seek “why” (quare) life is given to believers; another “upon
          what” (quibus) or “upon what qualities” (qualibus) it depends. The
          former we deny because our works of whatever kind cannot merit life,
          nor have they the relation of an instrument for apprehending it. But
          the latter we grant. Nor is anything different gathered from Mt.
          25:34, 35, where works are not adduced by the Judge as “the
          foundations of the right” which they obtain to eternal life. The
          proper cause of that right is indicated in the preceding verses, when
          they are called “ye blessed of my Father,” who ought “to inherit
          (kléronomein) the kingdom” (i.e., possess it by a title of
          inheritance). Rather they are adduced as arguments and testimonies
          indubitable a posteriori, from which the truth of their faith could be
          proved, and the equity of the sentence pronounced (as the particle gar
          is not causal [aitiologike], but only ratiocinative).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXII. Since Paul and James were inspired by the same Spirit, they
          cannot be said to oppose each other on the doctrine of justification,
          so that one should ascribe justification to faith alone and the other
          to works also. The reconciliation is not difficult, if the design of
          each be considered and the natures of faith and of justification
          (concerning which both treat) be attended. Paul disputes against the
          Pharisees, who urged the merits of works; James disputes against the
          Libertines and Epicureans, who, content with a profession of faith
          alone, denied not only the merits of works, but also their necessity.
          Against the former, Paul rightly urges faith alone for justification.
          Against the latter, James properly commends the necessity of works for
          the confirmation of justification. Paul speaks of a living and
          efficacious faith; James of an idle and dead faith which cannot be
          demonstrated by works (2:18); Paul of justification a priori and
          constitutively; James of the same a posteriori and declaratively; Paul
          properly constitutes the former in faith alone; James rightly places
          the latter in works, by which the reality of our faith and
          justification is declared not only before men, but also before God.
          Therefore, when faith is said “to have wrought with works in Abraham,
          and by works to have been made perfect” (v. 22), this ought to be
          understood in relation to the efficacy of faith, which exerted itself
          by works and by which also it was consummated and made perfect. It
          ought not to be understood essentially, for this it has by its own
          nature (but declaratively) because it is proven to be perfect and
          sincere; just as “the power of God” is said to be “made perfect in our
          weakness” (2 Cor. 12:9), i.e., known and declared to be perfect. See
          what else belongs to this point in our “Disputatio ... De Concordia
          Pauli et Jacobi,” Opera (1848), 4:731-52.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIII. It is one thing for works to be connected with faith in the
          person of the justified; another, however, in the matter of
          justification. The former we acknowledge and will afterwards prove,
          when we discuss the necessity of good works; but the latter we deny
          with Paul—nay, we maintain that they are wholly incompatible
          (asystata) with faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIV. Augustine says rightly, “Good works do not precede the one to be
          justified, but follow the one justified” (Faith and Works 14 [FC
          27:247; PL 40.211]). A person is justified freely by faith without
          works (Rom. 3:24); yea, justification is of the wicked (Rom. 4:5;
          5:6). No good works can be granted which precede his justification as
          causes, but only which follow as the effects and fruits springing from
          the faith of remission (Lk. 7:47; 1 Tim. 1:5). If calling (by which
          faith and holiness are infused) is prior to justification, it does not
          follow that holiness no less than faith is prior to it because
          holiness is indeed infused, but in its own order and by faith (Acts
          15:9). Faith however concurs to justification before it does to
          sanctification. If remission is sometimes promised to repentance, this
          is indeed promised to it as a condition not antecedent or concomitant
          by reason of contrition, but only consequent as to new obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          NINTH QUESTION: THE TIME OF JUSTIFICATION

          <br />
          <em
            >Was justification made from eternity or is it made in time? Is it
            an undivided act taking place at one and the same time?</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The opinions of theologians about this question vary. Some maintain
          that it is an immanent act in God which was performed from eternity;
          others that it is transient, terminating in us and which takes place
          only in time and in this life. And there are some who hold that it is
          postponed to the last and decretory day, in which all must stand
          before the solemn and public tribunal of Christ to hear the sentence
          of absolution or of condemnation from his lips. Now although there is
          an agreement on both sides in the substance of the thing and a
          disagreement only in the mode of the thing, still it is of no little
          importance to the accurate knowledge of the subject to know what is
          the true opinion to be held here.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The first opinion is that of those who hold that justification
          preceded our birth and was made in eternity because they conceive it
          to be an immanent and internal act in God. However, as nothing new can
          happen to God in time, they think it was made in him from eternity and
          is ascribed to faith only as to cognizance and sense because it leads
          us into the knowledge of him and makes us certain of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Our justification is not made from eternity.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But although we do not deny that our justification was decreed
          even from eternity (as nothing takes place in time which was not
          constituted by him from eternity), still we do not think (speaking
          accurately) justification itself can be called eternal. The decree of
          justification is one thing; justification itself another—as the will
          to save and sanctify is one thing; salvation and sanctification itself
          another. The will or decree to justify certain persons is indeed
          eternal and precedes faith itself, but actual justification takes
          place in time and follows faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Second, Paul expressly confirms this in the chain of salvation,
          enumerating in order the benefits flowing to the elect from the
          eternal love of God where he puts calling before justification as
          something antecedent: “Whom he called, them he justified” (Rom. 8:30).
          Nor have those various passages a different meaning in which we are
          said to be justified through and by faith, than that faith is a
          something prerequisite to justification. This could not be said if
          justification was done from eternity. For it is weak and foreign to
          the meaning of Paul to refer these things to the sense of
          justification only.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Third, the nature of the thing itself proves this. For since
          justification or remission of sins necessarily involves a deliverance
          from the obligation to punishment which sins deserved and no one can
          obtain it without faith and repentance, it is evident that such a
          justification could not have been made from eternity, but only in
          time—when the man actually believes and repents. Otherwise it would
          follow that he who is justified and consequently has passed from death
          unto life and become a child of God and an heir of eternal life, still
          remains in death and is a child of wrath. He who is not yet converted
          and lies in sin, remains in death (1 Jn. 3:14) and is of the Devil (1
          Jn. 3:8) and in a state of condemnation (Gal. 5:21).
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Finally, since justification is a blessing of God, while a
          blessing cannot pass to us and be actually bestowed upon us, except in
          time, it is clear that it is not to be conceived of after the manner
          of an immanent and internal act in God, but after the manner of a
          transient act arising from God and passing over and terminating upon
          the creature (not that it may subjectively inhere in him, as the
          Romanists falsely hold because this pertains to sanctification; but
          that it may adhere to him and the creature has an objective relation
          to it, while the absolving sentence is intimated to him by the Holy
          Spirit). If grace is said to have been given to us in Christ before
          the world began by reason of “destination” (2 Tim. 1:9) because from
          eternity God decreed to give it to us in time, it does not follow that
          it can be said to have been really bestowed because the decree indeed
          causes us to obtain in time a right to life certainly and infallibly,
          but not that we can say we already obtained it actually. It causes
          that we should be justified, but not to be already justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>It does not take place only at the last day.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. But as justification cannot be conceived to have taken place from
          eternity before the ages, so neither ought it to be thrown forward to
          the consummation of the world as others hold—as if God only then
          exercises properly the act of a Judge, both in the pardon of believers
          and in the condemnation of the wicked. For thus the declaration of
          justification is falsely confounded with justification itself. For
          although we are told the heavenly Judge will then sit on his throne of
          glory to exercise the last solemn act of judgment (as much in grace as
          in justice, in the sight of heaven and earth), this does not prevent
          that judgment from commencing in the present life. Nay, this must
          necessarily be supposed, since that final judgment is nothing else
          than a public and solemn manifestation of preceding judgments. And as
          Scripture everywhere sets before us the examples of God’s judgments,
          public as well as private over the wicked and rebellious (such as the
          flood, the destruction of Sodom, the overthrow of the Egyptians and
          the like), to refer these to mere chastisements of God, tending
          towards the improvement and salvation of those upon whom they were
          sent, is to contradict the whole tenor of Scripture and rashly to
          confound the medicinal chastisements of believers (which are sent upon
          them for instruction [paideian] by God as a merciful Father) with the
          punishments of the wicked (which are inflicted by God as an angry
          Judge, to punish [timorian] and avenge himself of their sins)—which
          has thus far been unheard-of in theological schools. So that he is
          evidently a stranger to the Scriptures who does not know that God is
          often set forth as justifying believers in this life; as is evident
          from the examples of Abraham (Gen. 15:6), of David (Ps. 32:1, 2, 5;
          Rom. 4:6, 7), of the sinful woman (Lk. 7:48), of the publican (Lk.
          18:14) and of all believers (Rom. 5:1). Not to say now that that
          opinion is hurtful to the consolation of believers, which springs from
          no other source more certainly than from a sense of the grace of God
          and his justification. For how else could they have the confidence in
          which they glory and exult on account of their justification and enjoy
          unspeakable (aneklaléto) peace and joy?
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>But it takes place in this life in effectual calling.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. This opinion then being dismissed, we embrace the middle one,
          which makes justification to take place in this life in the moment of
          effectual calling, by which the sinner is transferred from a state of
          sin to a state of grace and is united to Christ, his head, by faith.
          For hence it is that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to him by
          God, by whose merit apprehended by faith he is absolved from his sins
          and obtains a right to life. This absolving sentence, the Spirit
          pronounces in his heart when he says, “Be of good courage, son, thy
          sins are pardoned.”
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Further, this justification can be regarded in different ways: (1)
          actively on the part of God intimating by the Spirit the absolving
          sentence in the heart of the believer and judicially from the throne
          of grace (Heb. 4:16), pronouncing it upon us; and passively on our
          part, inasmuch as we admit and receive that absolving sentence
          delivered in the court of conscience by the Holy Spirit with faith,
          joy and the protestation of gratitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Second, universally as to state, when we are first received into
          union with Christ and his righteousness is imputed to us by God and
          received by faith. For then in passing from a state of sin into a
          state of grace, the guilt of all preceding sins is actually taken away
          and a remedy given to us in the righteousness of Christ against future
          sins. And specially as to particular acts of sin into which we
          afterwards fall, which also need a particular absolution. As often as
          it is intimated to us in the court of conscience, so often the
          believer is by repentance turned again to God and by faith applies to
          himself Christ’s righteousness. In this sense, we are commanded to
          seek remission of sins every day; not only with regard to the sense,
          but also with regard to the thing itself because sins cannot be
          forgiven unless committed (as we remarked before).
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Third, justification can be viewed in a twofold aspect (schesei):
          either as to the “eternal destination” in the decree, in which sense
          grace is said “to have been given to us in Christ before the world
          began” (2 Tim. 1:9) and God is said to have “predestinated us unto the
          adoption” (Eph. 1:5); or as to its execution in time which again can
          be regarded on the one hand as to obtainment, which was made by the
          death of Christ on the cross (referred to in Rom. 5:9, 10: “We were
          justified and reconciled to God by the blood of Christ”; and “Christ
          reconciled all things to God through the blood of the cross,” Col.
          1:20). Elsewhere Christ is said to “have been raised again for our
          justification” (Rom. 4:25) because as in him dead, we are dead, so in
          him raised and justified, we are justified (i.e., we have a sure and
          indubitable pledge and foundation of our justification because for no
          other cause was he justified by the Spirit [1 Tim. 3:16] except that
          we might be justified in him). Nor in a different sense does Paul say,
          “God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing
          their trespasses unto them” (2 Cor. 5:19); to wit, inasmuch as in
          Christ dying, the Father had the foundation of reconciliation by which
          he was made more propitious to the world of the elect, collected as
          well from the Jews as from the Gentiles, so that he does not impute to
          them their sins (which he imputed to Christ), but by absolving them
          from their sins, he may justify them also in him. On the other hand it
          may be viewed as to application, which is made in the heart by an
          intimation of the absolving sentence (referred to in Mt. 9:2). Or it
          may be viewed in general as to the state of the believer when he is
          first called; or in particular as to the act when he obtains the
          pardon of particular sins; or as to the sense and certainty of it,
          arising in us from a reflex act of faith (called consolatory); or
          finally, as to its declaration, which should be made immediately after
          death (Heb. 9:27) and publicly on the last day (which is not so much
          justification, as a solemn declaration of the justification once made
          and an adjudication of the reward, in accordance with the preceding
          justification).
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Hence it is evident in what sense justification can be called an
          undivided act; not on our part and with respect to the sense of it
          (which is produced by various and repeated acts according as this
          sense can be interrupted; or increased or diminished, by reason of
          interfering sins); but on the part of God, not only by reason of his
          decree (by which our justification was decreed) and by reason of his
          merit (by which he obtained it), but also by reason of the application
          when the absolving sentence is intimated to us. This is done by a
          unique act, not by many successive acts, just as inherent
          righteousness is wont to be infused into us (although this act is
          often applied to particular everyday sins).
        </p>
        <p>
          TENTH QUESTION
          <br />

          <em>The unity, perfection and certainty of justification</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Unity, perfection and certainty are the three principal adjuncts of
          justification concerning which disputes exist. Of these we must speak
          briefly because we have elsewhere discussed them partially.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The unity or equality of justification among believers.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Unity can be regarded in two ways: either relative to believers
          among themselves; or absolutely with respect to him who is justified.
          In the former sense, it is said to be “one in species” or “equal in
          all believers” of all times and places because God justifies all
          believers in the same manner (viz., by his grace and the merit of
          Christ through faith). “Seeing it is one God,” says the apostle,
          “which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision
          through faith” (Rom. 3:30), i.e., who justifies the Jews as well as
          the Gentiles by faith. For since all are liable to sin and
          condemnation (v. 19), and destitute of the glory of God (v. 23), there
          is no other method of justification than by faith. The apostle proves
          this fully in the same place and confirms it by the examples of David
          and of Abraham (Rom. 4); as also of all the saints of the Old
          Testament mentioned in Heb. 11, who by faith are said to have pleased
          God (v. 6), to have obtained witness that they were righteous (v. 4)
          and to have become heirs of the righteousness which is by faith (v.
          7). Nor either in the Old or New Testament can there be found any
          dissimilar example of a person justified in another way. Hence Peter
          says, “To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
          whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins” (Acts
          10:43). Through the grace of Christ, we shall be saved, even as they
          (Acts 15:11). Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever (Heb.
          13:8); he is the Way, and the Truth and the Life; no one can come to
          the Father except by him (Jn. 14:6).
        </p>
        <p>
          III. For the objections brought forward here by the Socinians against
          the identity of the justification of the believers of the Old and New
          Testaments, see Topic XII, Question 5 concerning the unity of the
          covenant of grace (where they are discussed).
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now although the same benefit as to substance was common to the
          believers of the Old Testament no less than to those of the New (as
          they had true remission of sins in and on account of Christ), still
          there was a multiple difference as to degree and sense. It is far more
          clearly revealed and more fully and efficaciously felt by us now; as
          was proved in the same place and in Question 12.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The numerical unity of the same in particular believers.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Second, the same justification is one numerically in individuals.
          It is not promoted successively after the manner of sanctification by
          repeated acts, but is finished in one judicial act and brings to the
          believer the remission of all sins. Hence the Romanists (from their
          fictitious hypothesis concerning physical justification by an infusion
          of righteousness) falsely make it twofold: the first, that by which a
          man from being unjust is made just by an infusion of righteousness;
          the second, that by which from being just he is made more just by the
          increase of righteousness. The foundation having been once overturned
          (as was done above), whatever is built upon it falls. Nor does the
          passage in Rev. 22:11 favor this error because (as we have already
          said), it does not treat of the infusion of righteousness, but either
          of the sense and declaration of righteousness once gained (which is
          retained by the exercise of righteousness) or of its special
          application to everyday sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The distinction between active and passive justification points
          out indeed the truth of the terms “from which” and “to which” (viz.,
          of God who justifies and of man who is justified), but does not change
          the degree or species. For by the same sentence by which God justifies
          us (while he intimates it to the conscience), we are also passively
          justified when it is received by us through faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. The blessing of justification and the right to it differ from the
          feeling and the knowledge of it. There is no cutting off or renewal of
          the former because it is a gift without repentance (ametameléton). The
          latter, however, may be interrupted and restored according to the
          various increases and decreases of sanctification. And although that
          sense may be interrupted in grievous sins and be recovered by various
          and repeated acts, still the blessing of justification remains always
          in him the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Although our justification will be fully declared on the last
          day (our good works also being brought forward as the sign and proof
          of its truth, Mt. 25:3440), still falsely would anyone maintain from
          this a twofold gospel justification—one from faith in this life (which
          is the first); the other (and second) from works on the day of
          judgment (as some hold, agreeing too much with Romanists on this
          point). The sentence to be pronounced by the supreme Judge will not be
          so much a new justification, as the solemn and public declaration of a
          sentence once passed and its execution by the assignment of the life
          promised with respect to an innocent person from the preceding
          justification. Thus it is nothing else than an adjudicatory sentence
          of the possession of the kingdom of heaven from the right given before
          through justification. And if works are then brought forward, they are
          not adduced as the foundation of a new justification to be obtained
          then, but as signs, marks and effects of our true faith and of our
          justification solely by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. It is one thing to apply justification often and to extend it to
          sins of daily occurrence (in which sense we are commanded to seek
          remission of sins every day); another to repeat and renew
          justification often. The former we grant, but not the latter. Nor is
          there need that a new justification should take place as often as the
          believer falls into a new sin. It is sufficient that the justification
          once made (which if not formally, virtually and generically contains
          the remission of all sins) be applied and extended specifically and
          determinatively to this or that sin by an intimation of the Holy
          Spirit and the apprehension of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Although remission of sins ought to be applied often to daily sins,
          yet falsely would anyone thence gather that sins once discharged
          revive and return again by subsequent sins (as some of the Romanists
          hold), since it is an unchangeable (ametameléton) gift of God. Nor
          does the parable of that ungrateful servant (who, after a greater
          amount had been yielded to him by his master, wished to deal cruelly
          with his fellow servant who owed him far less and who on that account
          was delivered to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due
          unto him [which is recorded in Mt. 18:23-—35]) prove this. It pertains
          to nothing else than to show that the remission of sins proposed
          conditionally does not belong to him in whom the condition is lacking.
          The design of the parable (which is to be regarded here simply) is no
          other than to teach that the mercy of God is not exercised towards the
          unmerciful; nor are sins pardoned by God, except to those who forgive
          the offenses of others. To show this the more efficaciously, the
          master is opposed here to his servant, an immense sum to a minute and
          the highest clemency to extreme inhumanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. Perfection.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. (2) Perfection belongs to justification, according to which it is
          so full and absolute intensively (both with respect to evils taken
          away and blessings acquired) that it is free as to itself from
          increase and decrease. Nor does it admit of more and less, although as
          to the apprehension and sense of it our faith advances so gradually as
          to have even its progressions and defects. If the faith by which we
          are justified is active and remitted, it does not follow that
          justification itself is equally intermittent because it does not
          justify by itself and properly, but only instrumentally and
          relatively; as the beholding of the brazen serpent did not cease
          equally to heal, although some looked at it more intently and strongly
          than others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>3. Certainty.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. (3) Its certainty is twofold: one of the object in itself by the
          immutability and perseverance by which God never recalls the pardon
          once given (on account of the immutability of his grace, justice and
          promise confirmed by an oath, Heb. 6:17, 18). For the gifts of God
          bestowed upon the elect and the calling according to his purpose (kata
          prothesin) are without repentance (ametameléta, Rom. 11:29). Hence God
          _ never condemns and disinherits those whom he has once justified and
          made heirs. The other is the certainty of the subject, which refers to
          the sense of justification. Although it is possible from the nature of
          faith (yea, even necessary to bring peace and consolation to our
          souls), still it is not always in the same degree—but more perfect or
          imperfect according to the proportion of faith, so that there never
          was a believer (not even excepting Abraham [Gen. 17:17], or David [Ps.
          42:5, 11]) who did not have to struggle with doubts concerning grace.
          How each of these certainties belong to justification has already been
          shown fully, when we discussed the perseverance and certainty of
          faith; cf. Topic XV, Questions 16 and 17.
