        Q. 70. What is justification?
        <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Justification is an act of God's free grace unto sinners,<sup>i</sup> in which
        he pardoneth all their sins, accepteth and accounteth their persons righteous in his sight;<sup>k</sup> not for
        anything wrought in them, or done by them,<sup>l</sup> but only for the perfect obedience and full satisfaction
        of Christ, by God imputed to them,<sup>m</sup> and received by faith alone.<sup>n</sup>
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>i</sup>Rom. 3:22, 24-25. … even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and
        upon all them that believe: for there is no difference.… being justified freely by his grace through the
        redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to
        declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God. Rom. 4:5. But
        to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
        righteousness
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>l</sup>Titus 3:5, 7. Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved
        us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.… that being justified by his grace, we
        should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. Eph. 1:7. … in whom we have redemption through his
        blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>n</sup>Acts 10:43. To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him
        shall receive remission of sins. Gal. 2:16. … knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but
        by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of
        Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. Phil. 3:9. …
        and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith
        of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.
      </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Q. 71. How is justification an act of God's free grace?
        <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Although Christ, by his obedience and death, did make a proper, real, and full
        satisfaction to God's justice in the behalf of them that are justified;<sup>o</sup> yet inasmuch as God
        accepteth the satisfaction from a surety, which he might have demanded of them, and did provide this surety, his
        own only Son,<sup>p</sup> imputing his righteousness to them,<sup>q</sup> and requiring nothing of them for
        their justification but faith,<sup>r</sup> which also is his gift,<sup>s</sup> their justification is to them of
        free grace.<sup>t</sup>
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>q</sup>2 Cor. 5:21. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
        righteousness of God in him. Rom. 4:6, 11. Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom
        God imputeth righteousness without works.… And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness
        of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though
        they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also.
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>r</sup>Rom. 3:24–25. … being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
        whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the
        remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>s</sup>Eph. 2:8. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of
        God.
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>t</sup>Eph. 1:7. … in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the
        riches of his grace. Rom. 3:24–25. … being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in
        Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his
        righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.
      </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Q. 72. What is justifying faith?
        <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Justifying faith is a saving grace,<sup>u</sup> wrought in the heart of a sinner
        by the Spirit<sup>w</sup> and Word of God,<sup>x</sup> whereby he, being convinced of his sin and misery, and of
        the disability in himself and all other creatures to recover him out of his lost condition,<sup>y</sup> not only
        assenteth to the truth of the promise of the gospel,<sup>z</sup> but receiveth and resteth upon Christ and his
        righteousness, therein held forth, for pardon of sin,<sup>a</sup> and for the accepting and accounting of his
        person righteous in the sight of God for salvation.<sup>b</sup>
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>u</sup>Heb. 10:39. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the
        saving of the soul.
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>x</sup>Rom. 10:14–17. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they
        believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they
        preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of
        peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord,
        who hath believed our report? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 1 Cor. 1:21. For
        after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching
        to save them that believe.
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>z</sup>Eph. 1:13. … in whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your
        salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise. Heb. 11:13.
        These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of
        them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>a</sup>John 1:12. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
        them that believe on his name. Acts 16:31. And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
        saved, and thy house. Acts 10:43. To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever
        believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. Zech. 3:8–9. Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy
        fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the
        BRANCH. For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will
        engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>b</sup>Phil. 3:9. … and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that
        which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. Acts 15:11. But we believe
        that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.
      </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Q. 73. How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight of God?
        <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God, not because of those other graces
        which do always accompany it, or of good works that are the fruits of it,<sup>c</sup> nor as if the grace of
        faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for his justification;<sup>d</sup> but only as it is an
        instrument by which he receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness.<sup>e</sup>
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>c</sup>Gal. 3:11. But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just
        shall live by faith. Rom. 3:28. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the
        law.
      </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        <sup>e</sup>John 1:12. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
        them that believe on his name. Phil. 3:9. … and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of
        the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. Gal. 2:16. …
        knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have
        believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law:
        for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
