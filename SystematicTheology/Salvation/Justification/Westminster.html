          Q. 70. What is justification?
          <br /><span class="tab"></span>A. Justification is an act of God's
          free grace unto sinners,<sup>i</sup> in which he pardoneth all their
          sins, accepteth and accounteth their persons righteous in his
          sight;<sup>k</sup> not for anything wrought in them, or done by
          them,<sup>l</sup> but only for the perfect obedience and full
          satisfaction of Christ, by God imputed to them,<sup>m</sup> and
          received by faith alone.<sup>n</sup> (<sup>i</sup>Rom. 3:22, 24-25;
          Rom. 4:5; <sup>k</sup>2 Cor. 5:19, 21; Rom. 3:22, 24-25, 27-28;
          <sup>l</sup>Titus 3:5, 7; Eph. 1:7; Rom. 5:17-19; <sup>m</sup>Rom.
          4:6-8; 5:17-19<sup>n</sup>Acts 10:43; Gal. 2:16; Phil. 3:9).

          Q. 71. How is justification an act of God's free grace?
          <br /><span class="tab"></span>A. Although Christ, by his obedience
          and death, did make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God's
          justice in the behalf of them that are justified;<sup>o</sup> yet
          inasmuch as God accepteth the satisfaction from a surety, which he
          might have demanded of them, and did provide this surety, his own only
          Son,<sup>p</sup> imputing his righteousness to them,<sup>q</sup> and
          requiring nothing of them for their justification but faith,<sup
            >r</sup
          >
          which also is his gift,<sup>s</sup> their justification is to them of
          free grace.<sup>t</sup> (<sup>o</sup>Rom. 5:8-10, 19; <sup>p</sup>1
          Tim. 2:5-6; Heb. 7:22; 10:10; Matt. 20:28; Dan. 9:24, 26; Isa. 53:4-6;
          Isa. 53:10-12; Heb. 7:22; Rom. 8:32; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; <sup>q</sup>2
          Cor. 5:21; Rom. 3:24-25; Eph. 2:8; Eph. 1:7).

          Q. 72. What is justifying faith?
          <br /><span class="tab"></span>A. Justifying faith is a saving
          grace,<sup>u</sup> wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit<sup
            >w</sup
          >
          and Word of God,<sup>x</sup> whereby he, being convinced of his sin
          and misery, and of the disability in himself and all other creatures
          to recover him out of his lost condition,<sup>y</sup> not only
          assenteth to the truth of the promise of the gospel,<sup>z</sup> but
          receiveth and resteth upon Christ and his righteousness, therein held
          forth, for pardon of sin,<sup>a</sup> and for the accepting and
          accounting of his person righteous in the sight of God for
          salvation.<sup>b</sup> (<sup>u</sup>Heb. 10:39; <sup>w</sup>II Cor.
          4:13; Eph. 1:17-19; <sup>x</sup>Rom. 10:14, 17; <sup>y</sup>Acts 2:37;
          4:12; 16:30; John 16:8-9; Rom. 5:6; Eph. 2:1; <sup>z</sup>Eph. 1:13;
          <sup>a</sup>John 1:12; Acts 10:43; 16:31; <sup>b</sup>Phil. 3:9; Acts
          15:11).

          Q. 73. How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight of God?
          <br /><span class="tab"></span>A. Faith justifies a sinner in the
          sight of God, not because of those other graces which do always
          accompany it, or of good works that are the fruits of it,<sup>c</sup>
          nor as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him
          for his justification;<sup>d</sup> but only as it is an instrument by
          which he receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness.<sup
