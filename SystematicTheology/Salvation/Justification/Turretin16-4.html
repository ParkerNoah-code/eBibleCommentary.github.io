          FOURTH QUESTION

          <br />
          <em
            >Does justification consist only in the remission of sins? Or does
            it embrace also adoption and the right to life? The former we deny
            and affirm the latter</em
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We have discussed the meritorious cause or the foundation of
          justification. We must now treat of its form or parts. In this matter,
          the opinions of theologians vary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Statement of the question.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Some contend that the whole of justification is comprehended in
          the remission of sin alone, so that God is to be considered as
          justifying us when he pardons our sins and absolves us from all
          punishment. They also hold this opinion who maintain that Christ’s
          passive righteousness alone is imputed to us. However, others make
          justification to consist of two parts: remission of sin and imputation
          of righteousness. The former removes punishment from the sinner; the
          latter renders him worthy of the reward or of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But neither opinion seems to us to explain this subject with
          sufficient accuracy. Not the first because (as we shall afterwards
          say) absolution from punishment is not sufficient for a full
          justification, but the communication of a right to life is also
          required. If the orthodox sometimes assert that justification is
          contained in the remission of sins alone, it does not follow that they
          do not also acknowledge the right to life under it. For they speak
          thus against the Romanists, who hold that to justification pertains
          not only the remission of sins, but also an internal renovation of the
          soul and an infusion of righteousness. Against these they well
          maintain that the whole of justification consists in the remission of
          sins, under which they embrace also the right to life, exclusive of
          the renovation of man or the infusion of righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. But neither can the second opinion be received simply because in
          it are falsely joined the remission of sins and the imputation of
          righteousness, as if they were parts answering to each other:
          remission indeed the first; imputation of righteousness another.
          However they do not in turn correspond with each other as a part to a
          part, but as a cause to an effect and a foundation to that which rests
          upon it and depends upon it. For if we wish to philosophize correctly,
          God does not remit our sins and afterwards impute righteousness, but
          he first imputes righteousness and afterwards on account of that
          imputed righteousness, remits our sins. For a satisfaction and a
          ransom (lytron) must necessarily intervene in order that remission may
          be granted by God without detriment to his justice and that it may be
          the foundation of the absolving sentence which is made in favor of the
          elect. If by the imputation of righteousness, theologians mean nothing
          else than the bestowal of a right to life (as it is certain many do),
          they hold that indeed truly, but do not express themselves with
          sufficient accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Thus then we believe the thing may be more readily and clearly
          conceived. Christ having been destined and given of God to us as a
          surety and head, in virtue of this union it happens that whatever was
          done by him (or endured for the perfect fulfillment of the law as to
          its precepts as well as to its penal sanction) is reckoned ours, as
          done in our place, and is imputed to us by God as if it had been
          performed by ourselves. From this imputation of his most perfect
          righteousness flow two benefits—both remission of sins and the
          bestowal of a right to life or adoption (in which two the whole of
          justification is contained). Thus the imputation of righteousness is
          the foundation and the meritorious cause of justification, while
          adoption and absolution are two parts of justification and effects of
          the imputation of righteousness which are inseparable from each other.
          For as pardon of sin cannot be granted nor a right to life be
          conferred, except on the supposition of the imputation of
          righteousness (by the intervention of which God can without prejudice
          to his justice free from punishment and bestow life), so, such
          imputation being posited, both these benefits flow necessarily from
          the double property of this righteousness, inasmuch as it has a
          satisfactory and meritorious power at the same time. By reason of the
          former, imputed righteousness is the foundation of the remission of
          sins; by reason of the latter, it is the cause of the right to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Remission and the right to life, the two parts of justification.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Now many reasons prove that these two benefits must be joined
          together here, whether we attend to the law (which was to be
          fulfilled) or regard our necessity, or the nature of things, or the
          voice of Scripture. For as the law contains a sanction of two parts—on
          the one side the punishment of death to transgressors; on the other,
          the reward of life to the obedient—so the righteousness of the law
          (which by the justification of Christ is fulfilled in us) cannot be
          obtained except with the remission of sins (which involves a
          liberation from punishment). We have a right to life which Christ
          acquired for us most perfectly by his obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. Second, the necessity of salvation demanded this very thing. Two
          evils were conveyed to us by sin: (1) that we were made guilty before
          God; (2) that we were made enemies and aliens from God, the fountain
          of life— the guilt of death into which we enter and the privation of
          life which we lost. And thus we could not be restored to integrity
          unless the guilt of death were taken away by the remission of sins and
          a right to life were given by adoption. As happiness is placed not
          only in a privation of evil, but most especially in the possession of
          good, it was not enough to be delivered from evil or death, unless
          also the right to good or life had been conferred.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Third, the nature of the thing proves it. It is one thing to
          redeem from punishment; another to assign a reward also. It is one
          thing to deliver from death; another to bestow life and happiness. It
          is one thing to bring out of prison; another to seat upon a throne.
          The former takes away evil, but the latter superadds good also; as if
          a fugitive slave should not only be acquitted of the punishment due,
          but also raised to the dignity and right of a son. For although these
          two things are connected together indissolubly from the covenant of
          grace, still from the nature of the thing they could be separated; as
          Adam, although innocent from the beginning of his creation and worthy
          of no punishment, still was not at once worthy of a reward until he
          had perfected the round of obedience, so it was not absolutely
          necessary that he whose sins have been remitted and who is delivered
          from the guilt of death, should straightway be gifted with a crown of
          immortality (since, if it pleased God, he might have afterwards
          directed man to work by which he should obtain the reward). Liberty
          certainly necessarily follows deliverance from prison, but not
          immediately the crown and throne. Joseph freed from his chains ought
          not on that account to be set over Egypt. Mephibosheth, brought out
          from squalor and thirst, was not immediately to be carried to the
          king’s table. Thus two things must be distinctly conceived of in this
          benefit: the pardon of sin committed with a deliverance from the curse
          of the law; and a bestowal of the reward or blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. In many places, Scripture connects and distinguishes these.
          “Christ was made under the law [hypo nomon] to redeem them that were
          under the law” (Gal. 4:4, 5) (to wit, as to the curse that we might
          receive the adoption of sons; i.e., the right to life which flows from
          adoption). Paul elsewhere confirms this: “by which faith we receive
          forgiveness of sins, and inheritance (kléron) among them which are
          sanctified” (Acts 26:18) (i.e., a right to eternal life with other
          saints). Here belongs the gradation between peace and glory which he
          weaves together when he says that “being justified we have peace with
          God, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God” (Rom. 5:1, 2). Peace has
          reference to deliverance from punishment and glorying supposes the
          bestowal of a right to life, which is the foundation of our hope. On
          this account, he joins together “the being saved from wrath” and
          “glorying in God” (Rom. 5:9, 11). This very thing Daniel had already
          intimated when he ascribes to the Messiah, who was about to come, “a
          propitiation of iniquity” (by whom remission would be obtained) and
          “the bringing of an everlasting righteousness” (by whose power a right
          to life would be given, Dan. 9:24). Nor does Christ mean anything else
          when he promises believers “a transition from death to life” (i.e.,
          not only deliverance from death, but also the possession of life).
          John means the same thing when he says that Christ not only “washes us
          from sin” by obtaining their pardon, but also “makes us kings and
          priests” who obtain the right to happiness and glory (Rev. 1:5, 6).
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Hence it appears that they are deceived who hold that the remission
          of sins and the imputation of righteousness differ only by reason of
          the diverse terms from which (a quo) and to which (ad quem); as it is
          not the covering of nakedness and the putting on of a garment, for
          this reason that sin and righteousness are contraries (ameta), one of
          which being posited the other is taken away. For it is far otherwise
          with these things, as we have already said. They are so to be joined
          together, as still not to be confounded, but to be distinguished as
          really differing from each other; or if the imputation of
          righteousness is put for a right to life, it is with respect to
          remission after the manner of a part, constituting with it the form of
          justification. Hence they are not to be compared with each other as
          the covering of nakedness and the putting on of a garment (which are
          really one and the same thing), but as deliverance from punishment and
          royal dignity in a guilty person.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Sin and righteousness are indeed direct contraries (ameta), but
          not the righteousness which signifies perseverance in righteousness
          and perfection itself. For it is one thing to be free from corruption,
          but another to have persisted in duty and to have acquired merit. Adam
          had the former, not the latter. Thus between death and life there is
          no middle ground; but between eternal death and a happy life the
          middle ground is the mortal and animal life, a pious and holy life—but
          on earth, not in heaven, under the obligation of meriting by
          obedience. So many things could still come in between the flames of
          hell and the joys of heaven, deliverance from punishment and the
          possession of the reward; the punishment of slaves and the dignity of
          sons. Who, therefore, confers upon us (who were slaves adjudged to
          eternal punishment) adoption and an inheritance, will he not also
          wonderfully increase the benefit? It was much for us to be manumitted
          and to be made freedmen; now to be pronounced children and heirs, this
          is the climax and crowning blessing of mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. When Paul argues from the remission of sins to the imputation of
          righteousness (Rom. 4:5—7), he does not do this on account of their
          equivalency, as if these two do not differ from each other and signify
          one and the same thing. Rather he does it on account of the undivided
          connection between both because remission of sins can be given to no
          one, except on account of the imputation of righteousness and
          imputation of righteousness is given to no one without his sins being
          forthwith pardoned.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. Although he who obtains the remission of all his sins (of
          omission as well as of commission) is freed from punishment (which he
          deserved on account of those sins) and thus far can be pronounced
          righteous (or rather justified and acquitted), still, accurately
          speaking, he cannot on that account be considered to have omitted
          nothing really good and to have committed nothing evil. God by
          remission reckons a man not unrighteous, not because he judges him
          never to have sinned and to be without a stain, but because he
          forgives and pardons the guilty whatever evil he has committed.
          However to pardon and, on account of rectitude of conduct
          (katorthomata), to reckon worthy of a reward and to honor, are far
          different. See what was said in Topic XIV, Question 8, Section 28 and
          following.
