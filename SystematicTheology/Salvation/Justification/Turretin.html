                FIRST QUESTION
                <br>
                <em>Is the word “justification” always used in a forensic sense in this argument;
                    or is it also used in a moral and physical sense? The former we affirm; the
                    latter we deny against the Romanists</em>.

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                I. As in the chain of salvation justification follows calling (Rom. 8:30)
                and is everywhere set forth as the primary effect of faith, the topic
                concerning calling and faith begets the topic concerning justification. This
                must be handled with the greater care and accuracy as this saving doctrine
                is of the greatest importance in religion. It is called by Luther “the article of
                a standing and a falling church” (Articulus stantis, et cadentis Ecclesiae).
                By other Christians, it is termed the characteristic and basis of Christianity
                —not without reason—the principal rampart of the Christian religion. This
                being adulterated or subverted, it is impossible to retain purity of doctrine in
                other places. Hence Satan in every way has endeavored to corrupt this
                doctrine in all ages, as has been done especially in the papacy. For this
                reason, it is deservedly placed among the primary causes of our secession
                from the Roman church and of the Reformation.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                II. However, although some of the more candid Romanists (conquered
                by the force of the truth) have felt and expressed themselves more soundly
                than others concerning this article (nor are there wanting also some among
                other divines who, influenced by a desire to lessen controversies, think
                there is not so great matter for dispute about it and that there are here not a
                few logomachies), still it is certain that up to this time there are between us
                and the Romanists in this argument controversies not only verbal, but real


                and many which are of great importance (as will be made manifest in what
                follows).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                III. From a false and preposterous explanation of the word, the truth of
                the thing itself has been wonderfully obscured. In the first place, its genuine
                sense (and in this question most especially) must be unfolded. This being
                settled, we will be able the more easily to reach the nature of the thing
                itself.

            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                IV. The word htsdyq, to which the Greek dikaioun answers and the Latin
                justificare, is used in two ways in the Scriptures—properly and improperly.
                Properly the verb is forensic, put for “to absolve” anyone in a trial or “to
                hold” and to declare “just”; as opposed to the verb “to condemn” and “to
                accuse” (Ex. 23:7; Dt. 25:1; Prov. 17:15; Lk. 18:14; Rom. 3—5). Thus apart
                from a trial, it is used to acknowledge and to praise one as just and that too
                either deservedly (as when it is terminated on God, in which way men are
                said to justify God when they celebrate him as just [Ps. 51:4]; “wisdom” is
                said to be “justified of her children” [Mt. 11:19*; Lk. 7:35], ie.,
                acknowledged and celebrated as such); or presumptuously ([doxastds] as
                the Pharisees are said to justify themselves, Lk. 16:15). Improperly it is
                used either ministerially, for to bring to righteousness (Dan. 12:3 where
                mtsdyqy seems to be exegetical of [exégétikon tou] mskylym because while
                the preachers of the gospel instruct and teach believers, by this very thing
                they justify them ministerially [to wit, by teaching them the true way in
                which they can be justified] in the same sense in which they are said to save
                them, 1 Tim. 4:16). Or by way of synecdoche (the antecedent being put for
                the consequent) for “to free”; “he that is dead is justified from sin” (Rom.
                6:7), i.e., freed. Or comparatively, where on account of a comparison
                between the sins of Israel and Samaria, Israel is said “to justify Samaria”
                (Ezk. 16:51, 52) and the sins of Judah increasing, Judah is said “to have
                justified Israel” (Jer. 3:11) because Israel was more just than Judah (i.e., her
                sins were fewer than the sins of Judah).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>Statement of the question.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                V. Hence arises the question with the Romanists concerning the acceptation
                of this word—whether it is to be taken precisely in a forensic sense in this
                affair; or whether it ought also to be taken in a physical and moral sense for
                the infusion of righteousness and justification, if it is allowable (so to
                speak) either by the acquisition or the increase of it. For they do not deny
                that the word jusfiticatio and the verb justificare are often taken in a
                forensic sense, even in this matter, as Bellarmine (“De Justificatione,” 1.1
                Opera [1858], 4:461-62), Tirinus (Theologiae — elenchticae
                controversarium fidei, Cont. 15, number 1 [1648], pp. 217-21) and Toletus
                (Commentarii et annotationes in epistolam ... ad Romanos, Annot. 13
                [1602], pp. 117—22) and not a few others. Yet they do not wish this to be the
                constant meaning, but that it often signifies a true production, acquisition or
                increase of righteousness; this is especially the case when employed about
                the justification of man before God. Hence they distinguish justification
                into “first and second.” The first is that by which the man who is unjust is
                made just; the second is that by which a just man is made more just. Hence
                Bellarmine says: “Justification undoubtedly is a certain movement from sin
                to righteousness, and takes its name from the terminus to which it leads, as
                all other similar motions, illumination, calefaction; that is true justification,
                where some righteousness is aquired beyond the remission of sin.” Thomas
                Aquinas says, “Justification taken passively implies a motion to making
                righteous, just as calefaction a motion to heat” (ST, III, Q. 113, Art. 1, p.
                1144). Now although we do not deny that this word has more than one
                signification and is taken in different ways in the Scriptures (now properly,
                then improperly, as we have already said), still we maintain that it is never
                taken for an infusion of righteousness, but as often as the Scriptures speak
                professedly about our justification, it always must be explained as a
                forensic term.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>Proof that the word “justification” is forensic. </b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VI. The reasons are: (1) the passages which treat of justification admit no
                other than a forensic sense (cf. Job 9:3; Ps. 143:2; Rom. 3:28; 4:1—-3; Acts
                13:39 and elsewhere). A judicial process is set forth and mention is made of
                an accusing “law,” of “accused persons” who are guilty (hypodikoi, Rom.
                3:19), of a “hand-writing” contrary to us (Col. 2:14), of divine “justice”

                demanding punishment (Rom. 3:24, 26), of an “advocate” pleading the
                cause (1 Jn. 2:1), of “satisfaction” and imputed righteousness (Rom. 4 and
                5), of a “throne of grace” before which we are absolved (Heb. 4:16), of a
                “judge” pronouncing sentence (Rom. 3:20) and absolving sinners (Rom.
                4:5).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VII. (2) Justification is opposed to condemnation: “Who shall lay
                anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he
                that condemneth?” (Rom. 8:33, 34*). As therefore accusation and
                condemnation occur only in a trial, so also justification. Nor can it be
                conceived how God can be said to condemn or to justify, unless either by
                adjudging to punishment or absolving us from it judicially. Toletus is
                compelled to confess this on Rom. 8:33: “The word justification in this
                place is taken with that signification, which is opposed to its antithesis,
                namely, condemnation; so that it is the same in this place to justify as to
                pronounce just, as a judge by his sentence absolves and pronounces
                innocent” (Commentarii et annotationes in epistolam ... ad Romanos
                [1602], p. 441 on Rom. 8:33). Cornelius a Lapide, who otherwise earnestly
                strives to obscure the truth, still overcome by the force of the truth,
                acknowledges that God justifies (i.e., absolves from the threatened action of
                sin and the Devil and pronounces just).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VIII. (3) The equivalent phrases by which our justification is described
                are judicial: such as “not to come into judgment” (Jn. 5:24), “not to be
                condemned” (Jn. 3:18), “to remit sins,” “to impute righteousness” (Rom. 4),
                “to be reconciled” (Rom. 5:10; 2 Cor. 5:19) and the like. (4) This word
                ought to be employed in the sense in which it was used by Paul in his
                disputation against the Jews. Yet it is certain that he did not speak there of
                an infusion of righteousness (viz., whether from faith or from the works of
                the law, the habit of righteousness should be infused into man), but how the
                sinner could stand before the judgment seat of God and obtain a right to life
                (whether by the works of the law, as the Jews imagined, or by faith in
                Christ). And since the thought concerning justification arose without doubt
                from a fear of divine judgment and of the wrath to come, it cannot be used
                in any other than a forensic sense (as it was used in the origin of those
                questions which were agitated in a former age upon the occasion of
                indulgences, satisfactions and remission of sins). (5) Finally, unless this
                word is taken in a forensic sense, it would be confounded with
                sanctification. But that these are distinct, both the nature of the thing and
                the voice of Scripture frequently prove.

            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                IX. Although the word “justification” in certain passages of Scripture
                should recede from its proper signification and be taken in another than a
                forensic sense, it would not follow that it is taken judicially by us falsely
                because the proper sense is to be looked to in those passages in which the
                foundation of this doctrine is formed. (2) Although perchance it should not
                be taken precisely in a forensic sense for “to pronounce just” and “to
                absolve in a trial,” still we maintain that it cannot be taken in a physical
                sense for the infusion of righteousness, as the Romanists hold (as is easily
                proved from the passages brought forward by Bellarmine himself).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                X. In Is. 53:11, where it is said Christ “by his knowledge shall justify
                many,” it is manifest that reference is made to the meritorious and
                instrumental cause of our absolution with God (namely, Christ and the
                knowledge or belief of him). For the knowledge of Christ here ought not to
                be taken subjectively concerning the knowledge by which he knows what
                was agreed upon between himself and the Father (which has nothing to do
                with our justification); but objectively concerning that knowledge by which
                he is known by his people unto salvation (which is nothing else than faith,
                to which justification is everywhere ascribed). The following words show
                that no other sense is to be sought when it is added “for he shall bear their
                iniquities.” This denotes the satisfaction of Christ, which faith ought to
                embrace in order that we may be justified.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XI. Nor does the passage in Dan. 12:3 press us. As we have already said,
                justification is ascribed to the ministers of the gospel, as elsewhere the
                salvation of believers is ascribed to them (1 Tim. 4:16; 1 Cor. 9:22). Not
                assuredly by an infusion of habitual righteousness (which does not come
                within their power), but by the instruction of believers by which, as they
                open the way of life, so they teach the mode by which sinners can obtain
                justification in Christ by faith. Hence the Vulgate does not translate it
                justificantes, but erudientes ad justitiam.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XII. “He that is righteous, let him be righteous still” (Rev. 22:11) does
                not favor our opponents so as to denote an infusion or increase of


                righteousness. Thus it would be tautological (tautologia) with the following
                words, “He that is holy, let him be holy still,” because justification would
                not differ from sanctification. But it is best to refer it to the application and
                sense of justification; for although on the part of God justification does not
                take place successively, still on our part it is apprehended by us by varied
                and repeated actions, while by new acts of faith we apply to ourselves from
                time to time the merit of Christ as a remedy for the daily sins into which we
                fall. Nay, although it should be granted that the exercise of righteousness is
                here meant (as in a manuscript we have dikaiosyneén poiésato) that it may be
                opposed to the preceding words—‘“He that is unjust, let him be more
                unjust’—the opinion of the Romanists will not on that account be
                established.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XIII. “The justification of the wicked” of which Paul speaks (Rom. 4:5),
                ought not to be referred to an infusion or increase of habitual righteousness,
                but belongs to the remission of sins (as it is explained by the apostle from
                David). Nay, it would not be a justification of the wicked, if it were used in
                any other sense than for a judicial absolution at the throne of grace. I
                confess that God in declaring just ought also for that very reason to make
                just so that his judgment may be according to truth. But man can be made
                just in two ways: either in himself or in another; either from the law or from
                the gospel. God therefore makes him just whom he justifies; not in himself,
                as if from a sight of his inherent righteousness he declared him just, but
                from the view of the righteousness imputed—in Christ. It is indeed an
                abomination to Jehovah to justify the wicked without a due satisfaction, but
                God in this sense justifies no wicked one (Christ having been given to us as
                a surety who received upon himself the punishment we deserved).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XIV. Although certain words of the same order with justification denote
                an effecting in the subject, there is not the same reason for this, which
                otherwise barbarously has been received into Latinity to express the force
                of htsdyq and dikaioun (neither of which admit a physical sense). Thus we
                magnify and justify God, not by making him great from small or just from
                unjust, but only declaratively celebrating him as such.
            </p>
            <p>

                SECOND QUESTION
                <br>
                <em>Is the impulsive and meritorious cause (on account of which man is justified
                    in the judgment of God) inherent righteousness infused into us or good
                    works ? We deny against the Romanists.</em>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                I. Since it is evident from the preceding question that the word
                “justification” is forensic and is taken judicially here because it relates to
                the manner in which sinful man can stand before the bar of God and obtain
                the pardon of sin with a right to life, we must inquire before all things what
                is the foundation of this justification or what is the true and proper
                meritorious cause in view of which he is absolved by God from sin and
                adjudged to life. Concerning this we must first treat negatively (kat’ arsin)
                according to the Pauline method in order that we may see in what it does
                not consist; second, we must treat affirmatively (kata thesin) to see in what
                it does consist.

            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                II. However, we must premise here that God, the just Judge (dikaiokritén),
                cannot pronounce anyone just and give him a right to life except on the
                ground of some perfect righteousness which has a necessary connection
                with life; but that righteousness is not of one kind. For as there are two
                covenants which God willed to make with men—the one legal and the other
                of grace—so also there is a twofold righteousness—legal and evangelical.
                Accordingly there is also a double justification or a double method of
                standing before God in judgment—legal and evangelical. The former
                consists in one’s own obedience or a perfect conformity with the law, which
                is in him who is to be justified; the latter in another’s obedience or a perfect
                observance of the law, which is rendered by a surety in the place of him
                who is to be justified—the former in us, the latter in Christ. Concerning the
                first, Paul says, “Not the hearers, but the doers of the law shall be justified”
                (Rom. 2:13); and “Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law.
                That the man which doeth those things shall live by them” (Rom. 10:5).
                Concerning the other, he says, “The gospel is the power of God unto
                salvation to every one that believeth, for therein is the righteousness of God
                revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith”
                (Rom. 1:16, 17); and “Being justified freely by his grace through the
                redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Rom. 3:24). Concerning both, he says,
                “That I may be found in Christ, not having my own righteousness, which is
                of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ” (Phil. 3:9; cf. also
                Rom. 9:30, 31). Hence a twofold justification flows: one in the legal
                covenant by one’s own righteousness according to the clause, “Do this and
                live”; the other in the covenant of grace, by another’s righteousness
                (Christ’s) imputed to us and apprehended by faith according to the clause,
                “Believe and thou shalt be saved.” Each demands a perfect righteousness.
                The former requires it in the man to be justified, but the latter admits the
                vicarious righteousness of a surety. The former could have place in a state
                of innocence, if Adam had remained in innocence. But because after sin it
                became impossible to man, we must fly to the other (i.e, the gospel), which
                is founded upon the righteousness of Christ.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                Ill. This being established, the question does not concern legal
                justification. For we confess that in it inherent righteousness is _ its
                meritorious cause, nor can it be obtained except by the perfect obedience of
                man. But because the law has now become weak by sin, this method of
                justification is impossible (ek ton adynaton). Thus we treat of the
                evangelical justification proposed to us in the covenant of grace, which we
                deny to be founded in inherent righteousness.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                IV. The question is not whether inherent righteousness is infused into us
                through the grace of Christ, by whose intervention we are made partakers of
                the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4) and obtain a true and real holiness pleasing
                and acceptable to God, by which we are properly denominated just and
                holy. For whatever the opponents may calumniously charge upon the
                orthodox (to wit, that “we allow of no inherent righteousness,” as
                Bellarmine, “De Justificatione,” 2.1 Opera [1858], 4:502, and others after
                him), it is surely a most foul calumny. Its falsity is proved from the writings
                of our divines whether public or private, in which everywhere and with
                common consent they teach that the benefits of justification and
                sanctification are so indissolubly connected with each other that God
                justifies no one without equally sanctifying him and giving inherent
                righteousness by the creating of a new man in true righteousness and
                holiness. But the question is whether that inherent righteousness (such as
                exists in believers on earth) enters into our justification, either as its cause
                or as a part, so that it constitutes some part of our justification and is the

                meritorious cause and foundation of our absolving sentence in the judgment
                of God. Romanists, as they pretend that justification consists of two parts—
                remission of sin and internal renovation of mind—so they assert that the
                cause on account of which God justifies us is the righteousness of God,
                which (infused into us) constitutes us internally righteous. For although
                they do not appear to exclude entirely the righteousness of Christ, inasmuch
                as they hold that by it he merited that God should communicate to us by the
                Holy Spirit internal righteousness and thus it is a condition of the formal
                cause (i.e., of inherent righteousness that it may be given to man), still they
                maintain that the right to seek life depends upon inherent righteousness and
                that on account of it God justifies us.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                V. This is evident from the Council of Trent where “the justification of
                the wicked is said to be the translation from that state in which man is born
                a son of the first Adam, into a state of grace and the adoption of the sons of
                God by the second Adam, Jesus Christ, our Savior. This translation indeed,
                after the promulgation of the gospel, cannot be made without the washing
                of regeneration or a desire for it” (Session 6.4, Schroeder, p. 31). And:
                “Justification itself follows this disposition or preparation which is not only
                the remission of sin, but also sanctification and the renovation of the inward
                man by a voluntary reception of grace and gifts, by which a person who was
                unjust is made just and instead of an enemy becomes a friend, so that he is
                an heir according to the hope of eternal life” (Session 6.7, Schroeder, p. 33).
                And afterwards: “The formal cause of it is the righteousness of God, not
                that by which he is himself righteous, but that by which he makes us
                righteous; and by which, bestowed upon us as his gift, we are renewed in
                the spirit of our mind and are not only accounted, but are truly called and
                are righteous, receiving each of us righteousness in ourselves, according to
                our measure, which the Spirit distributes to everyone as he wills and
                according to the peculiar disposition and cooperation of everyone” (ibid.).
                And Canon 11: “If any man shall say that men are justified solely by the
                remission of sins to the exclusion of grace and charity which is shed abroad
                in our hearts by the Spirit and is inherent in them, or even that the grace by
                which we are justified is only the favor of God, let him be accursed”
                (Session 6, Canon 11, Schroeder, p. 43). From these declarations, it is
                evident that the Council held that inherent righteousness is the cause on
                account of which we are justified. Nor ought we to be deceived by their


                seeming distinction between the formal and meritorious cause: the one
                indeed being Christ’s, but the other infused righteousness. Since they speak
                of justification before God, the formal cause cannot be distinguished from
                the meritorious cause because in this respect the formal cause is nothing
                other than that in view of which God frees us from condemnation and
                receives us to eternal life.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VI. On the other hand, the orthodox think far differently. For although
                they do not deny that inherent righteousness was purchased for us by the
                merit of Christ and by his grace conferred upon us so that by it we are and
                can be denominated truly just and holy, still they deny that it enters into
                justification in any way, either as a cause or as a part, so that justification
                may be said to be placed in it and by and on account of it man may be
                justified before God. For the righteousness of Christ alone imputed to us is
                the foundation and meritorious cause upon which our absolutary sentence
                rests, so that for no other reason does God bestow the pardon of sin and the
                right to life than on account of the most perfect righteousness of Christ
                imputed to us and apprehended by faith. Hence it is readily gathered that we
                have not here a mere dispute about words (as some falsely imagine), but a
                controversy most real and indeed of the highest moment. In it we treat of
                the principal foundation of our salvation, which being overthrown or
                weakened, all our confidence and consolation both in life and in death must
                necessarily perish.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VII. This appears more clearly when we come to the thing itself and the
                controversy is not carried on coldly and unfeelingly in scholastic cloud and
                dust (as if from a distance), but in wrestling and agony—when the
                conscience is placed before God and terrified by a sense of sin and of the
                divine justice, it seeks a way to stand in the judgment and to flee from the
                wrath to come. It is indeed easy in the shades of the schools to prattle much
                concerning the worth of inherent righteousness and of works to the
                justification of men; but when we come into the sight of God, it is necessary
                to leave such trifles because there the matter is conducted seriously and no
                ludicrous disputes about words (logomachia) are indulged. Hither our eyes
                must be altogether raised if we wish to inquire profitably concerning true
                righteousness; in what way we may answer the heavenly Judge, when he
                shall have called us to account. Truly while among men the comparison
                holds good; each one supposes he has what is of some worth and value. But
                when we rise to the heavenly tribunal and place before our eyes that
                supreme Judge (not such as our intellects of their own accord imagine, but
                as he is described to us in Scripture [namely, by whose brightness the stars
                are darkened; at whose strength the mountains melt; by whose anger the
                earth is shaken; whose justice not even the angels are equal to bear; who
                does not make the guilty innocent; whose vengeance when once kindled
                penetrates even to the lowest depths of hell]), then in an instant the vain
                confidence of men perishes and falls and conscience is compelled
                (whatever it may have proudly boasted before men concerning its own
                righteousness) to deprecate the judgment and to confess that it has nothing
                upon which it can rely before God. And so it cries out with David, “Lord, if
                thou marked iniquity, who can stand?”; and elsewhere, “Enter not into
                judgment with thy servant, because no flesh will be justified in thy sight.”
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VIII. Here then is the true state of the controversy. When the mind is
                thoroughly terrified with the consciousness of sin and a sense of God’s
                wrath, what is that thing on account of which he may be acquitted before
                God and be reckoned a righteous person? What is that righteousness which
                he ought to oppose to the judgment of God that he may not be condemned
                according to the strict demands of the law (akribodikaion), but may obtain
                remission of sins and a right to eternal life? Is it righteousness inhering in
                us and inchoate holiness or the righteousness and obedience of Christ alone
                imputed to us? Our opponents hold the former; we the latter. We are about
                to demonstrate this distinctly: (1) as to inherent righteousness; (2) as to
                imputed righteousness. Of the latter we will treat in the next question; of the
                former we speak now.

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                <b>Proof that inherent righteousness cannot be the
                    cause of justification: (1) because it is imperfect.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                IX. That inherent righteousness cannot be the meritorious cause of our
                justification, we prove: (1) because no one is justified by an imperfect
                righteousness, since the judgment of God is according to truth and in it
                there is no room for a gracious acceptation; nor can deception consist with
                his law and justice. But inherent righteousness is not perfect, nor actual, nor
                habitual. Not actual because in many things we all offend (Jam. 3:2) and
                there is no one that sinneth not (1 K. 8:46), which Bellarmine himself does
                not deny (“De Justificatione,” 2.16 Opera [1858], 4:530—32). Not habitual
                because the perfection and imperfection of an act depend upon the
                perfection or imperfection of the habit and our regeneration is always
                imperfect here (1 Cor. 13:12; Gal. 5:17). Nor ought it to be objected “that
                this absolute perfection was required under the law, but is not required
                under the gospel.” The relaxation made under the gospel does not extend so
                far that an imperfect righteousness can be accepted for a_ perfect
                righteousness; for God cannot be satisfied except by a perfect
                righteousness. Rather it consists in this—that the vicarious and the alien
                righteousness of a surety is admitted for our own. Nor ought it to be
                objected “that righteousness is properly said to be perfect because it belongs
                to the works of God, which must be perfect because the work of the Rock is
                perfect” (Dt. 32:4). For the works which God does immediately by himself
                (which are rightly called perfect absolutely and simply) and the mediate
                works (which are performed by the intervention of creatures—such as the
                work of regeneration—which are not at once perfect because God operating
                according to our capacity promotes and perfects them little by little) differ.

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                <b>2. Because works are excluded.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                X. Second, our justification takes place without works; therefore also
                without inherent righteousness, which consists wholly in works or in habits
                from which works spring. The passages are obvious. Scarcely anything has
                been said more often and asserted more constantly; nothing certainly more
                fully argued: “By the deeds of the law, there shall no flesh be justified”
                (Rom. 3:20); “We conclude, that a man is justified by faith without the
                deeds of the law” (v. 28). This the apostle confirms in Rom. 4:6 and Gal.
                2:16 and in many other places. Nor should it be replied here that all works
                are not absolutely excluded, but certain ones only (to wit, ceremonial); or if
                moral works are excluded, those only are meant which precede faith and
                grace and which are done by the strength of free will, not those which are
                done from faith and grace. Since the apostle absolutely and simply excludes
                all works without any exception, it does not become us to limit what he
                does not limit. The thing itself proves this also for he antithetically opposes
                faith to works in this matter. Hence it appears that all works entirely of

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                whatsoever kind and not some particular ones are excluded. Otherwise he
                could not have simply opposed “one working” and “one believing,” “to do”
                and “to believe,” but a certain kind of working to other kinds.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>Both ceremonial.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XI. This is demonstrated in particular (1) as to ceremonial works. For that
                law with its works is understood to be excluded by the apostle by which is
                the knowledge of sin (Rom. 3:20) and the whole world has become exposed
                to condemnation (v. 19). Concerning this it is said, “The man that doeth
                them shall live in them” (Gal. 3:12) and from the curse of which Christ
                redeemed us (v. 13). This must be understood of the whole law, especially
                the moral, not the ceremonial. (2) If the ceremonial law only would be
                excluded, not the moral (since it is the less principal part of the law),
                justification would have to be ascribed rather than denied to the law by
                reason of the moral law (which is much prior). (3) This objection is rejected
                by many Romanists—Lombard, Thomas Aquinas, Toletus, Pererius,
                Justiniani, Salmeron and others, as their commentaries clearly show.
                Lombard says, “Without any works of the law, even the moral” (In
                Epistolam ad Romanos [PL 191/1.1364] on Rom. 3:27). Thomas Aquinas
                says on this passage: “Without the works of the law, not only ceremonial,
                which do not bestow grace, but signify it, but also without the works of the
                moral precepts according to this, not by works of righteousness which we
                have done (Tit. 3:5)” (“Lectio [TV Ad Romanos,” In Omnes Sancta Pauli
                Epistolas Commentaria [ed. P. Marietti, 1917], 1:55-56 on Rom. 3:27-31).
                Augustine teaches expressly that Paul speaks of the whole law (On the
                Spirit and the Letter 13 [8] [NPNF1, 5:87—88]). Nor if the controversy
                between Paul and the false apostles arose from the use of circumcision and
                the observance of the ceremonial law (which they urged as necessary to
                justification), does it follow that the apostle speaks of it alone when he
                excludes the works of the law from it. He passes from a part to the whole,
                this hypothesis of the false apostles drawing with it a necessity of observing
                the whole law (as we see in Acts 15:5) and Paul himself testifies when he
                says that he who presses circumcision as necessary “is a debtor to do the
                whole law” (Gal. 5:3) because the law demands not a partial, but a perfect
                obedience in all. Hence because he saw that believers would thus slide back


                to the old covenant and depart from the new, he inveighs with so much
                warmth against this error as most pestilential.

                <b>And moral after grace.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                XII. No better do others answer that it treats of works of the moral law done
                before faith and grace. (1) Paul excludes all works which are opposed to
                faith; yet all works without distinction are here opposed to faith, as working
                and believing are opposed (Rom. 4:5). (2) There was no necessity to
                exclude the works of the unregenerate, since it was acknowledged that they
                were sins, being done without faith (Rom. 14:23). (3) The examples of
                Abraham and David adduced by Paul (Rom. 4), inasmuch as they had been
                already converted and were believers, prove that works performed even
                after faith are excluded; as the apostle speaking of himself (now a believer)
                says, “I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justifed” (1 Cor. 4:4).
                (4) All those works are excluded which could leave any reason for boasting
                to man (Rom. 3:27). And yet such are works done by faith which they hold
                to be meritorious. (5) The works of believers are effects which follow
                justification, not the causes which precede it. (6) The design of the apostle
                in the epistle to the Galatians was to dispute against the false apostles who
                joined together in justification, faith and works, the grace of Christ and their
                own merits. (7) If he had wished to exclude only the works of nature and
                not the works of grace, why does he so often and so carefully oppose works
                to faith absolutely? Why does he never oppose the works of nature to the
                works of grace, which would have greatly assisted in refuting the calumny
                of his adversaries by which they assailed his doctrine, as if by excluding
                works from justification he would open the door to sin: “Shall we continue
                in sin, that grace may abound?” (Rom. 6:1). And yet that inference would
                be founded upon no foundation at all, if Paul had wished to exclude only
                works done before faith. For who otherwise would gather that sin must not
                be indulged in after faith on this account because works antecedent to faith
                do not justify in the least? Now both kinds of works being excluded, it was
                easy to object this very thing, which the Romanists of the present day object
                to us (to wit, that it is useless to do good works if there is no merit in works;
                nay, we should rather sin that grace may abound). This objection of the
                profane, the apostle did not refute by a distinction between antecedent and


                subsequent works (which assuredly he ought to have done according to the
                hypothesis of our opponents); but by an explanation of sanctification and its
                indissoluble connection with justification.

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XIII. Third, “our justification is free by the grace of God, through the
                redemption of Christ” (Rom. 3:24). Here the grace of God cannot denote
                the infused habit of love (as Bellarmine holds), but the favor and
                benevolence of God because we are said to be justified by his grace (té
                autou chariti) (i.e., as the leading [proegoumené] and meritorious cause is
                placed in the redemption of Christ, the false is rejected by the particle
                “freely” [dorean], which excludes all merit in us). (2) This grace is opposed
                to works and boasting (Rom. 11:6; Eph. 2:9). (3) We cannot be justified by
                the redemption of Christ otherwise than by the imputation of his
                righteousness. This is incompatible (asystatos) with inherent righteousness
                in the matter of justification; for if we are justified in another, we cannot be
                justified in ourselves. (4) Pererius confesses that charin here denotes rather
                the gratuitous goodness and kindness of God towards men (which is
                elsewhere called “kindness” [chréstotés] and “love” [philanthropia] toward
                man, Tit. 3:4). If the benevolence of God works good-pleasure (eudokias) in
                men (i.e., the good which he wills for them), it does not follow that he gives
                inherent righteousness that we may be justified by it. God does that good by
                distinct acts—the good indeed of imputed righteousness by the act of
                justification or inherent righteousness by the act of sanctification (as he has
                made Christ unto us both righteousness and sanctification, 1 Cor. 1:30).

                    sins.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                XIV. Fourth, according to Paul justification consists in the remission of sins
                (Rom. 4:8). Nor can it be done otherwise, since a sinner is concerned. And
                yet he whose sin is freely pardoned cannot be justified by inherent
                righteousness; nor is inherent righteousness remission of sins. Nor does he
                escape who says that it is not indeed remission of sins, but still it is


                connected with it in justification. It involves a contradiction to say that man
                is justified at the same time by inherent righteousness and by remission of
                sins, as it is most absurd (asystaton) for one to be justified in himself and in
                another (by a personal and by another’s obedience).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>5. Because justification is not by the law.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                XV. Fifth, if justification were by inherent righteousness, justification will
                be of the law, not of the gospel, and the two covenants will be confounded
                which are nevertheless constantly opposed as diametrically opposite to each
                other. Legal justification takes place in no other way than by inherent
                righteousness, whether actual or habitual; gospel justification is to be
                sought not in us, but in another. This the apostle clearly teaches when he
                wishes “to be found in Christ” (to wit, in the judgment of God) “not having
                his own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the
                faith of Christ” (Phil. 3:9) (i.e., not an inherent righteousness, arising from
                an observance of the law and which is called ours because it is in us and is
                perfected by our actions, but the righteousness of God and Christ, imputed
                to us and apprehended by faith).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>6. Because this is derogatory to Christ and
                    furnishes material for boasting.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XVI. Sixth, this derogates from the merit of Christ and is an argument for
                glorying and pride. For if the righteousness and merit of Christ most fully
                suffice for our justification, why are human merits sewed on? Is not injury
                thus done to Christ and material given to man for glorying in himself with
                God? Nor is this absurdity removed by saying that all this righteousness
                depends on Christ, who obtained that also for us and gave to it the power of
                meriting. Besides the gratuitous assumption that Christ merited for us the
                power of meriting (as will be seen in the proper place), whatever good man
                receives from God by grace (according to their hypothesis) does not
                exclude the concourse of free will (by whose intervention man may have
                some material for glorying in himself, while we ought to glory in the Lord
                alone). The Pharisee is no less condemned, although giving thanks to God


                he professes that he has all that he has from him, not from himself (Lk.
                18:11, 12, 14).

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XVII. Seventh, remission of sin requires the removal of guilt by the
                payment of the ransom (lytrou) due. And yet inherent righteousness can
                neither remove the offense to God or the guilt springing from it, nor
                compensate for the injury to the divine majesty. For besides the fact that it
                looks to the future (that man may perform his duty), not to the past (that he
                may compensate for the defect of duty by giving a satisfaction), it is
                impossible by a quality of finite virtue and worth for an offense of infinite
                indignity to be blotted out and compensated for.

                <b>8. From the testimony of Contarini and Bellarmine.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                XVIII. Eight, we cannot omit here the remarkable testimonies of two
                cardinals, who, overcome by the power of the truth, agree with us. The first
                is Cardinal Contarini, who thus expresses himself: “Since we reach a
                twofold righteousness by faith, a righteousness inherent in us, and the love
                and grace by which we are made partakers of the divine nature; and the
                righteousness of Christ given and imputed to us, since we are planted in
                Christ and put on Christ: it remains to inquire, on which of these we ought
                to rest, and to think ourselves justified before God (i.e., reckoned holy and
                righteous). I truly think it to be said piously and religiously that we ought to
                rest, I say rest as upon a stable thing, which can certainly sustain us, upon
                the righteousness of Christ bestowed upon us, and not upon the holiness and
                grace inherent in us. For this our righteousness is inchoate and imperfect
                which cannot keep us from offending and from constantly sinning in many
                things. Therefore we cannot in the sight of God on account of this our
                righteousness be esteemed righteous and good, as it becomes the sons of
                God to be good and holy. But the righteousness of Christ given to us is a
                true and perfect righteousness. It is altogether pleasing in the sight of God.
                In it there is nothing that offends him; that does not in the highest degree
                please him. We must therefore rest upon this alone (sure and stable) and on
                account of it alone we must believe that we are justified before God, that is,

                considered righteous and called righteous” (“De Justificatione,” Casparis
                Contareni Cardinalis Opera [1571], p. 592). From him Bellarmine does not
                differ much, who, after exerting all his strength in a defense of human
                merit, pressed by the consciousness of the truth, at length is brought to say
                “that on account of the uncertainty of personal righteousness, and the
                danger of vain glory, it is the safest to place our entire confidence in the
                mercy and kindness of God alone” (“De Justificatione,” 5.7 Opera [1858],
                4:615). To this proposition answers this clause of his will: “And I pray him
                to admit me among his saints and elect, not as an estimator of merit, but as
                a bestower of pardon.”

            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XIX. Christ by his obedience is rightly said “to constitute” us “righteous,”
                not by an inherent but by an imputed righteousness as is taught in Rom. 4:6
                and gathered from the opposition of the antecedent condemnation (Rom.
                5:19). For they are no less constituted righteous before God who, on
                account of the obedience of Christ imputed to them, are absolved from
                deserved punishment, than they who on account of the disobedience of
                Adam are constituted unrighteous (i.e., are exposed to death and
                condemnation). If Adam constituted us unrighteous effectively by a
                propagation of inherent depravity (on account of which we are also exposed
                to death in the sight of God), it does not follow equally that Christ
                constitutes us righteous by a forensic justification at the bar of God by
                inherent righteousness given to us by him. The design of the apostle (which
                alone is to be regarded) does not have this direction. He only wishes to
                disclose the foundation of the connection between being exposed to death
                and the right to life, from our union with the first and second Adam, as to
                the thing (although the mode is different on account of the difference in the
                subject). The “abundance of grace and of righteousness” (perisseia tés
                charitos kai dikaiosynés, Rom. 5:17) does not denote habitual grace or
                inherent righteousness, but the abundance of divine mercy and the infinite
                treasury of righteousness, which believers obtain in the obedience of the
                Mediator. And this gift is said to be greater than the sin of Adam because
                the grace of God giving us the righteousness of Christ, not only took away
                the guilt of one transgression, but of all actual sins (as Thomas Aquinas


                well remarks on this passage). Nor does it press us more that we are said “to
                receive abundance of grace” (Rom. 5:17) because we receive it by the hand
                of faith, not that it becomes ours by way of infusion or of inhesion, but by
                way of imputation.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XX. “Justification” is not set forth as a genus, embracing under itself
                “ablution” and “sanctification” (1 Cor. 6:11), but on the contrary “ablution,”
                which is adumbrated in baptism; as the more general word is set forth in the
                first place, containing under it justification and sanctification as two
                species, as frequently both these benefits are wont to be described by the
                one word—ablution, as much as justification (Ps. 51:2; 1 Jn. 1:7) and as
                much as sanctification (Heb. 9:14). What is added, however, concerning
                “the name of Christ” does not properly denote an invocation, which is made
                by it, but the power and efficacy of it—that “to be justified in the name of
                Christ” is nothing else than to be justified by and on account of Christ. For
                there is no other name by which we can obtain salvation.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXI. Paul does not say that we are justified by regeneration (Tit. 3:5—7);
                nay, since he ascribes justification to the grace of God and takes it away
                from works, he shows that he is unwilling to ascribe it to righteousness
                inhering by regeneration, which is rather the fruit than the cause of
                justification. But his intention is to point out how God will have us saved by
                two benefits which he bestows upon us—regeneration, of which the Holy
                Spirit is the author in us; and justification, which we obtain by Christ, by
                which we are made heirs of eternal life. That denotes the way of salvation,
                this its cause.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXII. The conformity to the image of Christ to which we are
                predestinated (Rom. 8:29) means indeed that we are made partakers of
                inherent holiness and righteousness like his; but it does not mean that we
                are justified by that inherent righteousness, as he was. For both our
                preceding sin and the imperfection of this righteousness in us renders such a
                justification impossible. For it cannot happen that they, who are the children
                of wrath by nature and who are never without sin, can be justified in the
                Same manner in which he was justified, who knew no sin and in whose
                mouth no guile was found.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXII. Although Abel and Noah were righteous and did good works,
                still they were not on that account justified by their own inherent
                righteousness and good works. Nay, Paul testifies that they were righteous


                by the righteousness of faith (Heb. 11): Abel in that by faith he offered a
                more excellent sacrifice, by which he also obtained witness that he was
                righteous (v. 4). Noah became heir of the righteousness which is by faith (v.
                7), which is no other than the righteousness which God imputes through
                faith (Rom. 4:5, 6). From this flowed the good works which they
                performed.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXIV. Since justification is described in the Scriptures by remission of
                sins and the imputation of righteousness, it cannot be called a motion from
                sin to righteousness, such as occurs in illumination and calefaction. And
                this is the fundamental error (proton pseudos) of our opponents, who
                convert a forensic and judicial action (which takes place before God) into a
                physical or moral action (which takes place in us).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXV. When believers seek to be justified by God according to their
                righteousness (Pss. 7:8; 17:1; 18:20), we must not understand it of a
                personal righteousness (of which they elsewhere confess they are destitute,
                Pss. 130:3; 143:2), but of a righteousness of the cause (which they
                maintained and on account of which they suffered persecution from the
                wicked); or if personal righteousness is understood by it, it is not universal
                and absolute (which is found in no mortal), but particular as to certain acts
                in which they can conduct themselves well by the grace of God (such as
                was the action of Phineas which was imputed to him for righteousness) and
                comparative, not relative to God, but to the wicked (who undeservedly
                slandered them).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXVI. The proportion of man to the highest good is either from the
                prescription of the law (“Do this and live”) or from the assistance of grace.
                In the former sense, man in innocence would have had a proportion to the
                highest good. But by sin, that way having been shut up, another was to be
                sought in Christ, who by fulfilling the law for us, acquired for us a right to
                the highest good or eternal life. When therefore life is said to be given to
                the pious and righteous, the quality or disposition of the subject is denoted
                (which ought to possess life), not, however, the cause of such a good (i.e,
                how happy they ought to be, not why and on account of what).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXVII. Although in those to whom the satisfaction of Christ is imputed,
                the habit of righteousness is also infused (which we reach only in the other
                life and by this habit we begin to be righteous morally and inherently), still
                we cannot be called righteous relative to the divine judgment. For we are
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                constitued righteous in the divine court only insofar as we can remove the
                accusation with which we are charged—of sin past as well as present. Now
                such an inchoate habit of righteousness cannot remove such an accusation,
                whether by making it false (because it is evident that we always have sinned
                and so are guilty) or by expunging it through a suffering of the punishment
                due (because it cannot have the relation of a satisfaction for sins committed
                by which their guilt may be taken away). For it tends to this—that we may
                not sin hereafter; but it cannot make us not to have sinned so that we do not
                need another’s righteousness imputed to us for our justification.

                THIRD QUESTION
                <br>
                <em>Is the righteousness and obedience of Christ imputed to us the meritorious
                    cause and foundation of our justification with God? We affirm against the
                    Romanists and Socinians. </em>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                I. The false and pretended impelling and meritorious cause of our
                justification (which is placed by the Romanists in inherent righteousness)
                having been rejected, the true and genuine cause must now be exhibited
                from the Scriptures (to wit, the righteousness and obedience of Christ
                imputed to us by God). That the truth and mode of this may be the more
                clearly seen and more strongly retained against the cavils of our opponents,
                the following things must be premised.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>The opinion of the orthodox concerning the
                    imputation of Christ’s righteousness.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                II. First, we suppose that justification is a forensic act of God (as has
                already been proved), not as a creditor and a private person, but as a ruler
                and Judge giving sentence concerning us at his bar. (2) Justification is the
                act not of a subordinate Judge, who is bound to the formula of the law, but
                of a supreme magistrate and prince, to whom alone belongs, in virtue of his
                autocratic (autokratoriko) right, the showing of favor to the guilty and the
                relaxation of the rigor of established laws. (3) That God does not here sit on
                the throne of justice that he may act according to the strict justice of the law
                (kata to akribodikaion nomou), but on the throne of grace that he may act


                according to the gospel forbearance (epieikeian). (4) That he so acts from
                mercy as not to do injury to his justice, which (since it cannot suffer his
                laws to be violated with impunity and sin to go unpunished) necessarily
                requires some satisfaction (lytron) to be made to it.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                III. Hence it follows (5) that God cannot show favor to, nor justify
                anyone without a perfect righteousness. For since the judgment of God is
                according to truth, he cannot pronounce anyone just who is not really just.
                However, since no mortal after sin has such a righteousness in himself (nay,
                by sin he has been made a child of wrath and become exposed to death), it
                must be sought out of us in another, by the intervention of which man
                (sinful and wicked) may be justified without personal righteousness.
                Human courts often justify the guilty, either through ignorance (when the
                wickedness is not known and lies concealed) or by injury (when it is not
                attended to) or by iniquity (when it is approved). But in the divine court (in
                which we deal with the most just Judge, who neither holds the guilty as
                innocent, nor the innocent as guilty) this cannot occur. Therefore he who is
                destitute of personal righteousness ought to have another’s, by which to be
                justified. For although God (as the supreme arbiter of affairs and the
                sovereign Lord of all) has the power to remit the punishment of sinners, still
                he cannot (because he is most just) thus favor the sinner, unless a
                satisfaction is first made by which both his justice may be satisfied and
                punishment taken of sin. Since this could not come from us who are guilty,
                it was to be sought in another, who (constituted a surety in our place by
                receiving upon himself the punishment due to us) might bestow the
                righteousness (dikaiOma) of which we were destitute.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                IV. The gospel teaches that what could not be found in us and was to be
                sought in another, could be found nowhere else than in Christ, the God-man
                (theanthropo); who taking upon himself the office of surety most fully
                satisfied the justice of God by his perfect obedience and thus brought to us
                an everlasting righteousness by which alone we can be justified before God;
                in order that covered and clothed with that garment as though it were of our
                first-born (like Jacob), we may obtain under it the eternal blessing of our
                heavenly Father.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                V. Further, as long as Christ is outside of us and we are out of Christ, we
                can receive no fruit from another’s righteousness. God willed to unite us to
                Christ by a twofold bond—one natural, the other mystical—in virtue of


                which both our evils might be transferred to Christ and the blessings of
                Christ pass over to us and become ours. The former is the communion of
                nature by the incarnation. By this, Christ, having assumed our flesh, became
                our brother and true Goel and could receive our sins upon himself and have
                the right to redeem us. The latter is the communion of grace by mediation.
                By this, having been made by God a surety for us and given to us for a
                head, he can communicate to us his righteousness and all his benefits.
                Hence it happens that as he was made of God sin for us by the imputation
                of our sins, so in turn we are made the righteousness of God in him by the
                imputation of his obedience (2 Cor. 5:21).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VI. Just as Christ sustains a twofold relation (schesin) to us of surety and
                head (of surety, to take away the guilt of sin by a payment made for it; of
                head, to take away its power and corruption by the efficacy of the Spirit), so
                in a twofold way Christ imparts his blessings to us, by a forensic
                imputation, and a moral and internal infusion. The former flows from Christ
                as surety and is the foundation of our justification. The latter depends upon
                him as head, and is the principle of sanctification. For on this account, God
                justifies us because the righteousness of our surety, Christ, is imputed to us.
                And on this account we are renewed because we derive the Spirit from our
                head, Christ, who renews us after the image of Christ and bestows upon us
                inherent righteousness.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VII. However, because we treat here of the imputed righteousness of
                Christ, we must remark further that the word “impute” (which is in Hebrew
                chshbh; in Greek logizesthai or ellogein) can be taken in two ways, either
                properly or improperly. That is said to be imputed to anyone improperly
                which he himself has done or has, when on that account a reward or
                punishment is decreed to him. As sin is said “to be imputed” to the wicked
                (2 S. 19:19), when the reward of iniquity is imputed to them; and the
                judgment exercised by Phinehas “was counted unto him for righteousness”
                (Ps. 106:31), i.e., it was pleasing to God and gained for him the praise of
                holy zeal and the covenant of a perpetual priesthood. Properly is to hold
                him who has not done a thing, as if he had done it. In turn not to impute is
                to hold him who has done a thing as if he had not done it; as Paul desires
                the fault of Onesimus to be imputed to him (which he himself had not
                committed, Philem. 18) and asks that the fault should not be laid to the
                charge of those who forsook him (which they had committed, 2 Tim. 4:16).

                From this twofold acceptation of the word, a twofold imputation arises
                (about which Paul speaks)—of grace (kata charin) and of debt (kat’
                opheiléma): “Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace,
                but of debt. But to him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
                righteousness” (Rom. 4:4, 5), viz., of grace. For the foundation of
                imputation is either in the merit and dignity of the person, to whom a thing
                is imputed; or it is out of it in the grace and mercy alone of the one
                imputing. The first is the legal mode, the other is the evangelical. Hence we
                gather that this word is forensic. It is not to be understood physically of an
                infusion of righteousness, but judicially and relatively, of gratuitous
                acceptance in the judgment of God (which also appears from the force of
                the word logizesthai and ellogein, which is drawn from accountants).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VIII. But here we must accurately distinguish between imputed and
                putative or fictitious in order to meet the calumny of our opponents who
                traduce this imputation as a mere fiction of the mind about a thing not
                existing. For it is a thing no less real in its own order (to wit, judicial and
                forensic) than infusion in a moral or physical order; as the imputation of a
                payment made by a surety to the debtor is in the highest degree real (to wit,
                by which he is freed from the debt and delivered from the right which the
                creditor had over him). Hence it is evident that this judicial act of God does
                not lack truth because he does not pronounce us righteous in ourselves
                (which would be false), but in Christ (which is perfectly true); nor does it
                lack justice because there is granted a communion between us and Christ,
                which is the solid foundation of this imputation.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                IX. Therefore when we say that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to
                us for justification and that we are just before God through imputed
                righteousness and not through any righteousness inherent in us, we mean
                nothing else than that the obedience of Christ rendered in our name to God
                the Father is so given to us by God that it is reckoned to be truly ours and
                that it is the sole and only righteousness on account of and by the merit of
                which we are absolved from the guilt of our sins and obtain a right to life;
                and that there is in us no righteouness or good works by which we can
                deserve such great benefits which can bear the severe examination of the
                divine court, if God willed to deal with us according to the rigor of his law;
                that we can oppose nothing to it except the merit and satisfaction of Christ,


                in which alone, terrified by the consciousness of sin, we can find a safe
                refuge against the divine wrath and peace for our souls.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                X. Now although we hold that there is nothing in us which can be
                opposed at the bar of God for justification, still one would improperly
                conclude from this what our opponents falsely and slanderously charge
                upon us—that we recognize no inherent righteousness in believers and by
                reason of which they are truly reckoned righteous and holy with God. Thus
                that we teach that believers always remain wicked and unjust in themselves,
                and that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to us solely to cover our sins
                and not to take them away. Hence they take occasion to traduce our doctrine
                concerning the imputation of Christ’s righteousness as impious and
                execrable. As we just now said, however, we hold these two benefits to be
                inseparable: that no one is justified by Christ who is not also sanctified and
                gifted with inherent righteousness (from which believers can truly be
                denominated holy and righteous although not perfectly in this life).

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                <b>Statement of the question.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XI. From these principles, the state of the question can be readily gathered.
                First, against the Socinians it is inquired, Are the righteousness, obedience
                and satisfaction of Christ imputed to us for righteousness? For as they deny
                that the obedience and satisfaction of Christ were rendered for us, so they
                reject the imputation and application of that obedience and satisfaction and
                explode it as a human invention (Socinus, “Tractatus de Justificatione,”
                Opera omnia [1656], 1:601—27; Ostorodt, Unterrichtung ... hauptpuncten
                der Christlichen Religion 36, 37 [1612], pp. 294-328; Smalcius, “De
                Justificatione,” Refutatio Thesium D. Wolfgangi Frantzii, Disp. TV [1614],
                pp. 91-154). The orthodox, however, think the obedience and satisfaction
                of Christ are imputed to us for righteousness inasmuch as they are reckoned
                ours by the gratuitous mercy of God and on account of them we are
                absolved from sin in God’s court and pronounced just.

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                <b>And with the Romanists.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XII. But against the Romanists, the question is not: (1) Is the righteousness
                of Christ the formal cause of our justification (i.e., is it the form by which

                man is constituted just inherently, as the Romanists understand it describing
                justification by the infusion of righteousness)? For since we have already
                proved that it is a forensic, not a physical act, the question regarding the
                internal formal cause is fruitless (which pertains to the blessing of
                sanctification). Rather the question concerns the meritorious and impulsive
                cause of the divine judgment or our absolving sentence. Not, Is the
                righteousness of Christ our formal and inherent righteousness subjectively?
                But, Is our righteousness real and sufficient imputatively, by which, if we
                are not formally righteous by inherent righteousness, still we are formally
                justified by the imputation of it, so that apart from it there is no other
                material of our righteousness before God?
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XIII. (2) The question is not Is the righteousness and merit of Christ
                imputed to us? For this the Romanists do not dare to deny. The Council of
                Trent says, “Christ by his most holy suffering on the cross merited
                justification for us, and satisfied God, the Father for us, and no one can be
                just, unless he to whom the merits of the suffering of our Lord Jesus Christ
                are communicated” (Session 6.7*, Schroeder, p. 33). Hence Vasquez says,
                “We grant there are imputed to us for a certain effect, not only those things
                that are in us, as sin, faith and righteousness, but also some things that are
                without us, as the merit and obedience of Christ, because not only the things
                that are in us, but also those without, in view of which something is given to
                us are said to be reckoned among our things for some effect, as if they were
                truly ours” (Commentariorum ac Disputationum in primam secundce ...
                Thomae, II, Disp. 222.1 [1631], p. 637). Bellarmine also acknowledges this:
                “Tf the Protestants mean only this that the merits of Christ are imputed to us
                because they are given to us of God, and we can offer them to the Father for
                our sins, since Christ undertook the burden of satisfying for us, and
                reconciling us to God, the Father, their opinion is correct” (“De
                Justificatione,” 2.7 Opera [1858], 4:518). And yet we mean nothing else;
                for what he adds (“that we wish the righteousness of Christ to be so
                imputed to us that by it we are called, and are formally righteous,” ibid.), he
                supposes falsely and gratuitously from his perverse and preposterous
                hypothesis concerning moral justification. But the question is To what is
                that imputation made? To justification and life, as we maintain; or only to
                the infusion of internal grace and inherent righteousness, as they hold? That
                is, are the merits of Christ so imputed and communicated to us as to be the

                sole meritorious cause of our justification and that there is no other
                righteousness on account of which we are acquitted in the sight of God
                (which we contend for); or are they so imputed as to be the conditions of a
                formal cause that is of inherent righteousness, so that man can be gifted
                with it; or of an extrinsic cause which deserves the infusion of
                righteousness by which man is justified, so that not the merit of Christ
                properly, but inherent righteousness acquired by the merit of Christ is the
                proper and true cause on account of which man is justified (which they
                maintain)? They so limit the benefit of the imputation of Christ’s merits to
                obtaining the effect of infused grace that this imputation is made for no
                other end than to merit for us infused grace, in virtue of which we obey the
                law and, being righteous in ourselves, are justified; as Vasquez, in the
                passage cited, observes—cf. Commentariorum ac Disputationum in primam
                secundae ... Thomae, Il, Disp. 222.3 [1631], pp. 639-42). Hence
                Bonaventure denies that the causality of justification or of the remission of
                sins properly belongs to the death or resurrection of Christ, but only “by
                way of intervening merit,” which is reduced to the material cause, while he
                determines the formal cause to be infused love (“Liber III. Sententiarum,”
                Dist. 19, Art. 1, Q. 1 in Opera Theologica Selecta [1941], 3:392—94). From
                these it is evident that the question here is Are the righteousness and
                satisfaction of Christ so imputed to us by God as to be the only foundation
                and meritorious cause in view of which alone we are acquitted before God
                of our sins and obtain a right to life? Our opponents deny; we affirm.

                XIV. However, there is no need to remark that by the righteousness of
                Christ we do not understand here the “essential righteousness of God”
                dwelling in us (as Osiander with Schwenkfeld dreamed, opposing himself
                to Stancar his colleague, who acknowledged Christ as Mediator only
                according to his human nature—which error was exploded and perished
                with its author). That righteouness could not be communicated to us
                subjectively and formally which is an essential attribute of God without our
                becoming gods also. And the Scripture everywhere refers the righteousness
                of Christ, which is imputed to us, to the obedience of his life and the
                suffering of his death, by which he answered the demands of the law and
                perfectly fulfilled it. If we had need of an infinite righteousness, it should
                not be such in essence, but only in value and merit. If Christ is Jehovah, our
                righteousness, and if he is made to us righteousness by the Father, this is not


                said with respect to essential righteousness, but to the obedience which is
                imputed to us for righteousness. This is called the righteousness of God
                because it belongs to divine person and so is of infinite value and is highly
                pleasing and acceptable to God. By this righteousness then, we understand
                the entire obedience of Christ—of his life as well as of his death, active as
                well as passive (as we have already proved, Topic XIV, Question 13).

            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                XV. Now that this righteousness of Christ is the foundation and meritorious
                cause of our justification, we prove: (1) because by the righteousness and
                obedience of one, Christ, we are consitituted righteous—“As by the offense
                of one” (supply “guilt”) “came upon all men to condemnation, even so by
                the righteousness of one” (di’ henos dikaidmatos) (supply “the blessing
                redounded”) “upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man’s
                disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall
                many be made righteous” (Rom. 5:18, 19). Here it is clear that the one
                transgression (hen paraptoma) is opposed to the one righteousness (heni
                dikaiOmati) and the disobedience of one man (by which men are constituted
                sinners and guilty before God by the imputation of that sin) is opposed to
                the obedience of one, Christ, by which the elect are constituted righteous
                (i.e., are justified before God; not assuredly by inhesion, but by imputation).
                (a) The act of one cannot be made the act of many, except by imputation.
                (b) The righteousness (dikaidma) upon which justification of life (dikaidsis
                z0és) rests, demands a perfect and absolute righteousness (which cannot be
                said of inherent righteousness). (c) The condemnation (katakrima) to which
                the justification of life (dikaidsis zoés) is opposed, is not a physical, but a
                forensic and judicial act. In vain does Bellarmine maintain that the
                obedience of Christ is indeed the efficient but not the formal cause of
                justification, as the disobedience of Adam constituted us sinners, not
                formally but efficiently. We are not treating of an infusion of righteousness
                or of renovation (as we have just said), but of a juridical constitution which
                cannot take place except by imputation (since it is of another’s, not of a
                personal righteousness). Again, Bellarmine himself testifies the contrary


                when he says, “The sin of Adam is so imputed to his posterity, as if we had
                all committed the same sin” (“De amissione gratiae,” 4.10 Opera [1858],
                4:160). And: “The sin of Adam is communicated to us in the manner in
                which what passes over can be communicated, to wit, by imputation; for it
                is imputed to all who are born of Adam” (ibid., 5.17, p. 227). Nor if we are
                constitued unrighteous and guilty by sin propagated from Adam, ought we
                at once to be justified by inherent righteousness communicated to us
                through regeneration by Christ because there is a very different reason for
                each. And Paul here institutes the comparison between the first and second
                Adam in the thing and not as to the manner of the thing.

                XVI. Second, faith is said to be imputed to us for righteousness. “Abraham
                believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness” (Rom. 4:3);
                not the faith itself or the act of believing formally, as if it were
                righteousness with God (as the Remonstrants hold, against whom we will
                dispute hereafter) because thus justification would not be without works,
                since faith itself is a work; but objectively and relative to the righteousness
                of Christ, which faith apprehends and applies to itself. The apostle calls this
                “the righteousness of faith which is through the faith of Christ” (Phil. 3:9)
                “in which alone he wishes to be found” (viz., at the bar of God). For it is to
                be sought nowhere else than in Christ, who is Jehovah our righteousness,
                and who of God is made unto us righteousness. It is confirmed by this—that
                Paul in the same place explains the imputation of faith for righteousness by
                “the imputation of righteousness without works” (Rom. 4:6). Hence it is
                surely evident: (a) that justification consists in the imputation of
                righteousness, that no one may suppose this phrase was invented by us; (b)
                that this righteousness cannot be inherent, given to us by infusion, both
                because it is said to be without works and because what is inherent is
                opposed to what is imputed. On that account, it is opposed by Paul to his
                own righteousness which is of the law (Phil. 3:9) and is elsewhere called
                “the righteousness of God,” which is manifested without the law (Rom.
                3:21, 22). This is so because it is subjectively in a divine person and so of
                infinite value; and originally because it is from God, since it is given to us
                freely by God; and terminatively because it leads to God and is approved by


                him and can alone sustain the examination of his judgment. Therefore
                whoever by faith applies that righteousness to himself is said not to come
                into judgment, but to have already passed from death to life (Jn. 5:24), i.e.,
                to be justified.

            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XVII. Third, Christ is the righteousness by which we are justified. For on
                this account he is said to “be made of God unto us righteousness” (1 Cor.
                1:30) and we are said to be made the righteousness of God in him: “God
                hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made
                the righteousness of God in him” (2 Cor. 5:21). From this it is evident: (a)
                that Christ is our righteousness before God, not surely inherently (because
                the righteousness of one cannot pass over into another), but imputatively;
                (b) we are made the righteousness of God in him, just as he is made sin for
                us. Now Christ was made sin for us, not inherently or subjectively (because
                he knew no sin), but imputatively (because God imputed to him our sins
                and made the iniquities of us all to meet on him, Is. 53:6). Therefore, we
                also are made righteousness, not by infusion, but by imputation. Augustine
                well expresses this: “He, therefore, was sin, that we might be righteousness,
                nor ours, but God’s, nor in us, but in him, as he demonstrated sin, not his
                own, but ours, nor in himself, but in us constituted in the likeness of sinful
                flesh, in which he was crucified” (Enchiridion 13 [41] [FC 2:406—7; PL
                40.253]). The objection is fruitless that “Christ is said to have been made
                righteousness, as he was made wisdom and sanctification, not surely
                imputatively, but effectively.” For even if he was equally made to us of God
                all these as to merit because he acquired all these blessings for us, still he
                was not made in the same manner as to bestowal, but diversely according to
                the diversity of the gifts (even the nature of the thing demands this). For if
                he was made righteousness in no other way than sanctification (i.e.,
                effectively), Paul would be guilty of tautology, since in this way
                justification and sanctification would not differ. Therefore he is made
                wisdom and sanctification to us effectively by illuminating and regenerating
                us; but righteousness imputatively by imputing to us his righteousness.
                Bellarmine cannot deny this when he says that Christ can rightly be said to
                be made righteousness meritoriously “because he satisfied the Father for us,


                and gives and communicates that satisfaction to us, when he justifies us, so
                that he can be called our satisifaction and righteousness, as if we ourselves
                had satisfied God” (“De Justificatione,” 2.10 Opera [1858], 4:523). This he
                confirms on 2 Cor. 5:21: “The righteousness of Christ is imputed to us as to
                the satisfaction, which he made for us” (ibid., p. 524). Nor can that which
                our opponent adds in the same place help his cause when he says: “But not
                on this account can we be reckoned righteous, if the stains and corruption of
                sins truly inhere in us” (ibid.). For if the righteousness of Christ is imputed
                to us (as he had already confessed), then certainly we are considered
                righteous in him; for no one imputes righteousness to him whom he does
                not count righteous. And if the satisfaction of Christ is imputed to us, then
                our debts for which he satisfied are not imputed, but are remitted. Falsely
                also he holds “that the righteousness inhering in us is here called the
                righteousness of God because it is given to us of God; or also because it is
                the image and effect of the righteousness of God” (ibid.). For the little
                clause “in him” stands in the way; for how could it be said to be in Christ, if
                it was in us? Contarini acknowledges this: “The righteousness of God in
                him, since his righteousness is made ours, is given and imputed to us” (cf.
                “De Justificatione,” Casparis Contareni Cardinalis Opera [1571], p. 592).

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                XVIII. Fourth, justification takes place on account of the suretyship of
                Christ and the payment made for us by him—which cannot be done without
                imputation. For as a payment made by a surety for a debtor cannot help him
                except by imputation (inasmuch as the payment made by a surety is applied
                to him as if it had been made by himself), the cancelling of the debt follows
                and the deliverance of the debtor. Thus since Christ undertook to be our
                surety and paid in our place, who does not see that the payment made by
                him and the ransom (lytron) given is imputed to us for full absolution (i.e.,
                is considered by God as if it had been given by us)? In this sense, we are
                said to be “justified by the death and blood of Christ” (Rom. 5:9) because
                the merit of his obedience and death was that in view of which God was
                reconciled and gave to us the pardon of sin. In the same sense, he is said “to
                have been made a curse and sin for us, that we might be made a blessing
                and righteousness in him” (Gal. 3:13; 2 Cor. 5:21) because the curse, and


                punishment of sin which he received upon himself in our stead secures to us
                blessing and righteousness with God in virtue of that most strict union
                between us and him by which, as our sins are imputed to him, so in turn his
                obedience and righteousness are imputed to us. Just as under the law the
                punishment which the victims suffered in the place of sinners was imputed
                to them for the expiation of sin and their liberation.

                XIX. Fifth, Christ justifies us by that by which he frees us from the
                condemnation of the law and fulfills in us its right to life. “For what the law
                could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own
                Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
                that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us” (namely, our
                justification by the law having become impossible through sin, God
                restored this benefit to us in Christ). Being made like to sinful flesh (yet
                without sin), he offered himself for us as a victim for sin and having made a
                most full satisfaction condemned sin (i.e., perfectly expiated it) in the flesh
                for this end—that the condemnation of sin might give place to our
                justification and the righteousness of the law (to dikaidma nomou) (i.e., the
                right which it has) whether as to obedience or as to punishment is fulfilled
                in us (not inherently, but imputatively); while what Christ did and suffered
                in our place is ascribed to us as if we had done that very thing. Thus we are
                considered in Christ to have fulfilled the whole righteousness of the law
                because in our name he most perfectly fulfilled the righteousness of the law
                as to obedience as well as to punishment.

                XX. Sixth, our justification is “a justification of the ungodly but to him that
                worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is
                counted for righteousness” (Rom. 4:5). A justification of the ungodly
                cannot be made by infusion, but by imputation. For although he that is
                justified does not remain wicked, but is renewed by the grace of Christ, he
                cannot be said to be justified by that renovation (which is the effect
                following justification, not the cause which precedes it). And faith, by


                which man is justified and is made righteous in Christ, does not prevent him
                from being and being called wicked in himself, inasmuch as he is opposed
                to the one working as he who has nothing upon which he can rely before the
                divine tribunal for his justification and so is “ungodly,” partly antecedently,
                partly with respect to justification; not however concomitantly, still less
                consequently.

                By their vote, they approve our opinion, but we omit them from a desire to
                be brief. It will be sufficient to quote the words of Bernard because he often
                asserted this saving doctrine with exceeding skill: “Another’s righteousness
                is assigned to him who wanted a personal righteousness” (Contra ...
                Errorum Abelardi Epistola CXC 6.15 [PL 182.1065]). And a little after: “If
                one died for all, therefore all are dead; that the satisfaction of one might be
                imputed to all, as that one bore the sins of all” (ibid.). And: “My merit then
                is the compassion of the Lord; I am not wholly destitute of merit, as long as
                he is not wanting in mercy” (“Sermon 61 [5],” Song of Solomon [trans. S.J.
                Eales, 1984 rep.], p. 368; PL 183.1073). And a little after: “Shall I sing of
                my righteousness? O Lord, I will make mention of thy righteousness alone,
                which is also mine. Shall I fear that one righteousness is not enough for
                both? It is not a short garment which according to the prophet cannot cover
                two” (ibid.). And: “Not to sin is the righteousness of God; the righteousness
                of man is the indulgence of God” (“Sermon 23* [15],” ibid., p. 141; PL
                183.892).

                XXII. Christ ought not only to restore the goods lost in Adam, but also to
                remove the evils contracted through Adam. Now there were two—guilt and
                corruption of nature—to which two goods should be opposed: the
                imputation of righteousness to take away guilt before God; and a renovation
                of nature to heal inherent corruption. Again, Christ not only restored the
                lost goods, but in a far more excellent way. We lost mutable righteousness,
                but an immutable righteousness is restored to us. We lost only an inherent
                righteousness and there is given us an imputed righteousness with an
                inherent, without which we could not be made partakers of the inherent.
                Otherwise if nothing was restored in Christ than what had been lost in


                Adam, pardon of sin would not be given to us in Christ because it was not
                lost in Adam.

                XXIII. What is imputed to anyone by a mere gracious acceptation, that is
                not really paid, but is considered as paid; but what is imputed on account of
                a true payment made by another supposes the thing to be paid. Now the
                imputation of the righteousness of Christ (of which we speak) is not to be
                understood in the first sense (the improper sense, for an imputation which
                takes place without any payment at all whether of the debtor or of the
                surety); but is to be understood in the latter sense inasmuch as it is founded
                in another’s payment (that of Christ the surety).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXIV. Although we are justified by the imputed righteousness of Christ,
                it does not follow that we are no less righteous than Christ and are thus
                considered like Christ, saviors and redeemers of the world; and that Christ
                on account of our unrighteousness imputed to him can be called a sinner.
                The dignity of the head ought always to remain his own, that the members
                may be conformed to the head; but in their order and not that they should
                become the head. Thus although as to imputation we are truly righteous in
                the sight of God, still Christ is righteous in a far more perfect manner. We
                are such relatively in him and indeed precariously and dependently; Christ,
                however, is such infinitely, originally, inherently and subjectively. (2)
                Indeed we can (on account of Christ’s righteousness imputed to us) be said
                to be redeemed and saved passively, but not to be redeemers actively
                because he alone can be a Redeemer whose righteousness is imputed to
                another; not he who needs the imputation of another. (3) Christ cannot (on
                account of our sin having been imputed to him) be called a sinner (which
                implies inherent corruption), but only a victim for sin, who received on
                himself the punishment due to sin. Thus guilt was to be taken away, not its
                pollution.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXV. Where two contrary physical forms and qualities exist under the
                Same genus, there it is certain that the denomination should be made from
                the intrinisic (which affect the subject more), than from the extrinsic. Now
                inherent righteousness and imputed righteousness are not under the same
                genus. The former indeed is in the class of relation, but the latter is under
                the class of quality. Thus nothing is to hinder the subject from being
                denominated from both under a different respect (schesei). For when the
                inherent quality is regarded, he is said to be a sinner and wicked; but when


                the external and forensic relation is considered, he is said to be righteous in
                Christ. It is indeed true that no one can be called righteous inherently by
                another’s righteousness because if it is inherent, it is no longer another’s.
                But still he can be said to be justified imputatively, since every day among
                men a debtor (on account of the payment made by a surety) is said to be
                free and discharged. Augustine beautifully explains this: “It is surely just,
                that they whom the devil held as debtors, should be discharged believing in
                him whom he killed without any debt” (The Trinity 13*.14 [FC 45:395; PL
                42.1028]). Hence it is evident that the example of the Ethiopian adduced by
                Bellarmine (who is to be denominated rather from the blackness of his body
                than from the whiteness of his garments) is improper (aprosdionyson) since
                we are not speaking here of an inherent quality or of an adhering garment,
                but of a juridical relation given to him by the Judge. Besides, the Ethiopian
                always remains an Ethiopian in the same manner; yet the believer does not
                remain wicked, but is converted.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXVI. Although God justifies us on account of the imputed
                righteousness of Christ, his judgment does not cease to be according to truth
                because he does not pronounce us righteous in ourselves subjectively
                (which would be false), but in another imputatively and relatively (which is
                perfectly true). Thus God truly estimates the thing and judges it as it is; not
                in itself and in its own nature, but in Christ.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXVII. The spouse is said to be “all fair” (Cant. 4:7) in two ways: (1) in
                her head and husband imputatively, when all her pollutions are so covered
                by his righteousness that there is no more condemnation in her; nor does
                God see in her anything as to practical and penal knowledge which he can
                reprehend; (2) in herself inherently because she has been perfectly renewed
                by the Spirit, if not with a perfection of degrees, still with a perfection of
                parts and of grace which will at length be crowned by a perfection of glory.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXVIII. Although the imputed righteousness of Christ is maintained by
                us to be the foundation of our justification before God, it does not on that
                account cease to be purely gratuitous on our part. It is a mere gift of God’s
                mercy because the sponsor is given to us of God and was substituted in our
                place and because his obedience and righteousness (which we ourselves
                ought to have rendered from the rigor of the law) is reckoned ours and
                imputed to us by God. And what is more, the righteousness of the law is
                fulfilled in us (Rom. 8:4) and justification thus ceases to be of the works of


                the law performed by us, that still it is not made against it, but in
                accordance with it and the law is not only not made void but is rather
                established by faith (Rom. 3:31).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXIX. Although justification can be called extrinsic objectively
                (inasmuch as it is the imputation of righteousness which is formally without
                us), still it is ours terminatively. Nor is it more absurd for the righteousness
                of Christ to be extrinsic to us and yet to be imputed to us than it is absurd
                for our sins to be extrinsic to Christ and yet to be imputed to Christ for
                punishment; or (ad hominem) than it is absurd for the satisfaction of saints
                to be imputed to others, as the Romanists maintain.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXX. As the disobedience of Adam truly consitituted us sinners by
                imputation, so also the righteousness of Christ truly justifies us by
                imputation. Thus “imputed” is properly opposed to “inherent,” but not to
                “true” because we do not invent an imputation consisting in a mere opinion
                and fiction of law; but one which is in the highest sense real and true. Yet
                this truth belongs to imputation, not to infusion; is juridical, not moral.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXXI. The righteousness of Christ is rightly said to be imputed to us for
                righteousness, not that it may be reckoned righteousness (which was
                already so before), but that what was before another’s may be made ours
                and that on account of it we may be pronounced righteous and received to
                eternal life.
            </p>

                FOURTH QUESTION

                <br>
                <em>Does justification consist only in the remission of sins? Or does it embrace
                    also adoption and the right to life? The former we deny and affirm the
                    latter</em>.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                I. We have discussed the meritorious cause or the foundation of
                justification. We must now treat of its form or parts. In this matter, the
                opinions of theologians vary.

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                <b>Statement of the question.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                II. Some contend that the whole of justification is comprehended in the
                remission of sin alone, so that God is to be considered as justifying us when
                he pardons our sins and absolves us from all punishment. They also hold
                this opinion who maintain that Christ’s passive righteousness alone is
                imputed to us. However, others make justification to consist of two parts:
                remission of sin and imputation of righteousness. The former removes
                punishment from the sinner; the latter renders him worthy of the reward or
                of life.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                III. But neither opinion seems to us to explain this subject with sufficient
                accuracy. Not the first because (as we shall afterwards say) absolution from
                punishment is not sufficient for a full justification, but the communication
                of a right to life is also required. If the orthodox sometimes assert that
                justification is contained in the remission of sins alone, it does not follow
                that they do not also acknowledge the right to life under it. For they speak
                thus against the Romanists, who hold that to justification pertains not only
                the remission of sins, but also an internal renovation of the soul and an
                infusion of righteousness. Against these they well maintain that the whole
                of justification consists in the remission of sins, under which they embrace
                also the right to life, exclusive of the renovation of man or the infusion of
                righteousness.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                IV. But neither can the second opinion be received simply because in it
                are falsely joined the remission of sins and the imputation of righteousness,
                as if they were parts answering to each other: remission indeed the first;
                imputation of righteousness another. However they do not in turn
                correspond with each other as a part to a part, but as a cause to an effect and
                a foundation to that which rests upon it and depends upon it. For if we wish
                to philosophize correctly, God does not remit our sins and afterwards
                impute righteousness, but he first imputes righteousness and afterwards on
                account of that imputed righteousness, remits our sins. For a satisfaction
                and a ransom (lytron) must necessarily intervene in order that remission
                may be granted by God without detriment to his justice and that it may be
                the foundation of the absolving sentence which is made in favor of the
                elect. If by the imputation of righteousness, theologians mean nothing else
                than the bestowal of a right to life (as it is certain many do), they hold that
                indeed truly, but do not express themselves with sufficient accuracy.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                V. Thus then we believe the thing may be more readily and clearly
                conceived. Christ having been destined and given of God to us as a surety
                and head, in virtue of this union it happens that whatever was done by him


                (or endured for the perfect fulfillment of the law as to its precepts as well as
                to its penal sanction) is reckoned ours, as done in our place, and is imputed
                to us by God as if it had been performed by ourselves. From this imputation
                of his most perfect righteousness flow two benefits—both remission of sins
                and the bestowal of a right to life or adoption (in which two the whole of
                justification is contained). Thus the imputation of righteousness is the
                foundation and the meritorious cause of justification, while adoption and
                absolution are two parts of justification and effects of the imputation of
                righteousness which are inseparable from each other. For as pardon of sin
                cannot be granted nor a right to life be conferred, except on the supposition
                of the imputation of righteousness (by the intervention of which God can
                without prejudice to his justice free from punishment and bestow life), so,
                such imputation being posited, both these benefits flow necessarily from the
                double property of this righteousness, inasmuch as it has a satisfactory and
                meritorious power at the same time. By reason of the former, imputed
                righteousness is the foundation of the remission of sins; by reason of the
                latter, it is the cause of the right to life.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>Remission and the right to life, the two parts of
                    justification. </b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                VI. Now many reasons prove that these two benefits must be joined
                together here, whether we attend to the law (which was to be fulfilled) or
                regard our necessity, or the nature of things, or the voice of Scripture. For as
                the law contains a sanction of two parts—on the one side the punishment of
                death to transgressors; on the other, the reward of life to the obedient—so
                the righteousness of the law (which by the justification of Christ is fulfilled
                in us) cannot be obtained except with the remission of sins (which involves
                a liberation from punishment). We have a right to life which Christ acquired
                for us most perfectly by his obedience.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VII. Second, the necessity of salvation demanded this very thing. Two
                evils were conveyed to us by sin: (1) that we were made guilty before God;
                (2) that we were made enemies and aliens from God, the fountain of life—
                the guilt of death into which we enter and the privation of life which we
                lost. And thus we could not be restored to integrity unless the guilt of death


                were taken away by the remission of sins and a right to life were given by
                adoption. As happiness is placed not only in a privation of evil, but most
                especially in the possession of good, it was not enough to be delivered from
                evil or death, unless also the right to good or life had been conferred.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VIII. Third, the nature of the thing proves it. It is one thing to redeem
                from punishment; another to assign a reward also. It is one thing to deliver
                from death; another to bestow life and happiness. It is one thing to bring out
                of prison; another to seat upon a throne. The former takes away evil, but the
                latter superadds good also; as if a fugitive slave should not only be
                acquitted of the punishment due, but also raised to the dignity and right of a
                son. For although these two things are connected together indissolubly from
                the covenant of grace, still from the nature of the thing they could be
                separated; as Adam, although innocent from the beginning of his creation
                and worthy of no punishment, still was not at once worthy of a reward until
                he had perfected the round of obedience, so it was not absolutely necessary
                that he whose sins have been remitted and who is delivered from the guilt
                of death, should straightway be gifted with a crown of immortality (since, if
                it pleased God, he might have afterwards directed man to work by which he
                should obtain the reward). Liberty certainly necessarily follows deliverance
                from prison, but not immediately the crown and throne. Joseph freed from
                his chains ought not on that account to be set over Egypt. Mephibosheth,
                brought out from squalor and thirst, was not immediately to be carried to
                the king’s table. Thus two things must be distinctly conceived of in this
                benefit: the pardon of sin committed with a deliverance from the curse of
                the law; and a bestowal of the reward or blessing.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                IX. In many places, Scripture connects and distinguishes these. “Christ
                was made under the law [hypo nomon] to redeem them that were under the
                law” (Gal. 4:4, 5) (to wit, as to the curse that we might receive the adoption
                of sons; i.e., the right to life which flows from adoption). Paul elsewhere
                confirms this: “by which faith we receive forgiveness of sins, and
                inheritance (kléron) among them which are sanctified” (Acts 26:18) (i.e., a
                right to eternal life with other saints). Here belongs the gradation between
                peace and glory which he weaves together when he says that “being
                justified we have peace with God, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God”
                (Rom. 5:1, 2). Peace has reference to deliverance from punishment and
                glorying supposes the bestowal of a right to life, which is the foundation of


                our hope. On this account, he joins together “the being saved from wrath”
                and “glorying in God” (Rom. 5:9, 11). This very thing Daniel had already
                intimated when he ascribes to the Messiah, who was about to come, “a
                propitiation of iniquity” (by whom remission would be obtained) and “the
                bringing of an everlasting righteousness” (by whose power a right to life
                would be given, Dan. 9:24). Nor does Christ mean anything else when he
                promises believers “a transition from death to life” (i.e., not only
                deliverance from death, but also the possession of life). John means the
                same thing when he says that Christ not only “washes us from sin” by
                obtaining their pardon, but also “makes us kings and priests” who obtain the
                right to happiness and glory (Rev. 1:5, 6).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                X. Hence it appears that they are deceived who hold that the remission of
                sins and the imputation of righteousness differ only by reason of the diverse
                terms from which (a quo) and to which (ad quem); as it is not the covering
                of nakedness and the putting on of a garment, for this reason that sin and
                righteousness are contraries (ameta), one of which being posited the other is
                taken away. For it is far otherwise with these things, as we have already
                said. They are so to be joined together, as still not to be confounded, but to
                be distinguished as really differing from each other; or if the imputation of
                righteousness is put for a right to life, it is with respect to remission after
                the manner of a part, constituting with it the form of justification. Hence
                they are not to be compared with each other as the covering of nakedness
                and the putting on of a garment (which are really one and the same thing),
                but as deliverance from punishment and royal dignity in a guilty person.

            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XI. Sin and righteousness are indeed direct contraries (ameta), but not
                the righteousness which signifies perseverance in righteousness and
                perfection itself. For it is one thing to be free from corruption, but another
                to have persisted in duty and to have acquired merit. Adam had the former,
                not the latter. Thus between death and life there is no middle ground; but
                between eternal death and a happy life the middle ground is the mortal and
                animal life, a pious and holy life—but on earth, not in heaven, under the
                obligation of meriting by obedience. So many things could still come in
                between the flames of hell and the joys of heaven, deliverance from
                punishment and the possession of the reward; the punishment of slaves and
                the dignity of sons. Who, therefore, confers upon us (who were slaves
                adjudged to eternal punishment) adoption and an inheritance, will he not


                also wonderfully increase the benefit? It was much for us to be manumitted
                and to be made freedmen; now to be pronounced children and heirs, this is
                the climax and crowning blessing of mercy.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XII. When Paul argues from the remission of sins to the imputation of
                righteousness (Rom. 4:5—7), he does not do this on account of their
                equivalency, as if these two do not differ from each other and signify one
                and the same thing. Rather he does it on account of the undivided
                connection between both because remission of sins can be given to no one,
                except on account of the imputation of righteousness and imputation of
                righteousness is given to no one without his sins being forthwith pardoned.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XIII. Although he who obtains the remission of all his sins (of omission
                as well as of commission) is freed from punishment (which he deserved on
                account of those sins) and thus far can be pronounced righteous (or rather
                justified and acquitted), still, accurately speaking, he cannot on that account
                be considered to have omitted nothing really good and to have committed
                nothing evil. God by remission reckons a man not unrighteous, not because
                he judges him never to have sinned and to be without a stain, but because
                he forgives and pardons the guilty whatever evil he has committed.
                However to pardon and, on account of rectitude of conduct (katorthomata),
                to reckon worthy of a reward and to honor, are far different. See what was
                said in Topic XIV, Question 8, Section 28 and following.
            </p>
            <p>

                FIFTH QUESTION: THE REMISSION OF SINS
                <br>

                <em>Does remission of sins consist in an absolute removal of them? Or in the
                    pardon of them? And after the guilt is remitted is a certain punishment
                    retained? Or is it wholly remitted? The former we deny; the latter we affirm
                    against the Romanists</em>.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                I. Because various questions are wont to be agitated concerning the
                remission of sins, we must touch briefly upon them under three
                propositions.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>The first proposition, concerning the remission of
                    sins, which is not the abolition of them, against the


                    Romanists. </b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                II. The first: remission of sins does not consist in a removal of the
                corruption or depraved quality, but in a gratuitous pardon of the criminality
                and guilt arising from it. This is opposed to the Romanists, who, to support
                their hypothesis concerning physical justification by infusion, maintain that
                remission of sin consists in a real taking away of it, as to corruption as well
                as to guilt. Thus an infusion of righteousness always succeeds remission, as
                light always follows the scattering of the clouds of darkness.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                III. But the following arguments prove the falsehood of this opinion. (1)
                The mode of speaking and the proper signification of remission among
                men, which does not imply the extinction of sin, but only the pardoning of
                it (as a prince, by remitting a crime, does not take it away, but only pardons
                it and frees it from the punishment due on account of it). (2) The
                synonymous phrases of Scripture teach the same thing when remission is
                expressed by a “covering” (Ps. 32:1). Not that they are not, but that in the
                sight of God the Judge, they do not come into condemnation. For this
                reason, we ought to put on Christ that his righteousness may cover our sins
                before God. By a “not imputing” (Ps. 31:2) that on account of them we may
                not be punished as we deserve. By a “not remembering” (Jer. 31:34) that
                God may not deal with them practically according to his justice in
                punishing them. By a “blotting out” (Pss. 51:1; 103:12; Acts 3:19; Col.
                2:14) not of the corruption but of the guilt, as a creditor expunges from his
                account book a debt from which he wishes to release the debtor by
                destroying and blotting out the very handwriting that it may no longer have
                any force. Even so God destroys the sins which are written in his book and
                for which we are accountable (hypodikoi) when he pardons them by freeing
                us from the guilt which attached to us on account of them. By a “casting of
                them behind his back” and “throwing them into the sea” (Mic. 7:19) that
                they may no more come into judgment. By a “purging” by way of
                propitiation and of offering (hilasmou, Heb. 1:3; 9:14) that the guilt of sin
                (which makes us hateful and abominable to God) may be cleansed; in
                allusion to the sprinkling (rhantismon) of the old sacrifices, which did not
                take away inherent pollution, but adhering guilt. By a “turning away” of
                “his face” (Ps. 51:9) and a “putting away” (2 S. 12:13) and similar phrases


                which rightly mean a juridical pardoning of guilt, not a real removal of
                pollution.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                IV. (3) If remission of sin was the taking away of inherent corruption, as
                the former is perfect, so also the latter ought to be perfect (which is
                repugnant to Scripture, which testifies that sin always remains in us and
                belongs to the experience of saints, who always complain of the struggles of
                the flesh and the Spirit). (4) If not to impute sin is to expel it and to infuse
                righteousness; from the opposite, to impute sin will be to infuse sin. The
                falsity of this appears from the case of Christ, to whom sin was imputed,
                but not infused.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>Sources of explanation.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                V. Although by remission of sins actual guilt or the obligation to
                punishment is taken away, potential guilt is not immediately taken away or
                the intrinsic merit of sin (which flows from its inherent corruption) because
                remission consists only in this—that the guilty person is freed by the Judge
                from the actual punishment due to him, not however immediately from all
                vitiosity. Hence Paul indeed says there is no condemnation to them which
                are in Christ (Rom. 8:1), but he does not say there is nothing condemnable
                or worthy of condemnation. For as long as sin remains in us (now it remains
                as long as we live), there is always something condemnable, although on
                account of the interceding grace of the Judge it does not any more actually
                condemn us.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VI. There is a theoretical covering of sinners which belongs to
                omniscience, according to which it is certain that nothing can be covered by
                God except what he wholly destroys and abolishes; another practical (which
                has respect to the exercise of justice and thus can be covered by him)—
                what is still in the subject, when God does not see it so as to notice it, is
                blotted out of his book so that it may not come into account. Thus sins are
                said to be covered before God not because they are absolutely taken away
                (as they are not), but because they are not allotted to punishment. Hence
                Augustine says, “Therefore, why does he say his sins are covered? In order
                that they might not be seen. For what was it for God to see sins except to
                punish them?” (“Sermo ad Plebem,” Ennaratio in Psalmum XXXI: II [PL
                36.264]).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                VII. Although the remission of sins is expressed by various phrases
                (which denote a real taking away), it does not follow that they imply a total
                abolition of sin because in remission there is something real, since by it the
                actual obligation to punishment and the punishment itself are really and
                truly taken away from the person. Again, these phrases (such as “to take
                away,” “to bear away,” “to remove,” “to wash out,” “to purge sins”) are
                partly explained by others which signify the removal of guilt (not however
                the nonexistence of sin) and are partly drawn from the effect of sacrifices,
                which was the propitiation and purgation of sin; not by a removal of its
                corruption, but by a taking away of the guilt and a giving away
                (condonationem) of the punishment.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VIII. Although we do not deny that sin is really abolished in those to
                whom it is remitted, it does not follow on that account that remission itself
                consists in that abolition. The former is concerned only with the guilt of sin,
                the latter with its pollution; the former considers sin with its relation or
                obligation to punishment, the latter as a quality inherent in the subject; that
                is performed at the same time and at once, this little by little and
                successively. Nor does an infusion of righteousness forthwith follow
                remission of sin from the nature of the thing, as he who remits another’s
                debt ought not at once to give a new sum of money to him. We pardon the
                sins of others, nor on that account do we expel them from them, since there
                is one action which is done concerning someone and about him objectively,
                another which is done in someone subjectively.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>



                <b>Second proposition: remission is total with respect
                    to guilt as well as to punishment.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                IX. Second proposition: remission of sin is total and absolute with respect
                to guilt as well as to punishment. This is also against the Romanists, who
                urge a partial and not a total remission of guilt, but not of punishment; or of
                eternal, but not of temporal punishment. “If anyone says that after
                justification is received, criminality is so remitted to any penitent sinner and
                the guilt of eternal punishment destroyed, that no exposedness to temporal
                punishment to be taken away either in this world or in the future remains,


                before he can gain access into the kingdom of heaven, let him be accursed”
                (Council of Trent, Session 6, Canon 30, Schroeder, p. 46).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                X. For guilt to be remitted while the punishment is not remitted is absurd
                (asystaton) because there is no punishment without guilt and remission of
                guilt is nothing else than deliverance from punishment. (2) It is repugnant to
                Scripture which nowhere speaks of the remission of sin except on the
                supposition that no punishment of it is exacted; otherwise a great
                disturbance would be introduced into the Scriptures and nothing could be
                considered fixed and certain in them. Also great darkness would be poured
                over both the divine promises and threatenings, as often as either remission
                of sin is promised or denied (whether it is only of the guilt or also of the
                punishment; and whether of all or of a certain part of each). Again, how
                could God be said to cast behind his back, not to impute, to destroy, not to
                remember, if he still exacts the punishment of them (i.e., recollects and
                imputes them to punishment)? (3) The common manner of speaking does
                not suffer it to be said that his sin has been remitted from whom some
                punishment of sin is exacted. For thus anyone might be said at the same
                time and at once “to let go” (aphienai) and “to keep hold” (kratein) of
                something (which is a contradiction); as no one would say that a debt had
                been remitted to a person from whom the payment of it is still required. (4)
                The nature of remission, which is entirely gratuitous, cannot allow this
                because what is obtained by the payment of any price, cannot be called
                gratuitous. (5) The justified cannot have peace with God according to Paul
                (Rom. 5:1), if they are still to be disturbed in life or after death. (6) In
                believers after the reception of justification, there is no condemnation
                (Rom. 8:1). Therefore no punishment remains, since condemnation is the
                devoting to punishment.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XI. (7) This hypothesis supposes either that Christ has not fully satisfied
                for us or that God demands the payment of the same debt twice (both of
                which are impious and blasphemous). Nor can it be replied, “Subordinates
                are not at variance because the satisfactions of men depend upon Christ’s
                satisfaction, and from it have the power of satisfying; that Christ satisfied
                immediately for the guilt and exposedness to eternal death, mediately,
                however, for temporal punishment also, inasmuch as he furnishes the grace
                by which we ourselves make satisfaction to God.” (a) It is gratuitously
                supposed that our satisfactions can be subordinated to Christ’s satisfaction,


                since they are expressly opposed to it. For if righteousness came by the law
                then Christ is dead in vain (Gal. 2:21). (b) This mediate satisfaction is
                unheard-of in Scripture, which never says that Christ satisfied that he might
                acquire for us the power to satisfy, but by himself (di’ heautou) made
                expiation for sins, and thus reconciled us to God and freed us from the curse
                of the law, being made a curse for us. Now how could Christ be said to have
                borne our sins in his own body on the tree (i.e., their punishment) and to
                have freed us from the curse and to have blotted out and taken out of the
                way the handwriting which was against us (Col. 2:14) and by one offering
                to have perfected forever them that are sanctified (Heb. 10:14), if believers
                are still bound by the guilt of some punishments for which they are yet to
                make satisfaction? Finally, the mode of speaking does not suffer it to be
                said that he made satisfaction for us, unless he has cancelled our debt with
                his own money.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XII. No less absurd is the answer “Our satisfactions are required that the
                satisfaction of Christ and the remission acquired by him may be applied to
                us.” Although the satisfaction of Christ must be applied to particular
                believers to avail them, this ought to be done by the word and sacraments
                externally, by the Spirit and faith internally; but it cannot be done by
                satisfactions which ought to be offered to God, not to men. Nor have we
                ever heard it said that the remission of a debt is applied by an exaction of it
                and that this rests upon the debtor in order that he may enjoy the payment
                made for him by his security, so that the money which the sponsor paid for
                him, he also should pay out of his own funds to the creditor afterwards (or
                certainly some part of it). Again, if (in order that Christ’s satisfaction for
                temporal punishments may be applied to us) our satisfactions are required,
                why are they not equally necessary in order that the same may be applied
                for guilt and eternal punishment? Or if they confess that they are not
                required for that application, why should they be required for the other,
                since no reason for the difference can be assigned? Finally, if Christ’s
                satisfaction ought to be applied by our satisfaction, our satisfaction again
                would have to be applied by another satisfaction and so on to infinity.
            </p>

                XIII. What Scripture sometimes says of the exercise of judgment against
                the church and believers (1 Pet. 4:17; 1 Cor. 11:32 and elsewhere) does not
                favor the error of the Romanists. The judgment of a vindictive judge is one
                thing; the judgment of paternal chastisement is another. The one is legal, the


                other evangelical; the one proceeding from wrath and hatred, the other from
                love and mercy; the one for destruction and death, the other for correction
                and salvation; the one is exercised against the wicked and rebels, the other
                towards the pious and believers, not to destroy, but to teach and make them
                more cautious afterwards. Hence Augustine says, “What you bewail is
                medicine, not a punishment; chastisement not condemnation; be unwilling
                to repel the rod, if you do not wish to be repelled from the inheritance”
                (Psalm 103* [102].17 [20] [NPNF1, 8:508; PL 37.1332]). The former is
                incompatible (asystaton) with remission, not the latter.

                XIV. Although afflictions of themselves and in their own nature are truly
                the punishment of sin according to the threatening of the law (Lev. 26), still
                on account of our gratuitous reconciliation with God in Christ they cease to
                be punishments (timoriai). They become either fatherly chastisement (1
                Cor. 11:32; Heb. 12:8); or necessary evidences (dokimasiai) that we may be
                manifested to ourselves and to others (Jam. 1:2, 3); or witnesses (martyria)
                or testimonies concerning the truth of doctrine (Acts 5:41). On this account,
                they are reckoned even among the blessings of God (Ps. 94:12; Job 5:17;
                Phil. 1:29; Heb. 12:6, 7). They are connected with joy (Acts 5:41; Jam. 1:2;
                Heb. 12:11). They have glorying as an attendant (Rom. 5:2, 3). Therefore if
                they are still called punishments after the remission of sin, this is not said
                properly because they are without the formal reason of punishment (to wit,
                that it should be inflicted from the wrath of the Judge as the avenging of sin
                and the destruction of the sinner). Rather it is said improperly, both because
                they were of themselves the punishments of sin and because they tend to the
                destruction of the flesh and of the old man.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XV. This full and total remission of sins being established, the treasury
                of papal indulgences sinks and that most foul trafficking of the mystery of
                iniquity is swept away. For if the remission granted to believers is entire
                and total, freeing them from all guilt and punishment, why are necessary
                satisfactions further invented (either personal or another’s) for the taking
                away of punishment, if not eternal at least temporal? I dismiss the various
                arguments, which prove not only the weakness but also the falsity of that
                error (concerning which we will speak in the proper place) from which it
                will appear that this comment is not only unwritten (agraphon), but also
                contrary to what is written (antigraphon) and unreasonable (alogon) and
                filled with innumerable contradictions and impieties. Hence it should not


                seem amazing if this occasioned (as is well known) the work of the
                Reformation in the year 1519 at Zurich by Zwingli; in the year 1517 at
                Wittenberg by Luther, who could not endure that most disgraceful traffic in
                sacred things.

            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XVI. Nor ought we to recur to the indulgences of the fathers, which have
                nothing in common with the modern papal indulgences (as they cannot be
                ignorant who have any knowledge of the ancient discipline). Since it is
                evident that in the ancient church very severe canonical punishments and
                satisfactions were imposed upon public sinners by penitential canons,
                specimens of which can be seen not only in the canons of the councils of
                Elvira, Ancyra and Nicea, but also in the decrees of Burchard, Ivo and
                Gratian (which were not rendered properly to God in the court of heaven as
                a Satisfactory punishment for their sins, but only to the church itself for the
                extinction and reparation of the scandal by which it was injured). But since
                on account of that rigor many were reduced to desperation and relapsed into
                Gentilism, a modification of indulgences was introduced, which sinners
                obtained either by the intercession of martyrs or received from their bishops
                (their serious grief being regarded lest they should be swallowed up of
                sadness), by which, the severity being relaxed, they were restored to
                communion before the time required by the canons and a dispensation of
                canonical punishments was granted to them, as may be seen in Cyprian,
                Letters 15, 16, 17 (ACW 43:90-98); Canons 5 and 11 of the Council of
                Nicea (cf. Hefele, 1:386—87, 416-17); Canons 21 and 22 of the Council of
                Ancyra (a.b. 314) (Hefele, 1:220—21); and Canon 37 of the Council of
                Agathensis (Agde/Agatha, a.p. 506) (Hefele, 4:82). Afterwards most
                persons withdrawing from the yoke of the penitential canons, partly
                changes and partly redemptions of canonical satisfactions were introduced.
                Hence a fast of three days was redeemed by a recitation of fifty psalms, and
                by the feeding of some destitute person, or by three denarii from him who
                did not know the psalms (Burchard, Decretorum 19 [“Ex Poenitentiali
                Romano”] [PL 140.949-1014]). This gate of redemptions, however, being
                once opened, the sale of indulgences at length began in the eleventh century
                under Urban II. To make them of greater importance, various comments
                were devised concerning their value and efficacy, not only in the court of
                earth (as to canonical punishment), but also in the court of heaven and as to
                the satisfaction to be rendered to divine justice for sins. Hence it is evident


                how much these indulgences differ from the ancient, which were nothing
                else than relaxations of canonical punishments and dispensations from their
                severity for the consolation of private persons and the common edification
                of the church. However the modern are held to be relaxations of the
                satisfactory punishments of divine justice.

                <b>Third proposition: remission ts extended to all sins.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XVII. Third proposition: “Remission is extended to all the sins entirely of
                believers, of whatever kind they may be, future as well as past and present,
                but in their own order.” This question is moved with regard to future sins—
                are they also remitted at the same time and at once with the past and present
                sins? For there are some even of our theologians of great reputation who
                think that in the justification of the sinner all his sins (the future equally
                with the past) are at the same time and at once remitted, both because the
                righteousness of Christ, which is the foundation of our justification, is
                wholly (however great it is) imputed at once and at the same time to us and
                because justification ought to leave no room for condemnation (Rom. 8:1).
                Nay, being justified, they have peace with God (Rom. 5:1) and are called
                blessed (Ps. 32:1). This could not be said if they could still be subjected to
                condemnation on account of future sins not remitted.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XVIII. We think the difficulty can be overcome by a distinction. All sins
                (future as well as past) cannot be said to be remitted at the same time and
                once formally and explicitly because as they are not accidents of a
                nonentity, so as long as the sin is not, punishment is not due to it; and since
                it is not due, it cannot be remitted (as a debt not yet contracted cannot be
                cancelled). Besides for the remission of sin there is required a confession
                and repentance of it, which cannot be made unless it has been committed.
                Hence we are ordered to seek remission of sins every day, which is to be
                applied to sins committed, not to anticipate their perpetration. But because
                in justification the righteousness of Christ is applied to us (which is the
                foundation upon which the remission of all our sins rests) and because from
                the covenant of grace God promises that he will not remember our sins,
                nothing prevents us from saying that in this sense sins are remitted
                eminently and virtually because in the righteousness of Christ imputed to us
                is the foundation of that remission. And thus all our sins are remitted by


                God, whether past or present or future, but with respect to the time in which
                they are committed; so that past and present are actually remitted, the future
                when they are committed will most certainly be remitted according to God’s
                promise. Thus the state of justification remaining undisturbed and the
                acceptation of the person remaining uninterrupted and the general remission
                of sins already committed, the following and future as to particular
                absolution are not actually pardoned before their commission; nay, before
                they have been repented of either generally or particularly.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XIX. I confess if we regard the eternal purpose of God in which all
                things, even the future, appeared to God as present (Acts 15:18) and the
                merit and acquisition of Christ, who offered to God a perfectly sufficient
                ransom (lytron) for the expiation of all our sins, so that as to the promise
                given by God in the covenant of grace concerning their remission,
                remission under this relation (schesei) can be said to be extended to all sins
                whether past or future. But if the actual remission itself is regarded, which
                is made by an intimation of the absolving sentence in the heart of the
                believer and penitent, it can be referred only to sins already committed.
                Thus to take away the guilt of subsequent sins, there is required a particular
                application of remission, not only as to the sense and assurance of
                remission, but also as to the true and real forgiveness itself.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XX. As the person whose sins are pardoned can be considered, either as
                to the state of grace (in which he is constituted by justification) or as to the
                particular acts (which he can afterwards commit), so remission can be
                viewed in two aspects: either generally as to state (according to which God
                receives the believing and penitent sinner into grace on account of Christ
                and bestows upon him the pardon of all the sins of which he is guilty); or
                specially as to particular acts of sin into which he afterwards falls, for
                taking away the guilt of which a particular absolution is needed. Not that
                the state of justification into which he is translated can be dissolved or
                remission once bestowed be abrogated, because God remains always his
                Father, but a Father angry on account of sins recently committed (which
                although they cannot constitute him a “child of wrath” on account of the
                immutability of calling and justification, still they make him a “child under
                wrath,” so that he deservedly incurs the fatherly indignation of God and has
                need forthwith of a new justification or particular remission of these sins
                through faith and repentance).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                XXI. Although the justified believer has not as yet the formal remission
                of future sins, he does not cease to be happy and free from actual
                condemnation because he has the foundation from which he can infer with
                positive certainty that it is prepared for him according to God’s promise. If
                the whole righteousness of Christ is at the same time imputed, its entire
                fruit does not flow out to us at once, but successively in proportion to the
                inrushings of sin (for the remission of which the believer ought to apply that
                ransom [lytron] to himself every day).

                SIXTH QUESTION: ADOPTION
                <br>
                <em>What is the adoption which is given to us in justification? </em>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                The other part of justification, adoption.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                I. The other part of justification is adoption or the bestowal of a right to life,
                flowing from Christ’s righteousness, which acquired for us not only
                deliverance from death, but also a right to life by the adoption with which
                he endows us. For on this account, he is said to have been made under the
                law (hypo nomon) by an economical subjection that he might redeem us
                from the bondage of the law and confer upon us the adoption or the right of
                sons (Gal. 4:4, 5). On this, the right to life depends because “if children,
                then heirs” (Rom. 8:17). John says “to them who received him,” i.e., “who
                believed on his name, he gave power to become the sons of God” (1:12).
                Here exousia does not signify authority or power because it has reference
                here to inferiors; nor faculty or potency by which a person can make
                himself a son. Rather it signifies axidma (i.e., the dignity and right of sons).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>In how many ways adoption may be taken.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                II. However adoption here is not taken by us (as it is elsewhere) for an
                external calling and reception into the covenant (such as was formerly the
                case with the Jews, whose is said to be the adoption, Rom. 9:4). Nor for the
                sense and use of adoption which is made by emancipation, such as belongs
                to believers of the New Testament, who because they are made adults and
                are no longer minors are said to have received the Spirit of adoption and are


                no longer called servants, nor are held in the manner of servants, but are
                sons and heirs who rejoice in this right (Gal. 4:5). Nor for the full
                manifestation of adoption, which will occur in the resurrection. In this
                sense, believers are said to wait for the adoption (i.e., the resurrection of
                their bodies, Rom. 8:23). Rather it is taken for a juridical act of God by
                which from his mere mercy, he adopts into his family through faith in
                Christ those whom he elected to salvation from eternity and bestows upon
                them the name and right of sons as to inheritance.

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                <b>What is adoption?</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                III. However as the word “adoption” is derived from a custom received
                among men, so the action itself has a multiple analogy with civil adoption
                (although it differs also in various things and is better). Adoption is defined
                by lawyers as a “lawful act imitating nature introduced for the consolation
                of those who have no children.” Thus there is required here: first an adopter,
                who can have the authority of a father who (destitute of children) supplies
                the defect of nature by law and receives a stranger into his own family and
                promises to him paternal favor; (2) the person adopted, who passes from his
                father’s family into another and (his state being changed) changes his name
                and life and has a right to the paternal goods and especially to the
                inheritance; and in turn binds himself to all the duties of filial obedience.
                Thus in this matter, adoption is not an act of nature, but of a gracious will
                which our heavenly Father wished to exercise towards us. In this sense, he
                is said “to have begotten us of his own will” (Jam. 1:18) and the very name
                adoption (hyiothesias) denotes this voluntary and most free disposition of
                God. By it God transfers us strangers and foreigners (who were the servants
                or slaves of Satan) from the family of the old Adam and the power of
                darkness and admits us into his own family and the kingdom of light and
                gives us the dignity of sons. He not only bestows upon us the glorious name
                of dearly beloved sons (1 Jn. 3:1; Rev. 2:17; 3:12) with the distinctions and
                honors pertaining to them, but also gives us a right to all his goods of grace
                as well as of glory. All this comes under the name of inheritance as acquired
                not by any merit, but given by the mere grace of the Father to us in virtue of
                our adoption by him. And we in turn (answering by faith to this great love)


                bind ourselves to filial worship and obedience to him (2 Cor. 6:18; 1 Pet.
                1:15, 16; Mal. 1:6, 8).

            </p>

                <b>How it differs from human adoption.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                IV. Of whatever kind may be the analogy, still a great and remarkable
                difference always intervenes. For what the law does among men, this is a
                work of mere good will (eudokias). That was sought out for the solace of
                childlessness to supply a defect of nature; but this was made for our
                consolation only, not for God’s, who was perfectly well pleased with his
                only begotten Son. That was ordained for the succession to the goods of a
                deceased father, but this only for a participation in the goods of a Father
                living forever. That can give the name, the titles and distinctions of sons,
                but not the mind and qualities. But in this, God by adopting changes the
                heart, and to whom he gratuitously gives the right of sons, he also impresses
                upon them the mind and character of sons by the Spirit of adoption. That
                does not make them good, but supposes them to be so; for neither would a
                man adopt anyone as a son unless he perceived in him something lovely.
                But this is a work of mere grace which does not suppose anything good in
                us who were enemies, rebels and most corrupt. Thus God adopts us, not
                because we are good, but to make us good.

            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                V. Here belongs the testamentary disposition which the Father is said to
                have instituted for giving us the inheritance. It is nothing else than the final
                and immutable will sealed in the Scriptures and confirmed by the blood and
                death of Christ, by which he pronounces elect believers his heirs. Christ
                clearly intimates this: “I appoint” (diatithemai, or give by a will) “unto you
                a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed (dietheto) unto me” (Lk. 22:29).
                “And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament,” says Paul,
                “that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were
                under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of
                eternal inheritance” (Heb. 9:15). The goods left by this testament do not
                pertain only to “the inheritance of this world” (Rom. 4:13), according to
                which all things are ours (1 Cor. 3:21), but it is especially the inheritance of
                heaven or of the kingdom of heaven (Mt. 25; Jam. 2:5). Thus it is the
                inheritance of God himself, who (as he is the highest good) is often called


                our portion and inheritance (Gen. 15:1; Ps. 16:5; Jer. 10:16), as believers
                are the portion and inheritance of God (Ps. 33:12).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VI. Now although this privilege as to the thing is common to all the
                believers of the Old Testament, no less than to those of the New, who were
                both sons of God and had a right to the heavenly inheritance (to which after
                death they were admitted), still it is certain that the condition of believers of
                the New Testament as to the mode is far better in this respect: they are no
                longer in an infantile age, held like slaves under teachers and the rudiments
                of the world, when they were not able to have either the sense or the use of
                their right, animated by the spirit of bondage. But now being adults and
                emancipated by Christ, they are admitted to the sanctuary of the Father and
                have a full sense and fruit of their right, the Spirit of adoption being
                received, in virtue of which they can confidently cry out, Abba, Father. Paul
                refers to this when he says, “Christ was made under the law, to redeem
                them that were under the law” (to wit, under the curse of the moral law and
                under the yoke of the ceremonial law) “that we might receive the adoption
                of sons” (Gal. 4:4, 5). Not that only by which we are separated from the
                children of wrath and of the Devil, but also that by which we far excel
                infants, who do not differ from slaves. This is more copiously proved in
                Topic XII, of the covenant of grace, Question 10.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VII. From these positions, it is gathered that to no purpose do some
                anxiously ask here how justification and adoption differ from each other,
                and whether adoption is by nature prior to justification (as some hold, who
                think it is the first and immediate fruit of faith by which we are united and
                joined to Christ; or whether posterior to and consequent upon it, as others).
                For since it is evident from what has been said that justification is a benefit
                by which God (being reconciled to us in Christ) absolves us from the guilt
                of sins and gives us a right to life, it follows that adoption is included in
                justification itself as a part which, with the remission of sins, constitutes the
                whole of this benefit. Nor can it be distinguished from adoption except
                inasmuch as it is taken strictly for remission of sins, since in its formal
                conception it includes also acceptation to life, which flows from the
                imputation of Christ’s righteousness.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VIII. Nor is adoption here to be confounded with our union with Christ.
                For although it necessarily flows from it as its cause and foundation (since
                from union with Christ depends the communion of all his benefits, of


                justification and of sanctification and of glory), still it cannot (if we wish to
                speak accurately) be identified with it. Rather it stands related to it as an
                effect to its cause. Hence it is that, being united to Christ as our head and
                the first-begotten of God, his most perfect righteousness becomes ours by
                the imputation of God and the reception of faith, upon which depend both
                absolution from sins and the adoption or acceptation to life and the
                inheritance which is the right of sons. For as many as obtain that dignity are
                not only received into God’s family to be members of his house (Gal. 6:10),
                to be always under the fatherly protection of God, depending upon him for
                nutrition, education and perpetual conservation, but have a right to the
                inheritance (Rom. 8:17), i.e., the possession of all the goods of the Father
                and the enjoyment of God himself (which is our inheritance).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>Christian liberty flows from adoption.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                IX. From this adoption springs Christian liberty, which is not an immunity
                from all laws (divine and human) and a license to live according to our
                pleasure and to indulge the lusts of the flesh (as the Libertines profess,
                changing liberty into licentiousness); not an exemption from the civil
                obligation of subjection and from the tributes and jurisdiction of magistrates
                (as the various Anabaptists maintain and which the Romish clergy claim for
                themselves against the express teachings of Scripture); but it is a spiritual
                and mystical manumission obtained for us by the blood of Christ, by which
                from the spiritual bondage of the law, of sin, of the world and Satan (by
                whose chains we were before bound), we are brought into the liberty of the
                sons of God (as it is treated in Jn. 8:32, 36; Rom. 6:15, 22; 8:2, 3; Gal. 3:13;
                4:6, 26; 5:1; Heb. 2:15 and elsewhere); through which being called into
                fellowship with God (as our Father) and with Christ (as our brother), we
                obtain dominion over the creatures and are heirs of the kingdom of
                Heaven.

                SEVENTH QUESTION: THE JUSTIFICATION OF FAITH
                <br>

                <em>Does faith justify us properly and by itself or only relatively and
                    instrumentally? The former we deny; the latter we affirm against the
                    Socinians, Remonstrants and Romanists</em>.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>Justification—active and passive.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                I. Since justification can be viewed either actively (on the part of God who
                justifies) or passively (on the part of man who is justified), a twofold
                handling of it can also be adopted: either with respect to the benefit itself
                conferred upon us by God and of the righteousness imputed to us; or with
                respect to its reception and application made by faith (of which we now
                treat).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>Statement of the question.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                II. However, it is not controverted whether faith justifies—for Scripture so
                clearly asserts this that no one dares to deny it. Rather we inquire regarding
                the manner in which it justifies, in describing which there is an amazing
                discrepancy of opinions.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>The opinion of the Socinians.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                III. All our opponents agree in this—that faith justifies properly and by
                itself and so is our very righteousness—but with some differences. For the
                Socinians maintain that faith or the act of believing is the cause of our
                justification so that there is no other immediate and formal righteousness by
                which we are just before God than our faith; also justification is a universal
                affection of faith—‘“Not because it is considered such by the gracious
                acceptation of God; by which it pleased him to reckon faith for perfect
                righteousness, or for a perfect fulfillment of the law, no otherwise than
                formally under the legal covenant, the perfect obedience of the law was that
                universal righteousness upon which life depended” (as Socinus, De lesu
                Christo Servatore [1594] frequently expresses it; Smalcius, Refutatio
                Thesium D. Wolfgang Frantzii [1614]; Volkelius, De vera Religione 4.3
                [1630], pp. 175-84). The Remonstrants agree with them on this point in
                their Confession, c. 21+ (cf. The Confession or Declaration of the ...
                Remonstrants 18* [1676], p. 211).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>And of the Romanists.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                IV. The Romanists hold that faith is the disposing and cause sine qua non,
                which not only disposes to righteousness, but also begins and merits
                righteousness itself. “If anyone says that the wicked are justified by faith
                alone, so that he understands nothing else to be required to cooperate for
                obtaining the grace of justification and is necessary from no part, to be
                prepared and disposed with the motion of his own will, let him be accursed”
                (Council of Trent, Session 6, Canon 9*, Schroeder, p. 43). Bellarmine says,
                “Faith justifies as the beginning and root of justification because it is the
                first motion towards God, for it behooves one approaching God to believe
                that God is” (“De Justificatione,” 1.13 Opera [1858], 4:479). This opinion
                is founded upon a false hypothesis—as if justification consists in an
                infusion of righteousness and is a certain physical motion which demands
                previous dispositions in the subject before the introduction of the form.

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                <b>The opinion of the orthodox.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                V. However the orthodox differ wholly from them. They teach that faith is
                the organic and instrumental cause of our justification and that justification
                is ascribed to it, not properly and by itself (inasmuch as it is a work or as if
                it was the righteousness itself by which we are justified before God; or as if
                by its own worth or by the indulgence of God it deserves justification in
                whole or in part), but improperly and metonymically (inasmuch as Christ’s
                righteousness, which faith apprehends, is the foundation and meritorious
                cause on account of which we are justified). So that it is said to justify
                relatively and organically: relatively because the object of faith is our true
                righteousness before God; organically because faith is the instrument for
                receiving on our part and for applying to ourselves, that righteousness.

                <b>Proof that the act of believing is not our
                    righteousness. </b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                VI. Two things therefore must be done by us here. First, negatively (kat’
                arsin), the false mode of the justification of faith (introduced by the
                Socinians and Romanists) must be removed. Second, affirmatively (kata
                thesin) the true and genuine sense must be established. As to the former,


                faith or the act of believing is not considered as our righteousness with God
                by a gracious acceptation: (a) because what is only the instrument for
                receiving righteousness cannot be our righteousness itself formally. Now
                faith holds here only the relation (schesin) of an instrument, as is evident
                both from its proper act (which is instrumental and consists in the reception
                of Christ [Jn. 1:12] and the acceptance of righteousness [Rom. 5:17] and of
                the remission of sins [Acts 26:18]); and from the subordination of the
                causes of justification to the same effect (to wit, the grace of God, the
                redemption of Christ and faith). This is alluded to by Paul in Rom. 3:24
                where faith cannot sustain any other meaning than that of an instrument,
                since the grace of God holds the relation of an efficient principle and the
                redemption of Christ that of the meritorious cause.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VII. (b) Because faith is distinguished from the righteousness itself
                which is imputed to us, both because it is said to be “of faith” and “by faith”
                (Rom. 1:17; 3:22; Phil. 3:9) and because Christ with his obedience and
                satisfaction is that righteousness which is imputed to us (Is. 53:11; Jer. 23:6;
                1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 5:21; Gal. 3:13, 14), which faith indeed apprehends as
                its object, but with which it cannot be identified. Hence Scripture nowhere
                says that God willed to count our faith for righteousness, but that he made
                Christ unto us righteousness; that he is Jehovah our righteousness and that
                we are the righteousness of God in him.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VIII. (c) Because we are not justified except by a perfect righteousness.
                For we have to deal with the strict justice of God, which cannot be
                deceived. Now no faith here is perfect. Nor can it be said that it is not
                indeed a perfect righteousness of itself, but is admitted as such by God and
                considered such by a gratuitous lowering of the law’s demands. For in the
                court of divine justice (which demands an adequate and absolutely perfect
                payment), there cannot be room for a gracious acceptation which is an
                imaginary payment. Again, since our justification is a forensic and judicial
                act (where God shows himself just, Rom. 3:25), it does not admit of a
                gracious acceptation (which never proceeds from the authority and sentence
                of the Judge, but from the voluntary and private stipulation of the parties).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                IX. (d) If faith is counted for righteousness, we will be justified by works
                because thus faith cannot but have the relation of a work which justifies.
                And yet it is clear that in this business Paul always opposes faith to works
                as incompatible (asystata) and two antagonistic (antidiéremena) means by
                which man is justified either by his own obedience and in himself, by the
                law, or by another’s obedience by the gospel. Nor does the difference
                between these modes of justification consist in this—that in the former a
                perfect obedience and in the latter an imperfect is accepted of God as
                perfect, since the mode of justification would be always the same—by
                works. Rather the difference consists in this—that since in both cases a
                perfect righteousness is required, in the former from the strictness
                (akribodikaio) of the law God demands a personal righteousness, here from
                the forbearance (epieikeia) of the gospel he admits another’s (to wit, the
                righteousness of Christ). Thus faith cannot be said to justify properly and by
                itself unless we slide back to the old covenant and returm to legal
                justification.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                X. “The faith of Abraham,” it is said, “was imputed to him for
                righteousness” (Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3). Not properly because in this way he
                would have been justified by works (which the apostle denies in the same
                place). But (1) relatively and metonymically, so that faith is taken for its
                object (Gal. 3:25), i.e., for that which faith believes (to wit, that the promise
                concerning the seed [from Gal. 3:16], not so much bodily as spiritual, which
                he received by faith, was the foundation of his justification). This is
                confirmed by the circumstance that what does not inhere and what is
                contradistinguished from works is here said to be imputed. Thus in this
                sense faith is said to be imputed for righteousness by a hypallage because
                righteousness is imputed by faith, as the apostle declares in equivalent
                terms (Gal. 3:5, 6; Rom. 3:22). Nor is this to wrest the Scriptures and to
                express coldly the power and efficacy of faith, as Forbes falsely charges
                upon our theologians (A Treatise Tending to Clear the Doctrine of
                Justification 4 [1616], p. 10). Nay, no more clearly and truly can the
                genuine sense of that imputation be set forth. For since that thing which is
                imputed to us for righteousness ought to be our righteousness before God
                (i.e., that on account of which God justifies us); nor can faith be that (as we
                have already said and as he himself does not deny when he recognizes it to
                be the instrumental cause); it is clear that this phrase cannot be taken
                properly, but only metonymically with regard to the object. Nor is anything
                more usual in Scripture than for a faculty to be taken for its object. This
                does not prevent (2) faith from being said to be imputed for righteousness
                organically because it is the instrumental cause which apprehends the


                righteousness of Christ by a metonymy of the effect for the efficient, as it is
                elsewhere called eternal life (Jn. 17:3; 12:50), i.e., the instrumental cause of
                life.

                XI. In vain, however, does Arminius contend that the righteousness of
                Christ is not imputed for righteousness, since it is that very righteousness
                itself (to wit, supposing that is not properly righteousness which is imputed
                to us for righteousness). He falsely confounds to impute for righteousness
                by gracious acceptation that which is not a righteousness and to impute to a
                person for righteousness that which he did not have. The first sense has no
                place here, only the latter. Accordingly what Abraham had not is said to be
                imputed to him for righteousness and the righteousness of Christ is imputed
                to us (i.e., reckoned ours), which was not ours. Thus imputation does not
                deny the truth of the thing or the perfection of the righteousness, but only
                the truth of the possession by ascribing to a person what was not properly
                his.

                XII. What is said concerning anyone in Scripture ought to be altogether
                in him, but according to the manner which it teaches itself. Now the manner
                in which justification and salvation are ascribed to faith, does not consist in
                its own proper efficiency (as if our faith wrought or effected them), but they
                are placed only in its fiducial apprehension and application. Nor otherwise
                are we said to please God by faith (Heb. 11:6) and to be purged of sin (Acts
                15:9), than because it applies to us the righteousness and blood of Christ,
                who purges us from sins and makes us acceptable to God.

            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XIII. It is one thing for blessings to be conferred according to faith (i.e.,
                under the condition of faith) under which they are promised in the word and
                which we acknowledge with the Scriptures; another for faith to justify
                properly and by itself or to count faith itself for righteousness and thus to
                impute it for righteousness to the believer. There faith holds the relation of
                an instrument. Here, however, it holds that of a principal cause and
                foundation (which we deny).

                <b>2. Faith does not justify dispositively. </b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                XIV. Second, against the Romanists we prove that faith does not justify
                dispositively or meritoriously, as the beginning and root of righteousness.
                (1) The Holy Spirit nowhere ascribes to faith the beginning or only a part or


                disposition to justification, but the whole and entire justification. (2) Thus
                the antithesis of the apostle between works and faith would not hold good,
                since faith would always justify like a work. (3) Justification, as being a
                forensic act, takes place at once and in a moment (en atom0); nor can it
                admit of a beginning and progress. (4) Thus we could be said to be justified
                “on account of faith” (dia tén pistin). The Scripture never says this, but
                always either “by faith” (pistei) or “through faith” (dia tés pisteds, ek
                pisteos) as by an instrument. If in various passages these prepositions
                —“by” and “through’—have a causality properly so called (as when they
                are connected with the death and blood of Christ), it does not follow that
                they have the same force when used concerning the justification of faith.
                Nay, since it is evident that a man cannot be justified by two
                righteousnesses (one in himself, the other in Christ), if the righteousness
                and blood of Christ is the proper cause of his justification, this cannot be
                ascribed to faith, but only the instrumental cause. (5) This opinion falsely
                supposes that justification is a physical motion inhering in the subject,
                which needs previous dispositions by which it may be acquired so as to be
                introduced into the subject. But this is false since it is a forensic act (as was
                proved before) to which man holds himself objectively, not subjectively.
                And although faith is required on the part of man for receiving this benefit,
                it does not follow that it has the relation of a disposition by which the sinner
                is disposed to the infusion of righteousness.

                    Sources of explanation. </b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XV. Faith is viewed in different lights: either in the act itself of justification
                or in the person of the justified or in the effect of justification. In the person
                of the justified, it is well called “the beginning of righteousness”; not
                imputed but inherent because it is the root of all virtues. Thus in the effect
                of justification, it is the principle and cause of new obedience; but in the act
                of justification, it can be nothing else than an instrument apprehending and
                applying to man that which justifies. Thus he is justified not by the merit of
                faith, but only by it as a means.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XVI. Although justification is drawn away from works as to merit and a
                properly so-called efficiency, it does not follow that the same is ascribed to
                faith in the same manner. Nay, because it is taken away from works, it


                cannot for the same reason be ascribed to faith because it would thus justify
                as a work; nor could we be said to be justified without works. It therefore
                suffices (in order to save the opposition of the apostle) that faith should be
                substituted by him in the place of works because by faith we most surely
                obtain what the Jews in vain sought in works (although it acts here not
                meritoriously, but only instrumentally).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XVII. Faith is said to save us (Lk. 7:50), not by meriting something in
                order to justification, but only receptively and organically because it was
                the instrument receptive of that benefit. Nothing is more frequent than by a
                metalepsis to ascribe to an instrument the effect of the principal cause (as
                when “the gospel” is said “to be the power of God unto salvation,” Rom.
                1:16; the diligent hand is said to increase the house; the plough to enrich the
                farmer; the hand of the giver to relieve the poor; and the like). If elsewhere
                the greatness of the faith of the Canaanite woman to whom Christ granted
                the sought-for blessing is extolled (Mt. 15:28), its merit and efficiency is
                not on that account denoted. Believing, she was certainly healed because,
                faith being the medium, God bestowed this blessing upon her; but
                believing, he healed her, not on account of the fact that faith properly
                speaking effected or merited the healing.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XVIII. Therefore the true mode of the justification of faith is no other
                than instrumental. (1) Its proper act consists in the reception of Christ and
                his righteousness, as was said before. (2) It justifies in no other manner than
                by its being directed to the death and obedience of Christ (to wit, by
                apprehending and applying Christ to itself as a ransom [antilytron] given
                for us and a propitiation [hilasmon] for sin, 1 Jn. 2:2). (3) Faith in the
                Scriptures is described by “eating,” “looking” and “touching,” which have
                only an instrumental causality, not a proper efficiency (as the looking at a
                serpent did not cure per se, but relatively to the brazen serpent; nor does
                eating nourish except by food thrown into the mouth). (4) Justifying faith
                stands related in no other way to justification than as the faith of miracles
                stands related to the working of miracles; not effectively, but organically by
                apprehending the special promise given concerning them.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XIX. Not without reason, however, is this ascribed above all other things
                to the believer because it alone of all the virtues can subsist with grace as
                consisting in the mere reception and apprehension of an object placed
                beyond itself. Hence it is said to be “of faith, that it might be by grace”


                (Rom. 4:16), to wit, as man owes this entire blessing to God, he has no
                reason for glorying in himself. For if he were justified by works or inherent
                righteousness, he would seem to have something in which to glory; but
                when he is justified by faith (which gives nothing to God, but only receives)
                all glorying is excluded. This Toletus well explains when he gives the
                reason why the Scripture ascribes justification to faith alone: “Namely,
                because in faith it is more manifested that man is justified not by his own
                virtue, but by the merit of Christ. For as in beholding the serpent God
                placed healing in the desert, because the looking indicated more that the
                men were healed by the virtue of the serpent, not of any personal work or
                medicine; so faith shows that sinners are justified by the virtue and merit of
                Christ, in whom believing they are saved, not by any virtue and merit of
                their own. And it is the reason why justification is ascribed to faith
                especially by Paul, who strives to exclude from justification the works of
                the law, and human merit or efficacy, and to place it in the virtue and merit
                of Christ alone. Therefore he makes mention of faith in Christ. This neither
                repentance, nor love, nor hope have, for faith is carried more immediately
                and distinctly to it, by whose virtue we are justified” (Commentarii et
                annotationes in epistolam ... ad Romanos, Annot. 17 [1602], p. 177 on
                Rom. 3:22).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XX. Although the sacraments are external means and instruments
                applying (on the part of God) the promise of grace and justification, this
                does not hinder faith from being called the internal instrument and means
                on the part of man for receiving this benefit offered in the word and sealed
                by the sacraments.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXI. What justifies as an instrument does not forthwith justify as a
                work, although that instrument is a work. It is one thing for it to be a work
                and another to justify as a work. What justifies as a work ought to be the
                meritorious cause of justification, but what justifies as an instrument does
                not justify meritoriously, but only apprehensively and receptively; not by
                giving, but by receiving. Therefore the action of faith justifies us, but not as
                an action simply (as if it were our righteousness with God), but in relation
                to its object inasmuch as it receives Christ. As the extension of the beggar’s
                hand is indeed the act of the beggar prescribed by the rich man, still as an
                act it does not enrich the beggar, but insofar as in this way he applies the
                gift of the rich man to himself and makes it his own.

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXII. Although faith is called “the work of God” (Jn. 6:29), it does not
                follow that it justifies as a work. Although it is enjoined by God (and in this
                sense is called the work of God and is due from man that he may obtain
                life), it is not on this account due as the meritorious cause of that life, but
                only as a means and instrument receptive of the righteousness of Christ,
                which is the true cause of life. And thus it is so called by Christ imitatively
                (mimétikos) and by allusion to the Jewish sense, who sought life by the
                works of the law: “What must we do,” said they, “that we may work the
                works of God?” To this legal question Jesus answers, not legally, but
                evangelically (yet in a legal style, taking the legal phrase from the
                expression of the Jews and applying it to his discourse): “This is the work
                of God that ye believe”—intimating that no further work was necessary to
                acquire salvation, but that faith was substituted in the place of all works for
                the reception of it (as if he said, work earnestly, only believe—this is work,
                this is labor). Evidently as to a sick man seeking by what medicine he is
                about to be healed, if the physician answers, this is the medicine which I
                prescribe to you; keep quiet and confide in me—he does not wish to
                intimate that that rest and confidence are any remedies to cure him, but he
                means only this—there is no need of medicine. Thus the Scripture often
                ascribes the names of things (to which men attribute falsely a great efficacy
                and value) to those things which are truly efficacious and valuable; as the
                gospel is called law because what the law sought, the gospel gives; what the
                Jews vainly sought in the law is obtained by the gospel. Thus regeneration
                is called circumcision (Phil. 3:3); believers are called sons of Abraham;
                love and piety are called fasting (Is. 58:6, 7); and faith is called a work.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXIII. But we think it ought not to be anxiously inquired whether faith
                stands here in the relation of an instrument or also of a condition, as some
                think. Both may be ascribed to it, provided the condition is not understood
                as that in view of which God justifies man in the legal covenant. For in this
                sense, it cannot be called a condition, unless we agree with the Socinians
                and Remonstrants, who hold that faith or the act of believing is admitted by
                God by a gracious acceptation for a perfect righteousness (which we have
                just now refuted). Rather it is taken broadly for all that is required on our
                part to obtain this benefit—whether it has the relation of a cause properly so
                called or only instrumental. For thus as that condition has the relation
                (schesin) of an instrument, so the instrument has the relation of a condition


                on our part without which justification cannot be granted. Moreover
                concerning the manner in which faith concurs to justification and
                concerning its threefold act—dispository, justificatory and consolatory—see
                what was said in Topic XV, Question 12, Section 4.

                <em>Does faith alone justify? We affirm against the Romanists</em>.

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                I. This question also lies between us and the Romanists, who not only
                corrupt the true mode of the justification of faith by making the
                instrumental cause meritorious or at least dispositive, but by connecting
                with it the other virtues both as attendants and companions in this act.
                Hence arose the controversy concerning “faith alone justifying” (sole Fide
                Justificante), which as it is of no less importance than the preceding, so it is
                agitated with no less warmth of spirit.

            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                <b>Origin of the question.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                II. This question is not of recent birth. Even from the very beginning of the
                Christian religion, this was asserted by the false apostles or Judaizing
                Christians. They did not with full front attack the faith as the Pharisees, but
                on the side by a deadly mixture associating the law with the gospel, Moses
                with Christ and faith with works in the matter of justification, so that man
                should be justified not by faith alone, but at the same time by works also.
                Against them the apostle disputes in his epistles to the Galatians,
                Philippians and Colossians. This is urged by the Romanists of this day, who
                hold that with faith, fear, hope, love, penitence, the purpose of a new life
                concurs to justification. “If anyone shall say that the wicked are justified by
                faith alone, so as to understand that nothing else is required to cooperate for
                the obtainment of the grace of justification and is necessary from no part,
                that he should be prepared and disposed by a motion of his own will, let
                him be accursed” (Council of Trent, Session 6, Canon 9, Schroeder, p. 43).
                This is more fully set forth in chapters 5 and 6, where the mode and
                necessity of preparation for justification are treated (ibid., pp. 31-33).

                <b>Statement of the question.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                III. But that the state of the question may be the more easily understood, we
                must remark that a twofold trial can be entered into by God with man:
                either by the law (inasmuch as he is viewed as guilty of violating the law by
                sin and thus comes under the accusation and condemnation of the law); or
                by the gospel (inasmuch as he is accused by Satan of having violated the
                gospel covenant and so is supposed to be an unbeliever and impenitent or a
                hypocrite, who has not testified by works the faith he has professed with his
                mouth). Now to this twofold trial a twofold justification ought to answer;
                not in the Romish sense, but in a very different sense. The first is that by
                which man is absolved from the guilt of sin on account of the righteousness
                of Christ imputed to us and apprehended by faith; the other is that by which
                he is freed from the charge of unbelief and hypocrisy and declared to be a
                true believer and child of God; one who has fulfilled the gospel covenant (if
                not perfectly as to degree, still sincerely as to parts) and answered to the
                divine call by the exercise of faith and piety. The first is justification
                properly so called; the other is only a declaration of it. That is justification
                of cause a priori; this is justification of sign or of effect a posteriori,
                declaratively. In that, faith alone can have a place because it alone
                apprehends the righteousness of Christ, by whose merit we are freed from
                the condemnation of the law; in this, works also are required as the effects
                and signs of faith, by which its truth and sincerity are declared against the
                accusation of unbelief and hypocrisy. For as faith justifies a person, so
                works justify faith.

            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                IV. The question does not concern justification a posteriori and
                declaratively in the fatherly and gospel trial—whether faith alone without
                works concurs to it (for we confess that works come in here with faith; yea,
                that works only are properly regarded because it is concerned with the
                justification of faith, which can be gathered from no other source more
                certainly than by works as its effects and indubitable proofs). Rather the
                question concerns justification a priori, which frees us from the legal trial,
                which is concerned with the justification of the wicked and the perfect
                righteousness, which can be opposed to the curse of the law and acquire for
                us a right to life—whether works come into consideration here with faith
                (as the Romanists hold) or whether faith alone (as we maintain).

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                V. (2) The question is not whether faith alone justifies to the exclusion
                either of the grace of God or the righteousness of Christ or the word and
                sacraments (by which the blessing of justification is presented and sealed to
                us on the part of God), which we maintain are necessarily required here; but
                only to the exclusion of every other virtue and habit on our part. Hence the
                Romanists have no reason for accusing us of confusion (akatastasias) in
                this argument as if we ascribed justification at one time to the grace of God,
                at another to the blood of Christ and then again to faith. For all these as they
                are mutually subordinated in a different class of cause, consist with each
                other in the highest degree.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VI. (3) The question is not whether solitary faith (i.e., separated from the
                other virtues) justifies (which we grant could not easily be the case, since it
                is not even true and living faith); but whether it “alone” (sola) concurs to
                the act of justification (which we assert); as the eye alone sees, but not
                when torn out of the body. Thus the particle “alone” (sola) does not
                determine the subject, but the predicate (i.e., “faith only does not justify”
                [sola fides non justificat], but “faith justifies alone” [fides justificat sola]).
                The coexistence of love in him who is justified is not denied; but its
                coefficiency or cooperation in justification is denied. (4) The question is not
                whether the faith “which justifies” (quae justificat) works by love (for
                otherwise it would not be living but dead); rather the question is whether
                faith “by which it justifies’ (qua justificat) or in the act itself of
                justification, is to be considered under such a relation (schesei) (which we
                deny).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VII. Hence the question returns to this—Does faith justify, not as it is
                objectively the doctrine of salvation, but subjectively as it assents to that
                saving doctrine and applies it to itself; not as the promise to do something,
                but as we rest upon the promises in Christ as sufficient; alone (sola), not by
                reason of existence (i.e., solitary without faith and love), but in respect to
                function or efficiency; not by way of preparation with other virtues or of
                merit, but relatively after the manner of an instrument, apprehending the
                satisfaction of Christ and fiducially applying it. The Romanists deny; we
                assert.

                <b>Proof that faith alone justifies: (1) from Rom. 3:28.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                VIII. First, man is justified by faith without works; therefore by faith alone.
                The reason of the consequence is manifest because there are not more
                modes of justifying than these two—by faith and by works. Thus, one being
                removed, the other must not only necessarily be left, but also left alone.
                Otherwise the enumeration would not be legitimate. Now why would the
                apostle so often and so expressly institute an antithesis between faith and
                works in this matter, if works could concur with faith in any way to the act
                of justification? Would he not in this particular have occasioned believers to
                err by removing works absolutely and simply from it, if they contribute
                anything towards it? Let the various passages in which exclusives are
                employed be carefully examined and the thing will be clearer than the
                midday sun: “We conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds
                of the law” (Rom. 3:28); “By grace are ye saved, through faith; and that not
                of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works” (Eph. 2:8); and more
                clearly, “knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by
                the faith [ean mé dia pisteds] of Jesus Christ” (Gal. 2:16). Here it is certain
                that the particle (eimé) is adversative and exclusive (as often elsewhere, Mt.
                12:4; 24:36; Mk. 13:32; Jn. 17:12; Rev. 9:4; 21:27) from the force of the
                immediate opposition of faith and works, which mutually displace each
                other. Nor can the Romanists themselves deny this. Estius says the most
                learned interpreters follow this opinion (which Salmeron, Justiniani and
                others confirm). To no purpose, therefore, do others pretend that ean mé is
                here exceptive, with the meaning that a man is not justified by works,
                except as faith in Christ approaches to works. This is the very thing which
                Paul opposes against the false apostles, who maintained that not works
                alone could justify a man, but faith mingled with works (so that justification
                might be ascribed partly to faith and partly to works, which Paul frequently
                asserts is inconsistent [asystaton]—as Salmeron and Estius acknowledge).
                No better is the explanation of Cornelius a Lapide, who thinks that only the
                works of the law are excluded here, but not the works of hope, fear and
                love, which faith begets and produces, and which are under faith as
                daughters under a mother. We have seen above that all works are entirely
                excluded by Paul; not only the ceremonial, but also moral; not only those
                performed before grace, but also those performed from grace in the
                renewed.

                IX. Second, by that alone are we justified by which the righteousness of
                Christ is applied to us, who satisfied the law for us. Now this is done by
                faith alone; nor does it belong to love or to hope. Not to hope, which does
                not apprehend, but expects the thing promised. Not to love, which is
                concerned with the fulfillment of a command, not with the apprehension of
                a promise.

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                X. Third, we also are justified in the same way in which Abraham, the
                father of believers, was justified because what was written concerning him
                pertains not only to him, but to us also (Rom. 4:24). And yet Abraham was
                justified by faith alone: “Abraham believed in the Lord; and he counted it to
                him for righteousness” (Gen. 15:6), not of debt, on account of works
                preceding faith or subsequent to it, but of grace so that he might not have
                wherein to glory. For if “Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof
                to glory; but not before God” (Rom. 4:2), to wit, he has no matter for
                glorying (kauchéma) (which is to be drawn from the preceding verses). The
                argument is from the destruction of the consequent to the destruction of the
                antecedent. If Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory in
                himself as if he had contributed something of his own to which a reward
                was due in the judgment of God. And yet he hath not whereof he can glory
                in himself before God. Therefore he was not justified by works. Nor can it
                be said here that works preceding faith are excluded; not those done from
                faith on account of which he could have had glory before God, as he is
                called a friend of God. For this is to gainsay openly and to contradict Paul
                to his face, who expressly testifies that Abraham had not whereof to glory
                before God. For it is gratuitously and most falsely supposed that only works
                antecedent to faith are excluded. But he excludes all works entirely without
                distinction and indeed the works of Abraham not only as an unbeliever, but
                also a believer (since this was said of him when he was already a believer
                and renewed). Again, he excludes all debt (v. 4); therefore, he also excludes


                every work. Finally, if he had not wished to exclude works done from faith,
                he ought not to have opposed “one working” to “one believing” simply, but
                one working without faith to one working from faith (which, however, he
                nowhere does).

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                XI. Fourth, we are justified gratuitously and by the grace of God; therefore
                by faith alone because faith alone can consist with grace (Rom. 3:24, 25).
                Nor is Bellarmine to be listened to, who wishes the particle “freely” not to
                exclude merits absolutely, but proper merits (or those which are from us,
                not from God). For merits arising from prevenient grace (which are called
                by them merits of congruity) are not opposed to grace, unless we wish grace
                to contend with grace. Nor does it follow hence that a man who is justified
                freely is justified by faith alone because as gratuitous justification does not
                exclude faith (because it is by grace), so neither ought it to exclude
                repentance and love, which are from grace. For as we have already
                remarked, the particle “freely” excludes entirely all merits; for whatever is
                freely given, that is acquired by no merit. Nor can the grace which is undue
                subsist with merit, which makes the pay due: “If by grace, then it is no more
                of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is
                no more grace: otherwise work is no more work” (Rom. 11:6). Now
                although faith is not excluded in justification, it is not on that account
                excluded from grace (for thus works done from grace would not have to be
                excluded). But because it alone above other virtues has a power receptive of
                and applicatory to the righteousness of Christ (and so supposes man to be a
                sinner and destitute of all righteousness), it excludes all merit.

                <b>5. From Rom. 1:17.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XII. Fifth, “the righteousness of God is said to be revealed from faith to
                faith; as it is written, The just shall live by faith’ (Rom. 1:17). Here the
                apostle intends to prove that the gospel is the power of God (i.e., the sole
                most efficacious instrument for salvation) in opposition to the weakness of
                the law (Rom. 8:3; Heb. 7:19) because in it is the righteousness of God—
                not formally and subjectively (which is in God), but effectively (which is


                given to us by God); not inherent, because it is said to be manifested
                without the law by faith (Rom. 3:21), and to be imputed without works
                (Rom. 4:6), but imputed (which is opposed to man’s righteousness and his
                own works, Rom. 10:3, 4; Phil. 3:9). Thus the most perfect righteousness of
                Christ (which alone can bear the scrutiny of the divine trial as being divine
                and infinite, which is the cause and foundation of life and salvation) is
                revealed from faith to faith (i.e., is announced by the gospel, so as to be
                apprehended by faith alone because nothing besides faith can concur in the
                reception of it). Hence he does not say “from faith to works,” but “from
                faith to faith” so that to faith alone this office is wholly ascribed. That Paul
                may prove this doctrine to be neither absurd nor new, he confirms it by the
                prophecy of Habakkuk where he says, “The just shall live by his faith”
                (2:4). Now although this prophecy refers also to a temporal blessing (viz.,
                deliverance from the Babylonian captivity, which they would obtain by the
                intervention of faith in the divine promise; hence it is referred to by Paul in
                Heb. 10:38 to support believers in afflictions), still because the declaration
                of the prophet is general concerning faith in the promises of God, it is
                rightly applied specially to faith in Christ; and on this account the more—
                that the prophets and pious Jews regarded the promise of the Messiah as the
                foundation of all promises. Hence Paul (as best knowing the mind of the
                Holy Spirit) refers it (in Gal. 3:11 and in this place) to justification in order
                to teach that by faith alone man obtains the righteousness which brings
                eternal life to him. “The just shall live by faith,” whether the “by faith” (to
                ek pisteos) be referred to the just with this meaning—he who by faith is just
                —or to life, meaning—the just lives by faith. They amount to the same
                thing and each is true—that both he who by faith is just, obtains salvation;
                and again he who is just, obtains salvation by faith. In vain, therefore, is it
                said that Paul understands a living faith and that it alone is not such, but
                with works. Although living faith is never alone in the person who is
                justified, still it is alone in the very act of justification—to the production of
                which the other virtues can contribute nothing, faith alone claiming this
                privilege for itself (as we have said before). No better do others wish that
                life to be referred to the works by which faith proves itself alive. The design
                of the prophet is to teach that faith alone is the means of obtaining
                salvation, both temporal and spiritual. And Paul says that this righteousness
                by faith is manifested without the law; which cannot be said of the


                righteousness of works, but only of the righteousness of faith; which is said
                of the man believing, not of one working.

                XIII. It is one thing for love and works to be required in the person who is
                justified (which we grant); another in the act itself or causality of
                justification (which we deny). If works are required as concomitants of
                faith, they are not on that account determined to be causes of justification
                with faith or to do the very thing which faith does in this matter.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XIV. Although the whole force of justifying on the part of man is in faith
                as to the act of apprehension (so that other virtues contribute nothing to it
                with faith), it does not follow that faith can justify when they are absent as
                well as when they are present—yea, even when the opposite vices are
                present. It is one thing to justify without virtues (i.e., separated from them
                —which we deny); another for it to justify alone, but not separated from
                them. As it does not follow, the hand alone writes and the eye alone sees—
                therefore as much when tom from the head and the other members as in the
                body; the sole force of respiration is in the lungs—therefore the lungs can
                respire torn out from the liver and other viscera as well as when connected
                with them (which everyone sees to be absurd). There are hundreds of things
                of this kind which have a certain proper efficacy and effect, which still,
                when separated from their adjuncts, lose all their power. Natural potencies
                are connected as to existence, but disjoined as to operation. Light and heat
                in the sun are most closely connected together, but still the light alone
                illuminates, the heat alone warms. Therefore, although the other virtues do
                not justify with faith, still faith cannot justify in their absence, much less the
                opposite vices being present. For faith cannot be true except in connection
                with the virtues (which if they do not contribute to justification, still
                contribute to the existence and life of faith, which the presence of vices
                would destroy).

                XV. It is one thing for the love of the sinner to be the cause of the
                remission of sins a priori; another to be the effect and proof a posteriori.
                The latter is affirmed in Lk. 7:47, not the former. We gather this: (1) from
                the scope of the parable, which is to demonstrate which of two debtors,
                whose debt the creditor had cancelled, ought to love the creditor most (to


                wit, in token of gratitude); (2) from the answer of Peter, “I suppose that he,
                to whom he forgave most,” where love is placed as following, not as going
                before remission; (3) from the end, where a small remission is put as the
                cause of a small degree of love, “To whom little is forgiven, the same loveth
                little” (v. 47); (4) from v. 50, where salvation is ascribed to the faith, not to
                the love, of this woman, “Thy faith hath saved thee.” Nor does the particle
                hoti stand in the way because (as is known) it is so often only ratiocinative,
                not causal—the cause of the consequent, not of the consequence, so as to
                intimate that thence is known and gathered that many sins were forgiven her
                because she loved much.

            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XVI. When John says, “We know that we have passed from death unto
                life, because we love the brethren” (1 Jn. 3:14), he teaches that love is a
                proof and sign of our justification from which we know that we have passed
                from death unto life. For he who is in love is in God (who is love) and he
                who is in God, cannot be in death. But he does not mean that love is the
                cause of that translation (which is elsewhere ascribed to faith, Jn. 5:24).
                Hence Lorinus and Gagnaeus on this passage well remark that “the causal
                article denotes the cause, not of the thing but of the knowledge.” On this
                account even the more, that since God loved us first (not we God, 1 Jn.
                4:10), the justification by which God loved us ought to precede our love.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XVII. Christ promises “the love of the Father” to those who love him
                (Jn. 14:23), not affectively and as to its beginning (as if the love of the
                Father then begins, since he loved us before, 1 Jn. 4:10), but effectively and
                as to continuance and increase because he will prove his love by
                distinguished blessings and console them by a new manifestation of
                himself. But this has nothing to do with justification because to love Christ
                and to keep his commands belongs to a man already constituted in grace
                and justified.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XVIII. The “fear of the Lord” (to wit, filial and reverential) is a
                consequence of justification, not a previous disposition to it. It is not called
                “the beginning of wisdom” (Ps. 111:10) as if it initially disposes to wisdom,
                but because it is its head and perfection, as it is said to be in Ecc. 12:13,
                which begins from it (Prov. 9:10) and ends in it. If it is said apotheisthai
                hamartémata (Sir. 1:21), this ought not to be understood of a positive
                expulsion (as if it introduced either meritoriously or dispositively remission


                of sins), but of a negative expulsion because he who fears God does not
                indulge in sins, nor give ear to their solicitations.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XIX. It is one thing for hope to concur to salvation; another for it to
                concur to justification. The former is asserted in Rom. 5:5 and 8:24 when
                hope is said not to make us ashamed; yea, also to save us. For the
                expectation of salvation is founded upon a hope so certain to be fulfilled in
                its own time, as if we already possessed salvation itself. But not the latter
                because the object of hope is not the remission of sins, but the fulfillment of
                the promised salvation.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XX. Although remission of sins is promised to repentance (because it
                ought to accompany faith and be in him who is justified as a certain
                condition requisite from him because God cannot pardon sin to an
                impenitent), it does not follow that it can be said to justify with faith
                because it contributes nothing (neither meritoriously, nor instrumentally) to
                the act of justification.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXI. It is one thing for eternal life and the heavenly inheritance to be
                referred to works as meritorious or instrumental causes of our justification;
                another as effects of faith and qualities and dispositions requisite in the
                subject to be glorified. As it is one thing to seek “why” (quare) life is given
                to believers; another “upon what” (quibus) or “upon what qualities”
                (qualibus) it depends. The former we deny because our works of whatever
                kind cannot merit life, nor have they the relation of an instrument for
                apprehending it. But the latter we grant. Nor is anything different gathered
                from Mt. 25:34, 35, where works are not adduced by the Judge as “the
                foundations of the right” which they obtain to eternal life. The proper cause
                of that right is indicated in the preceding verses, when they are called “ye
                blessed of my Father,” who ought “to inherit (kléronomein) the kingdom”
                (i.e., possess it by a title of inheritance). Rather they are adduced as
                arguments and testimonies indubitable a posteriori, from which the truth of
                their faith could be proved, and the equity of the sentence pronounced (as
                the particle gar is not causal [aitiologike], but only ratiocinative).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXII. Since Paul and James were inspired by the same Spirit, they
                cannot be said to oppose each other on the doctrine of justification, so that
                one should ascribe justification to faith alone and the other to works also.
                The reconciliation is not difficult, if the design of each be considered and
                the natures of faith and of justification (concerning which both treat) be


                attended. Paul disputes against the Pharisees, who urged the merits of
                works; James disputes against the Libertines and Epicureans, who, content
                with a profession of faith alone, denied not only the merits of works, but
                also their necessity. Against the former, Paul rightly urges faith alone for
                justification. Against the latter, James properly commends the necessity of
                works for the confirmation of justification. Paul speaks of a living and
                efficacious faith; James of an idle and dead faith which cannot be
                demonstrated by works (2:18); Paul of justification a priori and
                constitutively; James of the same a posteriori and declaratively; Paul
                properly constitutes the former in faith alone; James rightly places the latter
                in works, by which the reality of our faith and justification is declared not
                only before men, but also before God. Therefore, when faith is said “to
                have wrought with works in Abraham, and by works to have been made
                perfect” (v. 22), this ought to be understood in relation to the efficacy of
                faith, which exerted itself by works and by which also it was consummated
                and made perfect. It ought not to be understood essentially, for this it has by
                its own nature (but declaratively) because it is proven to be perfect and
                sincere; just as “the power of God” is said to be “made perfect in our
                weakness” (2 Cor. 12:9), i.e., known and declared to be perfect. See what
                else belongs to this point in our “Disputatio ... De Concordia Pauli et
                Jacobi,” Opera (1848), 4:731-52.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXIII. It is one thing for works to be connected with faith in the person
                of the justified; another, however, in the matter of justification. The former
                we acknowledge and will afterwards prove, when we discuss the necessity
                of good works; but the latter we deny with Paul—nay, we maintain that
                they are wholly incompatible (asystata) with faith.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XXIV. Augustine says rightly, “Good works do not precede the one to be
                justified, but follow the one justified” (Faith and Works 14 [FC 27:247; PL
                40.211]). A person is justified freely by faith without works (Rom. 3:24);
                yea, justification is of the wicked (Rom. 4:5; 5:6). No good works can be
                granted which precede his justification as causes, but only which follow as
                the effects and fruits springing from the faith of remission (Lk. 7:47; 1 Tim.
                1:5). If calling (by which faith and holiness are infused) is prior to
                justification, it does not follow that holiness no less than faith is prior to it
                because holiness is indeed infused, but in its own order and by faith (Acts
                15:9). Faith however concurs to justification before it does to sanctification.


                If remission is sometimes promised to repentance, this is indeed promised
                to it as a condition not antecedent or concomitant by reason of contrition,
                but only consequent as to new obedience.

            <p>
                NINTH QUESTION: THE TIME OF JUSTIFICATION

                <br>
                <em>Was justification made from eternity or is it made in time? Is it an undivided
                    act taking place at one and the same time?</em>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                I. The opinions of theologians about this question vary. Some maintain
                that it is an immanent act in God which was performed from eternity; others
                that it is transient, terminating in us and which takes place only in time and
                in this life. And there are some who hold that it is postponed to the last and
                decretory day, in which all must stand before the solemn and public tribunal
                of Christ to hear the sentence of absolution or of condemnation from his
                lips. Now although there is an agreement on both sides in the substance of
                the thing and a disagreement only in the mode of the thing, still it is of no
                little importance to the accurate knowledge of the subject to know what is
                the true opinion to be held here.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                II. The first opinion is that of those who hold that justification preceded
                our birth and was made in eternity because they conceive it to be an
                immanent and internal act in God. However, as nothing new can happen to
                God in time, they think it was made in him from eternity and is ascribed to
                faith only as to cognizance and sense because it leads us into the knowledge
                of him and makes us certain of it.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>Our justification is not made from eternity.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                III. But although we do not deny that our justification was decreed even
                from eternity (as nothing takes place in time which was not constituted by
                him from eternity), still we do not think (speaking accurately) justification
                itself can be called eternal. The decree of justification is one thing;
                justification itself another—as the will to save and sanctify is one thing;
                salvation and sanctification itself another. The will or decree to justify
                certain persons is indeed eternal and precedes faith itself, but actual
                justification takes place in time and follows faith.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                IV. Second, Paul expressly confirms this in the chain of salvation,
                enumerating in order the benefits flowing to the elect from the eternal love
                of God where he puts calling before justification as something antecedent:
                “Whom he called, them he justified” (Rom. 8:30). Nor have those various
                passages a different meaning in which we are said to be justified through
                and by faith, than that faith is a something prerequisite to justification. This
                could not be said if justification was done from eternity. For it is weak and
                foreign to the meaning of Paul to refer these things to the sense of
                justification only.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                V. Third, the nature of the thing itself proves this. For since justification
                or remission of sins necessarily involves a deliverance from the obligation
                to punishment which sins deserved and no one can obtain it without faith
                and repentance, it is evident that such a justification could not have been
                made from eternity, but only in time—when the man actually believes and
                repents. Otherwise it would follow that he who is justified and consequently
                has passed from death unto life and become a child of God and an heir of
                eternal life, still remains in death and is a child of wrath. He who is not yet
                converted and lies in sin, remains in death (1 Jn. 3:14) and is of the Devil (1
                Jn. 3:8) and in a state of condemnation (Gal. 5:21).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VI. Finally, since justification is a blessing of God, while a blessing
                cannot pass to us and be actually bestowed upon us, except in time, it is
                clear that it is not to be conceived of after the manner of an immanent and
                internal act in God, but after the manner of a transient act arising from God
                and passing over and terminating upon the creature (not that it may
                subjectively inhere in him, as the Romanists falsely hold because this
                pertains to sanctification; but that it may adhere to him and the creature has
                an objective relation to it, while the absolving sentence is intimated to him
                by the Holy Spirit). If grace is said to have been given to us in Christ before
                the world began by reason of “destination” (2 Tim. 1:9) because from
                eternity God decreed to give it to us in time, it does not follow that it can be
                said to have been really bestowed because the decree indeed causes us to
                obtain in time a right to life certainly and infallibly, but not that we can say
                we already obtained it actually. It causes that we should be justified, but not
                to be already justified.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>It does not take place only at the last day.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VII. But as justification cannot be conceived to have taken place from
                eternity before the ages, so neither ought it to be thrown forward to the
                consummation of the world as others hold—as if God only then exercises
                properly the act of a Judge, both in the pardon of believers and in the
                condemnation of the wicked. For thus the declaration of justification is
                falsely confounded with justification itself. For although we are told the
                heavenly Judge will then sit on his throne of glory to exercise the last
                solemn act of judgment (as much in grace as in justice, in the sight of
                heaven and earth), this does not prevent that judgment from commencing in
                the present life. Nay, this must necessarily be supposed, since that final
                judgment is nothing else than a public and solemn manifestation of
                preceding judgments. And as Scripture everywhere sets before us the
                examples of God’s judgments, public as well as private over the wicked and
                rebellious (such as the flood, the destruction of Sodom, the overthrow of the
                Egyptians and the like), to refer these to mere chastisements of God,
                tending towards the improvement and salvation of those upon whom they
                were sent, is to contradict the whole tenor of Scripture and rashly to
                confound the medicinal chastisements of believers (which are sent upon
                them for instruction [paideian] by God as a merciful Father) with the
                punishments of the wicked (which are inflicted by God as an angry Judge,
                to punish [timorian] and avenge himself of their sins)—which has thus far
                been unheard-of in theological schools. So that he is evidently a stranger to
                the Scriptures who does not know that God is often set forth as justifying
                believers in this life; as is evident from the examples of Abraham (Gen.
                15:6), of David (Ps. 32:1, 2, 5; Rom. 4:6, 7), of the sinful woman (Lk.
                7:48), of the publican (Lk. 18:14) and of all believers (Rom. 5:1). Not to
                say now that that opinion is hurtful to the consolation of believers, which
                springs from no other source more certainly than from a sense of the grace
                of God and his justification. For how else could they have the confidence in
                which they glory and exult on account of their justification and enjoy
                unspeakable (aneklaléto) peace and joy?
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>But it takes place in this life in effectual calling.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VIII. This opinion then being dismissed, we embrace the middle one, which
                makes justification to take place in this life in the moment of effectual
                calling, by which the sinner is transferred from a state of sin to a state of
                grace and is united to Christ, his head, by faith. For hence it is that the
                righteousness of Christ is imputed to him by God, by whose merit
                apprehended by faith he is absolved from his sins and obtains a right to life.
                This absolving sentence, the Spirit pronounces in his heart when he says,
                “Be of good courage, son, thy sins are pardoned.”
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                IX. Further, this justification can be regarded in different ways: (1)
                actively on the part of God intimating by the Spirit the absolving sentence
                in the heart of the believer and judicially from the throne of grace (Heb.
                4:16), pronouncing it upon us; and passively on our part, inasmuch as we
                admit and receive that absolving sentence delivered in the court of
                conscience by the Holy Spirit with faith, joy and the protestation of
                gratitude.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                X. Second, universally as to state, when we are first received into union
                with Christ and his righteousness is imputed to us by God and received by
                faith. For then in passing from a state of sin into a state of grace, the guilt of
                all preceding sins is actually taken away and a remedy given to us in the
                righteousness of Christ against future sins. And specially as to particular
                acts of sin into which we afterwards fall, which also need a particular
                absolution. As often as it is intimated to us in the court of conscience, so
                often the believer is by repentance turned again to God and by faith applies
                to himself Christ’s righteousness. In this sense, we are commanded to seek
                remission of sins every day; not only with regard to the sense, but also with
                regard to the thing itself because sins cannot be forgiven unless committed
                (as we remarked before).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XI. Third, justification can be viewed in a twofold aspect (schesei):
                either as to the “eternal destination” in the decree, in which sense grace is
                said “to have been given to us in Christ before the world began” (2 Tim.
                1:9) and God is said to have “predestinated us unto the adoption” (Eph.
                1:5); or as to its execution in time which again can be regarded on the one
                hand as to obtainment, which was made by the death of Christ on the cross
                (referred to in Rom. 5:9, 10: “We were justified and reconciled to God by
                the blood of Christ”; and “Christ reconciled all things to God through the
                blood of the cross,” Col. 1:20). Elsewhere Christ is said to “have been


                raised again for our justification” (Rom. 4:25) because as in him dead, we
                are dead, so in him raised and justified, we are justified (i.e., we have a sure
                and indubitable pledge and foundation of our justification because for no
                other cause was he justified by the Spirit [1 Tim. 3:16] except that we might
                be justified in him). Nor in a different sense does Paul say, “God was in
                Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses
                unto them” (2 Cor. 5:19); to wit, inasmuch as in Christ dying, the Father
                had the foundation of reconciliation by which he was made more propitious
                to the world of the elect, collected as well from the Jews as from the
                Gentiles, so that he does not impute to them their sins (which he imputed to
                Christ), but by absolving them from their sins, he may justify them also in
                him. On the other hand it may be viewed as to application, which is made in
                the heart by an intimation of the absolving sentence (referred to in Mt. 9:2).
                Or it may be viewed in general as to the state of the believer when he is first
                called; or in particular as to the act when he obtains the pardon of particular
                sins; or as to the sense and certainty of it, arising in us from a reflex act of
                faith (called consolatory); or finally, as to its declaration, which should be
                made immediately after death (Heb. 9:27) and publicly on the last day
                (which is not so much justification, as a solemn declaration of the
                justification once made and an adjudication of the reward, in accordance
                with the preceding justification).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XII. Hence it is evident in what sense justification can be called an
                undivided act; not on our part and with respect to the sense of it (which is
                produced by various and repeated acts according as this sense can be
                interrupted; or increased or diminished, by reason of interfering sins); but
                on the part of God, not only by reason of his decree (by which our
                justification was decreed) and by reason of his merit (by which he obtained
                it), but also by reason of the application when the absolving sentence is
                intimated to us. This is done by a unique act, not by many successive acts,
                just as inherent righteousness is wont to be infused into us (although this act
                is often applied to particular everyday sins).

            </p>
            TENTH QUESTION
            <br>

            <em>The unity, perfection and certainty of justification</em>.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                I. Unity, perfection and certainty are the three principal adjuncts of
                justification concerning which disputes exist. Of these we must speak
                briefly because we have elsewhere discussed them partially.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>The unity or equality of justification among
                    believers.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                II. Unity can be regarded in two ways: either relative to believers among
                themselves; or absolutely with respect to him who is justified. In the former
                sense, it is said to be “one in species” or “equal in all believers” of all times
                and places because God justifies all believers in the same manner (viz., by
                his grace and the merit of Christ through faith). “Seeing it is one God,” says
                the apostle, “which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the
                uncircumcision through faith” (Rom. 3:30), i.e., who justifies the Jews as
                well as the Gentiles by faith. For since all are liable to sin and
                condemnation (v. 19), and destitute of the glory of God (v. 23), there is no
                other method of justification than by faith. The apostle proves this fully in
                the same place and confirms it by the examples of David and of Abraham
                (Rom. 4); as also of all the saints of the Old Testament mentioned in Heb.
                11, who by faith are said to have pleased God (v. 6), to have obtained
                witness that they were righteous (v. 4) and to have become heirs of the
                righteousness which is by faith (v. 7). Nor either in the Old or New
                Testament can there be found any dissimilar example of a person justified in
                another way. Hence Peter says, “To him give all the prophets witness, that
                through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of
                sins” (Acts 10:43). Through the grace of Christ, we shall be saved, even as
                they (Acts 15:11). Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever (Heb.
                13:8); he is the Way, and the Truth and the Life; no one can come to the
                Father except by him (Jn. 14:6).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                III. For the objections brought forward here by the Socinians against the
                identity of the justification of the believers of the Old and New Testaments,
                see Topic XII, Question 5 concerning the unity of the covenant of grace
                (where they are discussed).
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                IV. Now although the same benefit as to substance was common to the
                believers of the Old Testament no less than to those of the New (as they had


                true remission of sins in and on account of Christ), still there was a multiple
                difference as to degree and sense. It is far more clearly revealed and more
                fully and efficaciously felt by us now; as was proved in the same place and
                in Question 12.

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                <b>The numerical unity of the same in particular
                    believers.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                V. Second, the same justification is one numerically in individuals. It is not
                promoted successively after the manner of sanctification by repeated acts,
                but is finished in one judicial act and brings to the believer the remission of
                all sins. Hence the Romanists (from their fictitious hypothesis concerning
                physical justification by an infusion of righteousness) falsely make it
                twofold: the first, that by which a man from being unjust is made just by an
                infusion of righteousness; the second, that by which from being just he is
                made more just by the increase of righteousness. The foundation having
                been once overturned (as was done above), whatever is built upon it falls.
                Nor does the passage in Rev. 22:11 favor this error because (as we have
                already said), it does not treat of the infusion of righteousness, but either of
                the sense and declaration of righteousness once gained (which is retained by
                the exercise of righteousness) or of its special application to everyday sins.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VI. The distinction between active and passive justification points out
                indeed the truth of the terms “from which” and “to which” (viz., of God
                who justifies and of man who is justified), but does not change the degree
                or species. For by the same sentence by which God justifies us (while he
                intimates it to the conscience), we are also passively justified when it is
                received by us through faith.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                VII. The blessing of justification and the right to it differ from the
                feeling and the knowledge of it. There is no cutting off or renewal of the
                former because it is a gift without repentance (ametameléton). The latter,
                however, may be interrupted and restored according to the various increases
                and decreases of sanctification. And although that sense may be interrupted
                in grievous sins and be recovered by various and repeated acts, still the
                blessing of justification remains always in him the same.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                VIII. Although our justification will be fully declared on the last day
                (our good works also being brought forward as the sign and proof of its
                truth, Mt. 25:3440), still falsely would anyone maintain from this a
                twofold gospel justification—one from faith in this life (which is the first);
                the other (and second) from works on the day of judgment (as some hold,
                agreeing too much with Romanists on this point). The sentence to be
                pronounced by the supreme Judge will not be so much a new justification,
                as the solemn and public declaration of a sentence once passed and its
                execution by the assignment of the life promised with respect to an innocent
                person from the preceding justification. Thus it is nothing else than an
                adjudicatory sentence of the possession of the kingdom of heaven from the
                right given before through justification. And if works are then brought
                forward, they are not adduced as the foundation of a new justification to be
                obtained then, but as signs, marks and effects of our true faith and of our
                justification solely by it.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                IX. It is one thing to apply justification often and to extend it to sins of
                daily occurrence (in which sense we are commanded to seek remission of
                sins every day); another to repeat and renew justification often. The former
                we grant, but not the latter. Nor is there need that a new justification should
                take place as often as the believer falls into a new sin. It is sufficient that the
                justification once made (which if not formally, virtually and generically
                contains the remission of all sins) be applied and extended specifically and
                determinatively to this or that sin by an intimation of the Holy Spirit and the
                apprehension of faith.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                X. Although remission of sins ought to be applied often to daily sins, yet
                falsely would anyone thence gather that sins once discharged revive and
                return again by subsequent sins (as some of the Romanists hold), since it is
                an unchangeable (ametameléton) gift of God. Nor does the parable of that
                ungrateful servant (who, after a greater amount had been yielded to him by
                his master, wished to deal cruelly with his fellow servant who owed him far
                less and who on that account was delivered to the tormentors till he should
                pay all that was due unto him [which is recorded in Mt. 18:23-—35]) prove
                this. It pertains to nothing else than to show that the remission of sins
                proposed conditionally does not belong to him in whom the condition is
                lacking. The design of the parable (which is to be regarded here simply) is
                no other than to teach that the mercy of God is not exercised towards the


                unmerciful; nor are sins pardoned by God, except to those who forgive the
                offenses of others. To show this the more efficaciously, the master is
                opposed here to his servant, an immense sum to a minute and the highest
                clemency to extreme inhumanity.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>2. Perfection.</b>
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                XI. (2) Perfection belongs to justification, according to which it is so full
                and absolute intensively (both with respect to evils taken away and
                blessings acquired) that it is free as to itself from increase and decrease. Nor
                does it admit of more and less, although as to the apprehension and sense of
                it our faith advances so gradually as to have even its progressions and
                defects. If the faith by which we are justified is active and remitted, it does
                not follow that justification itself is equally intermittent because it does not
                justify by itself and properly, but only instrumentally and relatively; as the
                beholding of the brazen serpent did not cease equally to heal, although
                some looked at it more intently and strongly than others.
            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>

                <b>3. Certainty.</b>

            </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>
                XII. (3) Its certainty is twofold: one of the object in itself by the
                immutability and perseverance by which God never recalls the pardon once
                given (on account of the immutability of his grace, justice and promise
                confirmed by an oath, Heb. 6:17, 18). For the gifts of God bestowed upon
                the elect and the calling according to his purpose (kata prothesin) are
                without repentance (ametameléta, Rom. 11:29). Hence God _ never
                condemns and disinherits those whom he has once justified and made heirs.
                The other is the certainty of the subject, which refers to the sense of
                justification. Although it is possible from the nature of faith (yea, even
                necessary to bring peace and consolation to our souls), still it is not always
                in the same degree—but more perfect or imperfect according to the
                proportion of faith, so that there never was a believer (not even excepting
                Abraham [Gen. 17:17], or David [Ps. 42:5, 11]) who did not have to
                struggle with doubts concerning grace. How each of these certainties belong
                to justification has already been shown fully, when we discussed the
                perseverance and certainty of faith; cf. Topic XV, Questions 16 and 17.
