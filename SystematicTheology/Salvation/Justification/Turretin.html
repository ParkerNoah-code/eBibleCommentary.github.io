            16.2 <em>Is the impulsive and meritorious cause (on account of which man is justified in the judgment of God) inherent righteousness infused into us or good works ? We deny against the Romanists</em>
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            I. Since it is evident from the preceding question that the word “justification” is forensic and is taken judicially here because it relates to the manner in which sinful man can stand before the bar of God and obtain the pardon of sin with a right to life, we must inquire before all things what is the foundation of this justification or what is the true and proper meritorious cause in view of which he is absolved by God from sin and adjudged to life. Concerning this we must first treat negatively (<em>kat’ arsin</em>) according to the Pauline method in order that we may see in what it does not consist; second, we must treat affirmatively (<em>kata thesin</em>) to see in what it does consist.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            III. This being established, the question does not concern legal justification. For we confess that in it inherent righteousness is _ its meritorious cause, nor can it be obtained except by the perfect obedience of man. But because the law has now become weak by sin, this method of justification is impossible (<em>ek ton adynaton</em>). Thus we treat of the evangelical justification proposed to us in the covenant of grace, which we deny to be founded in inherent righteousness.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            IX. That inherent righteousness cannot be the meritorious cause of our justification, we prove: (1) because no one is justified by an imperfect righteousness, since the judgment of God is according to truth and in it there is no room for a gracious acceptation; nor can deception consist with his law and justice. But inherent righteousness is not perfect, nor actual, nor habitual. Not actual because in many things we all offend (Jam. 3:2) and there is no one that sinneth not (1 K. 8:46), which Bellarmine himself does not deny (“De Justificatione,” 2.16 Opera [1858], 4:530—32). Not habitual because the perfection and imperfection of an act depend upon the perfection or imperfection of the habit and our regeneration is always imperfect here (1 Cor. 13:12; Gal. 5:17). Nor ought it to be objected “that this absolute perfection was required under the law, but is not required under the gospel.” The relaxation made under the gospel does not extend so far that an imperfect righteousness can be accepted for a_ perfect righteousness; for God cannot be satisfied except by a perfect righteousness. Rather it consists in this—that the vicarious and the alien righteousness of a surety is admitted for our own. Nor ought it to be objected “that righteousness is properly said to be perfect because it belongs to the works of God, which must be perfect because the work of the Rock is perfect” (Dt. 32:4). For the works which God does immediately by himself (which are rightly called perfect absolutely and simply) and the mediate works (which are performed by the intervention of creatures—such as the work of regeneration—which are not at once perfect because God operating according to our capacity promotes and perfects them little by little) differ.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            X. Second, our justification takes place without works; therefore also without inherent righteousness, which consists wholly in works or in habits from which works spring. The passages are obvious. Scarcely anything has been said more often and asserted more constantly; nothing certainly more fully argued: “By the deeds of the law, there shall no flesh be justified” (Rom. 3:20); “We conclude, that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law” (v. 28). This the apostle confirms in Rom. 4:6 and Gal. 2:16 and in many other places. Nor should it be replied here that all works are not absolutely excluded, but certain ones only (to wit, ceremonial); or if moral works are excluded, those only are meant which precede faith and grace and which are done by the strength of free will, not those which are done from faith and grace. Since the apostle absolutely and simply excludes all works without any exception, it does not become us to limit what he does not limit. The thing itself proves this also for he antithetically opposes faith to works in this matter. Hence it appears that all works entirely of whatsoever kind and not some particular ones are excluded. Otherwise he could not have simply opposed “one working” and “one believing,” “to do” and “to believe,” but a certain kind of working to other kinds.

            XVII. Seventh, remission of sin requires the removal of guilt by the payment of the ransom (<em>lytrou</em>) due. And yet inherent righteousness can neither remove the offense to God or the guilt springing from it, nor compensate for the injury to the divine majesty. For besides the fact that it looks to the future (that man may perform his duty), not to the past (that he may compensate for the defect of duty by giving a satisfaction), it is impossible by a quality of finite virtue and worth for an offense of infinite indignity to be blotted out and compensated for.

          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            XVIII. Eight, we cannot omit here the remarkable testimonies of two cardinals, who, overcome by the power of the truth, agree with us. The first is Cardinal Contarini, who thus expresses himself: “Since we reach a twofold righteousness by faith, a righteousness inherent in us, and the love and grace by which we are made partakers of the divine nature; and the righteousness of Christ given and imputed to us, since we are planted in Christ and put on Christ: it remains to inquire, on which of these we ought to rest, and to think ourselves justified before God (i.e., reckoned holy and righteous). I truly think it to be said piously and religiously that we ought to rest, I say rest as upon a stable thing, which can certainly sustain us, upon the righteousness of Christ bestowed upon us, and not upon the holiness and grace inherent in us. For this our righteousness is inchoate and imperfect which cannot keep us from offending and from constantly sinning in many things. Therefore we cannot in the sight of God on account of this our righteousness be esteemed righteous and good, as it becomes the sons of God to be good and holy. But the righteousness of Christ given to us is a true and perfect righteousness. It is altogether pleasing in the sight of God. In it there is nothing that offends him; that does not in the highest degree please him. We must therefore rest upon this alone (sure and stable) and on account of it alone we must believe that we are justified before God, that is, considered righteous and called righteous” (“De Justificatione,” <em>Casparis Contareni Cardinalis Opera</em> [1571], p. 592). From him Bellarmine does not differ much, who, after exerting all his strength in a defense of human merit, pressed by the consciousness of the truth, at length is brought to say “that on account of the uncertainty of personal righteousness, and the danger of vain glory, it is the safest to place our entire confidence in the mercy and kindness of God alone” (“De Justificatione,” 5.7 <em>Opera</em> [1858], 4:615). To this proposition answers this clause of his will: “And I pray him to admit me among his saints and elect, not as an estimator of merit, but as a bestower of pardon.”
