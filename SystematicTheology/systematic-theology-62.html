        <p>A. ESCHATOLOGY IN PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE QUESTION OF ESCHATOLOGY A NATURAL ONE. A doctrine of the last
          things is not something that is peculiar to the Christian religion.
          Wherever people have seriously reflected on human life, whether in the
          individual or in the race, they have not merely asked, whence did it
          spring, and how did it come to be what it is, but also, whither is it
          bound? They raised the question, What is the end or final destiny of
          the individual; and what is the goal towards which the human race is
          moving? Does man perish at death, or does he enter upon another state
          of existence, either of bliss or of woe? Will the generations of men
          come and go in endless succession and finally sink into oblivion, or
          is the race of the children of men and the whole creation moving on to
          some divine telos, an end designed for it by God. And if the human
          race is moving on to some final, some ideal, condition perhaps, will
          the generations that have come and gone participate in this in any
          way, and if so, how; or did they merely serve as a thoroughfare
          leading up to the grand climax? Naturally, only those who believe
          that, as the history of the world had a beginning, it will also have
          an end, can speak of a consummation and have a doctrine of
          eschatology.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE QUESTION OF ESCHATOLOGY IN PHILOSOPHY. The question of the
          final destiny of the individual and of the race occupied an important
          place even in the speculations of the philosophers. Plato taught the
          immortality of the soul, that is, its continued existence after death,
          and this doctrine remained an important tenet in philosophy up to the
          present time. Spinoza had no place for it in his pantheistic system,
          but Wolff and Leibnitz defended it with all kinds of arguments. Kant
          stressed the untenableness of these arguments, but nevertheless
          retained the doctrine of immortality as a postulate of practical
          reason. The idealistic philosophy of the nineteenth century ruled it
          out. In fact, as Haering says, "Pantheism of all sorts is limited to a
          definite mode of contemplation, and does not lead to any 'ultimate'."
          Not only did the philosophers reflect on the future of the individual;
          they also thought deeply on the future of the world. The Stoics spoke
          of successive world-cycles, and the Buddhists, of world-ages, in each
          of which a new world appears and again disappears. Even Kant
          speculated on the birth and death of worlds.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE QUESTION OF ESCHATOLOGY IN RELIGION. It is especially in
          religion, however, that we meet with eschatological conceptions. Even
          false religions, the more primitive as well as the more advanced, have
          their eschatology. Buddhism has its Nirvana, Mohammedanism, its
          sensual paradise, and the Indians, their happy hunting-grounds. Belief
          in the continued existence of the soul appears everywhere and in
          various forms. Says J. T. Addison: "The belief that the soul of man
          survives his death is so nearly universal that we have no reliable
          record of a tribe or nation or religion in which it does not
          prevail."1 It may manifest itself in the conviction that the dead are
          still hovering around and near at hand, in ancestor worship, in
          seeking intercourse with the dead, in the conception of an underworld
          peopled with the dead, or in the idea of the transmigration of souls;
          but it is always present in some form or other. But in these religions
          all is vague and uncertain. It is only in the Christian religion that
          the doctrine of the last things receives greater precision and carries
          with it an assurance that is divine. Naturally, they who are not
          content to rest their faith exclusively on the Word of God, but make
          it contingent on experience and on the deliverances of the Christian
          consciousness, are at a great disadvantage here. While they may
          experience spiritual awakening, divine illumination, repentance and
          conversion, and may observe the fruits of the operations of divine
          grace in their lives, they cannot experience nor see the realities of
          the future world. They shall have to accept the testimony of God
          respecting these, or continue to grope about in the dark. If they do
          not wish to build the house of their hope on vague and indeterminate
          longings, they shall have to turn to the firm ground of the Word of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>B. ESCHATOLOGY IN THE HISTORY OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH.</p>
        <p>
          Speaking generally, it may be said that Christianity never forgot the
          glorious predictions respecting its future and the future of the
          individual Christian. Neither the individual Christian nor the Church
          could avoid thinking about these and finding comfort in them.
          Sometimes, however, the Church, borne down with the cares of life, or
          entangled in its pleasures, thought little of the future. Moreover, it
          happened repeatedly that at one time it would think more of this, and
          at another time, more of that particular element of its future hope.
          In days of defection the Christian hope sometimes grew dim and
          uncertain, but it never died out altogether. At the same time it must
          be said that there has never been a period in the history of the
          Christian Church, in which eschatology was the center of Christian
          thought. The other loci of Dogmatics have each had their time of
          special development, but this cannot be said of eschatology. Three
          periods can be distinguished in the history of eschatological thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. FROM THE APOSTOLIC AGE TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH CENTURY. In
          the very first period the Church was perfectly conscious of the
          separate elements of the Christian hope, as, for instance, that
          physical death is not yet eternal death, that the souls of the dead
          live on, that Christ is coming again, that there will be a blessed
          resurrection of the people of God, that this will be followed by a
          general judgment, in which eternal doom will be pronounced upon the
          wicked but the pious will be rewarded with the everlasting glories of
          heaven. But these elements were simply seen as so many separate parts
          of the future hope, and were not yet dogmatically construed. Though
          the various elements were quite well understood, their interrelation
          was not yet clearly seen. At first it seemed as if eschatology was in
          a fair way to become the center of the construction of Christian
          doctrine, for in the first two centuries Chiliasm was rather
          prominent, though not as prominent as some would have us believe. As
          it turned out, however, eschatology was not developed in this period.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH CENTURY TO THE REFORMATION. Under
          the guidance of the Holy Spirit the attention of the Church was
          directed from the future to the present, and Chiliasm was gradually
          forgotten. Especially under the influence of Origen and Augustine,
          anti-chiliastic views became dominant in the Church. But though these
          were regarded as orthodox, they were not thought through and
          systematically developed. There was a general belief in a life after
          death, in the return of the Lord, in the resurrection of the dead, in
          the final judgment, and in a kingdom of glory, but very little
          reflection on the manner of these. The thought of a material and
          temporal kingdom made way for that of eternal life and the future
          salvation. In course of time the Church was placed in the center of
          attention, and the hierarchical Church was identified with the Kingdom
          of God. The idea gained ground that outside of this Church there was
          no salvation, and that the Church determined the proper pedagogical
          training for the future. A great deal of attention was paid to the
          intermediate state, and particularly to the doctrine of purgatory. In
          connection with this the mediation of the Church was brought to the
          foreground, the doctrine of the mass, of prayers for the dead, and of
          indulgences. As a protest against this ecclesiasticism, Chiliasm again
          made its appearance in several sects This was in part a reaction of a
          pietistic nature against the externalism and worldliness of the
          Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. FROM THE REFORMATION UP TO THE PRESENT DAY. The thought of the
          Reformation centered primarily about the idea of the application and
          appropriation of salvation, and sought to develop eschatology mainly
          from this point of view. Many of the old Reformed theologians treat it
          merely as an adjunct to soteriology, dealing with the glorification of
          believers. Consequently, only a part of eschatology was studied and
          brought to further development. The Reformation adopted what the early
          Church taught respecting the return of Christ, the resurrection, the
          final judgment, and eternal life, and brushed aside the crass form of
          Chiliasm which appeared in the Anabaptist sects. In its opposition to
          Rome, it also reflected a good deal on the intermediate state and
          rejected the various tenets developed by the Roman Catholic Church. It
          can hardly be said that the Churches of the Reformation did much for
          the development of eschatology. In Pietism Chiliasm again made its
          appearance. The Rationalism of the eighteenth century retained of
          eschatology merely the bare idea of a colourless immortality, of the
          mere survival of the soul after death. Under the influence of the
          philosophy of evolution with its idea of an endless progress, it
          became, if not obsolete, at least obsolescent. Liberal theology
          entirely ignored the eschatological teachings of Jesus and placed all
          the emphasis on His ethical precepts. As a result it has no
          eschatology worthy of the name. Other - worldliness made way for this
          - worldliness; the blessed hope of eternal life was replaced by the
          social hope of a kingdom of God exclusively of this world; and the
          former assurance respecting the resurrection of the dead and future
          glory was supplanted by the vague trust that God may have even better
          things in store for man than the blessings which he now enjoys. Says
          Gerald Birney Smith: "In no realm are the changes of thinking more
          marked than in the portion of theology which deals with the future
          life. Where theologians used to speak to us in detail concerning 'last
          things,' they now set forth in somewhat general terms the reasonable
          basis for optimistic confidence in the continuance of life beyond
          physical death."2 At the present time, however, there are some signs
          of a change for the better. A new wave of Premillennialism appeared,
          which is not limited to the sects, but has also found entrance in some
          of the Churches of our day, and its advocates suggest a Christian
          philosophy of history, based particularly on the study of Daniel and
          Revelation, and help to fix the attention once more on the end of the
          ages. Weiss and Schweitzer called attention to the fact that the
          eschatological teachings of Jesus were far more important in His
          scheme of thought than His ethical precepts, which after all represent
          only an "Interimsethik." And Karl Barth also stresses the
          eschatological element in divine revelation.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE RELATION OF ESCHATOLOGY TO THE REST OF DOGMATICS.</p>
        <p>
          1. WRONG CONCEPTIONS WHICH OBSCURE THIS RELATION. When Kliefoth wrote
          his Eschatologie, he complained about the fact that there had never
          yet appeared a comprehensive and adequate treatise on eschatology as a
          whole; and further calls attention to the fact that in dogmatical
          works it often appears, not as a main division uniform with the
          others, but merely as a fragmentary and neglected appendix, while some
          of its questions are discussed in other loci. There were good reasons
          for his complaints. In general it may be said that eschatology is even
          now the least developed of all the loci of dogmatics. Moreover, it was
          often given a very subordinate place in the systematic treatment of
          theology. It was a mistake of Coccejus that he arranged the whole of
          dogmatics according to the scheme of the covenants, and thus treated
          it as a historical study rather than a systematic presentation of all
          the truths of the Christian religion. In such a scheme eschatology
          could only appear as the finale of history, and not at all as one of
          the constitutive elements of a system of truth. A historical
          discussion of the last things may form a part of the historia
          revelationis, but cannot as such be introduced as an integral part of
          dogmatics. Dogmatics is not a descriptive, but a normative science, in
          which we aim at absolute rather than at mere historical, truth.
          Reformed theologians on the whole saw this point very clearly, and
          therefore discussed the last things in a systematic way. However, they
          did not always do justice to it as one of the main divisions of
          dogmatics, but gave it a subordinate place in one of the other loci.
          Several of them conceived of it merely as dealing with the
          glorification of the saints or the consummation of the rule of Christ,
          and introduced it at the conclusion of their discussion of objective
          and subjective soteriology. The result was that some parts of
          eschatology received due emphasis, while other parts were all but
          neglected. In some cases the subject-matter of eschatology was divided
          among different loci. Another mistake, sometimes made, was to lose
          sight of the theological character of eschatology. We cannot subscribe
          to the following statement of Pohle (Roman Catholic) in his work on
          Eschatology, or the Catholic Doctrine of the Last Things: "Eschatology
          is anthropological and cosmological rather than theological; for,
          though it deals with God as the Consummator and Universal Judge,
          strictly speaking, its subject is the created universe, i.e. man and
          the cosmos."3 If eschatology is not theology it has no proper place in
          dogmatics.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE PROPER CONCEPTION OF THIS RELATION. Strange to say, the same
          Catholic author says: "Eschatology is the crown and capstone of
          dogmatic theology," which is perfectly correct. It is the one locus of
          theology, in which all the other loci must come to a head, to a final
          conclusion. Dr. Kuyper correctly points out that every other locus
          left some question unanswered, to which eschatology should supply the
          answer. In theology it is the question, how God is finally perfectly
          glorified in the work of His hands, and how the counsel of God is
          fully realized; in anthropology, the question, how the disrupting
          influence of sin is completely overcome; in christology, the question,
          how the work of Christ is crowned with perfect victory; in
          soteriology, the question, how the work of the Holy Spirit at last
          issues in the complete redemption and glorification of the people of
          God; and in ecclesiology, the question of the final apotheosis of the
          Church. All these questions must find their answer in the last locus
          of dogmatics, making it the real capstone of dogmatic theology.
          Haering testifies to the same fact when he says: "As a matter of fact
          it (eschatology) does shed a clear light upon every single section of
          doctrine. Is the universality of God's saving plan, is personal
          communion with a personal God asserted without reserve, is the
          permanent significance of the Redeemer upheld, is forgiveness of sin
          conceived as one with victory over the power of sin â€” on these
          points the eschatology must remove all doubt, even when indefinite
          statements which have been made in the preceding parts could not at
          once be recognized as such. Nor is it difficult to discover the reason
          of this. In the doctrine of the last things, the communion between God
          and man is set forth as completed, and therefore the idea of our
          religion, the Christian principle, is presented in its purity; not,
          however, as a mere idea in the sense of an ideal which is never
          completely realized, but as perfect reality â€” and it is clear what
          difficulties are implied in that. It must therefore appear at last, in
          the presentment of eschatology, if not sooner, whether the reality of
          this communion with God has received its unrestricted due."4
        </p>
        <p>D. THE NAME "ESCHATOLOGY."</p>
        <p>
          Various names have been applied to the last locus of dogmatics, of
          which de Novissimis or Eschatology is the most common. Kuyper uses the
          term Consummatione Saeculi. The name "eschatology" is based on those
          passages of Scripture that speak of "the last days (eschatai hemerai),
          Isa_2:2; Mic_4:1, "the last time " (eschatos ton chronon), 1Pe_1:20,
          and "the last hour," (eschate hora ), 1Jn_2:18. It is true that these
          expressions sometimes refer to the whole New Testament dispensation,
          but even so they embody an eschatological idea. Old Testament prophecy
          distinguishes only two periods, namely, "this age" (olam hazzeh Gr.;
          aion houtos), and "the coming age" (ollam habba', Gr.; aion mellon).
          Since the prophets represent the coming of the Messiah and the end of
          the world as coinciding, the "last days" are the days immediately
          preceding both the coming of the Messiah and the end of the world.
          They nowhere draw a clear line of distinction between a first and a
          second coming of the Messiah. In the New Testament, however, it
          becomes perfectly evident, that the coming of the Messiah is twofold,
          and that the Messianic age includes two stages, the present Messianic
          age and the future consummation. Consequently, the New Testament
          dispensation may be regarded under two different aspects. If the
          attention is fixed on the future coming of the Lord, and all that
          precedes it is considered as belonging to "this age," then New
          Testament believers are regarded as living on the eve of that
          important event, the Lord's return in glory and the final
          consummation. If, on the other hand, the attention is centered on the
          first coming of Christ, it is natural to consider the believers of
          this dispensation as already, though only in principle, living in the
          future age. This representation of their condition is not uncommon in
          the New Testament. The Kingdom of God is already present, eternal life
          is realized in principle, the Spirit is the earnest of the heavenly
          inheritance, and believers are already seated with Christ in heavenly
          places. But while some of the eschatological realities are thus
          projected into the present, they are not fully realized until the time
          of the future consummation. And when we speak of "eschatology," we
          have in mind more particularly the facts and events that are connected
          with the second coming of Christ, and that will mark the end of the
          present dispensation and will usher in the eternal glories of the
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          E. THE CONTENTS OF ESCHATOLOGY: GENERAL AND INDIVIDUAL ESCHATOLOGY.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. GENERAL ESCHATOLOGY. The name "eschatology" calls attention to the
          fact that the history of the world and of the human race will finally
          reach its consummation. It is not an indefinite and endless process,
          but a real history moving on to a divinely appointed end. According to
          Scripture that end will come as a mighty crisis, and the facts and
          events associated with this crisis form the contents of eschatology.
          Strictly speaking, they also determine its limits. But because other
          elements may be included under the general head, it is customary to
          speak of the series of events that is connected with the return of
          Jesus Christ and the end of the world as constituting general
          eschatology, â€” an eschatology in which all men are concerned. The
          subjects that call for consideration in this division, are the return
          of Christ, the general resurrection, the last judgment, the
          consummation of the Kingdom, and the final condition of both the pious
          and the wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. INDIVIDUAL ESCHATOLOGY. Besides this general, there is also an
          individual, eschatology that must be taken into consideration. The
          events named may constitute the whole of eschatology in the strict
          sense of the word, yet we cannot do justice to this without showing
          how the generations who have died will participate in the final
          events. For the individual the end of the present existence comes with
          death, which transfers him completely from the present into the future
          age. In so far as he is removed from the present age with its
          historical development, he is introduced into the future age, which is
          eternity. In the same measure in which there is a change in locality,
          there is also a change of Ã¦on. The things touching the condition of
          the individual between his death and the general resurrection, belong
          to personal or individual eschatology. Physical death, the immortality
          of the soul, and the intermediate condition call for discussion here.
          The study of these subjects will serve the purpose of connecting up
          the condition of those who die before the parousia with the final
