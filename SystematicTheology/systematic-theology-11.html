        <p>IV. Creation of the Spiritual World</p>
        <p>A. THE DOCTRINE OF THE ANGELS IN HISTORY</p>
        <p>
          There are clear evidences of belief in the existence of angels from
          the very beginning of the Christian era. Some of them were regarded as
          good, and others as evil. The former were held in high esteem as
          personal beings of a lofty order, endowed with moral freedom, engaged
          in the joyful service of God, and employed by God to minister to the
          welfare of men. According to some of the early Church Fathers they had
          fine ethereal bodies. The general conviction was that all angels were
          created good, but that some abused their freedom and fell away from
          God. Satan, who was originally an angel of eminent rank, was regarded
          as their head. The cause of his fall was found in pride and sinful
          ambition, while the fall of his subordinates was ascribed to their
          lusting after the daughters of men. This view was based on what was
          then the common interpretation of Gen_6:2. Alongside of the general
          idea that the good angels ministered to the needs and welfare of
          believers, the specific notion of guardian angels for individual
          churches and individual men was cherished by some. Calamities of
          various kinds, such as sicknesses, accidents, and losses, were
          frequently ascribed to the baneful influence of evil spirits. The idea
          of a hierarchy of angels already made its appearance (Clement of
          Alexandria), but it was not considered proper to worship any of the
          angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          As time went on the angels continued to be regarded as blessed
          spirits, superior to men in knowledge, and free from the encumbrance
          of gross material bodies. While some still ascribed to them fine
          ethereal bodies, there was an ever increasing uncertainty as to
          whether they had any bodies at all. They who still clung to the idea
          that they were corporeal did this, so it seems, in the interest of the
          truth that they were subject to spatial limitations. Dionysius the
          Areopagite divided the angels into three classes: the first class
          consisting of Thrones, Cherubim, and Seraphim; the second, of Mights,
          Dominions, and Powers; and the third, of Principalities, Archangels,
          and Angels. The first class is represented as enjoying the closest
          communion with God; the second, as being enlightened by the first; and
          the third, as being enlightened by the second. This classification was
          adopted by several later writers. Augustine stressed the fact that the
          good angels were rewarded for their obedience by the gift of
          perseverance, which carried with it the assurance that they would
          never fall. Pride was still regarded as the cause of Satan's fall, but
          the idea that the rest of the angels fell as the result of their
          lusting after the daughters of men, though still held by some, was
          gradually disappearing under the influence of a better exegesis of
          Gen_6:2. A beneficent influence was ascribed to the unfallen angels,
          while the fallen angels were regarded as corrupting the hearts of men,
          as stimulating to heresy. and as engendering diseases and calamities.
          The polytheistic tendencies of many of the converts to Christianity
          fostered an inclination to worship the angels. Such worship was
          formally condemned by a council which convened at Laodicea in the
          fourth century.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Middle Ages there were still a few who were inclined to
          assume that the angels have ethereal bodies, but the prevailing
          opinion was that they were incorporeal. The angelic appearances were
          explained by assuming that in such cases angels adopted temporal
          bodily forms for revelational purposes. Several points were in debate
          among the Scholastics. As to the time of the creation of the angels
          the prevailing opinion was that they were created at the same time as
          the material universe. While some held that the angels were created in
          the state of grace, the more common opinion was that they were created
          in a state of natural perfection only. There was little difference of
          opinion respecting the question, whether angels can be said to be in a
          place. The common answer to this question was affirmative, though it
          was pointed out that their presence in space is not circumscriptive
          but definitive, since only bodies can be in space circumscriptively.
          While all the Scholastics agreed that the knowledge of the angels is
          limited, the Thomists and Scotists differed considerably respecting
          the nature of this knowledge. It was admitted by all that the angels
          received infused knowledge at the time of their creation, but Thomas
          Aquinas denied, while Duns Scotus affirmed, that they could acquire
          new knowledge through their own intellectual activity. The former held
          that the knowledge of the angels is purely intuitive, but the latter
          asserted that it may also be discursive. The idea of guardian angels
          found considerable favor during the Middle Ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The period of the Reformation brought nothing new respecting the
          doctrine of the angels. Both Luther and Calvin had a vivid conception
          of their ministry, and particularly of the presence and power of
          Satan. The latter stresses the fact that he is under divine control,
          and that, while he is sometimes the instrument of God, he can only
          work within prescribed limits. Protestant theologians generally
          regarded the angels as pure spiritual beings, though Zanchius and
          Grotius still speak of them as having ethereal bodies. As to the work
          of the good angels the general opinion was that it is their special
          task to minister to the heirs of salvation. There was no general
          agreement, however, respecting the existence of guardian angels. Some
          favored this view, others opposed it, and still others refused to
          commit themselves on this point. Our Belgic Confession says in Article
          XII, which deals with creation: "He also created the angels good, to
          be His messengers and to serve His elect: some of whom are fallen from
          that excellency, in which God created them, into everlasting
          perdition; and the others have, by the grace of God, remained
          steadfast, and continued in their primitive state. The devils and evil
          spirits are so depraved that they are enemies of God and every good
          thing to the utmost of their power, as murderers watching to ruin the
          Church and every member thereof, and by their wicked stratagems to
          destroy all; and are therefore, by their own wickedness, adjudged to
          eternal damnation, daily expecting their horrible torments."
        </p>
        <p>
          Up to the present time Roman Catholics generally regarded the angels
          as pure spirits, while some Protestants, such as Emmons, Ebrard,
          Kurtz, Delitzsch, and others, still ascribe to them some special kind
          of bodies. But even the great majority of the latter take the opposite
          view. Swedenborg holds that all angels were originally men and exist
          in bodily form. Their position in the angelic world depends on their
          life in this world. Eighteenth century Rationalism boldly denied the
          existence of angels and explained what the Bible teaches about them as
          a species of accommodation. Some modern liberal theologians consider
          it worthwhile to retain the fundamental idea expressed in the doctrine
          of the angels. They find in it a symbolic representation of the
          protecting care and helpfulness of God.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE EXISTENCE OF THE ANGELS</p>
        <p>
          All religions recognize the existence of a spiritual world. Their
          mythologies speak of gods, half-gods, spirits, demons, genii, heroes,
          and so on. It was especially among the Persians that the doctrine of
          the angels was developed, and many critical scholars assert that the
          Jews derived their angelology from the Persians. But this is an
          unproved and, to say the least, very doubtful theory. It certainly
          cannot be harmonized with the Word of God, in which angels appear from
          the very beginning. Moreover, some great scholars, who made special
          study of the subject, came to the conclusion that the Persian
          angelology was derived from that current among the Hebrews. The
          Christian Church has always believed in the existence of angels, but
          in modern liberal theology this belief has been discarded, though it
          still regards the angel-idea as useful, since it imprints upon us "the
          living power of God in the history of redemption, His providentia
          specialissima for His people, especially for the 'little ones.'"68
          Though such men as Leibnitz and Wolff, Kant and Schleiermacher,
          admitted the possibility of the existence of an angelic world, and
          some of them even tried to prove this by rational argumentation, it is
          quite evident that philosophy can neither prove nor disprove the
          existence of angels. From philosophy, therefore, we turn to Scripture,
          which makes no deliberate attempt to prove the existence of angels,
          but assumes this throughout, and in its historical books repeatedly
          shows us the angels in action. No one who bows before the authority of
          the Word of God can doubt the existence of angels.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE NATURE OF THE ANGELS</p>
        <p>Under this heading several points call for consideration.</p>
        <p>
          1. IN DISTINCTION FROM GOD THEY ARE CREATED BEINGS. The creation of
          the angels has sometimes been denied, but is clearly taught in
          Scripture. It is not certain that those passages which speak of the
          creation of the host of heaven (Gen_2:1; Psa_33:6; Neh_9:6) refer to
          the creation of the angels rather than to the creation of the starry
          host; but Psa_148:2; Psa_148:5, and Col_1:16 clearly speak of the
          creation of the angels, (comp. 1Ki_22:19; Psa_103:20-21). The time of
          their creation cannot be fixed definitely. The opinion of some, based
          on Job_38:7, that they were created before all other things, really
          finds no support in Scripture. As far as we know, no creative work
          preceded the creation of heaven and earth. The passage in the book of
          Job (Job_38:7) teaches, indeed, in a poetic vein that they were
          present at the founding of the world just as the stars were, but not
          that they existed before the primary creation of heaven and earth. The
          idea that the creation of the heavens was completed on the first day,
          and that the creation of the angels was simply a part of the day's
          work, is also an unproved assumption, though the fact that the
          statement in Gen_1:2 applies to the earth only would seem to favor it.
          Possibly the creation of the heavens was not completed in a single
          moment any more than that of the earth. The only safe statement seems
          to be that they were created before the seventh day. This at least
          follows from such passages as Gen_2:1; Exo_20:11; Job_38:7; Neh_9:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THEY ARE SPIRITUAL AND INCORPOREAL BEINGS. This has always been
          disputed. The Jews and many of the early Church Fathers ascribed to
          them airy or fiery bodies; but the Church of the Middle Ages came to
          the conclusion that they are pure spiritual beings. Yet even after
          that some Roman Catholic, Arminian, and even Lutheran and Reformed
          theologians ascribed to them a certain corporeity, most subtle and
          pure. They regarded the idea of a purely spiritual and incorporeal
          nature as metaphysically inconceivable, and also as incompatible with
          the conception of a creature. They also appealed to the fact that the
          angels are subject to spatial limitations, move about from place to
          place, and were sometimes seen by men. But all these arguments are
          more than counter- balanced by the explicit statements of Scripture to
          the effect that the angels are pneumata, Mat_8:16; Mat_12:45;
          Luk_7:21; Luk_8:2; Luk_11:26; Act_19:12; Eph_6:12; Heb_1:14. They have
          no flesh and bone, Luk_24:39, do not marry, Mat_22:30, can be present
          in great numbers in a very limited space, Luk_8:30, and are invisible,
          Col_1:16. Such passages as Psa_104:4 (comp. Heb_1:7); Mat_22:30; and
          1Co_11:10 do not prove the corporeity of the angels. Neither is this
          proved by the symbolical descriptions of the angels in the prophecy of
          Ezekiel and in the book of Revelation, nor by their appearance in
          bodily forms, though it is difficult to say, whether the bodies which
          they assumed on certain occasions were real or only apparent. It is
          clear, however, that they are creatures and therefore finite and
          limited, though they stand in a freer relation to time and space than
          man. We cannot ascribe to them an ubi repletivum, nor an ubi
          circumscriptivum, but only an ubi definitivum. They cannot be in two
          or more places simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THEY ARE RATIONAL, MORAL, AND IMMORTAL BEINGS. This means that they
          are personal beings endowed with intelligence and will. The fact that
          they are intelligent beings would seem to follow at once from the fact
          that they are spirits; but it is also taught explicitly in Scripture,
          2Sa_14:20; Mat_22:36; Eph_3:10; 1Pe_1:12; 2Pe_2:11. While not
          omniscient, they are superior to men in knowledge, Mat_24:36.
          Moreover, they are possessed of moral natures, and as such are under
          moral obligation; they are rewarded for obedience, and are punished
          for disobedience. The Bible speaks of the angels which remained loyal
          as "holy angels," Mat_25:31; Mar_8:38; Luk_9:26; Act_10:22; Rev_14:10,
          and pictures those who fell away as lying and sinning, Joh_8:44;
          1Jn_3:8-10. The good angels are also immortal in the sense that they
          are not subject to death. In that respect the saints in heaven are
          said to be like them, Luk_20:35-36. In addition to all this, great
          power is ascribed to them. They form the army of God, a host of mighty
          heroes, always ready to do the Lord's bidding, Psa_103:20; Col_1:16;
          Eph_1:21; Eph_3:10; Heb_1:14; and the evil angels form the army of
          Satan, bent on destroying the work of the Lord, Luk_11:21; 2Th_2:9;
          1Pe_5:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THEY ARE PARTLY GOOD AND PARTLY EVIL. The Bible furnishes very
          little information respecting the original state of the angels. We
          read, however, that at the end of His creative work God saw everything
          that He had made and, behold, it was very good. Moreover, Joh_8:44;
          2Pe_2:4; and Jud_1:6 presupposes an original good condition of all
          angels. The good angels are called elect angels in 1Ti_5:21. They
          evidently received, in addition to the grace with which all angels
          were endowed, and which was sufficient to enable them to retain their
          position, a special grace of perseverance, by which they were
          confirmed in their position. There has been a great deal of useless
          speculation about the time and character of the fall of the angels.
          Protestant theology, however, was generally satisfied with the
          knowledge that the good angels retained their original state, were
          confirmed in their position, and are now incapable of sinning. They
          are not only called holy angels, but also angels of light, 2Co_11:14.
          They always behold the face of God, Mat_18:10, are our exemplars in
          doing the will of God, Mat_6:10, and possess immortal life, Luk_20:36.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE NUMBER AND ORGANIZATION OF THE ANGELS</p>
        <p>
          1. THEIR NUMBER. The Bible contains no definite information respecting
          the number of the angels, but indicates very clearly that they
          constitute a mighty army. They are repeatedly called the host of
          heaven or of God, and this term itself already points to a goodly
          number. In Deu_33:2 we read that "Jehovah came from Sinai... from the
          ten thousands of holy ones," and in Psa_68:17 the poet sings, "The
          chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands:
          the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary." In reply to
          the question of Jesus addressed to an unclean spirit, the answer was,
          "my name is legion; for we are many," Mar_5:9; Mar_5:15. The Roman
          legion was not always the same, but varied at different times all the
          way from 3000 to 6000, In Gethsemane Jesus said to the band that came
          to take him captive, "Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my
          Father, and He shall even now send me more than twelve legions of
          angels?" Mat_26:53. And, finally, we read in Rev_5:11, "And I saw, and
          I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the living
          creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand
          times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands." In view of all these
          data it is perfectly safe to say that the angels constitute an
          innumerable company, a mighty host. They do not form an organism like
          mankind, for they are spirits, which do not marry and are not born the
          one out of the other. Their full number was created in the beginning;
          there has been no increase in their ranks.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THEIR ORDERS. Though the angels do not constitute an organism, they
          are evidently organized in some way. This follows from the fact that,
          alongside of the general name "angel," the Bible uses certain specific
          names to indicate different classes of angels. The name "angel," by
          which we designate the higher spirits generally, is not a nomen
          naturae in Scripture, but a nomen officii. The Hebrew word mal'ak
          simply means messenger, and serves to designate one sent by men,
          Job_1:14; 1Sa_11:3, or by God, Hag_1:13; Mal_2:7; Mal_3:1. The Greek
          term aggelos is also frequently applied to men, Mat_11:10; Mar_1:2;
          Luk_7:24; Luk_9:51; Gal_4:14. There is no general distinctive name for
          all spiritual beings in Scripture. They are called sons of God,
          Job_1:6; Job_2:1; Psa_29:1; Psa_89:6, spirits, Heb_1:14, saints,
          Psa_89:5; Psa_89:7; Zec_14:5; Dan_8:13, watchers, Dan_4:13; Dan_4:17;
          Dan_4:24. There are several specific names, however, which point to
          different classes of angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Cherubim. Cherubim are repeatedly mentioned in Scripture. They
          guard the entrance of paradise, Gen_3:24, gaze upon the mercy-seat,
          Exo_25:18; Psa_80:1; Psa_99:1; Isa_37:16; Heb_9:5, and constitute the
          chariot on which God descends to the earth, 2Sa_22:11; Psa_18:10. In
          Eze_1:1-28 and Rev_4:1-11 they are represented as living beings in
          various forms. These symbolical representations simply serve to bring
          out their extraordinary power and majesty. More than other creatures
          they were destined to reveal the power, the majesty, and the glory of
          God, and to guard His holiness in the garden of Eden, in tabernacle
          and temple, and in the descent of God to the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Seraphim. A related class of angels are the Seraphim, mentioned
          only in Isa_6:2; Isa_6:6. They are also symbolically represented in
          human form, but with six wings, two covering the face, two the feet,
          and two for the speedy execution of the Lord's commandments. In
          distinction from the Cherubim, they stand as servants round about the
          throne of the heavenly King, sing His praises, and are ever ready to
          do His bidding. While the Cherubim are the mighty ones, they might be
          called the nobles among the angels. While the former guard the
          holiness of God, they serve the purpose of reconciliation, and thus
          prepare men for the proper approach to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Principalities, powers, thrones, and dominions. In addition to the
          preceding the Bible speaks of certain classes of angels, which occupy
          places of authority in the angelic world, as archai and exousiai
          (principalities and powers), Eph_3:10; Col_2:10, thronoi (thrones),
          Col_1:16, kureotetoi (dominions), Eph_1:21; Col_1:16, and dunameis
          (powers), Eph_1:21; 1Pe_3:22. These appellations do not point to
          different kinds of angels, but simply to differences of rank or
          dignity among them.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Gabriel and Michael. In distinction from all the other angels,
          these two are mentioned by name. Gabriel appears in Dan_8:16;
          Dan_9:21; Luk_1:19; Luk_1:26. The great majority of commentators
          regard him as a created angel, but some of these deny that the name
          Gabriel is a proper name and look upon it as common noun, meaning man
          of God, a synonym for angel. But this is an untenable position.69 Some
          earlier and later commentators see in him an uncreated being, some
          even suggesting that he might be the third person of the Holy Trinity,
          while Michael was the second. But a simple reading of the passages in
          question shows the impossibility of this interpretation. He may be one
          of the seven angels that are said to stand before God in Rev_8:2
          (comp. Luk_1:19). It seems to have been his special task to mediate
          and interpret divine revelations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name Michael (lit., "who as God?") has been interpreted as a
          designation of the second person of the Trinity. But this is no more
          tenable than the identification of Gabriel with the Holy Spirit.
          Michael is mentioned in Dan_10:13; Dan_10:21; Jud_1:9; Rev_12:7. From
          the fact that he is called "the archangel" in Jud_1:9, and from the
          expression used in Rev_12:7 it would seem that he occupies an
          important place among the angels. The passages in Daniel also point to
          the fact that he is a prince among them. We see in him the valiant
          warrior fighting the battles of Jehovah against the enemies of Israel
          and against the evil powers in the spirit-world. It is not impossible
          that the title "archangel" also applies to Gabriel and a few other
          angels.

        <p>E. THE SERVICE OF THE ANGELS</p>
        <p>
          We can distinguish between an ordinary and an extraordinary service of
          the angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THEIR ORDINARY SERVICE. This consists first of all in their
          praising God day and night, Job_38:7; Isa_6:1-13; Psa_103:20;
          Psa_148:2; Rev_5:11. Scripture gives the impression that they do this
          audibly, as at the birth of Christ, though we can form no conception
          of this speaking and singing of the angels. Since the entrance of sin
          into the world they are sent forth to minister to them that are heirs
          of salvation, Heb_1:14. They rejoice at the conversion of a sinner,
          Luk_15:10, watch over believers, Psa_34:7; Psa_91:11, protect the
          little ones, Mat_18:10, are present in the Church, 1Co_11:10;
          1Ti_5:21, learning from her the manifold riches of the grace of God,
          Eph_3:10; 1Pe_1:12, and convey believers into the bosom of Abraham,
          Luk_16:22. The idea that some of them serve as guardians of individual
          believers finds no support in Scripture. The statement in Mat_18:10 is
          too general to prove the point, though it seems to indicate that there
          is a group of angels who are particularly charged with the care of the
          little ones. Neither is it proved by Act_12:15, for this passage
          merely goes to show that there were some even among the disciples of
          that early day who believed in guardian angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THEIR EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE. The extraordinary service of the
          angels was made necessary by the fall of man, and forms an important
          element in the special revelation of God. They often mediate the
          special revelations of God, communicate blessings to His people, and
          execute judgment upon His enemies. Their activity is most prominent in
          the great turning points of the economy of salvation, as in the days
          of the patriarchs, the time of the lawgiving, the period of the exile
          and of the restoration, and at the birth, the resurrection, and the
          ascension of the Lord. When the period of God's special revelation
          closed, the extraordinary service of the angels ceased, to be resumed
          only at the return of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>F. THE EVIL ANGELS</p>
        <p>
          1. THEIR ORIGIN. Besides the good there also are evil angels, who
          delight in opposing God and antagonizing His work. Though they are
          also creatures of God, they were not created as evil angels. God saw
          everything that He had created, and it was very good, Gen_1:31. There
          are two passages in Scripture which clearly imply that some of the
          angels did not retain their original position, but fell from the state
          in which they were created, 2Pe_2:4; Jud_1:6. The special sin of these
          angels is not revealed, but has generally been thought to consist in
          this that they exalted themselves over against God, and aspired to
          supreme authority. If this ambition played an important part in the
          life of Satan and led to his downfall, it would at once explain why he
          tempted man on this particular point, and sought to lure him to his
          destruction by appealing to a possible similar ambition in man. Some
          of the early Church Fathers distinguished between Satan and the
          subordinate devils in explaining the cause of their fall. That of the
          fall of Satan was found in pride, but that of the more general fall in
          the angelic world, in fleshly lust, Gen_6:2. That interpretation of
          Gen_6:2 was gradually discarded, however, during the Middle Ages. In
          view of this it is rather surprising to find that several modern
          commentators are reiterating the idea in their interpretation of
          2Pe_2:4 and Jud_1:6 as, for instance, Meyer, Alford, Mayor,
          Wohlenberg. It is an explanation, however, that is contrary to the
          spiritual nature of the angels, and to the fact that, as Mat_22:30
          would seem to imply, there is no sexual life among the angels.
          Moreover, on that interpretation we shall have to assume a double fall
          in the angelic world, first the fall of Satan, and then, considerably
          later, the fall resulting in the host of devils that now serves Satan.
          It is much more likely that Satan dragged the others right along with
          him in his fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THEIR HEAD. Satan appears in Scripture as the recognized head of
          the fallen angels. He was originally, it would seem, one of the
          mightiest princes of the angelic world, and became the leader of those
          that revolted and fell away from God. The name "Satan" points to him
          as "the Adversary," not in the first place of man, but of God. He
          attacks Adam as the crown of God's handiwork, works destruction and is
          therefore called Apollyon (the Destroyer), and assaults Jesus when He
          undertakes the work of restoration. After the entrance of sin into the
          world he became Diabolos (the Accuser), accusing the people of God
          continually, Rev_12:10. He is represented in Scripture as the
          originator of sin, Gen_3:1; Gen_3:4; Joh_8:44; 2Co_11:3; 1Jn_3:8;
          Rev_12:9; Rev_20:2; Rev_20:10, and appears as the recognized head of
          those that fell away, Mat_25:41; Mat_9:34; Eph_2:2. He remains the
          leader of the angelic hosts which he carried with him in his fall, and
          employs them in desperate resistance to Christ and His Kingdom. He is
          also called repeatedly "the prince of this (not, "of the") world,
          Joh_12:31; Joh_14:30; Joh_16:11, and even "the god of this world,"
          2Co_4:4. This does not mean that he is in control of the world, for
          God is in control, and He has given all authority to Christ, but it
          does convey the idea that he is in control of this evil world, the
          world in so far as it is ethically separated from God. This is clearly
          indicated in Eph_2:2, where he is called "the prince of the powers of
          the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience."
          He is superhuman, but not divine; has great power, but is not
          omnipotent; wields influence on a large but restricted scale,
          Mat_12:29; Rev_20:2, and is destined to be cast into the bottomless
          pit, Rev_20:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THEIR ACTIVITY. Like the good angels, the fallen angels, too, are
          possessed of superhuman power, but their use of it contrasts sadly
          with that of the good angels. While the latter perennially praise God,
          fight His battles, and serve Him faithfully, they as powers of
          darkness are bent on cursing God, battling against Him and His
          Anointed, and destroying His work. They are in constant revolt against
          God, seek to blind and mislead even the elect, and encourage sinners
          in their evil. But they are lost and hopeless spirits. They are even
          now chained to hell and pits of darkness, and though not yet limited
          to one place, yet, as Calvin says, drag their chains with them
          wherever they go, 2Pe_2:4; Jud_1:6.
