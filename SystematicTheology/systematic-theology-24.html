        <p>II. The Covenant of Redemption</p>
        <p>A. SEPARATE DISCUSSION OF THIS DESIRABLE.</p>
        <p>
          There are different representations respecting the parties in the
          covenant of grace. Some consider them to be the triune God and man,
          either without qualification, or qualified in some way, as "the
          sinner," "the elect," or "man in Christ"; others, God the Father, as
          representing the Trinity, and Christ as representing the elect;45 and
          still others, since the days of Coccejus, distinguish two covenants,
          namely, the covenant of redemption (pactum salutis) between the Father
          and the Son, and, as based on this, the covenant of grace between the
          triune God and the elect, or the elect sinner. The second of these
          representations has a certain advantage from a systematic point of
          view. It may claim the support of such passages as Rom_5:12-21 and
          1Co_15:21-22; 1Co_15:47-49, and stresses the inseparable connection
          between the pactum salutis and the covenant of grace. It brings out
          the unity of the covenant in Christ, and is advocated among others by
          Boston, Gib, Dick, A. Kuyper Sr., H. Kuyper, and A. Kuyper, Jr. The
          third representation is more perspicuous, however, is easier to
          understand, and is therefore more serviceable in a practical
          discussion of the doctrine of the covenant. It escapes a great deal of
          confusion that is incidental to the other view, and is followed by the
          majority of Reformed theologians, such as Mastricht, Ã  Marck,
          Turretin, Witsius, Heppe, the Hodges, Shedd, Vos, Bavinck, and Honig.
          There is no essential difference between these two representations.
          Says Dr. Hodge: "There is no doctrinal difference between those who
          prefer the one statement and those who prefer the other; between those
          who comprise all the facts of Scripture relating to the subject under
          one covenant between God and Christ as the representative of His
          people, and those who distribute them under two."46 This being the
          case, the third mode of representing the whole matter undoubtedly
          deserves the preference. But in following it we should bear in mind
          what Shedd says: "Though this distinction (between the covenant of
          redemption and the covenant of grace) is favored by Scripture
          statements, it does not follow that there are two separate and
          independent covenants antithetic to the covenant of works. The
          covenant of grace and redemption are two modes or phases of the one
          evangelical covenant of mercy."47
        </p>
        <p>B. SCRIPTURAL DATA FOR THE COVENANT OF REDEMPTION.</p>
        <p>
          The name "counsel of peace" is derived from Zec_6:13. Coccejus and
          others found in this passage a reference to an agreement between the
          Father and the Son. This was clearly a mistake, for the words refer to
          the union of the kingly and priestly offices in the Messiah. The
          Scriptural character of the name cannot be maintained, but this, of
          course, does not detract from the reality of the counsel of peace. The
          doctrine of this eternal counsel rests on the following Scriptural
          basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Scripture clearly points to the fact that the plan of redemption
          was included in the eternal decree or counsel of God, Eph_1:4 ff;
          Eph_3:11; 2Th_2:13; 2Ti_1:9; Jas_2:5; 1Pe_1:2, etc. Now we find that
          in the economy of redemption there is, in a sense, a division of
          labor: the Father is the originator, the Son the executor, and the
          Holy Spirit the applier. This can only be the result of a voluntary
          agreement among the persons of the Trinity, so that their internal
          relations assume the form of a covenant life. In fact, it is exactly
          in the trinitarian life that we find the archetype of the historical
          covenants, a covenant in the proper and fullest sense of the word, the
          parties meeting on a footing of equality, a true suntheke.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There are passages of Scripture which not only point to the fact
          that the plan of God for the salvation of sinners was eternal,
          Eph_1:4; Eph_3:9; Eph_3:11, but also indicate that it was of the
          nature of a covenant. Christ speaks of promises made to Him before his
          advent, and repeatedly refers to a commission which He had received
          from the Father, Joh_5:30; Joh_5:43; Joh_6:38-40; Joh_17:4-12. And in
          Rom_5:12-21 and 1Co_15:22 He is clearly regarded as a representative
          head, that is, as the head of a covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Wherever we have the essential elements of a covenant, namely,
          contracting parties, a promise or promises, and a condition, there we
          have a covenant. In Psa_2:7-9 the parties are mentioned and a promise
          is indicated. The Messianic character of this passage is guaranteed by
          Act_13:33; Heb_1:5; Heb_5:5. Again, in Psa_40:7-9, also attested as
          Messianic by the New Testament (Heb_10:5-7), the Messiah expresses His
          readiness to do the Father's will in becoming a sacrifice for sin.
          Christ repeatedly speaks of a task which the Father has entrusted to
          Him, Joh_6:38-39; Joh_10:18; Joh_17:4. The statement in Luk_22:29 is
          particularly significant: "I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my
          Father appointed unto me." The verb used here is diatithemi, the word
          from which diatheke is derived, which means to appoint by will,
          testament or covenant. Moreover, in Joh_17:5 Christ claims a reward,
          and in Joh_17:6; Joh_17:9; Joh_17:24 (cf. also Php_2:9-11) He refers
          to His people and His future glory as a reward given Him by the
          Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. There are two Old Testament passages which connect up the idea of
          the covenant immediately with the Messiah, namely, Psa_89:3, which is
          based on 2Sa_7:12-14, and is proved to be a Messianic passage by
          Heb_1:5; and Isa_42:6, where the person referred to is the Servant of
          the Lord. The connection clearly shows that this Servant is not merely
          Israel. Moreover, there are passages in which the Messiah speaks of
          God as His God, thus using covenant language, namely, Psa_22:1-2, and
          Psa_40:8.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE SON IN THE COVENANT OF REDEMPTION.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE OFFICIAL POSITION OF CHRIST IN THIS COVENANT. The position of
          Christ in the covenant of redemption is twofold. In the first place He
          is Surety (Gr. egguos), a word that is used only in Heb_7:22. The
          derivation of this word is uncertain, and therefore cannot aid us in
          establishing its meaning. But the meaning is not doubtful. A surety is
          one who engages to become responsible for it that the legal
          obligations of another will be met. In the covenant of redemption
          Christ undertook to atone for the sins of His people by bearing the
          necessary punishment, and to meet the demands of the law for them. And
          by taking the place of delinquent man He became the last Adam, and is
          as such also the Head of the covenant, the Representative of all those
          whom the Father has given Him. In the covenant of redemption, then,
          Christ is both Surety and Head. He took upon Himself the
          responsibilities of His people. He is also their Surety in the
          covenant of grace, which develops out of the covenant of redemption.
          The question has been raised, whether the suretyship of Christ in the
          counsel of peace was conditional or unconditional. Roman jurisprudence
          recognizes two kinds of suretyship, the one designated fidejussor, and
          the other expromissor. The former is conditional, and the latter
          unconditional. The former is a surety who undertakes to pay for
          another, provided this person does not himself render satisfaction.
          The burden of guilt remains on the guilty party until the time of
          payment. The latter, however, is a surety who takes upon himself
          unconditionally to pay for another, thus relieving the guilty party of
          his responsibility at once. Coccejus and his school maintained that in
          the counsel of peace Christ became a fidejussor, and that consequently
          Old Testament believers enjoyed no complete forgiveness of sins. From
          Rom_3:25 they inferred that for those saints there was only a paresis,
          an overlooking of sin, and no aphesis or complete forgiveness, until
          Christ really made atonement for sin. Their opponents asserted,
          however, that Christ took upon Himself unconditionally to render
          satisfaction for His people, and therefore became a surety in the
          specific sense of an expromissor. This is the only tenable position,
          for: (a) Old Testament believers received full justification or
          forgiveness, though the knowledge of it was not as full and clear as
          it is in the New Testament dispensation. There was no essential
          difference between the status of the Old, and that of the New
          Testament believers, Psa_32:1-2; Psa_32:5; Psa_51:1-3; Psa_51:9-11;
          Psa_103:3; Psa_103:12; Isa_43:25; Rom_3:3; Rom_3:6-16;
        </p>
        <p>
          Gal_3:6-9. The position of Coccejus reminds one of that of the Roman
          Catholics with their Limbus Patrum. (b) Coccejus' theory makes the
          work of God in making provision for the redemption of sinners
          dependent on the uncertain obedience of man in an entirely unwarranted
          way. There is no sense in saying that Christ became a conditional
          surety, as if it were still possible that the sinner should pay for
          himself. God's provision for the redemption of sinners is absolute.
          This is not the same as saying that He does not treat and address the
          sinner as personally guilty until he is justified by faith, for this
          is exactly what God does do. (c) In Rom_3:25, the passage to which
          Coccejus appeals, the apostle uses the word paresis (overlooking or
          passing over), not because the individual believers in the Old
          Testament did not receive full pardon of sin, but because during the
          old dispensation the forgiveness of sin assumed the form of a paresis,
          as long as sin had not been adequately punished in Christ, and the
          absolute righteousness of Christ had not been revealed in the cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE CHARACTER THIS COVENANT ASSUMED FOR CHRIST. Though the covenant
          of redemption is the eternal basis of the covenant of grace, and, as
          far as sinners are concerned, also its eternal prototype, it was for
          Christ a covenant of works rather than a covenant of grace. For Him
          the law of the original covenant applied, namely, that eternal life
          could only be obtained by meeting the demands of the law. As the last
          Adam Christ obtains eternal life for sinners in reward for faithful
          obedience, and not at all as an unmerited gift of grace. And what He
          has done as the Representative and Surety of all His people, they are
          no more in duty bound to do. The work has been done, the reward is
          merited, and believers are made partakers of the fruits of Christ's
          accomplished work through grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. CHRIST'S WORK IN THE COVENANT LIMITED BY THE DECREE OF ELECTION.
          Some have identified the covenant of redemption and election; but this
          is clearly a mistake. Election has reference to the selection of the
          persons destined to be the heirs of everlasting glory in Christ. The
          counsel of redemption, on the other hand, refers to the way in which
          and the means by which grace and glory are prepared for sinners.
          Election, indeed, also has reference to Christ and reckons with
          Christ, for believers are said to be elected in Him. Christ Himself
          is, in a sense, the object of election, but in the counsel of
          redemption He is one of the contracting parties. The Father deals with
          Christ as the Surety of His people. Logically, election precedes the
          counsel of redemption, because the suretyship of Christ, like His
          atonement, is particular. If there were no preceding election, it
          would necessarily be universal. Moreover, to turn this around would be
          equivalent to making the suretyship of Christ the ground of election,
          while Scripture bases election entirely on the good pleasure of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. CONNECTION OF THE SACRAMENTS USED BY CHRIST WITH THE COVENANT.
          Christ used the sacraments of both the Old and the New Testament. It
          is evident, however, that they could not mean for Him what they do for
          believers. In His case they could be neither symbols nor seals of
          saving grace; nor could they be instrumental in strengthening saving
          faith. If we distinguish, as we are doing, between the covenant of
          redemption and the covenant of grace, then the sacraments were for
          Christ in all probability sacraments of the former rather than of the
          latter. Christ took upon Himself in the covenant of redemption to meet
          the demands of the law. These had assumed a definite form when Christ
          was on earth and also included positive religious regulations. The
          sacraments formed a part of this law, and therefore Christ had to
          subject Himself to them, Mat_3:15. At the same time they could serve
          as seals of the promises which the Father had given to the Son. The
          objection may be raised to this representation that the sacraments
          were indeed fit symbols and seals of the removal of sin and of the
          nourishment of spiritual life, but from the nature of the case could
          not have this meaning for Christ, who had no sin and needed no
          spiritual nourishment. The objection may be met, at least to a certain
          extent, by calling attention to the fact that Christ appeared on earth
          in a public and official capacity. Though He had no personal sin, and
          no sacrament could therefore signify and seal to Him its removal, yet
          He was made to be sin for His people, 2Co_5:21, by being burdened with
          their guilt; and consequently the sacraments could signify the removal
          of this burden, according to the promise of the Father, after He had
          completed His atoning work. Again, though we cannot speak of Christ as
          exercising saving faith in the sense in which this is required of us,
          yet as Mediator He had to exercise faith in a wider sense by accepting
          the promises of the Father believingly, and by trusting the Father for
          their fulfilment. And the sacraments could serve as signs and seals to
          strengthen this faith as far as His human nature was concerned.
        </p>
        <p>D. REQUIREMENTS AND PROMISES IN THE COVENANT OF REDEMPTION.</p>
        <p>
          1. REQUIREMENTS. The Father required of the Son, who appeared in this
          covenant as the Surety and Head of His people, and as the last Adam,
          that He should make amends for the sin of Adam and of those whom the
          Father had given Him, and should do what Adam failed to do by keeping
          the law and thus securing eternal life for all His spiritual progeny.
          This requirement included the following particulars:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. That He should assume human nature by being born of a woman, and
          thus enter into temporal relations; and that He should assume this
          nature with its present infirmities, though without sin, Gal_4:4-5;
          Heb_2:10-11; Heb_2:14-15; Heb_4:15. It was absolutely essential that
          He should become one of the human race.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. That He, who as the Son of God was superior to the law, should
          place Himself under the law; that He should enter, not merely into the
          natural, but also into the penal and federal relation to the law, in
          order to pay the penalty for sin and to merit everlasting life for the
          elect, Psa_40:8; Mat_5:17-18; Joh_8:28-29; Gal_4:4-5; Php_2:6-8.
        </p>
        <p>
          That He, after having merited forgiveness of sins and eternal life for
          His own, should apply to them the fruits of His merits: complete
          pardon, and the renewal of their lives through the powerful operation
          of the Holy Spirit. By doing this He would render it absolutely
          certain that believers would consecrate their lives to God, Joh_10:16;
          Joh_16:14-15; Joh_17:12; Joh_17:19-22;
        </p>
        <p>Heb_2:10-13; Heb_7:25.</p>
        <p>
          2. PROMISES. The promises of the Father were in keeping with His
          requirements. He promised the Son all that was required for the
          performance of His great and comprehensive task, thereby excluding all
          uncertainty in the operation of this covenant. These promises included
          the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. That He would prepare the Son a body, which would be a fit
          tabernacle for him; a body in part prepared by the immediate agency of
          God and uncontaminated by sin, Luk_1:35; Heb_10:5.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. That He would endow Him with the necessary gifts and graces for the
          performance of His task, and particularly would anoint Him for the
          Messianic offices by giving Him the Spirit without measure, a promise
          that was fulfilled especially at the time of His baptism, Isa_42:1-2;
          Isa_61:1; Joh_3:31.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. That He would support Him in the performance of His work, would
          deliver Him from the power of death, and would thus enable Him to
          destroy the dominion of Satan and to establish the Kingdom of God,
          Isa_42:1-7; Isa_49:8; Psa_16:8-11; Act_2:25-28.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. That He would enable Him, as a reward for His accomplished work, to
          send out the Holy Spirit for the formation of His spiritual body, and
          for the instruction, guidance, and protection of the Church,
          Joh_14:26; Joh_15:26; Joh_16:13-14; Act_2:33.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. That He would give unto Him a numerous seed in reward for His
          accomplished work, a seed so numerous that it would be a multitude
          which no man could number, so that ultimately the Kingdom of the
          Messiah would embrace the people of all nations and tongues,
          Psa_22:27; Psa_72:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          f. That He would commit to Him all power in heaven and on earth for
          the government of the world and of His Church, Mat_28:18; Eph_1:20-22;
          Php_2:9-11; Heb_2:5-9; and would finally reward Him as Mediator with
          the glory which He as the Son of God had with the Father before the
          world was, Joh_17:5.
        </p>
        <p>E. THE RELATION OF THIS COVENANT TO THE COVENANT OF GRACE</p>
        <p>
          The following points indicate the relation in which this covenant
          stands to the covenant of grace:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The counsel of redemption is the eternal prototype of the
          historical covenant of grace. This accounts for the fact that many
          combine the two into a single covenant. The former is eternal, that
          is, from eternity, and the latter, temporal in the sense that it is
          realized in time. The former is a compact between the Father and the
          Son as the Surety and Head of the elect, while the latter is a compact
          between the triune God and the elect sinner in the Surety.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The counsel of redemption is the firm and eternal foundation of the
          covenant of grace. If there had been no eternal counsel of peace
          between the Father and the Son, there could have been no agreement
          between the triune God and sinful men. The counsel of redemption makes

          3. The counsel of redemption consequently also gives efficacy to the
          covenant of grace, for in it the means are provided for the
          establishment and execution of the latter. It is only by faith that
          the sinner can obtain the blessings of the covenant, and in the
          counsel of redemption the way of faith is opened. The Holy Spirit,
          which produces faith in the sinner, was promised to Christ by the
          Father, and the acceptance of the way of life through faith was
          guaranteed by Christ.

          The covenant of redemption may be defined as the agreement between the
          Father, giving the Son as Head and Redeemer of the elect, and the Son,
          voluntarily taking the place of those whom the Father had given Him.
