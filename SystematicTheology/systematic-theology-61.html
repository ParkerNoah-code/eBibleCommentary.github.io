        <p>V. The Lord's Supper</p>
        <p>A. ANALOGIES OF THE LORD'S SUPPER AMONG ISRAEL.</p>
        <p>
          Just as there were analogies to Christian baptism among Israel, there
          were also analogies of the Lord's Supper. Not only among the Gentiles,
          but also among Israel, the sacrifices that were brought were often
          accompanied with sacrificial meals. This was particularly a
          characteristic feature of the peace-offerings. Of these sacrifices
          only the fat adhering to the inwards was consumed on the altar; the
          wave-breast was given to the priesthood, and the heave-shoulder to the
          officiating priest, Lev_7:28-34, while the rest constituted a
          sacrificial meal for the offerer and his friends, provided they were
          levitically clean, Lev_7:19-21; Deu_12:7; Deu_12:12. These meals
          taught in a symbolic way that "being justified by faith, we have peace
          with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." They were expressive of the
          fact that, on the basis of the offered and accepted sacrifice, God
          receives His people as guests in His house and unites with them in
          joyful communion, the communal life of the covenant. Israel was
          forbidden to take part in the sacrificial meals of the Gentiles
          exactly because it would express their allegiance to other gods,
          Exo_34:15; Num_25:3; Num_25:5; Psa_106:28. The sacrificial meals,
          which testified to the union of Jehovah with His people, were seasons
          of joy and gladness, and as such were sometimes abused and gave
          occasion for revelry and drunkenness, 1Sa_1:13; Pro_7:14; Isa_28:8.
          The sacrifice of the Passover was also accompanied with such a
          sacrificial meal. Over against the Roman Catholics, Protestants
          sometimes sought to defend the position that this meal constituted the
          whole of the Passover, but this is an untenable position. The Passover
          was first of all a sacrifice of atonement, Exo_12:27; Exo_34:25. Not
          only is it called a sacrifice, but in the Mosaic period it was also
          connected with the sanctuary, Deu_16:2. The lamb was slain by the
          Levites, and the blood was manipulated by the priests, 2Ch_30:16;
          2Ch_35:11; Ezr_6:19. But though it is first of all a sacrifice, that
          is not all; it is also a meal, in which the roasted lamb is eaten with
          unleavened bread and bitter herbs, Exo_12:8-10. The sacrifice passed
          right into a meal, which in later times became far more elaborate than
          it originally was. The New Testament ascribes to the Passover a
          typical significance, 1Co_5:7, and thus saw in it not only a reminder
          of the deliverance from Egypt, but also a sign and seal of the
          deliverance from the bondage of sin and of communion with God in the
          promised Messiah. It was in connection with the paschal meal that
          Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper. By using the elements present in
          the former He effected a very natural transition to the latter. Of
          late some critics sought to cast doubt on the institution of the
          Lord's Supper by Jesus, but there is no good reason to doubt the
          testimony of the Gospels, nor the independent testimony of the apostle
          Paul in 1Co_11:23-26.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER IN HISTORY.</p>
        <p>
          1. BEFORE THE REFORMATION. Even in the apostolic age the celebration
          of the Lord's Supper was accompanied with agapae or love-feasts, for
          which the people brought the necessary ingredients, and which
          sometimes led to sad abuses, 1Co_11:20-22. In course of time the gifts
          so brought were called oblations and sacrifices, and were blessed by
          the priest with a prayer of thanksgiving. Gradually these names were
          applied to the elements in the Lord's Supper, so that these assumed
          the character of a sacrifice brought by the priest, and thanksgiving
          came to be regarded as a consecration of those elements. While some of
          the early Church Fathers (Origen, Basil, Gregory of Nazianze) retained
          the symbolical or spiritual conception of the sacrament, others
          (Cyril, Gregory of Nyssa, Chrysostom) held that the flesh and blood of
          Christ were in some way combined with the bread and wine in the
          sacrament. Augustine retarded the realistic development of the
          doctrine of the Lord's Supper for a long time. While he did speak of
          the bread and wine as the body and blood of Christ, he distinguished
          between the sign and the thing signified, and did not believe in a
          change of substance. He denied that the wicked, though receiving the
          elements, also received the body, and stressed the commemorative
          aspect of the Lord's Supper. During the Middle Ages the Augustinian
          view was gradually transplanted by the doctrine of transubstantiation.
          As early as 818 A.D. Paschasius Radbertus already formally proposed
          this doctrine, but met with strong opposition on the part of Rabanus
          Maurus and Ratramnus. In the eleventh century a furious controversy
          again broke out on the subject between Berenger of Tours and Lanfranc.
          The latter made the crass statement that "the very body of Christ was
          truly held in the priest's hand, broken and chewed by the teeth of the
          faithful." This view was finally defined by Hildebert of Tours (1134),
          and designated as the doctrine of transubstantiation. It was formally
          adopted by the fourth Lateran Council in 1215. Many questions
          connected with this doctrine were debated by the Scholastics, such as
          those respecting the duration of the change of bread and wine into the
          body and blood of Jesus Christ, the manner of Christ's presence in
          both elements, the relation of substance and accidents, the adoration
          of the host, and so on. The final formulation of the doctrine was
          given by the Council of Trent, and is recorded in Sessio XIII of its
          Decrees and Canons. Eight Chapters and eleven Canons are devoted to
          it. We can only mention the most essential points here. Jesus Christ
          is truly, really, and substantially present in the holy sacrament. The
          fact that He is seated at the right hand of God does not exclude the
          possibility of His substantial and sacramental presence in several
          places simultaneously. By the words of consecration the substance of
          bread and wine is changed into the body and blood of Christ. The
          entire Christ is present under each species and under each particle of
          either species. Each one who receives a particle of the host receives
          the whole Christ. He is present in the elements even before the
          communicant receives them. In view of this presence, the adoration of
          the host is but natural. The sacrament effects an "increase of
          sanctifying grace, special actual graces, remission of venial sins,
          preservation from grievous (mortal) sin, and the confident hope of
          eternal salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. DURING AND AFTER THE REFORMATION. The Reformers, one and all,
          rejected the sacrificial theory of the Lord's Supper, and the
          mediaeval doctrine of transubstantiation. They differed, however, in
          their positive construction of the Scriptural doctrine of the Lord's
          Supper. In opposition to Zwingli, Luther insisted on the literal
          interpretation of the words of the institution and on the bodily
          presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper. However, he substituted for
          the doctrine of transubstantiation that of consubstantiation, which
          has been defended at length by Occam in his De Sacramento Altaris, and
          according to which Christ is "in, with, and under" the elements.
          Zwingli denied absolutely the bodily presence of Christ in the Lord's
          Supper, and gave a figurative interpretation to the words of the
          institution. He saw in the sacrament primarily an act of
          commemoration, though he did not deny that in it Christ is spiritually
          present to the faith of believers. Calvin maintained an intermediate
          position. Like Zwingli, he denied the bodily presence of the Lord in
          the sacrament, but in distinction from the former, he insisted on the
          real, though spiritual, presence of the Lord in the Supper, the
          presence of Him as a fountain of spiritual virtue and efficacy.
          Moreover, instead of stressing the Lord's Supper as an act of man
          (either of commemoration or of profession), he emphasized the fact
          that it is the expression first of all of a gracious gift of God to
          man, and only secondarily a commemorative meal and an act of
          profession. For him, as well as for Luther, it was primarily a
          divinely appointed means for the strengthening of faith. The
          Socinians, Arminians, and Mennonites saw in the Lord's Supper only a
          memorial, an act of profession, and a means for moral improvement.
          Under the influence of Rationalism this became the popular view.
          Schleiermacher stressed the fact that the Lord's Supper is the means
          by which the communion of life with Christ is preserved in a
          particularly energetic manner in the bosom of the Church. Many of the
          Mediating theologians, while belonging to the Lutheran Church,
          rejected the doctrine of consubstantiation, and approached the
          Calvinistic view of the spiritual presence of Christ in the Lord's
          Supper.
        </p>
        <p>C. SCRIPTURAL NAMES FOR THE LORD'S SUPPER.</p>
        <p>
          While there is but a single name for the initiatory sacrament of the
          New Testament, there are several for the sacrament now under
          consideration, all of which are derived from Scripture. They are the
          following: (1) Deipnon kuriakon, the Lord's Supper, which is derived
          from 1Co_11:20. This is the most common name in Protestant circles. It
          seems that in the passage indicated the apostle wants to make a
          pointed distinction between the sacrament and the agapae which the
          Corinthians connected with it and which they abused, thus making the
          two virtually incongruous. The special emphasis is on the fact that
          this Supper is the Lord's. It is not a supper in which the rich invite
          the poor as their guests and then treat them niggardly, but a feast in
          which the Lord provides for all in rich abundance. (2) Trapeza kuriou
          the table of the Lord, a name that is found in 1Co_10:21. Corinthian
          Gentiles offered to idols and after their sacrifices sat down to
          sacrificial meals; and it seems that some of the Corinthian church
          thought it was permissible to join them, seeing that all flesh is
          alike. But Paul points out that sacrificing to idols is sacrificing to
          devils, and that joining in such sacrificial meals is equivalent to
          exercising communion with devils. This would be absolutely in conflict
          with sitting at the table of the Lord, confessing allegiance to Him
          and exercising communion with Him. (3)Klasis tou artou, the breaking
          of bread, a term that is used in Act_2:42; cf. also Act_20:7. While
          this is a term which, in all probability, does not refer exclusively
          to the Lord's Supper, but also to the love-feasts, it certainly also
          includes the Lord's Supper. The name may even find its explanation in
          the breaking of the bread as this was ordained by Jesus. (4)
          Eucharistia thanksgiving, and eulogia, blessing, terms which are
          derived from 1Co_10:16; 1Co_11:24. In Mat_26:26-27 we read that the
          Lord took the bread and blessed it, and took the cup and gave thanks.
          In all probability the two words were used interchangeably and refer
          to a blessing and thanksgiving combined. The cup of thanksgiving and
          blessing is the consecrated cup.
        </p>
        <p>D. INSTITUTION OF THE LORD'S SUPPER.</p>
        <p>
          1. DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF THE INSTITUTION. There are four different
          accounts of the institution of the Lord's Supper, one in each of the
          Synoptics, and one in 1Co_11:1-34. John speaks of the eating of the
          passover, but does not mention the institution of a new sacrament.
          These accounts are independent of, and serve to complement, one
          another. Evidently, the Lord did not finish the passover meal before
          He instituted the Lord's Supper. The new sacrament was linked up with
          the central element in the paschal meal. The bread that was eaten with
          the lamb was consecrated to a new use. This is evident from the fact
          that the third cup, generally called "the cup of blessing" was used
          for the second element in the new sacrament. Thus the sacrament of the
          Old Testament passed into that of the New in a most natural way.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE SUBSTITUTION OF BREAD FOR THE LAMB. The paschal lamb had
          symbolical significance. Like all the bloody sacrifices of the Old
          Testament, it taught the people that the shedding of blood was
          necessary unto the remission of sins. In addition to that it had a
          typical meaning, pointing forward to the great sacrifice which would
          be brought in the fulness of time to take away the sin of the world.
          And, finally, it also had national significance as a memorial of
          Israel's deliverance. It was but natural that, when the real Lamb of
          God made His appearance and was on the point of being slain, the
          symbol and type should disappear. The all-sufficient sacrifice of
          Jesus Christ rendered all further shedding of blood unnecessary; and
          therefore it was entirely fitting that the bloody element should make
          way for an unbloody one which, like it, had nourishing properties.
          Moreover, through the death of Christ the middle wall of partition was
          broken down, and the blessings of salvation were extended to all the
          world. And in view of this it was quite natural that the passover, a
          symbol with a national flavor, should be replaced by one that carried
          with it no implications of nationalism.
        </p>
        <p>3. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DIFFERENT ACTIONS AND TERMS.</p>
        <p>
          a. Symbolic actions. All the accounts of the institution of the Lord's
          Supper make mention of the breaking of the bread, and Jesus clearly
          indicates that this was intended to symbolize the breaking of His body
          for the redemption of sinners. Because Jesus broke the bread in the
          presence of His disciples, Protestant theology generally insists on it
          that this action should always take place in the sight of the people.
          This important transaction was intended to be a sign, and a sign must
          be visible. After distributing the bread, Jesus took the cup, blessed
          it, and gave it to His disciples. It does not appear that He poured
          the wine in their presence, and therefore this is not regarded as
          essential to the celebration of the Lord's Supper. Dr. Wielinga
          infers, however, from the fact that the bread must be broken, that the
          wine must also be poured, in the sight of the communicants.62 Jesus
          naturally used unleavened bread, since it was the only kind at hand,
          and the ordinary wine which was largely used as a beverage in
          Palestine. But neither the one nor the other is stressed, and
          therefore it does not follow that it would not be permissible to use
          leavened bread and some other kind of wine. The disciples undoubtedly
          received the elements in a reclining position, but this does not mean
          that believers may not partake of them in a sitting, kneeling, or
          standing, position.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Words of command. Jesus accompanied His action with words of
          command. When He gave the bread to His disciples, He said, "Take,
          eat." And in issuing this command He undoubtedly had in mind, not
          merely a physical eating, but a spiritual appropriation of the body of
          Christ by faith. It is a command which, though it came first of all to
          the apostles, was intended for the Church of all ages. According to
          Luk_22:19 (comp. 1Co_11:24) the Lord added the words: "This do in
          remembrance of me." Some infer from these words that the Supper
          instituted by Jesus was nothing more than a memorial meal. It is quite
          evident, however, especially from Joh_6:32-33; Joh_6:50-51;
          1Co_11:26-30, that it was intended to be far more than that; and in so
          far as it had memorial significance, it was intended as a memorial of
          the sacrificial work of Christ rather than of His person. There was
          another word of command in connection with the cup. After distributing
          the bread the Lord also took the cup, gave thanks, and said, "Drink ye
          all of it," or (according to Luke), "Take this and divide it among
          yourselves." It is quite clear that the cup here stands for what it
          contains, for the cup could not be divided. From these words it is
          perfectly evident that the Lord intended the Sacrament to be used in
          both kinds (sub utraque specie), and that Rome is wrong in withholding
          the cup from the laity. The use of both elements enabled Christ to
          give a vivid representation of the idea that His body was broken, that
          flesh and blood were separated, and that the sacrament both nourishes
          and quickens the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Words of explanation. The word of command in connection with the
          bread is immediately followed by a word of explanation, which has
          given rise to sharp disputes, namely, "This is my body." These words
          have been interpreted in various ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The Church of Rome makes the copula "is" emphatic. Jesus meant to
          say that what He held in His hand was really His body, though it
          looked and tasted like bread. But this is a thoroughly untenable
          position. In all probability Jesus spoke Aramaic and used no copula at
          all. And while He stood before the disciples in the body, He could not
          very well say to His disciples in all seriousness that He held His
          body in His hand. Moreover, even on the Roman Catholic view, He could
          not truthfully say, "This is my body," but could only say, "This is
          now becoming my body."
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Carlstadt held the novel view that Jesus, when He spoke these
          words, pointed to His body. He argued that the neuter touto could not
          refer to artos, which is masculine. But bread can very well be
          conceived of as a thing and thus referred to as neuter. Moreover, such
          a statement would have been rather inane under the circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Luther and the Lutherans also stress the word "is," though they
          admit that Jesus was speaking figuratively. According to them the
          figure was not a metaphor, but a synecdoche. The Lord simply meant to
          say to His disciples: Where you have the bread, you have my body in,
          under, and along with it, though the substance of both remains
          distinct. This view is burdened with the impossible doctrine of the
          omnipresence of the Lord's physical body.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Calvin and the Reformed Churches understand the words of Jesus
          metaphorically: "This is (that is, signifies) my body." Such a
          statement would be just as intelligible to the disciples as other
          similar statements, such as, "I am the bread of life," Joh_6:35, and,
          "I am the true vine," Joh_15:1. At the same time they reject the view,
          generally ascribed to Zwingli, that the bread merely signifies the
          body of Christ, and stress the fact that it also serves to seal the
          covenant mercies of God and to convey spiritual nourishment. To these
          words Jesus adds the further statement, "which is given for you."
          These words in all probability express the idea that the body of Jesus
          is given for the benefit, or in the interest, of the disciples. It is
          given by the Lord to secure their redemption. Naturally, it is a
          sacrifice not only for the immediate disciples of the Lord, but also
          for all those who believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also a word of explanation in connection with the cup. The
          Lord makes the significant statement: "This cup is the new covenant in
          my blood, even that which is poured out for you." Luk_22:20. These
          words convey an implied contrast between the blood of the Saviour, as
          the blood of the new covenant, and the blood of the old covenant
          mentioned in Exo_24:8. The latter was only a shadowy representation of
          the New Testament reality. The words "for you" have no wider
          application than they do in the statement made in connection with the
          bread, "which is given for you." They are not to be understood in the
          unrestricted sense of "for all men indiscriminately," but rather in
          the limited sense of "for you and for all who are really my
          disciples." The concluding words in 1Co_11:26, "For as often as ye eat
          this bread, and drink this cup, ye proclaim the Lord's death till He
          come," point to the perennial significance of the Lord's Supper as a
          memorial of the sacrificial death of Christ; and clearly intimate that
          it should be celebrated regularly until the Lord's return.
        </p>
        <p>E. THE THINGS SIGNIFIED AND SEALED IN THE LORD'S SUPPER.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE THINGS SIGNIFIED IN THE SACRAMENT. It is one of the
          characteristics of a sacrament that it represents one or more
          spiritual truths by means of sensible and outward signs. The outward
          sign in the case of the Lord's Supper includes not only the visible
          elements employed, but also the breaking of the bread and the pouring
          of the wine, the appropriation of bread and wine by eating and
          drinking, and the partaking of them in communion with others. The
          following points should be mentioned here:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. It is a symbolical representation of the Lord's death, 1Co_11:26.
          The central fact of redemption, prefigured in the sacrifices of the
          Old Testament, is clearly set forth by means of the significant
          symbols of the New Testament sacrament. The words of the institution,
          "broken for you" and "shed for many", point to the fact that the death
          of Christ is a sacrificial one, for the benefit, and even in the
          place, of His people.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. It also symbolizes the believer's participation in the crucified
          Christ. In the celebration of the Lord's Supper the participants not
          merely look at the symbols, but receive them and feed upon them.
          Figuratively speaking, they "eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and
          drink His blood," Joh_6:53, that is, they symbolically appropriate the
          benefits secured by the sacrificial death of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. It represents, not only the death of Christ as the object of faith,
          and the act of faith which unites the believer to Christ, but also the
          effect of this act as giving life, strength, and joy, to the soul.
          This is implied in the emblems used. Just as bread and wine nourish
          and invigorate the bodily life of man, so Christ sustains and quickens
          the life of the soul. Believers are regularly represented in Scripture
          as having their life, and strength, and happiness, in Christ. d.
          Finally, the sacrament also symbolizes the union of believers with one
          another. As members of the mystical body of Jesus Christ, constituting
          a spiritual unity, they eat of the same bread and drink of the same
          wine, 1Co_10:17; 1Co_12:13. Receiving the elements, the one from the
          other, they exercise intimate communion with one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE THINGS SEALED IN THE LORD'S SUPPER. The Lord's Supper is not
          only a sign but also a seal. This is lost sight of by a good many in
          our day, who have a very superficial view of this sacrament, and
          regard it merely as a memorial of Christ and as a badge of Christian
          profession. These two aspects of the sacrament, namely, as a sign and
          as a seal, are not independent of each other. The sacrament as a sign,
          or â€” to put it differently â€” the sacrament with all that it
          signifies, constitutes a seal. The seal is attached to the things
          signified, and is a pledge of the covenanted grace of God revealed in
          the sacrament. The Heidelberg Catechism says that Christ intends "by
          these visible signs and pledges to assure us that we are as really
          partakers of His true body and blood, through the working of the Holy
          Spirit, as we receive by the mouth of the body these holy tokens in
          remembrance of Him; and that all His sufferings and obedience are as
          certainly ours as if we ourselves had in our own persons suffered and
          made satisfaction to God for our sins."63 The following points come
          into consideration here:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. It seals to the participant the great love of Christ, revealed in
          the fact that He surrendered Himself to a shameful and bitter death
          for them. This does not merely mean that it testifies to the reality
          of that sacrificial self-surrender, but that it assures the believing
          participant of the Lord's Supper that he personally was the object of
          that incomparable love.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Moreover, it pledges the believing partaker of the sacrament, not
          only the love and grace of Christ in now offering Himself to them as
          their Redeemer in all the fulness of His redemptive work; but gives
          him the personal assurance that all the promises of the covenant and
          all the riches of the gospel offer are his by a divine donation, so
          that he has a personal claim on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Again, it not only ratifies to the believing participant the rich
          promises of the gospel, but it assures him that the blessings of
          salvation are his in actual possession. As surely as the body is
          nourished and refreshed by bread and wine, so surely is the soul that
          receives Christ's body and blood through faith even now in possession
          of eternal life, and so surely will he receive it ever more
          abundantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Finally, the Lord's Supper is a reciprocal seal. It is a badge of
          profession on the part of those who partake of the sacrament. Whenever
          they eat the bread and drink the wine, they profess their faith in
          Christ as their Saviour and their allegiance to Him as their King, and
          they solemnly pledge a life of obedience to His divine commandments.
        </p>
        <p>
          F. THE SACRAMENTAL UNION OR THE QUESTION OF THE REAL PRESENCE OF
          CHRIST IN THE LORD'S SUPPER.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this question we are entering upon what has long been, and still
          is, the occasion for considerable difference of opinion in the Church
          of Jesus Christ. There is by no means a unanimous opinion as to the
          relation of the sign to the thing signified, that is to say, as to the
          nature of the presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper. There are
          especially four views that come into consideration here.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE VIEW OF ROME. The Church of Rome conceives of the sacramental
          union in a physical sense. It is hardly justified, however, in
          speaking of any sacramental union at all, for according to its
          representation there is no union in the proper sense of the word. The
          sign is not joined to the thing signified, but makes way for it, since
          the former passes into the latter. When the priest utters the formula,
          " hoc est corpus meum ", bread and wine change into the body and blood
          of Christ. It is admitted that even after the change the elements look
          and taste like bread and wine. While the substance of both is changed,
          their properties remain the same. In the form of bread and wine the
          physical body and blood of Christ are present. The supposed Scriptural
          ground for this is found in the words of the institution, "this is my
          body", and in Joh_6:50 ff. But the former passage is clearly tropical,
          like those in Joh_14:6; Joh_15:1; Joh_10:9, and others; and the
          latter, literally understood, would teach more than the Roman Catholic
          himself would be ready to grant, namely, that every one who eats the
          Lord's Supper goes to heaven, while no one who fails to eat it will
          obtain eternal life (cf. Joh_6:53-54). Moreover, Joh_6:63 clearly
          points to a spiritual interpretation. Furthermore, it is quite
          impossible to conceive of the bread which Jesus broke as being the
          body which was handling it; and it should be noted that Scripture
          calls it bread even after it is supposed to have been trans-
          substantiated, 1Co_10:17; 1Co_11:26-28. This view of Rome also
          violates the human senses, where it asks us to believe that what
          tastes and looks like bread and wine, is really flesh and blood; and
          human reason, where it requires belief in the separation of a
          substance and its properties and in the presence of a material body in
          several places at the same time, both of which are contrary to reason.
          Consequently, the elevation and adoration of the host is also without
          any proper foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE LUTHERAN VIEW. Luther rejected the doctrine of
          transubstantiation and substituted for it the related doctrine of
          consubstantiation. According to him bread and wine remain what they
          are, but there is in the Lord's Supper nevertheless a mysterious and
          miraculous real presence of the whole person of Christ, body and
          blood, in, under, and along with, the elements. He and his followers
          maintain the local presence of the physical body and blood of Christ
          in the sacrament. Lutherans sometimes deny that they teach the local
          presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, but then they ascribe to the
          word 'local' a meaning not intended by those who ascribe this teaching
          to them. When it is said that they teach the local presence of the
          physical nature of Christ, this does not imply that all other bodies
          are excluded from the same portion of space, nor that the human nature
          of Christ is nowhere else, as, for instance, in heaven; but it does
          mean that the physical nature of Christ is locally present in the
          Lord's Supper, as magnetism is locally present in the magnet, and as
          the soul is locally present in the body. Consequently, they also teach
          the so-called manducatio oralis, which means that those who partake of
          the elements in the Lord's Supper eat and drink the Lord's body and
          blood "with the bodily mouth", and not merely that they appropriate
          these by faith. Unworthy communicants also receive them, but to their
          condemnation. This view is no great improvement on the Roman Catholic
          conception, though it does not involve the oft-repeated miracle of a
          change of substance minus a change of attributes. It really makes the
          words of Jesus mean, 'this accompanies my body', an interpretation
          that is more unlikely than either of the others. Moreover, it is
          burdened with the impossible doctrine of the ubiquity of the Lord's
          glorified human nature, which several Lutherans would gladly discard.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE ZWINGLIAN VIEW. There is a very general impression, not
          altogether without foundation, that Zwingli's view of the Lord's
          Supper was very defective. He is usually alleged to have taught that
          it is a bare sign or symbol, figuratively representing or signifying
          spiritual truths or blessings; and that its reception is a mere
          commemoration of what Christ did for sinners, and above all a badge of
          the Christian's profession. This hardly does justice to the Swiss
          Reformer, however. Some of his statements undoubtedly convey the idea
          that to him the sacrament was merely a commemorative rite and a sign
          and symbol of what the believer pledges in it. But his writings also
          contain statements that point to a deeper significance of the Lord's
          Supper and contemplate it as a seal or pledge of what God is doing for
          the believer in the sacrament. In fact, he seems to have changed his
          view somewhat in the course of time. It is very hard to determine
          exactly what he did believe in this matter. He evidently wanted to
          exclude from the doctrine of the Lord's Supper all unintelligible
          mysticism, and showed an excessive leaning to the side of plainness
          and simplicity in its exposition. He occasionally expresses himself to
          the intent that it is a mere sign or symbol, a commemoration of the
          Lord's death. And though he speaks of it in passing also as a seal or
          pledge, he certainly does not do justice to this idea. Moreover, for
          him the emphasis falls on what the believer, rather than on what God,
          pledges in the sacrament. He identified the eating of the body of
          Christ with faith in Him and a trustful reliance on His death. He
          denied the bodily presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, but did not
          deny that Christ is present there in a spiritual manner to the faith
          of the believer. Christ is present only in His divine nature and in
          the apprehension of the believing communicant.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE REFORMED VIEW. Calvin objects to Zwingli's doctrine of the
          Lord's Supper, (a) that it allows the idea of what the believer does
          in the sacrament to eclipse the gift of God in it; and (b) that it
          sees in the eating of the body of Christ nothing more nor higher than
          faith in His name and reliance on His death. According to him the
          sacrament is connected not merely with the past work of Christ, with
          the Christ who died (as Zwingli seems to think), but also with the
          present spiritual work of Christ, with the Christ that is alive in
          glory. He believes that Christ, though not bodily and locally present
          in the Supper, is yet present and enjoyed in His entire person, both
          body and blood. He emphasizes the mystical communion of believers with
          the entire person of the Redeemer. His representation is not entirely
          clear, but he seems to mean that the body and blood of Christ, though
          absent and locally present only in heaven, communicate a life-giving
          influence to the believer when he is in the act of receiving the
          elements. That influence, though real, is not physical but spiritual
          and mystical, is mediated by the Holy Spirit, and is conditioned on
          the act of faith by which the communicant symbolically receives the
          body and blood of Christ. As to the way in which this communion with
          Christ is effected, there is a twofold representation. Sometimes it is
          represented as if by faith the communicant lifts his heart to heaven,
          where Christ is; sometimes, as if the Holy Spirit brings the influence
          of the body and blood of Christ down to the communicant. Dabney
          positively rejects the representation of Calvin as if the communicant
          partakes of the very body and blood of Christ in the sacrament. This
          is undoubtedly an obscure point in Calvin's representation. Sometimes
          he seems to place too much emphasis on the literal flesh and blood.
          Perhaps, however, his words are to be understood sacramentally. that
          is, in a figurative sense. This view of Calvin is that found in our
          confessional standards.64 A very common interpretation of the dubious
          point in Calvin's doctrine, is that the body and blood of Christ are
          present only virtually, that is, in the words of Dr. Hodge, that "the
          virtues and effects of the sacrifice of the body of the Redeemer on
          the cross are made present and are actually conveyed in the sacrament
          to the worthy receiver by the power of the Holy Ghost, who uses the
          sacrament as His instrument according to His sovereign will."65
        </p>
        <p>G. THE LORD'S SUPPER AS A MEANS OF GRACE, OR ITS EFFICACY.</p>
        <p>
          The sacrament of the Lord's Supper, instituted by the Lord Himself as
          a sign and seal, is as such also a means of grace. Christ instituted
          it for the benefit of His disciples and of all believers. It was
          clearly the intention of the Saviour that His followers should profit
          by participation in it. This follows from the very fact that He
          instituted it as a sign and seal of the covenant of grace. It can also
          readily be inferred from the symbolical eating and drinking, which
          point to nourishment and quickening, and from such passages as
          Joh_6:48-58 (irrespective of the question, whether this refers
          directly to the Lord's Supper or not), and 1Co_11:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE GRACE RECEIVED IN THE LORD'S SUPPER. The Lord's Supper is
          intended for believers and for believers only, and therefore is not
          instrumental in originating the work of grace in the heart of the
          sinner. The presence of the grace of God is presupposed in the hearts
          of the participants. Jesus administered it to His professed followers
          only; according to Act_2:42; Act_2:46 they who believed continued
          steadfastly in the breaking of bread; and in 1Co_11:28-29 the
          necessity of self-examination before partaking of the Lord's Supper is
          stressed. The grace received in the sacrament does not differ in kind
          from that which believers receive through the instrumentality of the
          Word. The sacrament merely adds to the effectiveness of the Word, and
          therefore to the measure of the grace received. It is the grace of an
          ever closer fellowship with Christ, of spiritual nourishment and
          quickening, and of an ever increasing assurance of salvation. The
          Roman Catholic Church names specifically sanctifying grace, special
          actual graces, the remission of venial sins, preservation from mortal
          sin, and the assurance of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS GRACE IS WROUGHT. How does the sacrament
          function in this respect? Is the Lord's Supper in any way a
          meritorious cause of the grace conferred? Does it confer grace
          irrespective of the spiritual condition of the recipient, or does it
          not?
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The Roman Catholic view. For the Roman Catholics the Lord's Supper
          is not merely a sacrament, but also a sacrifice; it is even first of
          all a sacrifice. It is "the unbloody renewal of the sacrifice of the
          cross." This does not mean that in the Lord's Supper Christ actually
          dies anew, but that He undergoes an external change, which is in some
          way equivalent to death. Did not the Lord speak of the bread as His
          body that was broken for the disciples, and of the wine as His blood
          that was poured out for them? Roman Catholic controversialists
          sometimes give the impression that this sacrifice has only a
          representative or commemorative character, but this is not the real
          doctrine of the Church. The sacrifice of Christ in the Lord's Supper
          is considered to be a real sacrifice, and is supposed to have
          propitiatory value. When the question is raised, what this sacrifice
          merits for the sinner, Roman Catholic authorities begin to hedge and
          to speak inconsistent language. The statement of Wilmers in his
          Handbook of the Christian Religion, which is used as a textbook in
          many Roman Catholic schools, may be given as an example. Says he on
          page 348: "By the fruits of the sacrifice of the Mass we understand
          the effects which it produces for us, inasmuch as it is a sacrifice of
          atonement and impetration: (a) not only supernatural graces, but also
          natural favors; (b) remission of sins, and of the punishment due to
          them. What Christ merited for us by His death on the cross is applied
          to us in the sacrament of the Mass." After the sacrifice of the Mass
          is called a sacrifice of atonement, the last sentence seems to say
          that it is after all only a sacrifice in which that which Christ
          merited on the cross is applied to the participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as the Lord's Supper as a sacrament is concerned, the Roman
          Catholic Church teaches that it works ex opere operato which means,
          "in virtue of the sacramental act itself, and not in virtue of the
          acts or disposition of the recipient, or of the worthiness of the
          minister (ex opere operantis)." This means that every one who receives
          the elements, be he wicked or pious, also receives the grace
          signified, which is conceived of as a substance contained in the
          elements. The sacramental rite itself conveys grace unto the
          recipient. At the same time it also teaches, rather inconsistently, it
          would seem, that the effects of the sacrament may be completely or
          partially frustrated by the existence of some obstacle, by the absence
          of that disposition that makes the soul capable of receiving grace, or
          by the priest's want of intention to do what the Church does.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The prevailing Protestant view. The prevailing view in the
          Protestant Churches is, that the sacrament does not work ex opere
          operato. It is not itself a cause of grace, but merely an instrument
          in the hand of God. Its effective operation is dependent, not only on
          the presence, but on the activity, of faith in the recipient.
          Unbelievers may receive the external elements, but do not receive the
          thing signified thereby. Some Lutherans and the High Church
          Episcopalians, however, in their desire to maintain the objective
          character of the sacrament, clearly manifest a leaning toward the
          position of the Church of Rome. "We believe, teach, and confess", says
          the Formula of Concord, "that not only true believers in Christ, and
          such as worthily approach the Supper of the Lord, but also the
          unworthy and unbelieving receive the true body and blood of Christ; in
          such wise, nevertheless, that they derive thence neither consolation
          nor life, but rather so as that receiving turns to their judgment and
          condemnation, unless they be converted and repent (1Co_11:27;
          1Co_11:29).66
        </p>
        <p>H. THE PERSONS FOR WHOM THE LORD'S SUPPER IS INSTITUTED.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE PROPER PARTICIPANTS OF THE SACRAMENT. In answer to the
          question, "For whom is the Lord's Supper instituted?" the Heidelberg
          Catechism says: "For those who are truly displeased with themselves
          for their sins and yet trust that these are forgiven them for the sake
          of Christ, and that their remaining infirmity is covered by His
          passion and death; who also desire more and more to strengthen their
          faith and amend their life." From these words it appears that the
          Lord's Supper was not instituted for all men indiscriminately, nor
          even for all those who have a place in the visible Church of Christ,
          but only for those who earnestly repent of their sins, trust that
          these have been covered by the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, and are
          desirous to increase their faith, and to grow in true holiness of
          life. The participants of the Lord's Supper must be repentant sinners,
          who are ready to admit that they are lost in themselves. They must
          have a living faith in Jesus Christ, so that they trust for their
          redemption in the atoning blood of the Saviour. Furthermore, they must
          have a proper understanding and appreciation of the Lord's Supper,
          must discern the difference between it and a common meal, and must be
          impressed with the fact that the bread and wine are the tokens of the
          body and blood of Christ. And, finally, they must have a holy desire
          for spiritual growth and for ever-increasing conformity to the image
          of Christ.

          2. THOSE WHO MUST BE EXCLUDED FROM THE LORD'S SUPPER. Since the Lord's
          Supper is a sacrament of and for the Church, it follows that they who
          are outside of the Church cannot partake of it. But it is necessary to
          make still further limitations. Not even every one that has a place in
          the Church can be admitted to the table of the Lord. The following
          exceptions should be noted:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Children, though they were allowed to eat the passover in the days
          of the Old Testament, cannot be permitted to partake of the table of
          the Lord, since they cannot meet the requirements for worthy
          participation. Paul insists on the necessity of self- examination
          previous to the celebration, when he says: "But let a man prove
          himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup",
          1Co_11:28, and children are not able to examine themselves. Moreover,
          he points out that, in order to partake of the Supper in a worthy
          manner, it is necessary to discern the body, 1Co_11:29, that is, to
          distinguish properly between the elements used in the Lord's Supper
          and ordinary bread and wine, by recognizing those elements as symbols
          of the body and blood of Christ. And this, too, is beyond the capacity
          of children. It is only after they have come to years of discretion,
          that they can be permitted to join in the celebration of the Lord's
          Supper.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Such unbelievers as may possibly be within the confines of the
          visible Church have no right to partake of the table of the Lord. The
          Church must require of all those who desire to celebrate the Lord's
          Supper a credible profession of faith. Naturally, she cannot look into
          the heart and can only base her judgment respecting an applicant for
          admission on his confession of faith in Jesus Christ. It is possible
          that she occasionally admits hypocrites to the privileges of full
          communion, but such persons in partaking of the Lord's Supper will
          only eat and drink judgment to themselves. And if their unbelief and
          ungodliness becomes evident, the Church will have to exclude them by
          the proper administration of Church discipline. The holiness of the
          Church and of the sacrament must be safeguarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Even true believers may not partake of the Lord's Supper under all
          conditions and in every frame of mind. The condition of their
          spiritual life, their conscious relation to God, and their attitude to
          their fellow-Christians may be such as to disqualify them to engage in
          such a spiritual exercise as the celebration of the Lord's Supper.
          This is clearly implied in what Paul says in 1Co_11:28-32. There were
          practices among the Corinthians which really made their participation
          in the Lord's Supper a mockery. When a person is conscious of being
          estranged from the Lord or from his brethren, he has no proper place
          at a table which speaks of communion. It should be stated explicitly,
          however, that lack of the assurance of salvation need not deter anyone
          from coming to the table of the Lord, since the Lord's Supper was
          instituted for the very purpose of strengthening faith.

          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: Can it be proved that the Lord's Supper
          took the place of the Old Testament passover? How? Is it permissible
          to cut the bread in squares before the administration of the Lord's
          Supper, and to use the individual cup? What does the term "real
          presence" mean in connection with this sacrament? Does the Bible teach
          such a real presence? If it does, does it favor the idea that the
          human nature of Christ is present in the state of humiliation, or in
          that of glorification? What is meant by the Reformed doctrine of the
          spiritual presence? Does the discourse of Jesus in Joh_6:1-71 really
          refer to the Lord's Supper? How does Rome defend the celebration of
          the Lord's Supper under one species? How did the conception of the
          Lord's Supper as a sacrifice arise? What objections are there to this
          notion? Does "eating the body" simply amount to believing in Christ?
          Is open communion defensible?
