        <p>VIII.The Kingly Office</p>
        <p>
          As the Second Person in the Holy Trinity, the eternal Son, Christ
          naturally shares the dominion of God over all His creatures. His
          throne is established in the heavens and His Kingdom ruleth over all,
          Psa_103:19. This kingship differs from the mediatorial kingship of
          Christ, which is a conferred and economical kingship, exercised by
          Christ, not merely in His divine nature, but as Theanthropos (the
          God-man). The latter is not a kingship that was Christ's by original
          right, but one with which He is invested. It does not pertain to a new
          realm, one that was not already under His control as Son of God, for
          such a realm can nowhere be found. It is rather, to speak in the words
          of Dick, His original kingship, "invested with a new form, wearing a
          new aspect, administered for a new end." In general we may define the
          mediatorial kingship of Christ as His official power to rule all
          things in heaven and on earth, for the glory of God, and for the
          execution of God's purpose of salvation. We must distinguish, however,
          between a regnum gratiae and a regnum potentiae.
        </p>
        <p>A. THE SPIRITUAL KINGSHIP OF CHRIST.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE NATURE OF THIS KINGSHIP. The spiritual kingship of Christ is
          His royal rule over the regnum gratiae, that is over His people or the
          Church. It is a spiritual kingship, because it relates to a spiritual
          realm. It is the mediatorial rule as it is established in the hearts
          and lives of believers. Moreover, it is spiritual, because it bears
          directly and immediately on a spiritual end, the salvation of His
          people. And, finally, it is spiritual, because it is administered, not
          by force or external means, but by the Word and the Spirit, which is
          the Spirit of truth and wisdom, of justice and holiness, of grace and
          mercy. This kingship reveals itself in the gathering of the Church,
          and in its government, protection, and perfection. The Bible speaks of
          it in many places, such as, Psa_2:6; Psa_45:6-7 (cf. Heb_1:8-9);
          Psa_132:11; Isa_9:6-7; Jer_23:5-6; Mic_5:2; Zec_6:13; Luk_1:33;
          Luk_19:37; Luk_19:38; Luk_22:29; Joh_18:36-37; Act_2:30-36, and other
          places. The spiritual nature of this kingship is indicated, among
          others, by the fact that Christ is repeatedly called the Head of the
          Church, Eph_1:22; Eph_4:15; Eph_5:23; Col_1:18; Col_2:19. This term,
          as applied to Christ, is in some cases practically equivalent to
          "King" (Head in a figurative sense, one clothed with authority), as in
          1Co_11:3; Eph_1:22; Eph_5:23; in other cases, however, it is used in a
          literal and organic sense, Eph_4:15; Col_1:18; Col_2:19, and in part
          also Eph_1:22. The word is never used (except it be in 1Co_11:3)
          without the implication of this organic conception. The two ideas are
          most intimately connected. It is just because Christ is the Head of
          the Church that He can rule it as King in an organic and spiritual
          way. The relation between the two may be indicated as follows: (1) The
          headship of Christ points to the mystical union between Christ and His
          body, the Church, and therefore belongs to the sphere of being. His
          kingship, however, implies that He is clothed with authority, and
          belongs to the judicial sphere. (2) The headship of Christ is
          subservient to His kingship. The Spirit which Christ, as the Head of
          the Church, imparts to it, is also the means by which He exercises His
          royal power in and over the Church. Present day Premillenarians
          strongly insist that Christ is the Head of the Church, but as a rule
          deny that He is its King. This is tantamount to saying that He is not
          the authoritative Ruler of the Church, and that the officers of the
          Church do not represent Him in the government of the Church. They not
          only refuse to admit that He is the King of the Church, but deny His
          present kingship altogether, except, perhaps, as a kingship de jure, a
          kingship which is His by right but has not yet become effective. At
          the same time their practice is better than their theory, for in
          practical life they do, rather inconsistently, recognize the authority
          of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE KINGDOM OVER WHICH IT EXTENDS. This kingdom has the following
          characteristics:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. It is grounded in the work of redemption. The regnum gratiae did
          not originate in the creative work of God but, as the name itself
          indicates, in His redeeming grace. No one is a citizen of this kingdom
          in virtue of his humanity. Only the redeemed have that honour and
          privilege. Christ paid the ransom for those that are His, and by His
          Spirit applies to them the merits of His perfect sacrifice.
          Consequently, they now belong to Him and recognize Him as their Lord
          and King.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. It is a spiritual Kingdom. In the Old Testament dispensation this
          kingdom was adumbrated in the theocratic kingdom of Israel. Even in
          the old dispensation the reality of this kingdom was found only in the
          inner life of believers. The national kingdom of Israel, in which God
          was King, Lawgiver, and Judge, and the earthly king was only the
          vicegerent of Jehovah, appointed to represent the King, to carry out
          His will, and to execute His judgments, was only a symbol, and a
          shadow and type of that glorious reality, especially as it was
          destined to appear in the days of the New Testament. With the coming
          of the new dispensation all the Old Testament shadows passed away, and
          among them also the theocratic kingdom. Out of the womb of Israel the
          spiritual reality of the kingdom came forth and assumed an existence
          independent of the Old Testament theocracy. Hence the spiritual
          character of the kingdom stands forth far more clearly in the New
          Testament than it does in the Old. The regnum gratiae of Christ is
          identical with what the New Testament calls the kingdom of God or of
          heaven. Christ is its mediatorial King. Premillenarians mistakenly
          teach that the terms "kingdom of God" and "kingdom of heaven," as they
          are used in the Gospels, refer to two different realities, namely, to
          the universal kingdom of God and the future mediatorial kingdom of
          Christ. It is perfectly evident, as some of their own leaders feel
          constrained to admit, that the two terms are used interchangeably in
          the Gospels. This appears from the fact that, while Matthew and Luke
          often report the same statements of Jesus, the former represents Him
          as using the term "kingdom of heaven," and the latter substitutes for
          it the term "kingdom of God," compare Mat_13:1-58 with Mar_4:1-41;
          Luk_8:1-10, and many other passages. The spiritual nature of the
          kingdom is brought out in several ways. Negatively, it is clearly
          indicated that the kingdom is not an external and natural kingdom of
          the Jews, Mat_8:11-12; Mat_21:43; Luk_17:21; Joh_18:36. Positively, we
          are taught that it can be entered only by regeneration, Joh_3:3;
          Joh_3:5; that it is like a seed cast into the earth, Mar_4:26-29, like
          a mustard seed, Mar_4:30, and like a leaven, Mat_13:33. It is in the
          hearts of people, Luk_17:21, "is righteousness and peace and joy in
          the Holy Spirit," Rom_14:17, and is not of this world, but a kingdom
          of the truth, Joh_18:36-37. The citizens of the kingdom are described
          as the poor in spirit, the meek, the merciful, the peacemakers, the
          pure in heart, and those that hunger and thirst for righteousness. The
          spiritual nature of the Kingdom should be stressed over against all
          those who deny the present reality of the mediatorial kingdom of God
          and hold that it will take the form of a re-established theocracy at
          the return of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          In connection with the present day tendency to regard the kingdom of
          God simply as a new social condition, an ethical kingdom of ends, to
          be established by human endeavors, such as education, legal
          enactments, and social reforms, it is well to bear in mind that the
          term "kingdom of God" is not always used in the same sense.
          Fundamentally, the term denotes an abstract rather than a concrete
          idea, namely, the rule of God established and acknowledged in the
          hearts of sinners. If this is clearly understood, the futility of all
          human efforts and of all mere externals is at once apparent. By no
          mere human endeavors can the rule of God be established in the heart
          of a single man, nor can any man be brought to a recognition of that
          rule. In the measure in which God establishes His rule in the hearts
          of sinners, He creates for Himself a realm in which He rules and in
          which He dispenses the greatest privileges and the choicest blessings.
          And, again, in the proportion in which man responds to the rule of God
          and obeys the laws of the kingdom, a new condition of things will
          naturally result. In fact, if all those who are now citizens of the
          Kingdom would actually obey its laws in every domain of life, the
          world would be so different that it would hardly be recognized. In
          view of all that has been said, it causes no surprise that the term
          "kingdom of God" is used in various senses in Scripture, as, for
          instance, to denote the kingship of God or of the Messiah, Mat_6:10;
          the realm over which this rule extends and the condition of things to
          which it gives rise, Mat_7:21; Mat_19:23-24; Mat_8:12; the totality of
          the blessings and privileges that flow from the reign of God or of the
          Messiah, Mat_13:44-45; and the condition of things that marks the
          triumphant culmination of the reign of God in Christ, Mat_22:2-14;
          Luk_14:16-24; Luk_13:29.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. It is a kingdom that is both present and future. It is on the one
          hand a present, ever developing, spiritual reality in the hearts and
          lives of men, and as such exercises influence in a constantly widening
          sphere. Jesus and the apostles clearly refer to the kingdom as already
          present in their time, Mat_12:28; Luk_17:21; Col_1:13. This must be
          maintained over against the great majority of present day
          Premillenarians. On the other hand it is also a future hope, an
          eschatological reality; in fact, the eschatological aspect of the
          kingdom is the more prominent of the two, Mat_7:21-22; Mat_19:23;
          Mat_22:2-14; Mat_25:1-13Mat_25:34; Luk_22:29-30; 1Co_6:9; 1Co_15:50;
          Gal_5:21; Eph_5:5; 1Th_2:12; 2Ti_4:18; Heb_12:28; 2Pe_1:11.
          Essentially the future kingdom will consist, like that of the present,
          in the rule of God established and acknowledged in the hearts of men.
          But at the glorious coming of Jesus Christ this establishment and
          acknowledgment will be perfected, the hidden forces of the kingdom
          will stand revealed, and the spiritual rule of Christ will find its
          consummation in a visible and majestic reign. It is a mistake,
          however, to assume that the present kingdom will develop almost
          imperceptibly into the kingdom of the future. The Bible clearly
          teaches us that the future kingdom will be ushered in by great
          cataclysmic changes, Mat_24:21-44; Luk_17:22-37; Luk_21:5-33;
          1Th_5:2-3; 2Pe_3:10-12.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. It is closely related to the Church, though not altogether
          identical with it. The citizenship of the kingdom is co-extensive with
          the membership in the invisible Church. Its field of operation,
          however, is wider than that of the Church, since it aims at the
          control of life in all its manifestations. The visible Church is the
          most important, and the only divinely instituted, external
          organization of the kingdom. At the same time it is also the God-given
          means par excellence for the extension of the kingdom of God on earth.
          It is well to note that the term "kingdom of God" is sometimes
          employed in a sense which makes it practically equivalent to the
          visible Church, Mat_8:12; Mat_13:24-30; Mat_13:47-50. While the Church
          and the kingdom must be distinguished, the distinction should not be
          sought along the lines indicated by Premillennialism, which regards
          the kingdom as essentially a kingdom of Israel, and the Church as the
          body of Christ, gathered in the present dispensation out of Jews and
          Gentiles. Israel was the Church of the Old Testament and in its
          spiritual essence constitutes a unity with the Church of the New
          Testament, Act_7:38; Rom_11:11-24; Gal_3:7-9; Gal_3:29; Eph_2:11-22.
        </p>
        <p>3. T HE DURATION OF THIS KINGSHIP.</p>
        <p>
          a. Its beginning. Opinions differ on this point. Consistent
          Premillenarians deny the present mediatorial kingship of Christ, and
          believe that He will not be seated upon the throne as Mediator until
          He ushers in the millennium at the time of His second advent. And the
          Socinians claim that Christ was neither priest nor king before His
          ascension. The generally accepted position of the Church is that
          Christ received His appointment as mediatorial King in the depths of
          eternity, and that He began to function as such immediately after the
          fall, Pro_8:23; Psa_2:6. During the old dispensation He carried on His
          work as King partly through the judges of Israel, and partly through
          the typical kings. But though He was permitted to rule as Mediator
          even before His incarnation, He did not publicly and formally assume
          His throne and inaugurate His spiritual kingdom until the time of His
          ascension and elevation at the right hand of God, Act_2:29-36;
          Php_2:5-11.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Its termination (?). The prevailing opinion is that the spiritual
          kingship of Christ over His Church will, as to its essential
          character, continue eternally, though it will undergo important
          changes in its mode of operation at the consummation of the world. The
          eternal duration of the spiritual kingship of Christ would seem to be
          explicitly taught in the following passages: Psa_45:6 (comp. Heb_1:8);
          Psa_72:17; Psa_89:36-37; Isa_9:7; Dan_2:24; 2Sa_7:13; 2Sa_7:19;
          Luk_1:33; 2Pe_1:11. The Heidelberg Catechism also speaks of Christ as
          "our eternal king." Similarly the Belgic Confession in article XXVII.
          Moreover, the kingship and the headship of Christ are inextricably
          bound up together. The latter is subservient to the former, and is
          sometimes clearly represented as including the former, Eph_1:21-22;
          Eph_5:22-24. But, surely, Christ will never cease to be the Head of
          His Church, leaving the Church as a body without a Head. Finally, the
          fact that Christ is a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek,
          would also seem to argue in favor of the eternal duration of the
          spiritual kingship of Christ, since His mediatorial office is after
          all a unit. Dick and Kuyper, however, argue that this kingship of
          Christ will cease when He has accomplished the salvation of His
          people. The only passage of Scripture to which they appeal is
          1Co_15:24-28, but this passage evidently does not refer to Christ's
          spiritual kingship, but to His kingship over the universe.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE KINGSHIP OF CHRIST OVER THE UNIVERSE.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE NATURE OF THIS KINGSHIP. By the regnum potentiae we mean the
          dominion of the God-man, Jesus Christ, over the universe, His
          providential and judicial administration of all things in the interest
          of the Church. As King of the universe the Mediator so guides the
          destinies of individuals, of social groups, and of nations, as to
          promote the growth, the gradual purification, and the final perfection
          of the people which He has redeemed by His blood. In that capacity He
          also protects His own against the dangers to which they are exposed in
          the world, and vindicates His righteousness by the subjection and
          destruction of all His enemies. In this kingship of Christ we find the
          initial restoration of the original kingship of man. The idea that
          Christ now rules the destinies of individuals and nations in the
          interest of His blood-bought Church, is a far more comforting thought
          than the notion that He is now "a refugee on the throne of heaven."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE RELATION OF THE REGNUM POTENTIAE TO THE REGNUM GRATIAE. The
          Kingship of Christ over the universe is subservient to His spiritual
          kingship. It is incumbent on Christ, as the anointed King, to
          establish the spiritual kingdom of God, to govern it, and to protect
          it against all hostile forces. He must do this in a world which is
          under the power of sin and is bent on thwarting all spiritual
          endeavors. If that world were beyond His control, it might easily
          frustrate all His efforts. Therefore God invested Him with authority
          over it, so that He is able to control all powers and forces and
          movements in the world, and can thus secure a safe footing for His
          people in the world, and protect His own against all the powers of
          darkness. These cannot defeat His purposes, but are even constrained
          to serve them. Under the beneficent rule of Christ even the wrath of
          man is made to praise God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE DURATION OF THIS KINGSHIP. Christ was formally invested with
          this kingship over the universe when He was exalted at the right hand
          of God. It was a promised reward of His labors, Psa_2:8-9; Mat_28:18;
          Eph_1:20-22; Php_2:9-11. This investiture was part of the exaltation
          of the God-man. It did not give Him any power or authority which He
          did not already possess as the Son of God; neither did it increase His
          territory. But the God-man, the Mediator, was now made the possessor
          of this authority, and His human nature was made to share in the glory
          of this royal dominion. Moreover, the government of the world was now
          made subservient to the interests of the Church of Jesus Christ. And
          this kingship of Christ will last until the victory over the enemies
          is complete and even death has been abolished, 1Co_15:24-28. At the
          consummation of all things the God-man will give up the authority
          conferred on Him for a special purpose, since it will no more be
          needed. He will return His commission to God, that God may be all in
          all. The purpose is accomplished; mankind is redeemed; and thereby the
          original kingship of man is restored.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: In whom was Christ typified as prophet in
          the Old Testament? How were the true prophets distinguished from the
          false? How did prophets and priests differ as teachers? What was
          characteristic of the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek? Were
          the sacrifices of Cain and Abel piacular? On what grounds do Jowett,
          Maurice, Young, and Bushnell deny the vicarious and typico-
          prophetical character of the Mosaic sacrifices? What is the difference
          between atonement, propitiation, reconciliation, and redemption? What
          accounts for the widespread aversion to the objective character of the
          atonement? What arguments are advanced to disprove the necessity of
          the atonement? Why is penal substitution practically impossible among
          men? Does the universal offer of salvation necessarily imply a
          universal atonement? What becomes of the doctrine of the atonement in
          modern liberal theology? What two parakletoi have we according to
          Scripture, and how does their work differ? What is the nature of the
          intercessory work of Christ? Are our intercessory prayers like those
          of Christ? Is Christ ever called "King of the Jews"? Do
          Premillenarians deny only the present spiritual kingship of Christ or
          also His Kingship over the universe?
