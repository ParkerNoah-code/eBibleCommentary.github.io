        <p>IV. Man in the Covenant of Works</p>
        <p>
          The discussion of the original state of man, thestatus integritatis,
          would not be complete without considering the mutual relationship
          between God and man, and especially the origin and nature of the
          religious life of man. That life was rooted in a covenant, just as the
          Christian life is today, and that covenant is variously known as the
          covenant of nature, the covenant of life, the Edenic covenant, and the
          covenant of works. The first name, which was rather common at first,
          was gradually abandoned, since it was apt to give the impression that
          this covenant was simply a part of the natural relationship in which
          man stood to God. The second and third names are not sufficiently
          specific, since both of them might also be applied to the covenant of
          grace, which is certainly a covenant of life, and also originated in
          Eden, Gen_3:15. Consequently the name "Covenant of Works" deserves
          preference.
        </p>
        <p>A. THE DOCTRINE OF THE COVENANT OF WORKS IN HISTORY.</p>
        <p>
          The history of the doctrine of the covenant of works is comparatively
          brief. In the early Church Fathers the covenant idea is seldom found
          at all, though the elements which it includes, namely, the
          probationary command, the freedom of choice, and the possibility of
          sin and death, are all mentioned. Augustine in his de Civitates Dei
          speaks of the relation in which Adam originally stood to God as a
          covenant (testamentum, pactum), while some others inferred the
          original covenant relationship from the well known passage of Hos_6:7.
          In the scholastic literature and in the writings of the Reformers,
          too, all the elements which later on went into the construction of the
          doctrine of the covenant of works were already present, but the
          doctrine itself was not yet developed. Though they contain some
          expressions which point to the imputation of Adam's sin to his
          descendants, it is clear that on the whole the transmission of sin was
          conceived realistically rather than federally. Says Thornwell in his
          analysis of Calvin's Institutes: "Federal representation was not
          seized as it should be, but a mystic realism in place of it."26 The
          development of the doctrine of the covenant of grace preceded that of
          the doctrine of the covenant of works and paved the way for it. When
          it was clearly seen that Scripture represented the way of salvation in
          the form of a covenant, the parallel which Paul draws in Rom_5:1-21
          between Adam and Christ soon gave occasion for thinking of the state
          of integrity also as a covenant. According to Heppe the first work
          which contained the federal representation of the way of salvation,
          was Bullinger's Compendium of the Christian Religion; and Olevianus
          was the real founder of a well developed federal theology, in which
          the concept of the covenant became for the first time the constitutive
          and determinative principle of the entire system.27 From the Reformed
          Churches of Switzerland and Germany federal theology passed over to
          the Netherlands and to the British Isles, especially Scotland. Its
          earliest representatives in the Netherlands were Gomarus, Trelcatius,
          Ravensperger, and especially Cloppenburg. The latter is regarded as
          the forerunner of Coccejus, who is often mistakenly called "the father
          of federal theology." The real distinction of Coccejus lies, at least
          partly, in the fact that he sought to substitute for the usual
          scholastic method of studying theology, which was rather common in his
          day, what he considered a more Scriptural method. He was followed in
          that respect by Burmannus and Witsius. Coccejus and his followers were
          not the only ones to embrace the doctrine of the covenant of works.
          This was done by others as well, such as Voetius, Mastricht, Ã  Marck,
          and De Moor. Ypeij and Dermout point out that in those days a denial
          of the covenant of works was regarded as a heresy.28 The Socinians
          rejected this doctrine altogether, since they did not believe in the
          imputation of Adam's sin to his descendants; and some of the
          Arminians, such as Episcopius, Limborgh, Venema, and J. Alting, who
          called it a human doctrine, followed suit. About the middle of the
          eighteenth century, when the doctrine of the covenant in the
          Netherlands had all but passed into oblivion, Comrie and Holtius in
          their Examen van het Ontwerp van Tolerantie once more brought it to
          the attention of the Church. In Scotland several important works were
          written on the covenants, including the covenant of works, such as
          those of Fisher (Marrow of Modern Divinity), Ball, Blake, Gib, and
          Boston. Says Walker: "The old theology of Scotland might be
          emphatically described as covenant theology."29 The doctrine found
          official recognition in the Westminster Confession, and in the Formula
          Consensus Helvetica. It is significant that the doctrine of works met
          with very little response in Roman Catholic and Lutheran theology.
          This finds its explanation in their attitude to the doctrine of the
          immediate imputation of the sin of Adam to his descendants. Under the
          influence of Rationalism and of PlacÃ¦us' theory of mediate
          imputation, which also found acceptance in New England theology, the
          doctrine of the covenant gradually suffered eclipse. Even such
          conservative scholars as Doedes and Van Oosterzee in the Netherlands
          rejected it; and in New England theology it was short-lived. In
          Scotland the situation is not much better. Hugh Martin already wrote
          in his work on The Atonement (published in 1887): "It has come to
          pass, we fear, that the federal theology is at present suffering a
          measure of neglect which does not bode well for the immediate future
          of the Church amongst us."30 And while in our own country such
          Presbyterian scholars as the Hodges, Thornwell, Breckenridge, and
          Dabney, take due account of the doctrine in their theological works,
          in the Churches which they represent it has all but lost its vitality.
          In the Netherlands there has been a revival of federal theology under
          the influence of Kuyper and Bavinck, and through the grace of God it
          still continues to be a living reality in the hearts and minds of the
          people.

        <p>
          B. THE SCRIPTURAL FOUNDATION FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE COVENANT OF
          WORKS.
        </p>
        <p>
          The widespread denial of the covenant of works makes it imperative to
          examine its Scriptural foundation with care.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE ELEMENTS OF A COVENANT ARE PRESENT IN THE EARLY NARRATIVE. It
          must be admitted that the term "covenant" is not found in the first
          three chapters of Genesis, but this is not tantamount to saying that
          they do not contain the necessary data for the construction of a
          doctrine of the covenant. One would hardly infer from the absence of
          the term "trinity" that the doctrine of the Trinity is not found in
          the Bible. All the elements of a covenant are indicated in Scripture,
          and if the elements are present, we are not only warranted but, in a
          systematic study of the doctrine, also in duty bound to relate them to
          one another, and to give the doctrine so construed an appropriate
          name. In the case under consideration two parties are named, a
          condition is laid down, a promise of reward for obedience is clearly
          implied, and a penalty for transgression is threatened. It may still
          be objected that we do not read of the two parties as coming to an
          agreement, nor of Adam as accepting the terms laid down, but this is
          not an insuperable objection. We do not read of such an explicit
          agreement and acceptance on the part of man either in the cases of
          Noah and Abraham. God and man do not appear as equals in any of these
          covenants. All God's covenants are of the nature of sovereign
          dispositions imposed on man. God is absolutely sovereign in His
          dealings with man, and has the perfect right to lay down the
          conditions which the latter must meet, in order to enjoy His favor.
          Moreover Adam was, even in virtue of his natural relationship, in duty
          bound to obey God; and when the covenant relation was established,
          this obedience also became a matter of self-interest. When entering
          into covenant relations with men, it is always God who lays down the
          terms, and they are very gracious terms, so that He has, also from
          that point of view, a perfect right to expect that man will assent to
          them. In the case under consideration God had but to announce the
          covenant, and the perfect state in which Adam lived was a sufficient
          guarantee for his acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THERE WAS A PROMISE OF ETERNAL LIFE. Some deny that there is any
          Scripture evidence for such a promise. Now it is perfectly true that
          no such promise is explicitly recorded, but it is clearly implied in
          the alternative of death as the result of disobedience. The clear
          implication of the threatened punishment is that in the case of
          obedience death would not enter, and this can only mean that life
          would continue. It has been objected that this would only mean a
          continuation of Adam's natural life, and not what Scripture calls life
          eternal. But the Scriptural idea of life is life in communion with
          God; and this is the life which Adam possessed, though in his case it
          was still amissible. If Adam stood the test, this life would be
          retained not only, but would cease to be amissible, and would
          therefore be lifted to a higher plane. Paul tells us explicitly in
          Rom_7:10 that the commandment, that is the law, was unto life. In
          commenting on this verse Hodge says: "The law was designed and adapted
          to secure life, but became in fact the cause of death." This is also
          clearly indicated in such passages as Rom_10:5; Gal_3:13. Now it is
          generally admitted that this glorious promise of unending life was in
          no way implied in the natural relation in which Adam stood to God, but
          had a different basis. But to admit that there is something positive
          here, a special condescension of God, is an acceptance of the covenant
          principle. There may still be some doubt as to the propriety of the
          name "Covenant of Works," but there can be no valid objection to the
          covenant idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. BASICALLY, THE COVENANT OF GRACE IS SIMPLY THE EXECUTION OF THE
          ORIGINAL AGREEMENT BY CHRIST AS OUR SURETY. He undertook freely to
          carry out the will of God. He placed Himself under the law, that He
          might redeem them that were under the law, and were no more in a
          position to obtain life by their own fulfilment of the law. He came to
          do what Adam failed to do, and did it in virtue of a covenant
          agreement. And if this is so, and the covenant of grace is, as far as
          Christ is concerned, simply the carrying out of the original
          agreement, it follows that the latter must also have been of the
          nature of a covenant. And since Christ met the condition of the
          covenant of works, man can now reap the fruit of the original
          agreement by faith in Jesus Christ. There are now two ways of life,
          which are in themselves ways of life, the one is the way of the law:
          "the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live
          thereby," but it is a way by which man can no more find life; and the
          other is the way of faith in Jesus Christ, who met the demands of the
          law, and is now able to dispense the blessing of eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE PARALLEL BETWEEN ADAM AND CHRIST. The parallel which Paul draws
          between Adam and Christ in Rom_5:12-21, in connection with the
          doctrine of justification, can only be explained on the assumption
          that Adam, like Christ, was the head of a covenant. According to Paul
          the essential element in justification consists in this, that the
          righteousness of Christ is imputed to us, without any personal work on
          our part to merit it. And he regards this as a perfect parallel to the
          manner in which the guilt of Adam is imputed to us. This naturally
          leads to the conclusion that Adam also stood in covenant relationship
          to his descendants.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. THE PASSAGE IN Hos_6:7. In Hos_6:7 we read: "But they like Adam
          have transgressed the covenant." Attempts have been made to discredit
          this reading. Some have suggested the reading "at Adam," which would
          imply that some well-known transgression occurred at a place called
          Adam. But the preposition forbids this rendering. Moreover, the Bible
          makes no mention whatever of such a well-known historical
          transgression at Adam. The Authorized Version renders "like men,"
          which would then mean, in human fashion. To this it may be objected
          that there is no plural in the original, and that such a statement
          would be rather inane, since man could hardly transgress in any other
          way. The rendering "like Adam" is after all the best. It is favored by
          the parallel passage in Job_31:33; and is adopted by the American
          Revised Version.
        </p>
        <p>C. ELEMENTS OF THE COVENANT OF WORKS.</p>
        <p>The following elements must be distinguished:</p>
        <p>
          1. THE CONTRACTING PARTIES. On the one hand there was the triune God,
          the Creator and Lord, and on the other hand, Adam as His dependent
          creature. A twofold relationship between the two should be
          distinguished:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The natural relationship. When God created man, He by that very
          fact established a natural relationship between Himself and man. It
          was a relationship like that between the potter and the clay, between
          an absolute sovereign and a subject devoid of any claim. In fact, the
          distance between the two was so great that these figures are not even
          an adequate expression of it. It was such that a life in communion
          with each other seemed to be out of the question. As the creature of
          God man was naturally under the law, and was in duty bound to keep it.
          And while transgression of the law would render him liable to
          punishment, the keeping of it would not constitute an inherent claim
          to a reward. Even if he did all that was required of him, he would
          still have to say, I am but an unprofitable servant, for I have merely
          done that which it was my duty to do. Under this purely natural
          relationship man could not have merited anything. But though the
          infinite distance between God and man apparently excluded a life of
          communion with each other, man was created for just such communion,
          and the possibility of it was already given in his creation in the
          image of God. In this natural relationship Adam was the father of the
          human race.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The covenant relationship. From the very beginning, however. God
          revealed Himself, not only as an absolute Sovereign and Lawgiver, but
          also as a loving Father, seeking the welfare and happiness of His
          dependent creature. He condescended to come down to the level of man,
          to reveal Himself as a Friend, and to enable man to improve his
          condition in the way of obedience. In addition to the natural
          relationship He, by a positive enactment, graciously established a
          covenant relationship. He entered into a legal compact with man, which
          includes all the requirements and obligations implied in the
          creaturehood of man, but at the same time added some new elements. (1)
          Adam was constituted the representative head of the human race, so
          that he could act for all his descendants. (2) He was temporarily put
          on probation, in order to determine whether he would willingly subject
          his will to the will of God. (3) He was given the promise of eternal
          life in the way of obedience, and thus by the gracious disposition of
          God acquired certain conditional rights. This covenant enabled Adam to
          obtain eternal life for himself and for his descendants in the way of
          obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE PROMISE OF THE COVENANT. The great promise of the covenant of
          works was the promise of eternal life. They who deny the covenant of
          works generally base their denial in part on the fact that there is no
          record of such a promise in the Bible. And it is perfectly true that
          Scripture contains no explicit promise of eternal life to Adam. But
          the threatened penalty clearly implies such a promise. When the Lord
          says, "for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die,"
          his statement clearly implies that, if Adam refrains from eating, he
          will not die, but will be raised above the possibility of death. The
          implied promise certainly cannot mean that, in the case of obedience,
          Adam would be permitted to live on in the usual way, that is, to
          continue the ordinary natural life, for that life was his already in
          virtue of his creation, and therefore could not be held out as a
          reward for obedience. The implied promise evidently was that of life
          raised to its highest development of perennial bliss and glory. Adam
          was indeed created in a state of positive holiness, and was also
          immortal in the sense that he was not subject to the law of death. But
          he was only at the beginning of his course and did not yet possess the
          highest privileges that were in store for man. He was not yet raised
          above the possibility of erring, sinning, and dying. He was not yet in
          possession of the highest degree of holiness, nor did he enjoy life in
          all its fulness. The image of God in man was still limited by the
          possibility of man's sinning against God, changing from good to evil,
          and becoming subject to the power of death. The promise of life in the
          covenant of works was a promise of the removal of all the limitations
          of life to which Adam was still subject, and of the raising of his
          life to the highest degree of perfection. When Paul says in Rom_7:10
          that the commandment was unto life, he means life in the fullest sense
          of the word. The principle of the covenant of works was: the man that
          does these things shall live thereby; and this principle is reiterated
          time and again in Scripture, Lev_18:5; Eze_20:11; Eze_20:13;
          Eze_20:20; Luk_10:28l Rom_10:5; Gal_3:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE CONDITION OF THE COVENANT. The promise in the covenant of works
          was not unconditional. The condition was that of implicit and perfect
          obedience. The divine law can demand nothing less than that, and the
          positive command not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge
          of good and evil, relating as it did, to a thing indifferent in
          itself, was clearly a test of pure obedience in the absolute sense of
          the word. Man was, of course, also subject to the moral law of God,
          which was written on the tablets of his heart. He knew this by nature,
          so that it did not have to be revealed supernaturally, as the special
          test was. Essentially, the moral law, as Adam knew it, was undoubtedly
          like the ten commandments, but the form was different. In its present
          form the moral law presupposes a knowledge of sin, and is therefore
          primarily negative; in Adam's heart, however, it must have had a
          positive character. But just because it was positive, it did not bring
          to his consciousness the possibility of sin. Therefore a negative
          commandment was added. Moreover, in order that the test of Adam might
          be a test of pure obedience, God deemed it necessary to add to the
          commandments of which Adam perceived the naturalness and
          reasonableness, a commandment which was in a certain sense arbitrary
          and indifferent. Thus the demands of the law were, so to say,
          concentrated on a single point. The great question that had to be
          settled was, whether man would obey God implicitly or follow the
          guidance of his own judgment. Dr. Bavinck says: "Het proefgebod
          belichaamde voor hem (Adam) het dilemma: God of de mensch, Zijn gezag
          of eigen inzicht, onvoorwaardelijke gehoorzaamheid of zelfstandig
          onderzoek, geloof of twijfel."31
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE PENALTY OF THE COVENANT. The penalty that was threatened was
          death, and what this means can best be gathered from the general
          meaning of the term as it is used in Scripture, and from the evils
          that came upon the guilty in the execution of the penalty. Evidently
          death in the most inclusive sense of the word is meant, including
          physical, spiritual, and eternal death. The fundamental Scriptural
          idea of death is not that of extinction of being, but that of
          separation from the source of life, and the resulting dissolution or
          misery and woe. Fundamentally, it consists in the separation of the
          soul from God, which manifests itself in spiritual misery, and finally
          terminates in eternal death. But it also includes the separation of
          body and soul and the consequent dissolution of the body. Undoubtedly
          the execution of the penalty began at once after the first
          transgression. Spiritual death entered instantly, and the seeds of
          death also began to operate in the body. The full execution of the
          sentence, however, did not follow at once, but was arrested, because
          God immediately introduced an economy of grace and restoration.

          5. THE SACRAMENT(S) OF THE COVENANT. We have no definite information
          in Scripture respecting the sacrament(s) or seal(s) of this covenant.
          Hence there is a great variety of opinions on the subject. Some speak
          of four: the tree of life, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
          paradise, and the sabbath; others of three: the two trees and
          paradise; still others of two: the tree of life and paradise; and
          still others of one: the tree of life. The last opinion is the most
          prevalent one, and would seem to be the only one to find any support
          in Scripture. We should not think of the fruit of this tree as
          magically or medically working immortality in Adam's frame. Yet it was
          in some way connected with the gift of life. In all probability it
          must be conceived of as an appointed symbol or seal of life.
          Consequently, when Adam forfeited the promise, he was debarred from
          the sign. So conceived the words of Gen_3:22 must be understood
          sacramentally.

        <p>D. THE PRESENT STTATUS OF THE COVENANT OF WORKS.</p>
        <p>
          With respect to the question, whether the covenant of works is still
          in force or was abrogated at the time of Adam's fall, there is
          considerable difference of opinion between Arminian and Reformed
          theologians.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE ARMINIAN VIEW. Arminians claim that this legal covenant was
          wholly abrogated at the fall of Adam, and argue this as follows: (a)
          The promise was then revoked and thus the compact annulled, and where
          there is no compact there can be no obligation. (b) God could not
          continue to exact obedience of man, when the latter was by nature
          unable, and was not enabled by the grace of God, to render the
          required service. (c) It would be derogatory to God's wisdom,
          holiness, and majesty to call the depraved creature to a service of
          holy and undivided love. They maintain that God established a new
          covenant and enacted a new law, the law of faith and evangelical
          obedience, which man in spite of his impaired powers can keep when
          assisted by the enabling helps of common or sufficient grace. However,
          the following considerations militate against this view: (a) Man's
          obligation to God was never rooted merely in the covenant requirement,
          but fundamentally in the natural relation in which he stood to God.
          This natural relationship was incorporated in the covenant
          relationship. (b) Man's inability is self-induced, and therefore does
          not relieve him of his just obligation. His self-imposed limitations,
          his criminal and voluntary hostility to God did not deprive the
          sovereign Ruler of the universe of the right to demand the hearty and
          loving service which is His due. (c) The reductio ad absurdum of the
          Arminian view is that the sinner can gain complete emancipation from
          righteous obligations by sinning. The more a man sins, the more he
          becomes a slave of sin, unable to do that which is good; and the
          deeper he sinks into this slavery which robs him of his capacity for
          good, the less responsible he becomes. If man continues to sin long
          enough, he will in the end be absolved of all moral responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE REFORMED VIEW. Even some Reformed theologians speak of the
          abrogation of the legal covenant, and seek proof for this in such
          passages as Heb_8:13. This naturally raised the question, whether, and
          in how far, the covenant of works can be considered as a thing of the
          past; or whether, and in how far, it must be regarded as still in
          force. It is generally agreed that no change in the legal status of
          man can ever abrogate the authority of the law; that God's claim to
          the obedience of His creatures is not terminated by their fall in sin
          and its disabling effects; that the wages of sin continues to be
          death; and that a perfect obedience is always required to merit
          eternal life. This means with respect to the question under
          consideration:
        </p>
        <p>
          a.That the covenant of works is not abrogated: (1) in so far as the
          natural relation of man to God was incorporated in it, since man
          always owes God perfect obedience; (2) in so far as its curse and
          punishment for those who continue in sin are concerned; and (3) in so
          far as the conditional promise still holds. God might have withdrawn
          this promise, but did not, Lev_18:5; Rom_10:5; Gal_3:12. It is
          evident, however, that after the fall no one can comply with the
          condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. That the covenant of works is abrogated: (1) in so far as it
          contained new positive elements, for those who are under the covenant
          of grace; this does not mean that it is simply set aside and
          disregarded, but that its obligations were met by the Mediator for His
          people; and (2) as an appointed means to obtain eternal life, for as
          such it is powerless after the fall of man.
