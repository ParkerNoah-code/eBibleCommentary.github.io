        <p>III. Creation in General</p>
        <p>
          The discussion of the decrees naturally leads on to the consideration
          of their execution, and this begins with the work of creation. This is
          not only first in order of time, but is also a logical prius. It is
          the beginning and basis of all divine revelation, and consequently
          also the foundation of all ethical and religious life. The doctrine of
          creation is not set forth in Scripture as a philosophical solution of
          the problem of the world, but in its ethical and religious
          significance, as a revelation of the relation of man to his God. It
          stresses the fact that God is the origin of all things, and that all
          things belong to Him and are subject to Him. The knowledge of it is
          derived from Scripture only and is accepted by faith (Heb_11:3),
          though Roman Catholics maintain that it can also be gathered from
          nature.
        </p>
        <p>A. THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION IN HISTORY</p>
        <p>
          While Greek philosophy sought the explanation of the world in a
          dualism, which involves the eternity of matter, or in a process of
          emanation, which makes the world the outward manifestation of God, the
          Christian Church from the very beginning taught the doctrine of
          creation ex nihilo and as a free act of God. This doctrine was
          accepted with singular unanimity from the start. It is found in Justin
          Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and
          others. Theophilus was the first Church Father to stress the fact that
          the days of creation were literal days. This seems to have been the
          view of Irenaeus and Tertullian as well, and was in all probability
          the common view in the Church. Clement and Origen thought of creation
          as having been accomplished in a single indivisible moment, and
          conceived of its description as the work of several days merely as a
          literary device to describe the origin of things in the order of their
          worth or of their logical connection. The idea of an eternal creation,
          as taught by Origen, was commonly rejected. At the same time some of
          the Church Fathers expressed the idea that God was always Creator,
          though the created universe began in time. During the trinitarian
          controversy some of them emphasized the fact that, in distinction from
          the generation of the Son, which was a necessary act of the Father,
          the creation of the world was a free act of the triune God. Augustine
          dealt with the work of creation more in detail than others did. He
          argues that creation was eternally in the will of God, and therefore
          brought no change in Him. There was no time before creation, since the
          world was brought into being with time rather than in time. The
          question what God did in the many ages before creation is based on a
          misconception of eternity. While the Church in general still seems to
          have held that the world was created in six ordinary days, Augustine
          suggested a somewhat different view. He strongly defended the doctrine
          of creatio ex nihilo, but distinguished two moments of creation: the
          production of matter and spirits out of nothing, and the organization
          of the material universe. He found it difficult to say what kind of
          days the days of Genesis were, but was evidently inclined to think
          that God created all things in a moment of time and that the thought
          of days was simply introduced to aid the finite intelligence. The
          Scholastics debated a great deal about the possibility of eternal
          creation; some, such as, Alexander of Hales, Bonaventura, Albertus
          Magnus, Henry of Ghent, and the great majority of the Scholastics
          denying this; and others, such as Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus,
          Durandus, Biel, and others affirming it. Yet the doctrine of creation
          with or in time carried the day. Erigena and Eckhart were exceptional
          in teaching that the world originated by emanation. Seemingly the days
          of creation were regarded as ordinary days, though Anselm suggested
          that it might be necessary to conceive of them as different from our
          present days. The Reformers held firmly to the doctrine of creation
          out of nothing by a free act of God in or with time, and regarded the
          days of creation as six literal days. This view is also generally
          maintained in the Post-Reformation literature of the sixteenth and
          seventeenth centuries, though a few theologians (as Maresius)
          occasionally speak of continuous creation. In the eighteenth century,
          however, under the dominating influence of Pantheism and Materialism,
          science launched an attack on the Church's doctrine of creation. It
          substituted the idea of evolution or development for that of absolute
          origination by a divine fiat. The world was often represented as a
          necessary manifestation of the Absolute. Its origin was pushed back
          thousands and even millions of years into an unknown past. And soon
          theologians were engaged in various attempts to harmonize the doctrine
          of creation with the teachings of science and philosophy. Some
          suggested that the first chapters of Genesis should be interpreted
          allegorically or mythically; others, that a long period elapsed
          between the primary creation of Gen_1:1-2 and the secondary creation
          of the following verses; and still others, that the days of creation
          were in fact long periods of time.
        </p>
        <p>B. SCRIPTURAL PROOF FOR THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION</p>
        <p>
          The Scriptural proof for the doctrine of creation is not found in a
          single and limited portion of the Bible, but is found in every part of
          the Word of God. It does not consist of a few scattered passages of
          doubtful interpretation, but of a large number of clear and
          unequivocal statements, which speak of the creation of the world as a
          historical fact. We have first of all the extended narrative of
          creation found in Gen_1:1-31, Gen_2:1-25, which will be discussed in
          detail when the creation of the material universe is considered. These
          chapters certainly appear to the unbiased reader as a historical
          narrative, and as the record of a historical fact. And the many
          cross-references scattered throughout the Bible do not regard them in
          any other light. They all refer to creation as a fact of history. The
          various passages in which they are found may be classified as follows:
          (1) Passages which stress the omnipotence of God in the work of
          creation, Isa_40:26; Isa_40:28; Amo_4:13. (2) Passages which point to
          His exaltation above nature as the great and infinite God, Psa_90:2;
          Psa_102:26-27; Act_17:24. (3) Passages which refer to the wisdom of
          God in the work of creation, Isa_40:12-14; Jer_10:12-16; Joh_1:3; (4)
          Passages regarding creation from the point of view of God's
          sovereignty and purpose in creation, Isa_43:7; Rom_1:25. (5) Passages
          that speak of creation as a fundamental work of God, 1Co_11:9;
          Col_1:16. One of the fullest and most beautiful statements is that
          found in Neh_9:6 : "Thou art Jehovah, even thou alone; thou hast made
          heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all
          things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou
          preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee." This
          passage is typical of several other, less extensive, passages that are
          found in the Bible, which emphasize the fact that Jehovah is the
          Creator of the universe, Isa_42:5; Isa_45:18; Col_1:16; Rev_4:11;
          Rev_10:6.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE IDEA OF CREATION</p>
        <p>
          The faith of the Church in the creation of the world is expressed in
          the very first article of the Apostolic Confession of Faith, "I
          believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth." This
          is an expression of the faith of the early Church, that God by His
          almighty power brought forth the universe out of nothing. The words
          "Maker of heaven and earth" were not contained in the original form of
          the creed, but represent a later addition. It ascribes to the Father,
          that is, to the first person in the Trinity, the origination of all
          things. This is in harmony with the representation of the New
          Testament that all things are of the Father, through the Son, and in
          the Holy Spirit. The word "Maker" is a rendering of the word poieten,
          found in the Greek form of the Apostolic Confession, while the Latin
          form has creatorem. Evidently, it is to be understood as a synonymous
          term for "Creator." "To create" was understood in the early Church in
          the strict sense of "to bring forth something out of nothing." It
          should be noted that Scripture does not always use the Hebrew word
          bara' and the Greek term ktizein in that absolute sense. It also
          employs these terms to denote a secondary creation, in which God made
          use of material that was already in existence but could not of itself
          have produced the result indicated, Gen_1:21; Gen_1:27; Gen_5:1;
          Isa_45:7; Isa_45:12; Isa_54:16; Amo_3:13; 1Co_11:9; Rev_10:6. It even
          uses them to designate that which comes into existence under the
          providential guidance of God, Psa_104:30; Isa_45:7-8; Isa_65:18;
          1Ti_4:4. Two other terms are used synonymously with the term "to
          create," namely, "to make" (Heb., 'asah; Greek, poiein) and "to form"
          (Heb. yatsar; Greek, plasso). The former is clearly used in all the
          three senses indicated in the preceding: of primary creation in
          Gen_2:4; Pro_16:4; Act_17:24; more frequently of secondary creation,
          Gen_1:7; Gen_1:16; Gen_1:26; Gen_2:22; Psa_89:47; and of the work of
          providence in Psa_74:17. The latter is used similarly of primary
          creation, Psa_90:2 (perhaps the only instance of this use); of
          secondary creation, Gen_2:7; Gen_2:19; Psa_104:26; Amo_4:13; Zec_12:1;
          and of the work of providence, Deu_32:18; Isa_43:7; Isa_43:21;
          Isa_45:7. All three words are found together in Isa_45:7. Creation in
          the strict sense of the word may be defined as that free act of God
          whereby He, according to His sovereign; will and for His own glory, in
          the beginning brought forth the whole visible and invisible; universe,
          without the use of preexistent material, and thus gave it an
          existence, distinct from His own and yet always dependent on Him. In
          view of the Scriptural data indicated in the preceding, it is quite
          evident, however, that this definition applies only to what is
          generally known as primary or immediate creation, that is, the
          creation described in Gen_1:1. But the Bible clearly uses the word
          "create" also in cases in which God did make use of pre-existing
          materials, as in the creation of sun, moon, and stars, of the animals
          and of man. Hence many theologians add an element to the definition of
          creation. Thus Wollebius defines: "Creation is that act by which God
          produces the world and all that is in it, partly out of nothing and
          partly out of material that is by its very nature unfit, for the
          manifestation of the glory of His power, wisdom, and goodness." Even
          so, however, the definition does not cover those cases, also
          designated in Scripture as creative work, in which God works through
          secondary causes, Psa_104:30; Isa_45:7-8; Jer_31:22; Amo_4:13, and
          produces results which only He could produce. The definition given
          includes several elements which call for further consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. CREATION IS AN ACT OF THE TRIUNE GOD. Scripture teaches us that the
          triune God is the author of creation, Gen_1:1; Isa_40:12; Isa_44:24;
          Isa_45:12, and this distinguishes Him from the idols, Psa_96:5;
          Isa_37:16; Jer_10:11-12. Though the Father is in the foreground in the
          work of creation, 1Co_8:6, it is also clearly recognized as a work of
          the Son and of the Holy Spirit. The Son's participation in it is
          indicated in Joh_1:3; 1Co_8:6; Col_1:15-17, and the activity of the
          Spirit in it finds expression in Gen_1:2; Job_26:13; Job_33:4;
          Psa_104:30; Isa_40:12-13. The second and third persons are not
          dependent powers or mere intermediaries, but independent authors
          together with the Father. The work was not divided among the three
          persons, but the whole work, though from different aspects, is
          ascribed to each one of the persons. All things are at once out of the
          Father, through the Son, and in the Holy Spirit. In general it may be
          said that being is out of the Father, thought or the idea out of the
          Son, and life out of the Holy Spirit. Since the Father takes the
          initiative in the work of creation, it is often ascribed to Him
          economically.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. CREATION IS A FREE ACT OF GOD. Creation is sometimes represented as
          a necessary act of God rather than as a free act determined by His
          sovereign will. The old theories of emanation and their modern
          counterpart, the Pantheistic theories, naturally make the world but a
          mere moment in the process of divine evolution (Spinoza, Hegel), and
          therefore regard the world as a necessary act of God. And the
          necessity which they have in mind is not a relative necessity
          resulting from the divine decree, but an absolute necessity which
          follows from the very nature of God, from his omnipotence (Origen) or
          from His love (Rothe). However, this is not a Scriptural position. The
          only works of God that are inherently necessary with a necessity
          resulting from the very nature of God, are the opera ad intra, the
          works of the separate persons within the Divine Being: generation,
          filiation, and procession. To say that creation is a necessary act of
          God, is also to declare that it is just as eternal as those immanent
          works of God. Whatever necessity may be ascribed to God's opera ad
          extra is a necessity conditioned by the divine decree and the
          resulting constitution of things. It is a necessity dependent on the
          sovereign will of God, and therefore no necessity in the absolute
          sense of the word. The Bible teaches us that God created all things,
          according to the counsel of His will, Eph_1:11; Rev_4:11; and that He
          is self-sufficient and is not dependent on His creatures in any way,
          Job_22:2-3; Act_17:25.
        </p>
        <p>3. CREATION IS A TEMPORAL ACT OF GOD.</p>
        <p>
          a. The teaching of Scripture on this point. The Bible begins with the
          very simple statement, "In the beginning God created the heavens and
          the earth," Gen_1:1. As addressed to all classes of people, it employs
          the ordinary language of daily life, and not the technical language of
          philosophy. The Hebrew term bereshith (lit. "in beginning") is itself
          indefinite, and naturally gives rise to the question, In the beginning
          of what? It would seem best to take the expression in the absolute
          sense as an indication of the beginning of all temporal things and
          even of time itself; but Keil is of the opinion that it refers to the
          beginning of the work of creation. Technically speaking, it is not
          correct to assume that time was already in existence when God created
          the world, and that He at some point in that existing time, called
          "the beginning" brought forth the universe. Time is only one of the
          forms of all created existence, and therefore could not exist before
          creation. For that reason Augustine thought it would be more correct
          to say that the world was created cum tempore (with time) than to
          assert that it was created in tempore (in time). The great
          significance of the opening statement of the Bible lies in its
          teaching that the world had a beginning. Scripture speaks of this
          beginning also in other places, Mat_19:4; Mat_19:8; Mar_10:1-52;
          Mar_6:1-56; Joh_1:1-2; Heb_1:10. That the world had a beginning is
          also clearly implied in such passages as Psa_90:2, "Before the
          mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and
          the world, even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God"; and
          Psa_102:25, "Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth; and
          the heavens are the work of thy hands."
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Difficulties which burden this doctrine. Prior to the beginning
          mentioned in Gen_1:1, we must postulate a beginningless eternity,
          during which God only existed. How must we fill up these blank ages in
          the eternal life of God? What did God do before the creation of the
          world? It is so far from possible to think of Him as a Deus otiosus (a
          God who is not active), that He is usually conceived of as actus purus
          (pure action). He is represented in Scripture as always working,
          Joh_5:17. Can we then say that He passed from a state of inactivity to
          one of action? Moreover, how is the transition from a non- creative to
          a creative state to be reconciled with His immutability? And if He had
          the eternal purpose to create, why did He not carry it out at once?
          Why did He allow a whole eternity to elapse before His plan was put
          into execution? Moreover, why did He select that particular moment for
          His creative work?
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Suggested solutions of the problem. (1) The theory of eternal
          creation. According to some, such as Origen, Scotus Erigina, Rothe,
          Dorner, and Pfleiderer, God has been creating from all eternity, so
          that the world, though a creature and dependent, is yet just as
          eternal as God Himself. This has been argued from the omnipotence, the
          timelessness, the immutability, and the love of God; but neither one
          of these necessarily imply or involve it. This theory is not only
          contradicted by Scripture, but is also contrary to reason, for (a)
          creation from eternity is a contradiction in terms; and (b) the idea
          of eternal creation, as applied to the present world, which is subject
          to the law of time, is based on an identification of time and
          eternity, while these two are essentially different. (2) The theory of
          the subjectivity of time and eternity. Some speculative philosophers,
          such as Spinoza, Hegel, and Green, claim that the distinction of time
          and eternity is purely subjective and due to our finite position.
          Hence they would have us rise to a higher point of vantage and
          consider things sub specie aeternitatis (from the point of view of
          eternity). What exists for our consciousness as a time development,
          exists for the divine consciousness only as an eternally complete
          whole. But this theory is contradicted by Scripture just as much as
          the preceding one, Gen_1:1; Psa_90:2; Psa_102:25; Joh_1:3. Moreover,
          it changes objective realities into subjective forms of consciousness,
          and reduces all history to an illusion. After all, time-development is
          a reality; there is a succession in our conscious life and in the life
          of nature round about us. The things that happened yesterday are not
          the things that are happening today.61
        </p>
        <p>
          d.Direction in which the solution should be sought. In connection with
          the problem under consideration, Dr. Orr correctly says, "The solution
          must lie in getting a proper idea of the relation of eternity to
          time." He adds that, as far as he can see, this has not yet been
          satisfactorily accomplished. A great deal of the difficulty
          encountered here is undoubtedly due to the fact that we think of
          eternity too much as an indefinite extension of time, as, for
          instance, when we speak of the ages of comparative inaction in God
          before the creation of the world. God's eternity is no indefinitely
          extended time, but something essentially different, of which we can
          form no conception. His is a timeless existence, an eternal presence.
          The hoary past and the most distant future are both present to Him. He
          acts in all His works, and therefore also in creation, as the Eternal
          One, and we have no right to draw creation as an act of God into the
          temporal sphere. In a certain sense this can be called an eternal act,
          but only in the sense in which all the acts of God are eternal. They
          are all as acts of God, works that are done in eternity. However, it
          is not eternal in the same sense as the generation of the Son, for
          this is an immanent act of God in the absolute sense of the word,
          while creation results in a temporal existence and thus terminates in
          time.62 Theologians generally distinguish between active and passive
          creation, the former denoting creation as an act of God, and the
          latter, its result, the world's being created. The former is not, but
          the latter is, marked by temporal succession, and this temporal
          succession reflects the order determined in the decree of God. As to
          the objection that a creation in time implies a change in God,
          Wollebius remarks that "creation is not the Creator's but the
          creature's passage from potentiality to actuality."63

          4. CREATION AS AN ACT BY WHICH SOMETHING IS BROUGHT FORTH OUT OF
          NOTHING.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The doctrine of creation is absolutely unique. There has been a
          great deal of speculation about the origin of the world, and several
          theories have been proposed. Some declared the world to be eternal,
          while others saw in it the product of an antagonistic spirit
          (Gnostics). Some maintained that it was made out of pre-existing
          matter which God worked up into form (Plato); others held that it
          originated by emanation out of the divine substance (Syrian Gnostics,
          Swedenborg); and still others regarded it as the phenomenal appearance
          of the Absolute, the hidden ground of all things (Pantheism). In
          opposition to all these vain speculations of men the doctrine of
          Scripture stands out in grand sublimity: "In the beginning God created
          the heavens and the earth."
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Scriptural terms for "to create." In the narrative of creation, as
          was pointed out in the preceding, three verbs are used, namely, bara',
          ' asah, and yatsar, and they are used interchangeably in Scripture,
          Gen_1:26-27; Gen_2:7. The first word is the most important. Its
          original meaning is to split, to cut, to divide; but in addition to
          this it also means to fashion, to create, and in a more derivative
          sense, to produce, to generate, and to regenerate. The word itself
          does not convey the idea of bringing forth something out of nothing,
          for it is even used of works of providence, Isa_45:7; Jer_31:22;
          Amo_4:13. Yet it has a distinctive character: it is always used of
          divine and never of human production; and it never has an accusative
          of material, and for that very reason serves to stress the greatness
          of the work of God. The word ' asah is more general, meaning to do or
          to make, and is therefore used in the general sense of doing, making,
          manufacturing, or fashioning. The word yatsar has, more distinctively,
          the meaning of fashioning out of pre-existent materials, and is
          therefore used of the potter's fashioning vessels out of clay. The New
          Testament words are ktizein, Mar_13:19, poiein, Mat_19:4; themelioun,
          Heb_1:10,katartizein, Rom_9:22, kataskeuazein, Heb_3:4, and plassein,
          Rom_9:20. None of these words in themselves express the idea of
          creation out of nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Meaning of the term "creation out of nothing." The expression "to
          create or bring forth out of nothing" is not found in Scripture. It is
          derived from one of the Apocrypha, namely, 2Ma_7:28. The expression ex
          nihilo has been both misinterpreted and criticized. Some even
          considered the word nihilum (nothing) as the designation of a certain
          matter out of which the world was created, a matter without qualities
          and without form. But this is too puerile to be worthy of serious
          consideration. Others took the expression "to create out of nothing"
          to mean that the world came into being without a cause, and proceeded
          to criticize it as conflicting with what is generally regarded as an
          axiomatic truth, ex nihilo nihil fit (out of nothing comes nothing).
          But this criticism is entirely unwarranted. To say that God created
          the world out of nothing is not equivalent to saying that the world
          came into being without a cause. God Himself or, more specifically,
          the will of God is the cause of the world. Martensen expresses himself
          in these words: "The nothing out of which God creates the world are
          the eternal possibilities of His will, which are the sources of all
          the actualities of the world."64 If the Latin phrase "ex nihilo nihil
          fit" be taken to mean that no effect can be without a cause, its truth
          may be admitted, but it cannot be regarded as a valid objection
          against the doctrine of creation out of nothing. But if it be
          understood to express the idea that nothing can originate, except out
          of previously existing material, it certainly cannot be regarded as a
          self-evident truth. Then it is rather a purely arbitrary assumption
          which, as Shedd points out, does not even hold true of man's thoughts
          and volitions, which are ex nihilo.65 But even if the phrase does
          express a truth of common experience as far as human works are
          concerned, this does not-yet prove its truth with respect to the work
          of the almighty power of God. However, in view of the fact that the
          expression "creation out of nothing" is liable to misunderstanding,
          and has often been misunderstood, it is preferable to speak of
          creation without the use of pre-existing material.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Scriptural basis for the doctrine of creation out of nothing.
          Gen_1:1 records the beginning of the work of creation, and it
          certainly does not represent God as bringing the world forth out of
          pre-existent material. It was creation out of nothing, creation in the
          strict sense of the word, and therefore the only part of the work
          recorded in Gen_1:1-31 to which Calvin would apply the term. But even
          in the remaining part of the chapter God is represented as calling
          forth all things by the word of His power, by a simple divine fiat.
          The same truth is taught in such passages as Psa_33:6; Psa_33:9;
          Psa_148:5. The strongest passage is Heb_11:3, "By faith we understand
          that the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is
          seen hath not been made out of things which appear." Creation is here
          represented as a fact which we apprehend only by faith. By faith we
          understand (perceive, not comprehend) that the world was framed or
          fashioned by the word of God, that is, the word of God's power, the
          divine fiat, so that the things which are seen, the visible things of
          this world, were not made out of things which do appear, which are
          visible, and which are at least occasionally seen. According to this
          passage the world certainly was not made out of anything that is
          palpable to the senses. Another passage that may be quoted in this
          connection is Rom_4:7, which speaks of God, "who quickeneth the dead,
          and calleth those things which be not as though they were" (Moffatt:
          "who makes the dead alive and calls into being what does not exist").
          The apostle, it is true, does not speak of the creation of the world
          in this connection, but of the hope of Abraham that he would have a
          son. However, the description here given of God is general and is
          therefore also of a general application. It belongs to the very nature
          of God that He is able to call into being what does not exist, and
          does so call it into being.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. CREATION GIVES THE WORLD A DISTINCT, YET ALWAYS DEPENDENT
          EXISTENCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The world has a distinct existence. This means that the world is
          not God nor any part of God, but something absolutely distinct from
          God; and that it differs from God, not merely in degree, but in its
          essential properties. The doctrine of creation implies that, while God
          is self-existent and self-sufficient, infinite and eternal, the world
          is dependent, finite, and temporal. The one can never change into the
          other. This doctrine is an absolute barrier against the ancient idea
          of emanation, as well as against all pantheistic theories. The
          universe is not the existence-form of God nor the phenomenal
          appearance of the Absolute; and God is not simply the life, or soul,
          or inner law of the world, but enjoys His own eternally complete life
          above the world, in absolute independence of it. He is the
          transcendent God, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing
          wonders. This doctrine is supported by passages of Scripture which (1)
          testify to the distinct existence of the world, Isa_42:5; Act_17:24;
          (2) speak of the immutability of God, Psa_102:27; Mal_3:6; Jas_1:17;
          (3) draw a comparison between God and the creature, Psa_90:2;
          Psa_102:25-27; Psa_103:15-17; Isa_2:21; Isa_22:17, etc.; and (4) speak
          of the world as lying in sin or sinful, Rom_1:18-32; 1Jn_2:15-17, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The world is always dependent on God. While God gave the world an
          existence distinct from His own, He did not withdraw from the world
          after its creation, but remained in the most intimate connection with
          it. The universe is not like a clock which was wound up by God and is
          now allowed to run off without any further divine intervention. This
          deistic conception of creation is neither biblical nor scientific. God
          is not only the transcendent God, infinitely exalted above all His
          creatures; He is also the immanent God, who is present in every part
          of His creation, and whose Spirit is operative in all the world. He is
          essentially and not merely per potentiam, present in all His
          creatures, but He is not present in every one of them in the same
          manner. His immanence should not be interpreted as boundless extension
          throughout all the spaces of the universe, nor as a partitive
          presence, so that He is partly here and partly there. God is Spirit,
          and just because He is Spirit He is everywhere present as a whole. He
          is said to fill heaven and earth, Psa_139:7-10; Jer_23:24, to
          constitute the sphere in which we live and move and have our being,
          Act_17:28, to renew the face of the earth by His Spirit, Psa_104:30,
          to dwell in those that are of a broken heart, Psa_51:11; Isa_57:15,
          and in the Church as His temple, 1Co_3:16; 1Co_6:19; Eph_2:22. Both
          transcendence and immanence find expression in a single passage of
          Scripture, namely, Eph_4:6, where the apostle says that we have "one
          God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all. "
          The doctrine of divine immanence has been stretched to the point of
          Pantheism in a great deal of modern theology. The world, and
          especially man, was regarded as the phenomenal manifestation of God.
          At present there is a strong reaction to this position in the
          so-called "theology of crisis." It is sometimes thought that this
          theology, with its emphasis on the "infinite qualitative difference"
          between time and eternity, on God as the "wholly Other" and the hidden
          God, and on the distance between God and man, naturally rules out the
          immanence of God. Brunner gives us the assurance, however, that this
          is not so. Says he, "Much nonsense has been talked about the 'Barthian
          theology' having perception only for the transcendence of God, not for
          His immanence. As if we too were not aware of the fact that God the
          Creator upholds all things by His power, that He has set the stamp of
          His divinity on the world and created man to be His own image."66 And
          Barth says, "Dead were God Himself if He moved His world only from the
          outside, if He were a 'thing in Himself' and not the One in all, the
          Creator of all things visible and invisible, the beginning and the
          ending."67 These men oppose the modern pantheistic conception of the
          divine immanence, and also the idea that, in virtue of this immanence,
          the world is a luminous revelation of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. THE FINAL END OF GOD IN CREATION. The question of the final end of
          God in the work of creation has frequently been debated. In the course
          of history the question has received especially a twofold answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The happiness of man or of humanity. Some of the earlier
          philosophers, such as Plato, Philo, and Seneca, asserted that the
          goodness of God prompted Him to create the world. He desired to
          communicate Himself to His creatures; their happiness was the end He
          had in view. Though some Christian theologians chimed in with this
          idea, it became prominent especially through the Humanism of the
          Reformation period and the Rationalism of the eighteenth century. This
          theory was often presented in a very superficial way. The best form in
          which it is stated is to the effect that God could not make Himself
          the end of creation, because He is sufficient unto Himself and could
          need nothing. And if He could not make Himself the end, then this can
          be found only in the creature, especially in man, and ultimately in
          his supreme happiness. The teleological view by which the welfare or
          happiness of man or humanity is made the final end of creation, was
          characteristic of the thinking of such influential men as Kant,
          Schleiermacher, and Ritschl, though they did not all present it in the
          same way. But this theory does not satisfy for several reasons: (1)
          Though God undoubtedly reveals His goodness in creation, it is not
          correct to say that His goodness or love could not express itself, if
          there were no world. The personal relations within the triune God
          supplied all that was necessary for a full and eternal life of love.
          (2) It would seem to be perfectly self-evident that God does not exist
          for the sake of man, but man for the sake of God. God only is Creator
          and the supreme Good, while man is but a creature, who for that very
          reason cannot be the end of creation. The temporal finds its end in
          the eternal, the human in the divine, and not vice versa. (3) The
          theory does not fit the facts. It is impossible to subordinate all
          that is found in creation to this end, and to explain all in relation
          to human happiness. This is perfectly evident from a consideration of
          all the sufferings that are found in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The declarative glory of God. The Church of Jesus Christ found the
          true end of creation, not in anything outside of God, but in God
          Himself, more particularly in the external manifestation of His
          inherent excellency. This does not mean that God's receiving glory
          from others is the final end. The receiving of glory through the
          praises of His moral creatures, is an end included in the supreme end,
          but is not itself that end. God did not create first of all to receive
          glory, but to make His glory extant and manifest. The glorious
          perfections of God are manifested in His entire creation; and this
          manifestation is not intended as an empty show, a mere exhibition to
          be admired by the creatures, but also aims at promoting their welfare
          and perfect happiness. Moreover, it seeks to attune their hearts to
          the praises of the Creator, and to elicit from their souls the
          expression of their gratefulness and love and adoration. The supreme
          end of God in creation, the manifestation of His glory, therefore,
          includes, as subordinate ends, the happiness and salvation of His
          creatures, and the reception of praise from grateful and adoring
          hearts. This doctrine is supported by the following considerations:
          (1) It is based on the testimony of Scripture, Isa_43:7; Isa_60:21;
          Isa_61:3; Eze_36:21-22; Eze_39:7; Luk_2:14; Rom_9:17; Rom_11:36;
          1Co_15:28; Eph_1:5-6; Eph_1:9; Eph_1:12; Eph_1:14; Eph_3:9--10;
          Col_1:16. (2) The infinite God would hardly choose any but the highest
          end in creation, and this end could only be found in Himself. If whole
          nations, as compared with Him, are but as a drop in a bucket and as
          the small dust of the balance, then, surely, His declarative glory is
          intrinsically of far greater value than the good of His creatures,
          Isa_40:15-16. (3) The glory of God is the only end that is consistent
          with His independence and sovereignty. Everyone is dependent on
          whomsoever or whatsoever he makes his ultimate end. If God chooses
          anything in the creature as His final end, this would make Him
          dependent on the creature to that extent. (4) No other end would be
          sufficiently comprehensive to be the true end of all God's ways and
          works in creation. It has the advantage of comprising, in
          subordination, several other ends. (5) It is the only end that is
          actually and perfectly attained in the universe. We cannot imagine
          that a wise and omnipotent God would choose an end destined to fail
          wholly or in part, Job_23:13. Yet many of His creatures never attain
          to perfect happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Objections to the doctrine that the glory of God is the end of
          creation. The following are the most important of these: (1) It makes
          the scheme of the universe a selfish scheme. But we should distinguish
          between selfishness and reasonable self-regard or self-love. The
          former is an undue or exclusive care for one's own comfort or
          pleasure, regardless of the happiness or rights of others; the latter
          is a due care for one's own happiness and well-being, which is
          perfectly compatible with justice, generosity, and benevolence towards
          others. In seeking self-expression for the glory of His name, God did
          not disregard the well-being, the highest good of others, but promoted
          it. Moreover, this objection draws the infinite God down to the level
          of finite and even sinful man and judges Him by human standards, which
          is entirely unwarranted. God has no equal, and no one can claim any
          right as over against Him. In making His declarative glory the end of
          creation, He has chosen the highest end; but when man makes himself
          the end of all his works, he is not choosing the highest end. He would
          rise to a higher level, if he chose the welfare of humanity and the
          glory of God as the end of his life. Finally, this objection is made
          primarily in view of the fact that the world is full of suffering, and
          that some of God's rational creatures are doomed to eternal
          destruction. But this is not due to the creative work of God, but to
          the sin of man, which thwarted the work of God in creation. The fact
          that man suffers the consequences of sin and insurrection does not
          warrant anyone in accusing God of selfishness. One might as well
          accuse the government of selfishness for upholding its dignity and the
          majesty of the law against all wilful transgressors. (2) It is
          contrary to God's self-sufficiency and independence. By seeking His
          honour in this way God shows that He needs the creature. The world is
          created to glorify God, that is, to add to His glory. Evidently, then,
          His perfection is wanting in some respects; the work of creation
          satisfies a want and contributes to the divine perfection. But this
          representation is not correct. The fact that God created the world for
          His own glory does not mean that He needed the world. It does not hold
          universally among men, that the work which they do not perform for
          others, is necessary to supply a want. This may hold in the case of
          the common laborer, who is working for his daily bread, but is
          scarcely true of the artist, who follows the spontaneous impulse of
          his genius. In the same way there is a good pleasure in God, exalted
          far above want and compulsion, which artistically embodies His
          thoughts in creation and finds delight in them. Moreover, it is not
          true that, when God makes His declarative glory the final end of
          creation, He aims primarily at receiving something. The supreme end
          which He had in view, was not to receive glory, but to manifest His
          inherent glory in the works of His hands. It is true that in doing
          this, He would also cause the heavens to declare His glory, and the
          firmament to show His handiwork, the birds of the air and the beasts
          of the field to magnify Him, and the children of men to sing His
          praises. But by glorifying the Creator the creatures add nothing to
          the perfection of His being, but only acknowledge His greatness and
          ascribe to Him the glory which is due unto Him.
        </p>
        <p>D. DIVERGENT THEORIES RESPECTING THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD</p>
        <p>
          The Biblical doctrine is not the only view respecting the origin of
          the world. Three alternative theories, which were suggested, deserve
          brief consideration at this point.

        <p>
          1. THE DUALISTIC THEORY. Dualism is not always presented in the same
          form, but in its most usual form posits two self-existent principles,
          God and matter, which are distinct from and co-eternal with each
          other. Original matter, however, is regarded as but a negative and
          imperfect substance (sometimes regarded as evil), which is subordinate
          to God and is made the instrument of His will (Plato, Aristotle, the
          Gnostics, the Manichaeans). According to this theory God is not the
          creator, but only the framer and artificer of the world. This view is
          objectionable for several reasons. (a) It is wrong in its fundamental
          idea that there must have been some substance out of which the world
          was created, since ex nihilo nihil fit. This maxim is true only as an
          expression of the idea that no event takes place without a cause, and
          is false if it means to assert that nothing can ever be made except
          out of pre-existing material. The doctrine of creation does not
          dispense with a cause, but finds the all-sufficient cause of the world
          in the sovereign will of God. (b) Its representation of matter as
          eternal is fundamentally unsound. If matter is eternal, it must be
          infinite for it cannot be infinite in one way (duration) and finite in
          other respects. But it is impossible that two infinites or absolutes
          should exist side by side. The absolute and the relative may exist
          simultaneously, but there can be only one absolute and self-existent
          being. (c) It is unphilosophical to postulate two eternal substances,
          when one self-existent cause is perfectly adequate to account for all
          the facts. For that reason philosophy does not rest satisfied with a
          dualistic explanation of the world, but seeks to give a monistic
          interpretation of the universe. (d) If the theory assumes â€” as it
          does in some of its forms â€” the existence of an eternal principle of
          evil, there is absolutely no guarantee that good will triumph over
          evil in the world. It would seem that what is eternally necessary is
          bound to maintain itself and can never go down.

          2. THE EMANATION THEORY IN VARIOUS FORMS. This theory is to the effect
          that the world is a necessary emanation out of the divine being.
          According to it God and the world are essentially one, the latter
          being the phenomenal manifestation of the former. The idea of
          emanation is characteristic of all pantheistic theories, though it is
          not always represented in the same way. Here, again, we may register
          several objections. (a) This view of the origin of the world virtually
          denies the infinity and transcendence of God by applying to Him a
          principle of evolution, of growth and progress, which characterizes
          only the finite and imperfect; and by identifying Him and the world.
          All visible objects thus become but fleeting modifications of a
          self-existent, unconscious, and impersonal essence, which may be
          called God, Nature, or the Absolute. (b) It robs God of His
          sovereignty by denuding Him of His power of self-determination in
          relation to the world. He is reduced to the hidden ground from which
          the creatures necessarily emanate, and which determines their movement
          by an inflexible necessity of nature. At the same time it deprives all
          rational creatures of their relative independence, of their freedom,
          and of their moral character. (c) It also compromises the holiness of
          God in a very serious manner. It makes God responsible for all that
          happens in the world, for the evil as well as for the good. This is,
          of course, a very serious consequence of the theory, from which
          Pantheists have never been able to escape.

          3. THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION. The theory of evolution is sometimes
          spoken of as if it could be a substitute for the doctrine of creation.
          But this is clearly a mistake. It certainly cannot be a substitute for
          creation in the sense of absolute origination, since it presupposes
          something that evolves, and this must in the last resort be either
          eternal or created, so that, after all, the evolutionist must choose
          between the theory of the eternity of matter and the doctrine of
          creation. At best, it might conceivably serve as a substitute for what
          is called secondary creation, by which the substance already in
          existence is given a definite form. (a) Some evolutionists, as, for
          instance, Haeckel, believe in the eternity of matter, and ascribe the
          origin of life to spontaneous generation. But belief in the eternity
          of matter is not only decidedly un-Christian and even atheistic; it is
          also generally discredited. The idea that matter, with force as its
          universal and inseparable property, is quite sufficient for the
          explanation of the world, finds little favor to-day in scientific
          circles. It is felt that a material universe, composed of finite parts
          (atoms, electrons, and so on) cannot itself be infinite; and that that
          which is subject to constant change cannot be eternal. Moreover, it
          has become increasingly clear that blind matter and force or energy
          cannot account for life and personality, for intelligence and free
          will. And the idea of spontaneous generation is a pure hypothesis, not
          only unverified, but practically exploded. The general law of nature
          seems to be " omne vivum e vivo " or " ex vivo." (b) Other
          evolutionists advocate what they call theistic evolution. This
          postulates the existence of God back of the universe, who works in it,
          as a rule according to the unalterable laws of nature and by physical
          forces only, but in some cases by direct miraculous intervention, as,
          for instance, in the case of the absolute beginning, the beginning of
          life, and the beginning of rational and moral existence. This has
          often been called derisively a "stop-gap" theory. It is really a child
          of embarrassment, which calls God in at periodic intervals to help
          nature over the chasms that yawn at her feet. It is neither the
          Biblical doctrine of creation, nor a consistent theory of evolution,
          for evolution is defined as "a series of gradual progressive changes
          effected by means of resident forces " (Le Conte). In fact, theistic
          evolution is a contradiction in terms. It is just as destructive of
          faith in the Biblical doctrine of creation as naturalistic evolution
          is; and by calling in the creative activity of God time and again it
          also nullifies the evolutionary hypothesis. Besides these two views we
          may also mention Bergson's Creative evolution, and C. Lloyd Morgan's
          Emergent evolution. The former is a vitalistic pantheist, whose theory
          involves the denial of the personality of God; and the latter in the
          end comes to the conclusion that he cannot explain his so-called
          emergents without positing some ultimate factor which might be called
          "God."
