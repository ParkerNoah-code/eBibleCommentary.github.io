        <p>II. The Priestly Office</p>
        <p>A. THE SCRIPTURAL IDEA OF A PRIEST.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE TERMS USED IN SCRIPTURE. The Old Testament word for priest is
          almost without exception kohen. The only exceptions are found in
          passages which refer to idolatrous priests, 2Ki_23:5; Hos_10:5;
          Zep_1:4, where the word chemarim is found. The original meaning of
          kohen is uncertain. It is not impossible that in early times it could
          denote a civil as well as an ecclesiastical functionary, cf. 1Ki_4:5;
          2Sa_8:18; 2Sa_20:26. It is clear that the word always denoted someone
          who occupied an honorable and responsible position, and was clothed
          with authority over others; and that it almost without exception
          serves to designate an ecclesiastical officer. The New Testament word
          for priest is hiereus, which originally seems to have denoted "a
          mighty one," and later on "a sacred person," "a person dedicated to
          God."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A PROPHET AND A PRIEST. The Bible makes a
          broad but important distinction between a prophet and a priest. Both
          receive their appointment from God, Deu_18:18 f; Heb_5:4. But the
          prophet was appointed to be God's representative with the people, to
          be His messenger, and to interpret His will. He was primarily a
          religious teacher. The priest, on the other hand, was man's
          representative with God. He had the special privilege of approach to
          God, and of speaking and acting in behalf of the people. It is true
          that the priests were also teachers during the old dispensation, but
          their teaching differed from that of the prophets. While the latter
          emphasized the moral and spiritual duties, responsibilities, and
          privileges, the former stressed the ritual observances involved in the
          proper approach to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE PRIEST AS INDICATED IN SCRIPTURE. The
          classical passage in which the true characteristics of a priest are
          given and his work is partly designated, is Heb_5:1. The following
          elements are indicated here: (a) the priest is taken from among men to
          be their representative; (b) he is appointed by God, cf. Heb_5:4; (c)
          he is active in the interest of men in things that pertain to God,
          that is, in religious things; (d) his special work is to offer gifts
          and sacrifices for sins. But the work of the priest included even more
          than that. He also made intercession for the people (Heb_7:25), and
          blessed them in the name of God, Lev_9:22.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. SCRIPTURAL PROOF FOR THE PRIESTLY OFFICE OF CHRIST. The Old
          Testament predicts and prefigures the priesthood of the coming
          Redeemer. There are clear references to it in Psa_110:1 and Zec_6:13.
          Moreover, the Old Testament priesthood, and particularly the high
          priest, clearly pre-figured a priestly Messiah. In the New Testament
          there is only a single book in which He is called priest, namely, the
          Epistle to the Hebrews, but there the name is applied to Him
          repeatedly, Heb_3:1; Heb_4:14; Heb_5:5; Heb_6:20; Heb_7:26; Heb_8:1.
          At the same time many other New Testament books refer to the priestly
          work of Christ, as we shall see in the discussion of this subject.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE SACRIFICIAL WORK OF CHRIST.</p>
        <p>
          The priestly work of Christ was twofold according to Scripture. His
          foremost task was to offer an all-sufficient sacrifice for the sin of
          the world. It belonged to the office of a priest that he should offer
          gifts and sacrifices for sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE SACRIFICIAL IDEA IN SCRIPTURE. The sacrificial idea occupies a
          very important place in Scripture. Various theories have been
          suggested as to the origin and development of this idea, of which the
          following are the most important:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The gift-theory which holds that sacrifices were originally
          presents to the deity, given with the intention of establishing good
          relations and of securing favors. This is based on an extremely low
          conception of God, one that is altogether out of harmony with the
          Scriptural representation of God. Moreover, it does not explain why
          the gift should always be brought in the form of a slain animal. The
          Bible does speak of offering gifts to God (Heb_5:1), but only as
          expressions of gratitude and not for the purpose of courting the favor
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The sacramental-communion theory, based on the totemistic idea of
          reverencing an animal which was supposed to share in the divine
          nature. On solemn occasions such an animal would be slain to furnish a
          meal for man, who would thus literally eat his God and assimilate the
          divine qualities. There is absolutely nothing in the book of Genesis,
          however, to suggest such an utterly unspiritual and crassly material
          view. It is totally at variance with the Biblical representation as a
          whole. This, of course, does not mean that some pagans may not have
          held that view later on, but it does mean that it is entirely
          unwarranted to regard this as the original view.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The homage-theory, according to which sacrifices were originally
          expressions of homage and dependence. Man was prompted to seek closer
          communion with God, not by a sense of guilt, but by a feeling of
          dependence and a desire to render homage to God. This theory does not
          do justice to the facts in the case of such early sacrifices as those
          of Noah and Job; nor does it explain why this homage should be
          rendered in the form of slaying an animal.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. The symbol-theory, which regards the offerings as symbols of
          restored communion with God. The killing of the animal took place only
          to secure the blood, which as a symbol of life was brought upon the
          altar, signifying communion of life with God (Keil). This theory
          certainly does not square with the facts in the case of the sacrifices
          of Noah and Job, nor with those in the case of Abraham, when he placed
          Isaac upon the altar. Neither does it explain why in later days so
          much importance was attached to the killing of the animal.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. The piacular theory, which regards sacrifices as being originally
          expiatory or atoning. On this theory the fundamental idea in the
          slaying of the animal was that of vicarious atonement for the sins of
          the offerer. In the light of Scripture this theory certainly deserves
          preference. The idea that, whatever other elements may have been
          present, such as an expression of gratitude to God, or of communion
          with Him, the piacular element was also present and was even the most
          prominent element, is favored by the following considerations: (a) The
          recorded effect of Noah's burnt-offerings is expiatory, Gen_8:21. (b)
          The occasion for the sacrifice of Job lay in the sins of his children,
          Job_1:5. (c) This theory accounts for the fact that the sacrifices
          were regularly brought in the form of slain animals, and that they
          were bloody, involving the suffering and death of the victim. (d) It
          is fully in harmony with the fact that the sacrifices which prevailed
          among heathen nations generally, were certainly regarded as expiatory.
          (e) It is further in perfect agreement with the undoubted presence of
          several promises of the coming Redeemer in the pre-Mosaic period. This
          should be borne in mind by those who regard the piacular idea of
          sacrifices as too advanced for that time. (f) Finally, it also fits in
          well with the fact that, when the Mosaic sacrificial ritual was
          introduced, in which the expiatory element was certainly the most
          prominent, it was in no way represented as something entirely new.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among those who believe that the piacular element was present even in
          the pre- Mosaic sacrifices, there is a difference of opinion as to the
          origin of this type of sacrifices. Some are of the opinion that God
          instituted them by a direct divine command, while others hold that
          they were brought in obedience to a natural impulse of man, coupled
          with reflection. The Bible does not record any special statement to
          the effect that God commanded man to serve Him with sacrifices in
          those early days. And it is not impossible that man expressed His
          gratitude and devotion in sacrifices, even before the fall, led by the
          inner promptings of his own nature. But it would seem that the
          expiatory sacrifices after the fall could originate only in a divine
          appointment. There is considerable force in the arguments of Dr. A. A.
          Hodge. Says he: "(1) It is inconceivable that either the propriety or
          probable utility of presenting material gifts to the invisible God,
          and especially of attempting to propitiate God by the slaughter of His
          irrational creatures, should ever have occurred to the human mind as a
          spontaneous suggestion. Every instinctive sentiment and every
          presumption of reason must, in the first instance, have appeared to
          exclude them. (2) On the hypothesis that God intended to save men, it
          is inconceivable that He should have left them without instruction
          upon a question so vital as that concerned in the means whereby they
          might approach into His presence and conciliate His favor. (3) It is
          characteristic of all God's self-revelations, under every
          dispensation, that He discovers Himself as jealous of any use by man
          of unauthorized methods of worship or service. He uniformly insists
          upon this very point of His sovereign right of dictating methods of
          worship and service, as well as terms of acceptance. (4) As a matter
          of fact, the very first recorded instance of acceptable worship in the
          family of Adam brings before us bleeding sacrifices, and seals them
          with the divine approbation. They appear in the first act of worship,
          Gen_4:3-4. They are emphatically approved by God as soon as they
          appear."38 The Mosaic sacrifices were clearly of divine appointment.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE SACRIFICIAL WORK OF CHRIST SYMBOLIZED AND TYPIFIED. The
          sacrificial work of Christ was symbolized and typified in the Mosaic
          sacrifices. In connection with these sacrifices the following points
          deserve attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Their expiatory and vicarious nature. Various interpretations have
          been given of the Old Testament sacrifices: (1) that they were gifts
          to please God, to express gratitude to Him, or to placate His wrath;
          (2) that they were essentially sacrificial meals symbolizing communion
          of man with God; (3) that they were divinely appointed means of
          confessing the heinousness of sin; or (4) that, in so far as they
          embodied the idea of substitution, they were merely symbolic
          expressions of the fact that God accepts the sinner, in lieu of actual
          obedience, in the sacrifice which expresses his desire to obey and his
          longing for salvation. However, Scripture testifies to the fact that
          all the animal sacrifices among Israel were piacular, though this
          feature was not equally prominent in all of them. It was most
          prominent in the sin- and trespass-offerings, less prominent in the
          burnt-offering, and least in evidence in the peace-offerings. The
          presence of that element in those sacrifices appears (1) from the
          clear statements in Lev_1:4; Lev_4:29; Lev_4:35; Lev_5:10; Lev_16:7;
          Lev_17:11; (2) from the laying on of hands which, in spite of Cave's
          assertion to the contrary, certainly served to symbolize the transfer
          of sin and guilt, Lev_1:4; Lev_16:21-22; (3) from the sprinkling of
          the blood on the altar and on the mercy-seat as a covering for sin,
          Lev_16:27; and (4) from the repeatedly recorded effect of the
          sacrifices, namely the pardoning of the sins of the offerer, Lev_4:26;
          Lev_4:31; Lev_4:35. New Testament proofs could easily be added, but
          these will suffice.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Their typico-prophetical nature. The Mosaic sacrifices had not only
          ceremonial and symbolical, but also spiritual and typical
          significance. They were of a prophetical character, and represented
          the gospel in the law. They were designed to prefigure the vicarious
          sufferings of Jesus Christ and His atoning death. The connection
          between them and Christ is already indicated in the Old Testament. In
          Psa_40:6-8 the Messiah is introduced as saying: "Sacrifice and
          offering thou hast no delight in: Mine eyes hast thou opened;
          burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required. Then said I,
          Lo, I come; in the roll of the book it is written of me; I delight to
          do thy will O my God, yea thy law is within my heart." In these words
          the Messiah Himself substitutes His own great sacrifice for those of
          the Old Testament. The shadows pass away when the reality, which they
          adumbrated, arrives, Heb_10:5-9. In the New Testament there are
          numerous indications of the fact that the Mosaic sacrifices were
          typical of the more excellent sacrifice of Jesus Christ. There are
          clear indications, and even express statements, to the effect that the
          Old Testament sacrifices prefigured Christ and His work, Col_2:17,
          where the apostle clearly has the whole Mosaic system in mind;
          Heb_9:23-24; Heb_10:1; Heb_13:11-12. Several passages teach that
          Christ accomplished for sinners in a higher sense what the Old
          Testament sacrifices were said to effect for those who brought them,
          and that He accomplished it in a similar way, 2Co_5:21; Gal_3:13;
          1Jn_1:7. He is called "the Lamb of God", Joh_1:29, clearly in view of
          Isa_53:1-12 and of the paschal lamb, "a Lamb without blemish and
          without spot," 1Pe_1:19, and even "our Passover" that was slain for
          us, 1Co_5:7. And because the Mosaic sacrifices were typical, they
          naturally shed some light on the nature of the great atoning sacrifice
          of Jesus Christ. A great many scholars under the influence of the
          Graf-Wellhausen school deny the penal and substitutionary character of
          the Old Testament sacrifices, though some of them are willing to admit
          that this character was sometimes ascribed to them during the Old
          Testament period, though at a comparatively late date and without
          sufficient warrant.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Their purpose. In view of the preceding it may be said that the Old
          Testament sacrifices had a twofold purpose. As far as the theocratic,
          the covenant, relation was concerned, they were the appointed means
          whereby the offender could be restored to the outward place and
          privileges, enjoyed as a member of the theocracy, which he had
          forfeited by neglect and transgression. As such they accomplished
          their purpose irrespective of the temper and spirit in which they were
          brought. However, they were not in themselves efficacious to expiate
          moral transgressions. They were not the real sacrifice that could
          atone for moral guilt and remove moral pollution, but only shadows of
          the coming reality. Speaking of the tabernacle, the writer of Hebrews
          says: "Which is a figure for the time present; according to which are
          offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot, as touching the
          conscience, make the worshipper perfect", Heb_9:9. In the following
          chapter he points out that they could not make the offerers perfect,
          Heb_10:1, and could not take away sins, Heb_10:4. From the spiritual
          point of view they were typical of the vicarious sufferings and death
          of Christ, and obtained forgiveness and acceptance with God only as
          they were offered in true penitence, and with faith in God's method of
          salvation. They had saving significance only in so far as they fixed
          the attention of the Israelite on the coming Redeemer and the promised
          redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. SCRIPTURAL PROOF FOR THE SACRIFICIAL WORK OF CHRIST. The striking
          thing in the Scriptural representations of the priestly work of
          Christ, is that Christ appears in them as both priest and sacrifice.
          This is in perfect harmony with the reality as we see it in Christ. In
          the Old Testament the two were necessarily separate, and in so far
          these types were imperfect. The priestly work of Christ is most
          clearly represented in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where the Mediator
          is described as our only real, eternal, and perfect High Priest,
          appointed by God, who takes our place vicariously, and by His self-
          sacrifice obtains a real and perfect redemption, Heb_5:1-10;
          Heb_7:1-28; Heb_9:11-15; Heb_9:24-28; Heb_10:11-14; Heb_10:19-22;
          Heb_12:24, and particularly the following verses, Heb_5:5; Heb_7:26;
          Heb_9:14. This Epistle is the only one in which Christ is called
          priest, but His priestly work is also clearly represented in the
          Epistles of Paul, Rom_3:24-25; Rom_5:6-8; 1Co_5:7; 1Co_15:3; Eph_5:2.
          The same representation is found in the writings of John, Joh_1:29;
          Joh_3:14-15; 1Jn_2:2; 1Jn_4:10. The symbol of the brazen serpent is
          significant. As the brazen serpent was not itself poisonous, but yet
          represented the embodiment of sin, so Christ, the sinless One, was
          made sin for us. As the lifting up of the serpent signified the
          removal of the plague, so the lifting up of Christ on the cross
          effected the removal of sin. And as a believing look at the serpent
          brought healing, so faith in Christ heals to the saving of the soul.
          The representation of Peter, 1Pe_2:24; 1Pe_3:18, and of Christ
          Himself, Mar_10:45, corresponds with the preceding. The Lord plainly
          tells us that His sufferings were vicarious.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE PRIESTLY WORK OF CHRIST IN MODERN THEOLOGY. As was said in the
          preceding chapter, the doctrine of the offices of Christ does not meet
          with great favor in present day theology. As a matter of fact it is
          generally conspicuous by its absence. It can hardly be denied that the
          Bible speaks of Christ as prophet, priest, and king, but it is
          commonly held that these terms, as applied to Christ, are only so many
          figurative descriptions of the different aspects of Christ's work.
          Christ is not regarded as a real prophet, a real priest, and a real
          king. And if any one of the aspects of the work of Christ is made to
          stand out as pre-eminent, it is the prophetical rather than the
          priestly aspect. The modern spirit is quite averse to the official
          Christ, and while it may be greatly in love with the self-denying and
          self-sacrificing Jesus, it absolutely refuses to recognize His
          official priesthood. In view of this it should be emphasized at the
          outset that, according to Scripture, Jesus is a real priest. As over
          against the priests of the Old Testament, who were merely shadows and
          types, He may be called the only real priest. He was revealed among
          men as the truth, that is, the reality of all the shadows of the Old
          Testament, and therefore also of the Old Testament priesthood. The
          seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews stresses the fact that
          His priesthood is vastly superior to that of Aaron. Consequently it is
          a sad mistake to assume that He is priest only in some figurative
          sense, in the sense in which devotees of literature and art are
          sometimes called priests. This is an entirely unwarranted use of the
          word "priest", and one that is entirely foreign to Scripture. When
          Jehovah swore, "Thou art a priest forever after the order of
          Melchizedek," He constituted the Messiah a real priest.
