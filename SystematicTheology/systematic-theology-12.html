        <p>V. Creation of the Material World</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPTURAL ACCOUNT OF CREATION</p>
        <p>
          Other nations, as well as the Hebrews, had their accounts respecting
          the origin of the material universe, and of the way in which the
          original chaos was changed into a cosmos or habitable world. Some of
          those accounts reveal traces of similarity with the Biblical record,
          but contain even more striking dissimilarities. They are as a rule
          characterized by dualistic or polytheistic elements, represent the
          present world as the result of a fierce struggle among the gods, and
          are far removed from the simplicity and sobriety of the Biblical
          account. It may be advisable to preface our discussion of its details
          with a few general remarks.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE POINT OF VIEW FROM WHICH THE BIBLE CONTEMPLATES THE WORK OF
          CREATION. It is a significant thing that the narrative of creation,
          while it mentions the creation of the heavens, devotes no further
          attention to the spiritual world. It concerns the material world only,
          and represents this primarily as the habitation of man and as the
          theater of his activities. It deals not with unseen realities such as
          spirits, but with the things that are seen. And because these things
          are palpable to the human senses, they come up for discussion, not
          only in theology, but also in other sciences and in philosophy. But
          while philosophy seeks to understand the origin and nature of all
          things by the light of reason, theology takes its starting point in
          God, allows itself to be guided by His special revelation respecting
          the work of creation, and considers everything in relation to Him. The
          narrative of creation is the beginning of God's self-revelation, and
          acquaints us with the fundamental relation in which everything, man
          included, stands to Him. It stresses the original position of man, in
          order that men of all ages might have a proper understanding of the
          rest of Scripture as a revelation of redemption. While it does not
          pretend to give us a complete philosophical cosmogony, it does contain
          important elements for the construction of a proper cosmogony.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE ORIGIN OF THE ACCOUNT OF CREATION. The question as to the
          origin of the narrative of creation has been raised repeatedly, and
          the interest in it was renewed by the discovery of the Babylonian
          story of creation. This story, as it is known to us, took shape in the
          city of Babylon. It speaks of the generation of several gods, of whom
          Marduk proves supreme. He only was sufficiently powerful to overcome
          the primeval dragon Tiamat, and becomes the creator of the world, whom
          men worship. There are some points of similarity between the narrative
          of creation in Genesis and this Babylonian story. Both speak of a
          primeval chaos, and of a division of the waters below and above the
          firmament. Genesis speaks of seven days, and the Babylonian account is
          arranged in seven tablets. Both accounts connect the heavens with the
          fourth epoch of creation, and the creation of man with the sixth. Some
          of these resemblances are of little significance, and the differences
          of the two accounts are far more important. The Hebrew order differs
          on many points from the Babylonian. The greatest difference is found,
          however, in the religious conceptions of the two. The Babylonian
          account, in distinction from that of Scripture, is mythological and
          polytheistic. The gods do not stand on a high level, but scheme and
          plot and fight. And Marduk succeeds only after a prolonged struggle,
          which taxes his strength, in overcoming the evil forces and reducing
          chaos to order. In Genesis, on the other hand, we encounter the most
          sublime monotheism, and see God calling forth the universe and all
          created things by the simple word of His power. When the Babylonian
          account was discovered, many scholars hastily assumed that the
          Biblical narrative was derived from the Babylonian source, forgetting
          that there are at least two other possibilities, namely, (a) that the
          Babylonian story is a corrupted reproduction of the narrative in
          Genesis; or (b) that both are derived from a common, more primitive,
          source. But however this question may be answered, it does not settle
          the problem of the origin of the narrative. How did the original,
          whether written or oral, come into existence? Some regard it simply as
          the natural product of man's reflection on the origin of things. But
          this explanation is extremely unlikely in view of the following facts:
          (a) the idea of creation is incomprehensible; (b) science and
          philosophy both equally oppose the doctrine of creation out of
          nothing; and (c) it is only by faith that we understand that the
          worlds have been framed by the word of God, Heb_11:3. We therefore
          come to the conclusion that the story of creation was revealed to
          Moses or to one of the earlier patriarchs. If this revelation was
          pre-Mosaic, it passed in tradition (oral or written) from one
          generation to another, probably lost something of its original purity,
          and was finally incorporated in a pure form, under the guidance of the
          Holy Spirit, in the first book of the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE INTERPRETATION OF Gen_1:1-2. Some regard Gen_1:1 as the
          superscription or title of the whole narrative of creation. But this
          is objectionable for three reasons: (a) because the following
          narrative is connected with the first verse by the Hebrew conjunction
          waw (and), which would not be the case if the first verse were a
          title; (b) because, on that supposition, there would be no account
          whatsoever of the original and immediate creation; and (c) since the
          following verses contain no account of the creation of heaven at all.
          The more generally accepted interpretation is that Gen_1:1 records the
          original and immediate creation of the universe, Hebraistically called
          "heaven and earth." In this expression the word "heaven" refers to
          that invisible order of things in which the glory of God reveals
          itself in the most perfect manner. It cannot be regarded as a
          designation of the cosmical heavens, whether of the clouds or of the
          stars, for these were created on the second and on the fourth day of
          the creative week. Then in the second verse the author describes the
          original condition of the earth (comp. Psa_104:5-6). It is a debatable
          question, whether the original creation of matter formed a part of the
          work of the first day, or was separated from this by a shorter or
          longer period of time. Of those who would interpose a long period
          between the two, some hold that the world was originally a dwelling
          place of angels, was destroyed as the result of a fall in the angelic
          world, and was then reclaimed and turned into a fit habitation for
          men. We shall refer to this restitution theory in another connection.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE HEXAEMERON, OR THE WORK OF THE SEPARATE DAYS</p>
        <p>
          After the creation of the universe out of nothing in a moment of time,
          the existing chaos was gradually changed into a cosmos, a habitable
          world, in six successive days. Before the work of the separate days is
          indicated, the. question as to the length of the days of creation
          calls for a brief discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. CONSIDERATION OF THE THEORY THAT THEY WERE LONG PERIODS OF TIME.
          Some scholars assume that the days of Gen_1:1-31 were long periods of
          time, in order to make them harmonize with the geological periods. The
          opinion that these days were not ordinary days of twenty-four hours
          was not entirely foreign to early Christian theology, as E. C.
          Messenger shows in detail in his learned work on Evolution and
          Theology. But some of the Church Fathers, who intimated that these
          days were probably not to be regarded as ordinary days, expressed the
          opinion that the whole work of creation was finished in a moment of
          time, and that the days merely constituted a symbolical frame- work,
          which facilitated the description of the work of creation in an
          orderly fashion, so as to make it more intelligible to finite minds.
          The opinion that the days of creation were long periods came to the
          foreground again in recent years, not, however, as the result of
          exegetical studies, but under the influence of the disclosures of
          science. Previous to the nineteenth century the days of Genesis were
          most generally regarded as literal days. But, of course, human
          interpretation is fallible, and may have to be revised in the light of
          later discoveries. If traditional exegesis conflicts, not merely with
          scientific theories â€” which are themselves interpretations â€”, but
          with well established facts, re-thinking and reinterpretation is
          naturally in order. It can hardly be maintained, however, that the
          assumed geological periods necessitate a change of front, since they
          are by no means generally recognized, even in scientific circles, as
          well established facts. Some Christian scholars, such as Harris,
          Miley, Bettex, and Geesink, assume that the days of Genesis are
          geological days, and both Shedd and Hodge call attention to the
          remarkable agreement between the record of creation and the testimony
          of the rocks, and are inclined to regard the days of Genesis as
          geological periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question may be raised, whether it is exegetically possible to
          conceive of the days of Genesis as long periods of time. And then it
          must be admitted that the Hebrew word yom does not always denote a
          period of twenty-four hours in Scripture, and is not always used in
          the same sense even in the narrative of creation. It may mean daylight
          in distinction from darkness, Gen_1:5; Gen_1:16; Gen_1:18; day-light
          and darkness together, Gen_1:5; Gen_1:8; Gen_1:13 etc.; the six days
          taken together, Gen_2:4; and an indefinite period marked in its entire
          length by some characteristic feature, as trouble, Psa_20:1, wrath,
          Job_20:28, prosperity, Ecc_7:14, or salvation 2Co_6:2. Now some hold
          that the Bible favors the idea that the days of creation were
          indefinite periods of time, and call attention to the following: (a)
          The sun was not created until the fourth day, and therefore the length
          of the previous days could not yet be determined by the earth's
          relation to the sun. This is perfectly true, but does not prove the
          point. God had evidently, even previous to the fourth day, established
          a rhythmic alternation of light and darkness, and there is no ground
          for the assumption that the days so measured were of longer duration
          than the later days. Why should we assume that God greatly increased
          the velocity of the earth's revolutions after the light was
          concentrated in the sun? (b) The days referred to are God's days, the
          archetypal days, of which the days of men are merely ectypal copies;
          and with God a thousand years are as a single day, Psa_90:4; 2Pe_3:8.
          But this argument is based on a confusion of time and eternity. God ad
          intra has no days, but dwells in eternity, exalted far above all
          measurements of time. This is also the idea conveyed by Psa_90:4; and
          2Pe_3:8. The only actual days of which God has knowledge are the days
          of this time- space world. How does it follow from the fact that God
          is exalted above the limitations of time, as they exist in this world,
          where time is measured by days and weeks and months and years, that a
          day may just as well be a period of 100,000 years as one of
          twenty-four hours? (c) The seventh day, the day in which God rested
          from His labours, is said to continue up to the present time, and must
          therefore be regarded as a period of thousands of years. It is God's
          sabbath, and that sabbath never ends. This argument represents a
          similar confusion. The whole idea of God's beginning the work of
          creation at a certain point of time, and then ceasing it after a
          period of six days, does not apply to God as He is in Himself, but
          only to the temporal results of His creative activity. He is
          unchangeably the same from age to age. His sabbath is not an
          indefinitely prolonged period of time; it is eternal. On the other
          hand, the sabbath of the creation week was a day equal in length to
          the other days. God not only rested on that day, but He also blessed
          and hallowed it, setting it aside as a day of rest for man, Exo_20:11.
          This would hardly apply to the whole period from the time of creation
          up to the rpesent day.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. CONSIDERATION OF THE VIEW THAT THEY WERE LITERAL DAYS. The
          prevailing view has always been that the days of Gen_1:1-31 are to be
          understood as literal days. Some of the early Church Fathers did not
          regard them as real indications of the time in which the work of
          creation was completed, but rather as literary forms in which the
          writer of Genesis cast the narrative of creation, in order to picture
          the work of creation â€” which was really completed in a moment of
          time â€” in an orderly fashion for human intelligence. It was only
          after the comparatively new sciences of geology and palÃ¦ontology came
          forward with their theories of the enormous age of the earth, that
          theologians began to show an inclination to identify the days of
          creation with the long geological ages. To-day some of them regard it
          as an established fact that the days of Gen_1:1-31 were long
          geological periods; others are somewhat inclined to assume this
          position, but show considerable hesitation. Hodge, Sheldon, Van
          Oosterzee, and Dabney, some of whom are not entirely averse to this
          view, are all agreed that this interpretation of the days is
          exegetically doubtful, if not impossible. Kuyper and Bavinck hold
          that, while the first three days may have been of somewhat different
          length, the last three were certainly ordinary days. They naturally do
          not regard even the first three days as geological periods. Vos in his
          Gereformeerde Dogmatiek defends the position that the days of creation
          were ordinary days. Hepp takes the same position in his Calvinism and
          the Philosophy of Nature.70 Noortzij in Gods Woord en der Eeuwen
          Getuigenis,71 asserts that the Hebrew word yom (day) in Gen_1:1-31
          cannot possibly designate anything else than an ordinary day, but
          holds that the writer of Genesis did not attach any importance to the
          concept "day," but introduces it simply as part of a frame-work for
          the narrative of creation, not to indicate historical sequence, but to
          picture the glory of the creatures in the light of the great
          redemptive purpose of God. Hence the sabbath is the great culminating
          point, in which man reaches his real destiny. This view reminds us
          rather strongly of the position of some of the early Church Fathers.
          The arguments adduced for it are not very convincing, as Aalders has
          shown in his De Eerste Drie Hoofdstukken van Genesis.72 This Old
          Testament scholar holds, on the basis of Gen_1:5, that the term yom in
          Gen_1:1-31 denotes simply the period of light, as distinguished from
          that of darkness; but this view would seem to involve a rather
          unnatural interpretation of the repeated expression "and there was
          evening and there was morning." It must then be interpreted to mean,
          and there was evening preceded by a morning. According to Dr. Aalders,
          too, Scripture certainly favors the idea that the days of creation
          were ordinary days, though it may not be possible to determine their
          exact length, and the first three days may have differed somewhat from
          the last three.
        </p>
        <p>
          The literal interpretation of the term "day" in Gen_1:1-31 is favored
          by the following considerations: (a) In its primary meaning the word
          yom denotes a natural day; and it is a good rule in exegesis, not to
          depart from the primary meaning of a word, unless this is required by
          the context. Dr. Noortzij stresses the fact that this word simply does
          not mean anything else than "day," such as this is known by man on
          earth. (b) The author of Genesis would seem to shut us up absolutely
          to the literal interpretation by adding in the case of every day the
          words, "and there was evening and there was morning." Each one of the
          days mentioned has just one evening and morning, something that would
          hardly apply to a period of thousands of years. And if it should be
          said that the periods of creation were extraordinary days, each one
          consisting of one long day and one long night, then the question
          naturally arises, What would become of all vegetation during the long,
          long night? (c) In Exo_20:9-11 Israel is commanded to labor six days
          and to rest on the seventh, because Jehovah made heaven and earth in
          six days and rested on the seventh day. Sound exegesis would seem to
          require that the word "day" be taken in the same sense in both
          instances. Moreover the sabbath set aside for rest certainly was a
          literal day; and the presumption is that the other days were of the
          same kind. (d) The last three days were certainly ordinary days, for
          they were determined by the sun in the usual way. While we cannot be
          absolutely sure that the preceding days did not differ from them at
          all in length, it is extremely unlikely that they differed from them,
          as periods of thousands upon thousands of years differ from ordinary
          days. The question may also be asked, why such a long period should be
          required, for instance, for the separation of light and darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE WORK OF THE SEPARATE DAYS. We notice in the work of creation a
          definite gradation, the work of each day leads up to and prepares for
          the work of the next, the whole of it culminating in the creation of
          man, the crown of God's handiwork, entrusted with the important task
          of making the whole of creation subservient to the glory of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The first day. On the first day the light was created, and by the
          separation of light and darkness day and night were constituted. This
          creation of light on the first day has been ridiculed in view of the
          fact that the sun was not created until the fourth day, but science
          itself silenced the ridicule by proving that light is not a substance
          emanating from the sun, but consists of ether waves produced by
          energetic electrons. Notice also that Genesis does not speak of the
          sun as light (or), but as light-bearer (ma'or), exactly what science
          has discovered it to be. In view of the fact that light is the
          condition of all life, it was but natural that it should be created
          first. God also at once instituted the ordinance of the alternation of
          light and darkness, calling the light day and the darkness night. We
          are not told, however, how this alternation was effected. The account
          of each day's work closes with the words, "and there was evening and
          there was morning." The days are not reckoned from evening to evening,
          but from morning to morning. After twelve hours there was evening, and
          after another twelve hours there was morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          b.The second day. The work of the second day was also a work of
          separation: the firmament was established by dividing the waters above
          and the waters below. The waters above are the clouds, and not, as
          some would have it, the sea of glass, Rev_4:6; Rev_15:2, and the river
          of life, Rev_22:1. Some have discredited the Mosaic account on the
          supposition that it represents the firmament as a solid vault; but
          this is entirely unwarranted, for the Hebrew word raqia does not
          denote a solid vault at all, but is equivalent to our word "expanse."
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The third day. The separation is carried still further in the
          separation of the sea from the dry land, cf. Psa_104:8. In addition to
          that the vegetable kingdom of plants and trees was established. Three
          great classes are mentioned, namely, deshe', that is flowerless
          plants, which do not fructify one another in the usual way; ' esebh,
          consisting of vegetables and grain yielding seed; and 'ets peri or
          fruit trees, bearing fruit according to their kind. It should be noted
          here: (1) That, when God said, "Let the earth put forth grass" etc.,
          this was not equivalent to saying: Let inorganic matter develop by its
          own inherent force into vegetable life. It was a word of power by
          which God implanted the principle of life in the earth, and thus
          enabled it to bring forth grass and herbs and trees. That it was a
          creative word is evident from Gen_2:9. (2) That the statement, "and
          the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind,
          and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their
          kind" (Gen_1:12), distinctly favors the idea that the different
          species of plants were created by God, and did not develop the one out
          of the other. Each one brought forth seed after its kind, and could
          therefore only reproduce its kind. The doctrine of evolution, of
          course, negatives both of these assertions; but it should be borne in
          mind that both spontaneous generation and the development of one
          species from another, are unproved, and now largely discredited,
          assumptions.73

          d. The fourth day. Sun, moon, and stars, were created as
          light-bearers, to serve a variety of purposes: (1) to divide the day
          and the night; (2) to be for signs, that is, to indicate the cardinal
          points, to presage changes of weather conditions, and to serve as
          signs of important future events and coming judgments; (3) to be for
          seasons, and for days and years, that is, to serve the purpose of
          effecting the change of seasons, the succession of years, and the
          regular recurrence of special festive days; and (4) to serve as lights
          for the earth and thus to make the development of organic life on
          earth possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. The fifth day. This day brings the creation of the birds and the
          fishes, the inhabitants of the air and the waters. Birds and fishes
          belong together, because there is a great similarity in their organic
          structure. Moreover, they are characterized by an instability and
          mobility which they have in common with the element in which they
          move, in distinction from the solid ground. They also agree in their
          method of procreation. Notice that they, too, were created after their
          kind, that is, the species were created.
        </p>
        <p>
          f. The sixth day. This day brings the climax of the work of creation.
          In connection with the creation of the animals the expression is once
          more used, "Let the earth bring forth," and this should again be
          interpreted as was indicated under (c). The animals did not naturally
          develop out of the earth, but were brought forth by the creative fiat
          of God. We are told distinctly in Gen_1:25 that God made the beasts of
          the earth, the cattle and the creeping things of the earth, after
          their kind. But even if the expression did refer to natural
          development, it would not be in harmony with the doctrine of
          evolution, since that does not teach that the animals developed
          directly out of the mineral world. The creation of man is
          distinguished by the solemn counsel that precedes it: "Let us make man
          in our own image, after our likeness"; and this is no wonder, since
          all that preceded was but a preparation for the coming of man, the
          crowning work of God, the king of creation; and because man was
          destined to be the image of God. The words tselem and demuth do not
          denote exactly the same thing, but are nevertheless used
          interchangeably. When it is said that man is created in the image of
          God, this means that God is the archetype of which man is is the
          ectype; and when it is added that he is created according to the
          likeness of God, this merely adds the idea that the image is in every
          way like the original. In his entire being man is the very image of
          God.

          Before passing on to the seventh day it may be well to call attention
          to the remarkable parallel between the work of the first, and that of
          the second three days of creation.

        <p>
          3. Separation of waters and dry land, and preparation of the earth as

          6. Creation of the beasts of the field, the cattle, and all creeping
          things; and man.
        </p>
        <p>
          g. The seventh day. The rest of God on the seventh day contains first
          of all a negative element. God ceased from His creative work. But to
          this must be added a positive element, namely, that He took delight in
          His completed work. His rest was as the rest of the artist, after He
          has completed His masterpiece, and now gazes upon it with profound
          admiration and delight, and finds perfect satisfaction in the
          contemplation of His production. "And God saw everything that He had
          made, and, behold, it was very good." It answered the purpose of God
          and corresponded to the divine ideal. Hence God rejoices in His
          creation, for in it He recognizes the reflection of His glorious
          perfections. His radiant countenance shines upon it and is productive
          of showers of blessings.

        <p>
          4. NO SECOND ACCOUNT OF CREATION IN Gen_2:1-25. It is quite common for
          advanced higher criticism to assume that Gen_2:1-25 contains a second
          and independent account of creation. The first account is regarded as
          the work of the Elohist, and the second as that of the Jehovist. The
          two, it is said, do not agree, but conflict on several points.
          According to the second account, as distinguished from the first, the
          earth is dry before the creation of plants; man is created before the
          animals, and that alone, not as man and woman; then God created the
          animals, in order to see whether they will be fit companions for man;
          seeing that they fail in that respect, He creates woman as a helpmeet
          for man; and, finally, He places man in the garden which He had
          prepared for him. But this is clearly a complete misunderstanding of
          the second chapter. Gen_2:1-25 is not, and does not pretend to be, a
          narrative of creation. The superscription 'eleh toledoth, which is
          found ten times in Genesis, never refers to the birth or origin of
          things, but always to their births, that is, their later history. The
          expression dates from a time when history still consisted in the
          description of generations. Gen_2:1-25 begins the description of the
          history of man, arranges its material to suit this purpose, and only
          repeats so much of what was said in the previous chapter, without any
          consideration of chronological order, as is necessary for the author's
          purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. ATTEMPTS TO HARMONIZE THE NARRATIVE OF CREATION WITH THE FINDINGS
          OF SCIENCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The ideal or allegorical interpretation. This gives prominence to
          the idea rather than to the letter of the narrative. It regards
          Gen_1:1-31 as a poetic description of the creative work of God,
          representing this from different points of view. But (1) it is quite
          evident that the narrative is intended as a record of history, and is
          clearly so regarded in Scripture, cf. Exo_20:11; Neh_9:6; Psa_33:6;
          Psa_33:9; Psa_145:2-6; (2) the opening chapter of Genesis "lacks
          nearly every element of acknowledged Hebrew poetry" (Strong); and (3)
          this narrative is inseparably connected with the succeeding history,
          and is therefore most naturally regarded as itself historical.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The mythical theory of modern philosophy. Modern philosophy has
          advanced beyond the preceding position. It rejects not only the
          historical narrative of creation, but also the idea of creation, and
          regards the contents of Gen_1:1-31 as a myth embodying a religious
          lesson. There is no intentional allegory here, it is said, but only a
          naive mythical representation with a religious core or nucleus. This
          is also contrary to the fact that Gen_1:1-31 certainly comes to us
          with the pretension of being a historical narrative, and in the cross
          references, referred to above, it certainly is not regarded as a myth.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The restitution theory. Some theologians attempted to reconcile the
          narrative of creation with the discoveries of science in the study of
          the earth by adopting the restitution theory. It was advocated by
          Chalmers, Buckland, Wisemann, and Delitzsch, and assumes that a long
          period of time elapsed between the primary creation mentioned in
          Gen_1:1 and the secondary creation described in Gen_1:3-31. This long
          period was marked by several catastrophic changes, resulting in the
          destruction supposedly described in the words "waste and void." The
          second verse should then read, "And the earth became waste and void."
          This destruction was followed by a restitution, when God changed the
          chaos into a cosmos, a habitable world for man. This theory might
          offer some explanation of the different strata of the earth, but it
          offers no explanation of the fossils in the rocks, unless it is
          assumed that there were also successive creations of animals, followed
          by mass destructions. This theory never found favor in scientific
          circles, and finds no support in Scripture. The Bible does not say
          that the earth became, but that it was waste and void. And even if the
          Hebrew verb hayetha can be rendered "became," the words "waste and
          void" denote an unformed condition, and not a condition resulting from
          destruction. Delitzsch combined with this theory the idea that the
          earth was originally inhabited by the angels, and that the fall in the
          angelic world was the cause of the destruction which resulted in the
          chaos referred to in Gen_1:2. For some reason or other this view finds
          considerable favor among present day dispensationalists, who find
          support for it in such passages as Isa_24:1; Jer_4:23-26; Job_9:4-7;
          2Pe_2:4. But even a careful reading of these passages is sufficient to
          convince one that they do not prove the point in question at all.
          Moreover, the Bible clearly teaches us that God created heaven and
          earth "and all the host of them" in six days, Gen_2:1; Exo_20:11.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. The concordistic theory. This seeks to harmonize Scripture and
          science by assuming that the days of creation were periods of
          thousands of years. In addition to what was said about this in
          discussing the days of creation, we may now add that the idea that the
          earth's strata positively point to long and successive periods of
          development in the history of its origin, is simply a theory of the
          geologists, and a theory based on unwarranted generalizations. We
          would call attention to the following considerations: (1) The science
          of geology is not only young, but it is still in bondage to
          speculative thought. It cannot be considered as an inductive science,
          since it is largely the fruit of a priori or deductive reasoning.
          Spencer called it "Illogical Geology" and ridiculed its methods, and
          Huxley spoke of its grand hypotheses as "not proven and not
          provable."74 (2) Up to the present time it has done little more than
          scratch the surface of the earth, and that in a very limited number of
          places. As a result its conclusions are often mere generalizations,
          based on insufficient data. Facts observed in some places are
          contradicted by those found in others. (3) Even if it had explored
          large areas in all parts of the globe, it could only increase our
          knowledge of the present condition of the earth, but would never be
          able to give us perfectly reliable information respecting its past
          history. You cannot write the history of a nation on the basis of the
          facts observed in its present constitution and life. (4) Geologists
          once proceeded on the assumption that the strata of rocks were found
          in the same order all over the globe; and that by estimating the
          length of time required by the formation of each it could determine
          the age of the earth. But (a) it was found that the order of the rocks
          differs in various localities; (b) the experiments made to determine
          the time required for the formation of the different strata, led to
          widely different results; and (c) the uniformitarian theory of Lyell,
          that the physical and chemical action of today are safe guides in
          estimating those of all previous times, was found to be unreliable.75
          (5) When the attempt to determine the age of the various strata or
          rocks by their mineral and mechanical make-up failed, geologists began
          to make the fossils the determining factor. Palaeontology became the
          really important subject, and under the influence of the
          uniformitarian principle of Lyell developed into one of the important
          proofs of evolution. It is simply assumed that certain fossils are
          older than others; and if the question is asked on what basis the
          assumption rests, the answer is that they are found in the older
          rocks. This is just plain reasoning in a circle. The age of the rocks
          is determined by the fossils which they contain, and the age of the
          fossils by the rocks in which they are found. But the fossils are not
          always found in the same order; sometimes the order is reversed. (6)
          The order of the fossils as now determined by geology does not
          correspond to the order which the narrative of creation leads us to
          expect, so that even the acceptance of the geological theory would not
          serve the purpose of harmonizing Scripture and science.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION AND THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION. The question
          naturally arises in our day, How does the theory of evolution affect
          the doctrine of creation?
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The theory of evolution cannot take the place of the doctrine of
          creation. Some speak as if the hypothesis of evolution offered an
          explanation of the origin of the world; but this is clearly a mistake,
          for it does no such thing. Evolution is development, and all
          development presupposes the prior existence of an entity or principle
          or force, out of which something develops. The non-existent cannot
          develop into existence. Matter and force could not have evolved out of
          nothing. It has been customary for evolutionists to fall back on the
          nebular hypothesis, in order to explain the origin of the solar
          system, though in present day science this is supplanted by the
          planetesimal hypothesis. But these only carry the problem one step
          farther back, and fail to solve it. The evolutionist must either
          resort to the theory that matter is eternal, or accept the doctrine of
          creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          b.The theory of naturalistic evolution is not in harmony with the
          narrative of creation. If evolution does not account for the origin of
          the world, does it not at least give a rational account of the
          development of things out of primordial matter, and thus explain the
          origin of the present species of plants and animals (including man),
          and also the various phenomena of life, such as sentiency,
          intelligence, morality, and religion? Does it necessarily conflict
          with the narrative of creation? Now it is perfectly evident that
          naturalistic evolution certainly does conflict with the Biblical
          account. The Bible teaches that plants and animals and man appeared on
          the scene at the creative fiat of the Almighty; but according to the
          evolutionary hypothesis they evolved out of the inorganic world by a
          process of natural development. The Bible represents God as creating
          plants and animals after their kind, and yielding seed after their
          kind, that is, so that they would reproduce their own kind; but the
          theory of evolution points to natural forces, resident in nature,
          leading to the development of one species out of another. According to
          the narrative of creation, the vegetable and animal kingdoms and man
          were brought forth in a single week; but the hypothesis of evolution
          regards them as the product of a gradual development in the course of
          millions of years. Scripture pictures man as standing on the highest
          plane at the beginning of his career, and then descending to lower
          levels by the deteriorating influence of sin; the theory of evolution,
          on the other hand, represents original man as only slightly different
          from the brute, and claims that the human race has risen, through its
          own inherent powers, to ever higher levels of existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The theory of naturalistic evolution is not well established and
          fails to account for the facts. The conflict referred to in the
          preceding would be a serious matter, if the theory of evolution were
          an established fact. Some think it is and confidently speak of the
          dogma of evolution. Others, however, correctly remind us of the fact
          that evolution is still only a hypothesis. Even so great a scientist
          as Ambrose Fleming says that "the close analysis of the ideas
          connected with the term Evolution shows them to be insufficient as a
          philosophic or scientific solution of the problems of reality and
          existence."76 The very uncertainty which prevails in the camp of the
          evolutionists is proof positive that evolution is only a hypothesis.
          Moreover, it is frankly admitted to-day by many who still cling to the
          principle of evolution that they do not understand its method of
          operation. It was thought at one time that Darwin had furnished the
          key to the whole problem, but that key is now rather generally
          discarded. The foundation pillars, on which the Darwinian structure
          was reared, such as the principle of use and disuse, the struggle for
          existence, natural selection, and the transmission of acquired
          characteristics, have been removed one after another. Such
          evolutionists as Weissmann, De Vries, Mendel, and Bateson, all
          contributed to the collapse of the Darwinian edifice. Nordenskioeld,
          in his History of Biology, speaks of the "dissolution of Darwinism" as
          an established fact. Dennert calls us to the deathbed of Darwinism,
          and O'Toole says, "Darwinism is dead, and no grief of mourners can
          resuscitate the corpse." Morton speaks of "the bankruptcy of
          evolution," and Price of the "phantom of organic evolution."
          Darwinism, then, has admittedly failed to explain the origin of
          species, and evolutionists have not been able to offer a better
          explanation. The Mendelian law accounts for variations, but not for
          the origin of new species. It really points away from the development
          of new species by a natural process. Some are of the opinion that the
          mutation theory of De Vries or Lloyd Morgan's theory of emergent
          evolution points the way, but neither one of these has proved to be a
          successful explanation of the origin of species by natural development
          pure and simple. It is now admitted that the mutants of De Vries are
          varietal rather than specific, and cannot be regarded as the
          beginnings of new species. And Morgan feels constrained to admit that
          he cannot explain his emergents without falling back upon some
          creative power that might be called God. Morton says: "The fact is
          that, besides creation, there is not even a theory of origins to hold
          the field today."77
        </p>
        <p>
          The hypothesis of evolution fails at several points. It cannot explain
          the origin of life. Evolutionists sought its explanation in
          spontaneous generation, an unproved assumption, which is now
          discredited. It is a well established fact in science that life can
          only come from antecedent life. Further, it has failed utterly to
          adduce a single example of one species producing another distinct
          (organic as distinguished from varietal) species. Bateson said in
          1921: "We cannot see how the differentiation in species came about.
          Variations of many kinds, often considerable, we daily witness, but no
          origin of species.... Meanwhile, though our faith in evolution stands
          unshaken, we have no acceptable account of the origin of species."78
          Neither has evolution been able successfully to cope with the problems
          presented by the origin of man. It has not even succeeded in proving
          the physical descent of man from the brute. J. A. Thomson, author of
          The Outline of Science and a leading evolutionist, holds that man
          really never was an animal, a fierce beastly looking creature, but
          that the first man sprang suddenly, by a big leap, from the primate
          stock into a human being. Much less has it been able to explain the
          psychical side of man's life. The human soul, endowed with
          intelligence, self- consciousness, freedom, conscience, and religious
          aspirations, remains an unsolved enigma.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Theistic evolution is not tenable in the light of Scripture. Some
          Christian scientists and theologians seek to harmonize the doctrine of
          creation, as taught by Scripture, and the theory of evolution by
          accepting what they call theistic evolution. It is a protest against
          the attempt to eliminate God, and postulates Him as the almighty
          worker back of the whole process of development. Evolution is regarded
          simply as God's method of working in the development of nature.
          Theistic evolution really amounts to this, that God created the world
          (the cosmos) by a process of evolution, a process of natural
          development, in which He does not miraculously intervene, except in
          cases where this is absolutely necessary. It is willing to admit that
          the absolute beginning of the world could only result from a direct
          creative activity of God; and, if it can find no natural explanation,
          will also grant a direct intervention of God in the origination of
          life and of man. It has been hailed as Christian evolution, though
          there is not necessarily anything Christian about it. Many, otherwise
          opposed to the theory of evolution, have welcomed it, because it
          recognizes God in the process and is supposed to be compatible with
          the Scriptural doctrine of creation. Hence it is freely taught in
          churches and Sunday Schools. As a matter of fact, however, it is a
          very dangerous hybrid. The name is a contradiction in terms, for it is
          neither theism nor naturalism, neither creation nor evolution in the
          accepted sense of the terms. And it does not require a great deal of
          penetration to see that Dr. Fairhurst is right in his conviction "that
          theistic evolution destroys the Bible as the inspired book of
          authority as effectively as does atheistic evolution."79 Like
          naturalistic evolution it teaches that it required millions of years
          to produce the present habitable world; and that God did not create
          the various species of plants and animals, and that, so that they
          produced their own kind; that man, at least on his physical side, is a
          descendant of the brute and therefore began his career on a low level;
          that there has been no fall in the Biblical sense of the word, but
          only repeated lapses of men in their upward course; that sin is only a
          weakness, resulting from man's animal instincts and desires, and does
          not constitute guilt; that redemption is brought about by the
          ever-increasing control of the higher element in man over his lower
          propensities; that miracles do not occur, either in the natural or in
          the spiritual world; that regeneration, conversion, and sanctification
          are simply natural psychological changes, and so on. In a word, it is
          a theory that is absolutely subversive of Scripture truth.

          Some Christian scholars of the present day feel that Bergson's theory
          of Creative Evolution commends itself to those who do not want to
          leave God out of consideration. This French philosopher assumes an
          Ã©lan vital a vital impulse in the world, as the ground and animating
          principle of all life. This vital principle does not spring from
          matter, but is rather the originating cause of matter. It pervades
          matter, overcomes its inertia and resistance by acting as a living
          force on that which is essentially dying, and ever creates, not new
          material, but new movements adapted to ends of its own, and thus
          creates very much as the artist creates. It is directive and purposive
          and yet, though conscious, does not work according to a preconceived
          plan, however that may be possible. It determines evolution itself as
          well as the direction in which evolution moves. This ever creating
          life, "of which every individual and every species is an experiment,"
          is Bergson's God, a God who is finite, who is limited in power, and
          who is seemingly impersonal, though Hermann says that "we shall,
          perhaps, not go far wrong in believing that he will be 'the ideal
          tendency of things' made personal."80 Haas speaks of Bergson as a
          vitalistic pantheist rather than a theist. At any rate, his God is a
          God that is wholly within the world. This view may have a special
          appeal for the modern liberal theologian, but is even less in harmony
          with the narrative of creation than theistic evolution.

          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY. What is the real alternative to the
          doctrine of creation? Wherein lies the importance of the doctrine of
          creation? Should the first chapters of Genesis be allowed to have any
          bearing on the scientific study of the origin of things? Does the
          Bible in any way determine the time when the world was created? What
          extremes should be avoided as to the relation of God and the world to
          each other? Should the Bible always be interpreted in harmony with
          widely accepted scientific theories? What is the status of the
          hypothesis of evolution in the scientific world today? What is the
          characteristic element in the Darwinian theory of evolution? How do
          you account for its widespread repudiation at the present time? How
          does Bergson's Creative Evolution or the Neo-vitalism of Hans Driesch
          affect the mechanistic view of the universe? In what respect is
          theistic evolution an improvement over naturalistic evolution?
