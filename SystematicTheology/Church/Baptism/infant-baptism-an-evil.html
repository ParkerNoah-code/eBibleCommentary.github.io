            consistently adhere. One or the other must, sooner or later, be
            abandoned. Their opposite characters indicate this result, and the
            history of the church, primitive, popish, and protestant, evinces
            that it is inevitable. Let the doctrines in question be separately

            says an apostle, "being justified freely by his grace through the
            redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a
            propitiation through faith in his blood…to declare…his righteousness
            for the remission of sins…that he might be just, and the justifier

            >And "being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
            Lord Jesus Christ.” (Rom. 5:1) Justification is the act of God by
            which he declares a man just and righteous. The justified are
            accepted, and approved, as if they had never sinned. This is an act
            of God's own free and sovereign grace, and therefore necessarily
            irrespective of any works or worthiness on the part of the
            justified. It is by faith, not as a meritorious agency to procure
            justification, but as the medium through which it is bestowed.

            faith, that it might be by grace;" faith being characterized by a
            peculiarity which harmonizes with grace, and which looks not to
            itself, but to Christ for righteousness and salvation. This,
            briefly, is justification by faith, as taught in the Word of

            whole subject. We must, of course, rely upon the statements of
            Protestant Pedobaptists for our authority. With Papists, I have at
            present nothing to do. Dr. Wall is more definite on this topic than
            any other writer now before me. He says: "Most of the Pedobaptists
            go no further than St. Austin does. They hold that God by his
            Spirit, does, at the time of baptism, seal and apply to the infant
            that is there dedicated to him, the promises of the covenant of
            which he is capable, viz.: adoption, pardon of sins, [and]
            translation from the state of nature to that of grace." (</span

            translation into the state of grace, and of course, that he receives
            justification! Davenant, the Bishop of Salisbury, thus speaks on
            this subject: "The justification, regeneration, and adoption of
            little children baptized, confers upon them a state of salvation."

            by baptism, either in infancy, or at any other time, and if you are
            justified by baptism, then you are not justified by faith. This
            conclusion is perfectly plain. These doctrines are therefore as
            opposite as darkness and light. They emphatically contradict and
            falsify each other.</span

            the gospel. It is vital. It is "the faith once delivered to the
            saints." (Jude 3) No system from which it is excluded can ever be
            justly regarded as embodying the religion of Christ. It was taught
            by the apostles, and early ministers, constantly, forcibly,
            emphatically. It was cherished by the primitive churches as a
            priceless truth. How can we account for its abandonment by the
            professed followers of Jesus Christ?

            though it may be, to pass from the substance to the forms of
            religion. The transition is so easy that it can only be prevented by
            perpetual vigilance. The influence of this propensity the early
            churches did not very long escape. Among the first of the
            corruptions they admitted and embraced, was the undue importance
            which became attached to religious ceremonials. They gradually
            exalted the rites above the doctrines of Christianity, while both
            were perverted and misapplied.

            >Baptism, especially, was imagined to possess great and peculiar
            virtues. Thus justification through grace by faith was ultimately
            displaced by justification through grace by baptism. Popery was the
            result, the doctrine of which, on this subject, is thus expressed by
            the Council of Trent: “Justification is by means of the sacraments,
            either originally infused into us, or subsequently increased, or
            when lost, again restored.” (</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C3"
            >But justification by faith was restored at the Reformation. Noble
            efforts to give back to men this truth had previously been made by
            Tindall, and Wycliffe, and Huss, and others, but they all fell
            martyrs to their benevolent designs. All the denominations that then
            sprang out of popery, did not agree as to the details of religion;
            hence their separate organizations. But they all concurred in the
            doctrine of justification by faith, whether Lutheran, Calvinist, or
            Episcopalian. They each embodied it fully in their separate
            Confessions, and other standards.

            symbols, that opposite and contradictory system, infant baptism. Why
            they did this will more fully appear hereafter. I now speak of facts
            only. I am not attempting to account for them. Thus they threw
            together conflicting elements, which, as they had before done,
            gradually destroyed the blessings which had been gained. To the
            sublimest truths they united the rankest corruption. To the gospel
            of Christ they chained the main supports of Popery, ignorance, and
            worldly conformity. These facts are most readily demonstrated by
            reference to the standards themselves.</span

            Augsburg Confession is the symbol of Lutheranism. Its fourth article
            is in the following words: "They teach also that men cannot be
            justified before God by their own efforts, merits, or works, but are
            justified freely through Christ by faith, and are received into

            for anything wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ's sake
            alone ; not by imputing faith itself, the act of believing, or any

            their one-sided conception of the justification of man before God.
            Hereby especially the communication of really sanctifying graces by

            were to have no other destination than to make the faithful receiver
