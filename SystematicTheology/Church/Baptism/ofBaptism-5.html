        <h2>Defense of Baptizing by Immersion</h2>
        <p>A Defense Of A Book, Entitled,</p>
        <p>THE ANCIENT MODE OF BAPTIZING BY IMMERSION,</p>
        <p>Plunging, Or Dipping In Water, Etc.</p>
        <p>AGAINST MR. MATTHIAS MAURICE’S REPLY, CALLED,</p>
        <p>Plunging into Water no Scriptural Mode of Baptizing, etc.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 1.</p>
        <p>Some Remarks on Mr. M’s entrance to his Work</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Having lately attempted to vindicate the ancient mode of baptizing, by
          immersion, plunging, or dipping into water, against the exceptions of
          an anonymous pamphlet, entitled, The manner of baptizing with water,
          cleared up from the word of God and right reason, etc. The author, who
          appears to be Mr. Matthias Maurice of Rowell in Northamptonshire, has
          thought fit to reply. He seems angry at the treatment he has met with;
          but if he thought that his name would have commanded greater respect,
          why did not he put it to his book? and why did he refuse to give
          satisfaction to his friends when inquired of about the author of it?
          Would he be treated as a gentleman, a scholar, or a Christian? he
          ought to have wrote as such. Who is the aggressor? who gave the first
          provocation? If I have any where exceeded the bounds of Christianity,
          or humanity, I would readily acknowledge it upon the first conviction;
          but who indeed "can touch pitch, without being defiled with it?" Three
          or four pages are filled up with a whining, insinuating harangue, upon
          the nature of controversies, and the disagreeable temper and spirit
          with which they are frequently managed; designing hereby to wipe
          himself clean, whilst he is casting reproach upon others. I would not
          be an advocate for burlesque and banter in religious controversies;
          but if he would have them banished from thence, why does he make use
          of them, even in this his performance, which begins with such loud
          exclamations against them. As for instance, how does he pun upon
          presumptive proofs, page 13 and in page 27. Speaking of our baptizing
          in holes or cisterns, as he is pleased to call them, "Thus, says he,
          you have forsook the scriptural way of baptizing with water, and have
          hewn out unto yourselves cisterns," referring to Jer 2:13 besides the
          frequent sneers with which his book abounds. Now if burlesque and
          banter, in general, ought to be laid aside, much more punning and
          bantering with the words of scripture, which are sacred and awful. Is
          this the man that directs others to "write in the fear of God, having
          the awful Judge, and the approaching judgment in view;" and yet takes
          such a liberty as this? He says, page 7, "I shall not entertain the
          reader with any remarks upon his performance, as it is ludicrous,
          virulent and defaming:" Which, itself is a manifest defamation, as the
          reader cannot but observe; it being asserted without attempting to
          give one single instance wherein it appears to be so. With what face
          can he call it ludicrous; when he himself, in the debate, has been so
          wretchedly guilty that way? when he talks, page 9 of "Christ’s being
          under water still: and in page 10 of John’s thrusting the people into
          thorns and briars, when he baptized in the wilderness;" as also his
          concluding from Philip and the Eunuch’s coming up out of the water,
          page 19 that "neither of them was drowned there;" with other such like
          rambling stuff, which he might have been attained to publish to the
          world. Moreover, what defamation has he been guilty of, in
          representing it, as the judgment of "some of us to baptize naked?"
          page 22. And in the words of a servant of Christ, as he calls him,
          page 44 tells the world that we "baptize persons in thin and
          transparent garments;" which, in other cases, would be accounted down
          right lying. Nay even in this his last performance, page 44 he has the
          assurance to insinuate, as if we ourselves thought plunging to be
          immodest, because we put lead at the bottom of our plunging garments;
          why could not he as well have argued from our making use of clothes
          themselves? it is strange that a carefulness to prevent every thing
          that looks like immodesty, should be improved as an evidence of it:
          None but a man that is ill-natured and virulent, would ever be guilty
          of such an insinuation.
        </p>
        <p>
          What his friends, at Rowell, may think of his performances, I cannot
          tell; but I can assure him, that those of his persuasion at London
          think very meanly of them; and, as the most effectual way to secure
          the honor of their cause, which is endangered by such kind of writing
          as his, say, "he is a weak man that has "engaged in the controversy;"
          though, perhaps, some of his admirers may think that he is one of the
          mighty men of Israel, who, like another Samson, has smote us hip and
          thigh; but if I should say, that it is with much such an instrument as
          he once used, I know that I should be very gravely and severely
          reprimanded for it, my grace and good manners called in question, and
          perhaps be pelted into the bargain, with an old musty proverb or
          sentence, either in Greek or Latin; but I will forbear, and proceed to
          the consideration of his work, as he calls it. His first attack, page
          8 is upon a final sentence of Latin, made use of to express the
          nauseous and fulsome repetition, of threadbare arguments in this
          controversy, to which he has thought fit, to give no less than three
          several answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He says the Latin is false, because of an erratum of coctum for
          cocta; which had I observed before the last half sheet had been worked
          off, should have been inserted among the errata; whereby he would have
          been prevented making this learned remark; though had it not fallen
          under my notice, before he pointed it to me, he should have had the
          honor of this great discovery. He does well indeed to excuse his
          making such low observations, as being beneath the vast designs he has
          in view. I might as well take notice of his Greek proverb, page 25
          where osper, is put for asper, and charge it with being false Greek,
          though I should rather choose to ascribe it to the fault of the
          printer, than the inadvertency of the writer. However, he does well to
          let his readers know that he can write Greek; which they could not
          have come at the knowledge of, by his former performance. But why does
          not he give a version of his Latin and Greek scraps, especially seeing
          he writes for the benefit of the Lord’s people, the Godly, and poor
          men and women, that cannot look into Dictionaries, and consult
          Lexicons; besides, all the wit therein will be lost to them, as well
          as others be left unacquainted with his happy genius for, and skill in
          translating.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He says, "the application of this sentence is false:" But how does
          it appear? why, because at Rowell he and his people are very moderate
          in the affair of baptism, they seldom discourse of it; when every body
          knows, that has read my book, that the paragraph referred to, regards
          not the private conversation of persons on that subject, but the
          repeated writings which have been published to the world on his fide
          the question. If the different sentiments of his people, about
          Baptism, "make no manner of difference in affection, church-relation,"
          etc. as he says page 9 why does he give them any disturbance? what
          could provoke him to write after the manner he has done? He knows very
          well, however mistaken they may be about this ordinance, in his
          apprehensions, yet that they are conscientious in what they do; why
          should he then sneer at them, as he does for their practice of
          plunging, and fix upon them the heavy charges of superstition and
          will-worship? Is not this man a wise shepherd, that will give
          disturbance to his flock, when the sheep are still and quiet?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. He would have his reader believe, that in using this sentence, I
          would insinuate, that the notions wherein they differ from us about
          baptism are poisonous, when I intend no such thing; nor does the
          proverb, as expressed by me, lead to any such thought, but is used for
          a nauseous repetition of things, with which his performance, we are
          considering, very plentifully abounds. We do not look upon mistakes
          about the grace of God, the person of Christ, and the person and
          operations of the Spirit, to be of a lesser nature than those about
          Baptism, as he reproachfully insinuates; for we do with a becoming
          zeal and courage, oppose such erroneous doctrines in those who are of
          the same mind with us, respecting baptism, as much as we do in those
          who differ from us therein. Page 10. He seems to be angry with me for
          calling him an anonymous author; what should I have called him, since
          he did not put his name to his book? he asks, "Who was the penman of
          the epistle to the Hebrews?" Very much to the purpose indeed! and then
          brings in a scrap of Greek out of Synesius, with whom, however he may
          agree in the choice of an obscure life, yet will not in the affair of
          Baptism; for Synesius was baptized upon profession of his faith, and
          after that made bishop of Ptolemais. "Hundreds of precious tracts, he
          says, have been published without the names of their authors;" among
          which, I hope, he does not think his must have a place, it having no
          authority from the scripture, whatever else it may pretend to; as I
          hope hereafter to make appear.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 2.</p>
        <p>
          The proofs for immersion, taken from the circumstances which attended
          the Baptism of John, Christ, and his Apostles, maintained: and Mr. M’s
          demonstrative proofs, for pouring or sprinkling, considered.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          The ordinance of water-baptism, is not only frequently inculcated in
          the New Testament, as an ordinance that ought to be regarded; but also
          many instances of persons who have submitted to it, are therein
          recorded, and those attended with such circumstances, as manifestly
          show, to unprejudiced minds, in what manner it was performed.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The baptism of Christ administered by John deserves to be
          mentioned, and considered first: This was performed in the river
          Jordan (Mat 3:6; Mat 3:13), and the circumstance of his coming up out
          of the water, as soon as it was done, recorded verse 16 is a full
          demonstration that he was in it; now that he should go into the river
          Jordan, to have water poured, or sprinkled on him, is intolerable, and
          ridiculous to suppose. Mr. M. in his debate, page 6 tells us, that the
          words "only signify, that he went up from the water;" to which I
          replied, that the preposition apo signifies out of, and is justly
          rendered so here. I gave him an instance of it, which he has not
          thought fit to except against; yet still he says, the "criticism
          delivers us from a necessity of concluding, that Christ was in the
          water:" though it has been entirely baffled; neither has he attempted
          to defend it. And, because I say, that "we do not infer plunging,
          merely from Christ’s going down into, and coming up out of the water;"
          therefore he would have the argument from hence, as well as from the
          same circumstances attending the baptism of the Eunuch, wholly laid
          aside; which I do not wonder at, because it presses him hard. He seems
          to triumph, because I have not, in his positive and dogmatical way,
          asserted those circumstances, to be demonstrative proofs of immersion;
          as though they were entirely given up as such; but he is more ready to
          receive, than I am to give. This is a manifest indication, I will not
          say, of a wounded cause only, but of a dying one, which makes him
          catch at every thing to support himself under, or, free himself from
          those pressures, which lie hard upon him. We insist upon it, that
          those proofs are demonstrative, so far as proofs from circumstances
          can be so; and challenge him to give the like in favor of pouring or
          sprinkling. Is it not a wretched thing, to use our author’s words;
          that not one text of scripture can be produced, which will vindicate
          the practice of sprinkling in baptism; and that among all the
          instances of the performance of the ordinance, which are recorded in
          scripture; not one single circumstance can render it so much as
          probable?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We not only read of many others baptized by John, but also the
          places which he chore to administer it in, which will lead any
          thinking, and considering mind to conclude, that it was performed by
          immersion: Now, one of those places, where John baptized a
          considerable number, and among the rest Christ Jesus, was the river
          Jordan (Mat 3:6; Mk 1:5; Mk 1:9), the latter of which texts Mr. M.
          says, page 12 "leads us to no other thought, than that Jesus was
          baptized of John at Jordan; as the preposition eiv, he says, is
          sometimes translated;" though he gives us no one instance of it. Now
          in his debate, page 7 he says, "that the holy Ghost himself tells us,
          that nothing else is intended by it than baptizing in Jordan;" and yet
          this man takes a liberty to differ from him. What will he be at next?
          to such straits are men driven, who oppose the plain words of the Holy
          Ghost, as he is pleased to say in another case. Ænon was another of
          those places, which John chose to baptize in; and the reason of his
          making choice of it was, because there was much water there (Jn 3:23),
          which was proper and necessary, for the baptizing of persons by
          immersion. Mr. M. says, page 19 "that the holy Ghost does not say that
          they were baptized there, because there was much water; but that John
          was also baptizing in Ænon because there was much water there;" but
          what difference is there? Why only between John’s administering the
          ordinance, and the persons to whom it was administered. He says, page
          21 that I have granted that the words, he means udata polla, literally
          denote, "many rivulets or streams;" which is notoriously false; for I
          do in express words utterly deny it; and have proved from the use of
          the phrase in the New Testament, and in the Septuagint version of the
          Old, as well as from Nonnus’s paraphrase of the text, that it
          signifies "large waters, or abundance of them:" I do assure him, that
          neither of the editions of Nonnus, which he has the vanity to mention,
          was made use of by me; but if there had been any material difference
          in them, from what I have made use of, I suppose he would have
          observed it to me, if he has consulted them; and I would also inform
          him, that Nonnus has not always a Latin version printed along with it,
          as he wrongly asserts. I have consulted Calvin upon the place directed
          to by him: the text says, that Jesus and his disciples came into the
          land of Judea; and Calvin upon it says, that "he came into that part
          of the country which was nigh to Ænon;" but neither the text, nor
          Calvin upon it, say that they were both at Ænon, as our author
          insinuates; so that from hence there appears no necessity of
          concluding that choice was made of this place for the accommodation of
          the large number of people which attended, either upon the ministry of
          Christ or John; that so both they and their cattle might be refreshed,
          as he ridiculously enough suggests. As to the account he has given of
          the land of Canaan, it is manifest, notwithstanding all his shifts and
          cavils, that he did represent it in general as a land that wanted
          water, especially a great part of it; now whatever little spots (for
          the land itself was not very large) might not be so well watered, yet
          it is certain, that in general it was; and is therefore called a land
          of brooks of water, etc. But since he acknowledges there was plenty of
          water at Ænon, where John was baptizing, which is sufficient for our
          purpose, we need not further inquire about the land.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Another remarkable instance of baptism is that of the Eunuch’s, in
          Acts 8:38 which is attended with such circumstances, as would leave
          any person, that is seriously inquiring after truth, without any
          scruple or hesitation, in what manner it was performed. In Acts 8:36
          we are told, that they came unto a certain water, where the Eunuch
          desiring baptism, and Philip agreeing to it, after he had made a
          confession of his faith, it is said, verse 38 that they went down both
          into the water; they first came to it, and then went into it; which
          leaves that observation without any real foundation, which supposes
          that their going down into the water signifies no more than the
          descent which led to the rivers for they were come thither before, as
          appears from verse 36 where a phrase is made use of different from
          this in verse 38. Now though I had observed to our author, that it was
          not to, but into the water they went, to which he has not thought fit
          to reply; yet he still produces his impertinent instance of going down
          to the sea in ships; which is all that can be obtained from him, to
          set aside the force of this evidence; which, how weak and ridiculous
          it is, will easily appear to every judicious reader. Now if persons
          will but diligently consider those plain instances of baptism, in an
          humble and hearty search after truth, they will find that they amount
          to little less than a full demonstration that it was performed in
          those early times of John, Christ, and his apostles, by an immersion
          or plunging of the whole body under water, as has been fully
          acknowledged by many great and excellent divines, But now let us
          consider Mr. M’s demonstrative proofs for pouring or sprinkling water
          in baptism, produced by him, page 14.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He says, "pouring water in baptism, is a true representation of the
          donation of the Spirit; being, according to God’s word, instituted for
          that end" (Isa 44:3; Ezek 36:25; Mat 3:11; 1Cor 12:13). But the word
          of God no where expresses, or gives the least intimation, that baptism
          was instituted for any such end; it is true, the donation of the
          Spirit is sometimes called a baptism, and so are the sufferings of
          Christ; but do we make use of such mediums as there to prove the
          representation of them to be the end of this ordinance? though it
          would with equal strength conclude the one as the other: Besides, he
          might as well argue, that the end of baptism is to represent the
          passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea, because that is called
          a baptism also. But how does pouring of water in baptism, according to
          the practice of our modern Paedobaptists, represent the donation of
          the Spirit, when they only let fall a few drops of water upon the
          face? But the Spirit’s grace is expressed by pouring floods of water
          upon his people in Isa 44:3 one of the texts referred to by our
          author. Though I have acknowledged, and still do, that the ordinary
          donation of the Spirit is sometimes expressed by pouring, and
          sometimes by sprinkling, yet that it was the extraordinary one which
          the disciples received on the day of Pentecost, that is particularly
          called the baptism of the Spirit and of fire, by John and Christ. Now
          says Mr. M. page 17 if this was by pouring, then you are undone:
          perhaps not. But what does he think will undo us? why the prophecy of
          Joel, cited in Acts 2:16-17. I will pour out of my Spirit upon all
          flesh. To which I reply, that though this extraordinary instance of
          the Spirit’s grace is expressed, as well as the more ordinary ones
          are, by pouring, under the Old-Testament-dispensation, in allusion to
          those frequent libations, or drink-offerings, which were then used;
          yet it need not seem strange, that when this prophecy was nearer
          accomplishing, and there was a greater display of divine grace, that
          another word should be used which more largely expressed the abundance
          of it: It is no wonder that it should be more abundant in the
          exhibition than in the prophecy; besides this text, and all others in
          the Old Testament, which express the Spirit’s grace in this, or any
          other form of language whatever, can never be looked upon as
          sufficient proofs of the manner in which a New-Testament ordinance is
          to be administered, which was never instituted with a view to
          represent it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He says, it, that is, "pouring water in baptism," exactly answers
          to John’s "baptism he said that he baptized with water" (Lk 3:15). But
          it seems, according to him in page 15 that the phrase of baptizing
          with water, regards the strength of the administrator’s arms,
          wherewith he performs, and not the mode of baptizing; so that he can
          pretty easily tell us wherein and wherewith a person may be plunged,
          though he still says plunging with water is an expression without
          sense; but he cannot yet inform us how a man can be plunged in it,
          without being plunged with it. I urged that in all the evangelists the
          words are, en udap, "in water," excepting Lk 3:16 where the
          preposition is omitted, which has occasioned some to think it
          redundant in the other Evangelists, which I observe no ways hurts our
          sense and reading of the words; now he wonders that this should make
          for our reading, or be of any use to us; when all that I observe is,
          that it does not make against us; if it does, let him make it appear.
          John baptized in water, persons were baptized by him in the river
          Jordan, and not with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Another demonstrative proof of "pouring water in baptism, is, that
          it is exactly agreeable to the signification of the word, as the Lord
          gives it to us in the New Testament" (1Cor 10:2). Which place I shall
          more fully consider hereafter, and make it appear, that it is there to
          be understood in the sense of dipping or plunging.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. His last proof is, "that it directly answers the promise of what
          Christ should do (Isa 52:15), so shall he sprinkle many nations;" to
          this text he says, page 43 the commission in Mat 28:19 refers, which
          if it does, though I cannot see it can without a very large stretch,
          it must be only in that part of it which concerns the teaching of the
          Gentiles by the ministry of the apostles, and not that which respects
          the baptizing of them; for the word here rendered sprinkle, is rwbd
          zyn[ expressive of speaking, as Kimchi on the place observes; and the
          meaning is, that Christ shall speak to the Gentiles in the ministry of
          the gospel by the apostles, with so much power, majesty, and
          authority, that Kings themselves shall shut their mouths at him; that
          is, shall silently submit to the scepter of his grace, and to the
          doctrines of his gospel; for that which had not been told them, shall
          they see; and that which they had not heard, shall they consider.
          Moreover, who, in the world, could ever imagine, that the ordinance of
          water baptism, with the mode of its administration, should be intended
          here? a man must have his imagination prodigiously heated indeed, and
          his mind captivated with a mere jingle of words, that can look upon
          such proofs as there, fetcht out of the Old Testament, as
          demonstrative ones of the true mode of baptizing under the New. Thus
          we have had a taste, as he calls it, of his demonstrations of pouring
          or sprinkling water in baptism.

        <p>Chapter 3.</p>
        <p>A vindication of Erasmus, and of his version of (Acts 10:47).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          The author of the debate in page 22 urges the impropriety of Peter’s
          speech in Cornelius’ house, when he talked of forbidding water in
          baptism, if plunging was the right mode of its administration; to
          which I replied, that if there was any impropriety in the text, it was
          not to be charged, either upon the words or sense of the holy Ghost,
          but upon our translation; and urged, that the word water should be put
          in construction with the word to be baptized, and not with the word
          forbid, and the whole text be rendered thus, Can any man forbid that
          these should be baptized in water, which have received the holy Ghost
          as well as we? and produced the testimony of Erasmus to confirm it.
          Now let us attend to Mr. M's animadversions upon it. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Within the compass of four or five lines, he tells two palpable and
          notorious untruths; for first, he affirms that I say that the words in
          Acts 10:47 are not good sense, when it is he that insinuates an
          impropriety in Peter’s manner of speaking, supposing plunging to be
          the mode of baptism; what I say, is, that if there is any impropriety
          in it, it is not to be charged upon the words or sense of the holy
          Ghost, but upon our translation;" and yet he would have it, that I
          assert that the words are not good sense; where do I say so? It is
          true, I think the words are better rendered according to Erasmus’
          version; and, for what I can yet see to the contrary, I shall abide by
          it. Again, he says, that I think there is something wanting in the
          original. With what face can he say so? Or have I attempted a
          supplement to any part of it? How unfair is this? Yet this is the man
          that complains of rank injustice, wresting of words and wracking of
          sentences in polemical writings. He says, he fears God; I hope he
          does; but he has given but very little evidence of it, in his
          management of this controversy.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He next falls foul upon Erasmus, calling him old Erasmus; and
          represents him as disapproved of by the learned; when almost every
          body knows how much the learned world owes to that great man, and what
          deference is always paid to him; but why old Erasmus, and great Beza?
          Not that I would go about to diminish the praise of Beza, yet I cannot
          but be of opinion, that to let Erasmus upon a level with him, in
          respect of learning, can be no lessening of him; but it seems to me,
          that the reason of those different epithets which Mr. M. has given to
          those excellent men, is only because the version of the one removes
          the foundation of his impertinent cavil, and the note of the other, as
          he imagines, secures it to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. He proceeds, in the next place, to find fault with my translation
          of Erasmus’ version; but if he had had that candor which he would have
          the world believe he shews in the management of this controversy, he
          would have easily overlooked this, which he thinks is so much
          blame-worthy; especially when he could not but observe, that in the
          very same page, this text is rendered according to the transposition
          of Erasmus, without the negative particle, which hurts the sense: so
          that he might easily have perceived that this did not arise from a
          want of knowledge in translating, but from an inadvertency in writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. As to what Beza says of this trajection, that it is dura ac plane
          insolens; I shall only say cum pace tanti viri, that the trajections
          in scripture, which he himself approves of, for which see his notes on
          Jn 8:25 and Acts 1:2 are not more easy or more usual.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The sense of the text requires such a transposition of the words;
          for the meaning is not, as if Peter thought that any person would go
          about to hinder them of water convenient for the administration of the
          ordinance of baptism; for such a sense of the words would be trifling
          and jejune, and yet this our version seems to incline to; but that
          there might be some who would be displeased with, and to their utmost
          oppose, the baptizing of those Gentiles. Hence Peter says, Who can
          forbid that these should be baptized in water? Therefore, and what
          will further confirm this sense and reading of the words, he commands
          them in the next verse to be baptized: he does not order water to be
          brought unto them, but that they be baptized in the name of the Lord.
          To all which,
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Might be added, that this transposition of the words has not its
          confirmation only from the authority, judgment and learning of
          Erasmus, which is not inconsiderable, but also from others; for, as
          Cornelius a Lapide has observed, both the Tigurine version, and that
          of Pagnine’s, read the words the same way: so that however Erasmus may
          be disapproved of by the learned, as our author asserts, yet it seems
          this version is regarded by them.
        </p>

        <p>Chapter 4.</p>
        <p>
          The end of the institution of the ordinance of Baptism, considered.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          As the ordinance of water-baptism derives its authority from Christ,
          so it was instituted by him for some end or other, which may make for
          his own glory, as well as for the comfort, edification, and increase
          of faith in his people; and what that end is, we shall now inquire.
          Mr. M. page 33 says, "the manifest end of it is a representation of
          the donation of the Spirit to us in the new covenant" (Isa 44:3; Mat
          3:11; 1Cor 12:13). As for the former of there proofs, I need only say,
          that an Old-Testament-text can never be a proof or evidence of what is
          the end of the institution of a New-Testament-ordinance: Besides, if
          it could be thought to have any reference to the affair of baptism, it
          would only regard the mode, and not the end of this ordinance, for
          which he has cited it already, and to what purpose has been also
          shown. As for the two latter texts here produced by him, they only
          inform us, that the Spirit’s grace is called a baptism, and so are the
          sufferings of Christ (Lk 12:50), the representation of which he will
          not own to be the end of baptism, though every body will see that this
          may be as strongly concluded from hence, as what he contends for;
          besides, the martyrdom of the saints is called a Baptism (Mat 20:23),
          as also the passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea (1Cor 10:2),
          yet no body ever thought that the design of baptism was to represent
          either of these. Now these are what he calls the plain proofs of the
          manifest end of baptism, without any force upon scripture. What sort
          of readers does Mr. M. expect to have, that will be imposed upon by
          such proofs as there? But there are manifest proofs which fully
          discover to us, that the end of this ordinance is to represent the
          sufferings, death, burial, and resurrection of Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ has particularly instituted two ordinances, Baptism and the
          Lord’s-Supper, to be observed by his people; and the end of the one is
          no less evident than that of the other. It is said of the
          Lord’s-Supper, As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye
          do shew the Lord’s death till he come (1Cor 11:26). It is also said of
          Baptism, That so many of us, as were baptized into Christ, were
          baptized into his death (Rom6:3). Did Christ say in the celebration of
          the Ordinance of the Supper? This is my blood of the New Testament,
          which is shed for many for the remission of sins (Mat 26:28). His
          disciples in his name have also laid, Repent and be baptized every one
          of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins (Acts
          2:38): that is, that their faith in that ordinance might be led to the
          blood of Christ, by which remission of sins was procured; to the grave
          of Christ, where they were left; and to a risen Savior, where they
          have a full discharge from them; all which, in a very lively manner,
          is represented in this ordinance of baptism. There are many other
          texts, besides their, which would lead any truly serious and inquiring
          mind to observe this to be the true end of baptism, as Rom6:4, Col
          2:12, 1 Pet 3:21, and 1Cor 15:29 but because those texts are excepted
          against by Mr. M. it will be proper more particularly to consider
          them, and what he is pleased to advance against the commonly received
          sense of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st, "Rom6:4, Col 2:12" he says, "are not to be understood of
          water-baptism, but of the baptism of Christ’s sufferings, in which his
          people were considered in him, and with him, as their head and
          representative." I firmly believe the doctrine of Christ’s being a
          common head, representative, and surety of all the elect of God; for
          which reason, in my reply, I acknowledged his sense of those texts to
          be agreeable to the analogy of faith; on the account of which he
          triumphs, as if it shone with an unconquerable evidence, as his
          expression is, page 34 when I never owned it to be the true sense of
          the words; for a sense may be given of a text that is agreeable to the
          analogy of faith, which is foreign enough to the mind of the holy
          Ghost therein; as for instance, if of Gen 1:1. In the beginning God
          created the heaven and the earth; a man should give such a sense as
          this, that God chore a certain number of men in Christ unto salvation,
          before he created the heaven and the earth: This is a sense that is
          agreeable enough to the analogy of faith, but none will say that it is
          the sense of the text. But let us a little consider the exposition of
          those texts, so much boasted of, and see how well it will bear. As for
          Rom6:4, it does not say, that we are buried with him in baptism, but
          by baptism into death: So that according to Mr. M’s exposition, it
          runs thus, "We are buried with Christ representatively in the grave,
          by his sufferings on the cross, into that death he there submitted
          to;" in which, how oddly things hang together, every judicious reader
          will observe. As to Col 2:12. though we are hid to be buried with him
          in baptism, yet it is added, Wherein also you are risen with him; but
          how we can be laid to be risen with him in the baptism of his
          sufferings, will, I believe, not be very easy, to account for. It is
          better therefore to understand those texts, in the more generally
          received sense both of ancient and modern divines, who unanimously
          interpret them of water baptism; in which the death, burial, and
          resurrection of Christ are very evidently represented, when performed
          by immersion.
        </p>
        <p>
          2dly, He says, 1 Pet 3:21 is not meant of water baptism, but of the
          blood of Christ sprinkled upon the conscience. That the blood of
          Christ, as sprinkled upon a believer’s conscience, is ever called a
          Baptism, I never met with; and, I will venture to say, can never be
          proved. Besides, the baptism that Peter speaks of was a figure,
          anptupon, "an antitype" of Noah’s ark, and of the deliverance of him
          and his family by water; which was a kind of resurrection from the
          dead, and did well prefigure our salvation by the resurrection of
          Christ, represented to us in the ordinance of water baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          3dly, The sense of 1Cor 15:29. given by me, is also objected against
          by Mr. M. page 32. and another substituted in its room. Let the
          readers of the controversy between us judge which is most agreeable.
          The text is difficult, and has employed the thoughts and pens of the
          most able and learned men in all ages: Both the senses have their
          defenders. I shall only refer the reader to the learned notes of Sir
          Norton Knatchbull, on 1 Pet 3:21 where both those texts are considered
          by him; and where he has sufficiently proved, from scripture, fathers,
          schoolmen, and modern interpreters, that the ordinance of baptism is a
          true figure, and just representation of the resurrection of Christ,
          and of ours by him.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 5</p>
        <p>
          A consideration of the signification of the Greek word paptizw, and
          particularly, the use of it in Mk 7:4, Lk 11:38, and Heb 9:10.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          That the proper, primary, common, and natural sense of the Greek word
          baptizo, is to dip or plunge, has been acknowledged by the greatest
          masters of that language; and it is a rule which should be carefully
          attended to, that the first, natural, and common sense of a word ought
          to be used in the interpretation of scripture, unless some very good
          reason can be given why it should be used in a remote, improper, and
          consequential one. Now though the nature, end, and circumstances of
          the ordinance of baptism, manifestly shew that immersion is the right
          mode of administering it, and do abundantly confirm the sense of the
          Greek word, directing us to the proper and primary use thereof; yet
          some have endeavored to confine it to a more low and remote sense, but
          none have attempted to do it with more positiveness and confidence
          than our author. But what method does he take to effect it, and how
          does he succeed therein?
        </p>
        <p>
          Why, 1st, he will exclude all the testimonies of the use of the word
          among Greek authors uninspired, especially Heathens; which is
          unreasonable If our translators had confined themselves to this rule,
          they would have made but poor work in their version of some part of
          the Bible, where a word is but once used, or at least but very rarely
          in that sense in which it is to be taken. Now if a controversy
          concerning the use of a Greek word in scripture arises, which cannot
          be determined by it, though I do not say this is the case in hand,
          what methods must be taken? Will it not be very proper to consult
          Greek authors, either Christian or Heathen, and produce their
          testimonies, especially the latter? who cannot be suspected of
          perverting the use of a word, having never been concerned in our
          religious controversies. But it seems, if we will make use of them, we
          must be said under an obligation to prove that: "they were delivered
          under the immediate inspiration of the holy Ghost" was ever such an
          unreasonable demand made in this world before? Or was the inspiration
          of the holy Spirit ever thought necessary to fix and determine the
          sense of a word? But I am willing to lay aside those testimonies in
          this controversy. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          2dly, Be confined, as he would have me, to the use of the word in the
          New Testament; but then I must, it seems, be confined to the use of
          it, as applied to the ordinance of baptism, which is also
          unreasonable: He says the word, whenever applied to the ordinance,
          signifies pouring or sprinkling only; which is a shameful begging of
          the question; and if I should say it only signifies dipping or
          plunging, whenever applied to it, how must the controversy be decided?
          Must we not refer the decision of it to other texts of scripture? It
          is true, the circumstances, which attend the administration of the
          ordinance are sufficient to determine the true sense of the word, and
          I am willing to put it upon that issue; but I know he will not stand
          to it: Besides, why has he himself brought other texts of scripture
          into the controversy, where the ordinance or baptism is not concerned?
          As Mk 7:4, Heb 9:10, and 1Cor 10:2 as also the Septuagint version in
          Dan 4:33 why may not others take the same liberty? And what miserable
          replies has he made to my instances out of the latter? that in 2 Kin
          5:14 he says, discovers that they, that is, the Septuagint, understood
          no more by it than, louw. No more than louw! Is not that enough? is
          not louw a word that includes in it all kinds of washing, especially
          bathing of the whole body; and is always used by the Septuagint to
          express the Jewish bathings, which were always performed by immersion;
          and that Naaman understood the prophet of such a kind of washing, is
          manifest from his use of it; he dipped himself in Jordan, kata to rhma
          Elisaie, according to the word of Elisha. As for the other in Isa 21:4
          he says, "it is no wonder they made use of the word, for they knew
          very well that sin procures showers of divine displeasure to be poured
          upon a person, people, and nation." I desire the next time he pretends
          to baptize an infant, that he would pour showers of water upon it, if
          he thinks proper, according to this sense of the word baptizw, which
          he allows of. But however, though those testimonies must be laid
          aside, yet,
        </p>
        <p>
          3dly, I hope Lexicons may be made use of to direct us in the sense of
          the word, if it is only as it is used in the New Testament. Yes, that
          will be allowed of; for Mr. M. himself consults Lexicons, though he
          does well to let us know so; for one would have thought, by his
          positiveness, that he had never looked into one in all his life. Well,
          but what do the Lexicons say? How do they render the word baptizw? Why
          by mergo, immergo, to dip or plunge into; and this they give, as the
          first, and primary sense of the word; but do they make use of no other
          words to express it by? Yes, they also use abluo, lavo, to wash; and
          they mean such a washing as is by dipping, but Mr. M. page 38 asks,
          where do they tell us so? I answer in their Lexicons. Let Scapula be
          consulted, who thus renders the word baptizo, mergo seu immergo: Ut
          quae tingendi aut abluendi gratia aquae immergimus. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          4thly, Let us now consider those texts where the word is used in the
          New Testament; I am willing to be confined to those which Mr. M.
          himself has fixed upon, and we will begin,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, With Mk 7:4 and when they come from the market, except they
          wash or baptize (themselves) they eat not; which may be understood
          either,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Of the things they bought in the market, which they did not eat
          until they were washed: Thus the Syriac version reads the words; and
          what they buy in the market, unless it be washed, they eat not: The
          same way read all the oriental versions, the Arabic, Ethiopic, and
          Persic. Now this must be understood of those things that may be, and
          are proper to be washed, as herbs, etc. And nobody will question, but
          that the manner of the washing there was by putting them into water.
          But,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If the words design the washing of persons, they must be
          understood, either of the washing of their whole bodies, or else of
          some part only; as their hands or feet: It seems most likely, that the
          washing of the whole body is intended, as Grotius,[1] Vatablus,
          Drufius,[2] and others think; because washing of hands is mentioned in
          the preceding verse. Besides, to understand it thus, better expresses
          the outward, affected sanctity of the more superstitious part of the
          people. All the Jews washed their hands and feet before eating; but
          those who pretended to a greater degree of holiness, washed their
          whole bodies, especially when they came from a market; and of this
          total ablution of the body is Lk 11:38 to be understood. And here I
          cannot forbear mentioning, a passage of the great Scaliger[3] to this
          purpose. "The more superstitious part of the Jews, says he, not only
          washed their feet, but their whole body. Hence they were called
          Hemerobaptists, who every day washed their bodies before they sat down
          to food; wherefore, the Pharisee, which had invited Jesus to dine with
          him, wondered that he sat down to meat before he had washed his whole
          body, Lk 11:1-54. But those that were more free from superstition,
          were contented with washing of their feet, instead of that universal
          immersion. Witness the Lord himself, who being entertained at dinner
          by another Pharisee, objected to him, when he was sat down to meat,
          that he had given him no water for his feet, Lk 7:1-50."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If, by this washing, we understand only the washing of their hands
          when they came from market; then it will be proper to inquire in what
          manner this was performed: And it must be observed, that whatever was
          the manner which they used, it was not used as a national custom, or
          as it was according to the word of God; but what was most agreeable to
          the traditions of the elders, as is manifest from the text itself. Now
          this tradition is delivered in their Misna in these words; "They
          washed their hands before they eat common food, by an elevation of
          them; but before they eat the tithes, the offering, and the holy
          flesh, they washed by immersion."[4] It is reported in the same tract,
          that Johanan Ben Gud-Gada, who, they say, was one of the most
          religious in the priesthood, "always eat his common food after the
          manner of purification for eating of the holy flesh;" that is, he
          always used immersion before eating; and it is highly reasonable to
          suppose, that the Pharisees, especially the more superstitious part,
          who pretended to a greater strictness in religion than others, used
          the same method. It deserves also to be remarked, that this tradition,
          which some of the Jews have been so tenacious of, that they would
          rather die than break it, is by them laid to be founded on Lev 15:11
          and hath not rinsed his hands in water; where the Hebrew word qfç is
          used, which signifies a washing by immersion: and so Buxtorf renders
          it. Moreover, in the above said Misna[5] we are told many things
          concerning this tradition, as the quantity and quality of the water
          they used, the vessels they washed in, as well as how far this washing
          reached, which was qrp d[, by which they meant, either the back of the
          hand or the wrist or else the elbow, as Theopylact observes on Mk 7:3
          who in this is followed by Capellus.[6]
        </p>
        <p>
          Now some one of these, the word pugmu intends, which we translate oft.
          As to their manner of washing, it was either by taking water in one
          hand and pouring it upon the other, and then lifting it up,[7] that
          the water might run down to the aforesaid parts, that so it might not
          return and defile them; or else it was performed by an immersion of
          them into water; which latter was accounted the moot effectual way,
          and used by the more superstitious part of the Jews. Now those who
          contend the most for a washing of hands, and not the whole body, as
          Pocock[8] and Lightfoot, yet frankly acknowledge that it must be
          understood of washing of them by immersion. Lightfoot’s words are
          these, "The Jews used, says he, µydy tlyfg "a washing of hands;"[9]
          that is, by lifting them up in the manner before described; and µyry
          tlibf an immersion of the hands; and the word niywntai, used by our
          Evangelist, seems to answer to the former, and baptizwontai, to the
          latter." So that from the whole, suppose washing of hands is here
          intended; yet the sense of the Greek word, baptizw contended for, is
          nevertheless effectually secured: Nor need we be much concerned at 2
          Kin 3:11 being thrown in our way by Mr. M. page 41. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The text does not say that Elisha poured water upon the hands of
          Elijah, to wash his hands withal: and if he asks what did he then do
          it for; suppose I should answer, I cannot tell, how will he help
          himself? It lies upon him to prove that he did it for that end, which
          he will not find very easy to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Some of the Jewish writers think,[10] that washing of hands, is not
          intended, but some very great miracle, which followed upon Elisha’s
          pouring water on Elijah’s hands, and is therefore mentioned as a thing
          known, and what would serve to recommend him to the kings of Judah,
          Israel, and Edom. But taken in the other sense, the recommendation
          would be but very inconsiderable; besides, they were now in a very
          great strait for water, 2 Kin 3:9 and they might expect, from his
          former performance, some miracle would be now wrought by him for their
          relief, as was 2 Kin 3:17, 2 Kin 3:20. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Suppose washing of hands is intended, and that this phrase is
          expressive of Elisha’s being Elijah’s ministering servant, and that it
          was his usual method to wash his master’s hands by pouring water upon
          them; it makes nothing against the sense of the word in Mk 7:4 since
          that regards the superstitious walking of hands, as has been observed,
          which was performed by an immersion of them, and is there justly
          reprehended by our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, The other text produced by Mr. M. in page 41 is Heb 9:10
          where the apostle speaks of divers washings or baptisms, which I have
          asserted to be performed always by bathing or dipping, and never by
          pouring or sprinkling. And I still abide by my assertion, the
          instances produced by him being insufficient to disprove, it 1. He
          mentions Heb 9:19 where the apostle speaks of Moses’s sprinkling the
          book and people with blood; but does he say that they were waffled
          therewith? or was ever this instance of sprinkling reckoned among the
          ceremonial ablutions? When only a few drops of blood or water are
          sprinkled upon persons or things, can they be said, in any just
          propriety of speech, to be washed therewith?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He instances in Ex 29:4. which speaks of the washing of Aaron and
          his sons, but not a word either of sprinkling or pouring, so that it
          makes nothing for his purpose: Besides, the Septuagint here use the
          word louw, by which they always express the Jewish bathings, which
          were performed by a total immersion of the body in water.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. His next instance is Num 8:6-7. Take the Levites from among the
          children of Israel, and cleanse them; and thus shalt thou do unto them
          to cleanse them; sprinkle water of purifying upon them. But why did
          not he read on? and let them shove all their flesh, and wash their
          clothes, and so make themselves clean; that is, by bathing their whole
          bodies, which was done, as the Targum of Jonathan upon the place says,
          in forty measures of water. Now, it was thus the Levites were washed.
          Sprinkling the water of purification, was indeed a ceremony used
          preparatory to this bathing, but was itself no part of it, as will
          more fully appear from,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. His other instance in Num 19:18. where it is laid, that tents,
          vessels, or persons, that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead,
          or a grave, were to be sprinkled; but why did not he transcribe Num
          19:19? where his readers would have been informed, that as this
          sprinkling was to be done on the third and seventh days, so after
          that, on the seventh day, the unclean person was to purify himself,
          and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water: So that all those
          aspersions before, were but so many preparations to the general
          washing or bathing himself all over in water, on the seventh day. I
          shall therefore still abide by it, that none of the ceremonial
          washings were performed by sprinkling; and indeed, to talk of washing
          by sprinkling, deserves rather to be laughed at, than to have a
          serious answer; it being no more reconcilable to good sense, than it
          is to the just propriety of language, or universal customs of nations.
          From the whole it appears, that Maimonides was not mistaken in his
          observation; and that the word in Heb 9:10 properly signifies bathings
          or dippings. And now,
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, We are come, as he says, to that great text, 1Cor 10:2. which
          he directs to, as the poor man and woman’s Lexicon; and it is pity but
          that they should know how to make use of it. Here the children of
          Israel are said to be baptized in the cloud, and in the sea. But since
          the word is here used in a figurative sense, it is not very fair in
          our antagonists to urge us with it, nor, indeed, any other place where
          it is so used; yet we are no: afraid of engaging with them in the
          consideration of those places, and particularly this; wherein there is
          enough to justify the apostle in the use of the word, and at the same
          time secure its sense on our side. When we consider, that the cloud in
          which they are said to be baptized, passed over them, so that they
          were covered therewith; and if it let down, at the same time, a shower
          of rain upon them, it makes it still look more like a baptism; which
          also is aptly resembled by their passage through the sea, the waters
          standing up on both tides, so that they seemed to be buried in them.
          Which things being considered, justifies the apostle, I say, in the
          use of the word, which strictly and properly signifies dipping or
          plunging. Words, when used in a figurative sense, though what is
          expressed by them is not literally true; yet the literal sense is not
          lost thereby: For instance, in the word dipage When a person has been
          in a large shower of rain, so that his clothes and body are exceeding
          wet, we often say of such an one, he is finely dipt; the meaning of
          which is, that he is as wet as if he had been dipt all over in a brook
          or river. So likewise of a person that has just looked into a book,
          controversy, art, or science; we say, that he has just dipt into it;
          whereby we mean, that he has arrived but to a small acquaintance with,
          or knowledge in those things. Now would it not be a vain thing for a
          man, from hence, to attempt to prove, that the word dip is not to be
          understood in its native, common, and literal sense, in which we
          mostly use it. This observation will serve to vindicate my way of
          accounting for the use of the word in the present text, as well as for
          baptw in Dan 4:33. In fine, from the whole, we may well conclude that
          Baptism ought to be performed by immersion, plunging, or dipping in
          water, according to the practice of John, Christ, and his apostles,
          the nature and end of the ordinance, and the true and native
          signification of the word; which mode of baptizing has been used in
          all ages of the world, and I doubt not but will be, notwithstanding
          all opposition made against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to the endangering of health by immersion, I referred the reader to
          Sir John Floyer’s History of Cold-bathing. Mr. M. insinuates that I
          have misrepresented him. I only intimate to the reader, that Sir John
          gives a relation of several cures performed by cold-bathing: And I
          could easily fill up several pages with a catalogue of diseases for
          which he says it is useful, together with instances of cures performed
          by it. He asks, "Why I do not inform my reader in how many cases Sir
          J. F. and Dr. B. thought cold-bathing inconvenient and dangerous?" I
          could, indeed, soon acquaint the reader, that Sir John Floyer thought
          it not proper to be used when persons were hot and sweating, nor after
          excessive eating or drinking; as also, that they should not stay in it
          too long, until they were chilled; and that if any danger came by it,
          it was usually in such cases: But this will do his cause no service,
          nor affect ours. I could also have told my reader, that he thinks
          cold-bathing to be useful in Consumptions, Catarrhs, etc. the cases
          which Mr. M. instances in; who cites Dr. Cheyne’s Essay on Health,
          page 108. where the Doctor says, "that Cold-bathing should never be
          used under a fit of a chronical distemper, with a quick pulse, or with
          a headache, or by those that have weak lungs." But why does he not
          acquaint his reader that the Doctor in the very same paragraph, says,
          "that cold-bathing is of great advantage to health — It promotes
          perspiration, enlarges the circulation, and prevents the danger of
          catching cold."
        </p>
        <p>
          So that every body will easily see, as all experience testifies, that
          there is no force in the argument, taken from the endangering of
          health by immersion. By this time the reader will be capable of
          judging whether Mr. Gill is fairly answered or no, as Mr. M. has
          expressed in his title-page; though it would have been as well to have
          left it for another to have made the remark, and so took the advice of
          the wise man, Let another praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a
          stranger, and not thine own lips (Prov 27:2). But before I conclude, I
          shall take liberty to ask Mr.. M. four or five questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Why does he not tell the world who that servant of Christ is, whose
          words he uses; he says, I am mistaken in saying that they are the
          words of Ruffen; but I still aver, that they are used by him; but
          whether Ruffen took them from his servant of Christ, or his servant of
          Christ from Ruffen, I cannot tell; for that two men, without the
          knowledge of one another’s words, should fall into the same odd, and
          awkward way of speaking, and commit the very same blunders, is not
          reasonable to suppose; but however, let him be who he will, Mr.
          Stennett’s reply to Ruffen, which I have transcribed, fully detects
          the sin and folly of those indecent expressions. As to what Mr.. M.
          says, page 44 "that he is very willing that both Stennett and Ruffen
          should lie dormant;" I believe it, for as the latter will never be of
          any service to his cause, so the former would give a considerable blow
          to it, was his book more diligently perused.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What does he mean by the word of the Lord, he so often mentions,
          when speaking of the sense of the Greek word? Does he mean the
          original text of the New Testament? That uses a word in the account it
          gives of this ordinance, which, as has been made appear, always
          signifies to dip or plunge. Or, by the word of the Lord, does he mean
          our translation; which uses the word baptize, thereby leaving the
          sense of the Greek word undetermined, had not the circumstances,
          attending the accounts we have of the administration of this
          ordinance, sufficiently explained it; as will clearly appear to every
          one who considers them: Had this rendered it dip, as some other
          versions have done, none, one would think, would have been at a loss
          about the right mode of administering this ordinance; though in
          Holland, where they use no other word but dipping to express baptism
          by, yet they nevertheless use sprinkling; nay, as I am informed, the
          minister when he only sprinkles or pours water upon the face of the
          infant, says, "I dip thee in the name of the Father, of the Son, and
          of the holy Ghost." Such a force have prejudice and custom on the
          minds of men, that it puts them on doing what is contrary to the plain
          and manifest sense of words.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Why has he dropped his new found name of Plungers, which he seemed
          to be so fond of in his former performance, and thought so exceeding
          proper for us, and revived the old name of Anabaptists? which we
          cannot be, neither according to his principles, nor our own; not
          according to ours, because we deny pouring or sprinkling to be
          baptism; not according to his, because he denies dipping or plunging
          to be baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Why are Dr Owen’s arguments for Infants-baptism published at the
          end of his book? How impertinent is this? When the controversy between
          us, is not about the subjects, but the mode of baptism: Perhaps his
          bookseller did this, seeing Mr. M. says nothing of them himself, nor
          recommends them to others; but if he thinks fit to shew his talent in
          this part of the controversy, he may expect attendance thereto, if
          what he shall offer deserves it.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Why has he not defended his wise reasons for mixed communion, and
          made some learned strictures upon those arguments of mine, which he
          has been pleased to call frivolous, without making any further reply
          to them? He has very much disappointed many of his friends, who
          promised both me and themselves an answer, to that part of my book
          especially; but perhaps a more elaborate performance may be expected
          from him, upon that subject, or some other learned hand. However, at
          present, I shall take my leave of him; but not with Prov 26:4 which he
          has been ashamed to transcribe at length, lest his readers should
          compare the beginning and end of his book together; whereby they would
          discover, how much he deserves the character of a Gentleman, a
          Scholar, or a Christian; as also, how well this suits the whining
          insinuations, with which he begins his performance. I shall add no
          more, but conclude with the words of Job, Teach me, and I will hold my
          tongue; and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. How forcible
          are right words? But what doth your arguing reprove?

          [3] Judaei vero superstitiosiores non pedes tantum, sed & corpus totum
          intingebant. Hinc hmerobaptivai, dicti, qui quodidie, ante discubitum,
          corpus intingebant. Quare Pharisaeus ille, qui lesum ad coenam
          invitaverat, mirabatur eum, antequam totum corpus abluisset,
          discubuisse: oti ou prwton ebaptioqh pro tou arisou, Lk 11:1-54.
