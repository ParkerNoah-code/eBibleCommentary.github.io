          An Answer to a Welsh Clergyman’s Twenty Arguments<br />In Favor of
          Infant-Baptism
        </h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          With Some STRICTURES on what the said AUTHOR has advanced concerning
          the Mode of BAPTISM.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          A BOOK some time ago being published in the Welch language, entitled,
        </p>
        <p>
          "A Guide to a saving Knowledge of the Principles and Duties of
          Religion, viz. Questions and Scriptural Answers, relating to the
          Doctrine contained in the Church Catechism," etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some extracts out of it respecting the ordinance of baptism, its
          subject, and mode, being communicated to me, with a request from our
          friends in Wales to make some Reply unto, and also to draw up some
          Reasons for dissenting from the church of England, both which I have
          undertook, and shall attempt in the following manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall take but little notice of what this author says, part 5, page
          40 concerning sponsors in baptism, but refer the reader to what is
          said of them in the Reasons for dissenting, hereunto annexed. This
          writer himself owns, that the practice of having sureties is not
          particularly mentioned in scripture; only he would have it, that it
          has in general obtained in the churches from the primitive times, and
          was enacted by the powers which God has appointed, and whole
          ordinances are to be submitted to, when they are not contrary to those
          of God;[1] and must be allowed to be of great service, if the sureties
          fulfilled their engagements. The answer to all which is, that since it
          is not mentioned in scripture, it deserves no regard; at least, this
          can never recommend it to such, who make the Bible the rule of their
          faith and practice; and as to its obtaining in primitive times, it is
          indeed generally ascribed to Pope Hyginus, as an invention of his; but
          the genuineness of the epistles attributed to him and others, is
          called in question by learned men, and are condemned by them as
          spurious; but were they genuine, neither his office nor his age would
          have much weight and authority with us, who are not to be determined
          by the decrees of popes and councils; the powers spoken of in the
          scriptures referred to, were Heathen magistrates, who surely had no
          authority to enact any thing relating to gospel-worship and
          ordinances; nor can it be reasonably thought they should; and
          submission and obedience to them, are required in things of a civil
          nature, not ecclesiastical, as the scope of the passages, and their
          context manifestly shew; nor has God given power and authority to any
          let of men whatever, to enact laws and ordinances of religious
          worship; nor are we bound to submit to all ordinances of men in
          religious matters, that are not contrary to the appointments of God,
          that is, that are not expressly forbidden in his word; for by this
          means, all manner of superstition and will worship may be introduced.
          Oil and spittle in baptism are no where forbidden, nor is the
          baptizing of bells; yet there ordinances of men are not to be
          submitted to, and a multitude of others of the like kind: we are not
          only to take care to do what God has commanded, but to reject what he
          has not commanded; remembering the care of Nadab and Abihu, who
          offered strange fire to the Lord, which he commanded not. And whereas
          it is suggested, that this practice would be very serviceable were the
          engagements of sureties fulfilled, it is not practicable they should;
          it is impossible to do what they engage to do, even for themselves,
          and much less for others, as is observed in the Reasons, before
          referred to.
        </p>
        <p>
          But passing these things, I shall chiefly attend to the twenty
          arguments, which this writer has advanced in favor of infant-baptism,
          pages 41-45.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first argument runs thus: "Baptism, which is a seal of the
          covenant of grace, should not be forbid to the children of believers,
          seeing they are under condemnation through the covenant of works; and
          if they are left without an interest in the covenant of grace, they
          then would be, to their parents great distress, under a dreadful
          sentence of eternal condemnation, without any sign or promise of the
          mercy of God, or of an interest in Christ; being by nature children of
          wrath as others, and consequently without any hope of salvation, if
          they die in their infancy."
        </p>
        <p>
          In which there are some things true, and others false, and nothing
          that can be improved into an argument in favor of infant-baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is true that the infants of believers, as well as others, are by
          nature the children of wrath, and under condemnation through the
          covenant of works; so all mankind are as considered in Adam, and in
          consequence of his sin and fall (Rom5:12; Rom5:18). But,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is not baptism that can save them from wrath and condemnation; a
          person may be baptized in water, and yet not saved from wrath to come,
          and still lie under the sentence of condemnation, being
          notwithstanding that, in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity,
          as the case of Simon Magus shews. Though this writer seems to be of
          opinion, that baptism is a saving ordinance, and that a person cannot
          be fared without it; and indeed he expressly says, p. 27. that "in
          general it is necessary to salvation;" as if salvation was by it,
          (which is a popish notion) and there was none without it; but the
          instance of the penitent thief, is a proof to the contrary: the text
          does not say, he that is baptized shall be saved, but he that
          BELIEVETH and is baptized; nor is it any where suggested, that a
          person dying without baptism shall be damned. It is CHRIST only, and
          not baptism, that fares from wrath and condemnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Being unbaptized, does not leave without an interest in the
          covenant of grace, or exclude from the hope of salvation, or the mercy
          of God, or an interest in Christ; persons may have an interest in all
          these, and yet not be baptized. See the strange contradictions men run
          into when destitute of truth; one while the covenant of grace is said
          to be made with believers, and their seed, as in the next argument,
          and so their infants being in it, have a right to baptism; at another
          time it is baptism that puts them into the covenant; and if they are
          not baptized they are left without interest in it, and, to the great
          grief of their parents, under a dreadful sentence of eternal
          condemnation. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. as the salvation of an infant dying in its infancy is one of the
          secret things which belong unto the Lord, a judicious Christian parent
          will leave it with him; and find more relief from his distress, by
          hoping in the grace and mercy of God through Christ, and in the virtue
          and efficacy of his blood and righteousness, which may be applied unto
          it without baptism, than he can in baptism; which he may observe, may
          be administered to a person, and yet be damned. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          5. baptism is no seal of the covenant of grace, nor does it give any
          person an interest in it, or seal it to them; a person may be
          baptized, and yet have no interest in the covenant, as Simon Magus and
          others, and to whom it was never sealed; and on the other hand, a
          person may be in the covenant of grace, and it may be sealed to him,
          and he assured of his interest in it, and not yet be baptized: the
          blood of Christ is the seal of the covenant, and the Spirit of Christ
          is the sealer of the saint’s interest in it. And, after all, if
          baptism has such virtue in it, as to give an interest in the covenant
          of grace, to be a sign and promise of mercy, and of our interest in
          Christ, and furnish out hope of salvation, and secure from wrath and
          condemnation, why should not compassion be shewn to the children of
          unbelievers, who are in the same state and condition by nature? for, I
          observe all along, that in this and the following arguments, baptism
          is wholly restrained to the children of believers; upon the whole, the
          argument from the state of infants to their baptism is impertinent and
          fruitless; since there is no such efficacy in baptism, to deliver them
          from it.[2]
        </p>
        <p>
          The second argument is: "The children of believers should be admitted
          to baptism, since as the covenant of works, and the real of it
          belonged to Adam and his children, so the covenant of grace, and the
          real thereof belongs, through Christ, to believers and their
          children:" to which it may be replied,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That it is indeed true, that the covenant of works belonged to Adam
          and his posterity, he being a federal head unto them; but then it does
          not appear, that that covenant had any seal belonging to it, since it
          needed none, nor was it proper it should have any, seeing it was not
          to continue. And if the tree of life is intended, As I suppose it is,
          whatever that might be a sign of, it was no real of any thing, nor did
          it belong to Adam’s children, who were never suffered to partake of
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There is a great disparity between Adam and believers, and the
          relation they stand in to their respective offspring: Adam stood as a
          common head and representative to all his posterity; not so believers
          to theirs: they are no common heads unto them, or representatives of
          them; wherefore though the covenant of works belonged to Adam and his
          posterity, it does not follow, that the covenant of grace belongs to
          believers and their children, they not standing in the same relation
          he did. There never were but two covenant-heads, Adam and CHRIST, and
          between them, and them only, the parallel will run, and in this form;
          that as the covenant of works belonged to Adam and his seed, so the
          covenant of grace belongs to Christ and his seed.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As it does not appear there was any real belonging to the covenant
          of works, so we have seen already, that baptism is not the real of the
          covenant of grace; wherefore this argument in favor of infant-baptism
          is weak and frivolous; the reason this author adds to strengthen the
          above argument, is very lamely and improperly expressed, and
          impertinently urged; "for we are not to imagine, that there is more
          efficacy in the covenant of works, to bring condemnation on the
          children of the unbelieving, through the fall of Adam; than there is
          virtue in the covenant of grace, through the mediation of the son of
          God, the second Adam, to bring salvation to the seed of those that
          believe" (Rom5:15; Rom5:18).
        </p>
        <p>
          For the covenant of works being broken by the fall of Adam, brought
          condemnation, not on the children of the unbelieving only, but of
          believers also, even on all his posterity, to whom he stood a federal
          head; and so the covenant of grace, of which Christ the second Adam is
          the mediator, brings salvation, not to the seed of those that believe,
          many of whom never believe, and to whom salvation is never brought,
          nor they to that; but to all Christ’s spiritual seed and offspring, to
          whom he stands a federal head; which is the sense of the passages of
          scripture referred to, and serves no ways to strengthen the cause of
          infant baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third argument runs thus: "The seed of believers are to be
          baptized into the same covenant with themselves; seeing infants, while
          infants, as ha-aural parts of their parents, are included in the same
          threatenings, which are denounced against wicked parents, and in the
          same promises as are made to godly parents, being branches of one
          root" (Rom11:16; Deut 4:37; Deut 4:40; Deut 28:1-4; Deut 30:6; Deut
          30:19; Ps 102:28; Prov 11:21; Prov 20:7; Jer 32:38-39; Ex 20:5; Ex
          34:7; Deut 28:15; Deut 28:18; Deut 28:45-46; Ps 21:10; Ps 19:9-10; Isa
          14:20-21; Jer 22:28; Jer 36:31). Here let it be observed,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. that it is pleaded that infants should be baptized into the same
          covenant with their parents, meaning no doubt the covenant of grace;
          that is, should by baptism be brought into the covenant as it is
          expressed in Argument 7th, or else I know not what is meant by being
          baptized into the same covenant; and yet in the preceding argument it
          is urged, that the covenant of grace belongs to the infants of
          believers, that is, they are in it, and therefore are to be baptized:
          an instance this of the glaring contradiction before observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Threatenings indeed are made to wicked parents and their children,
          partly to shew the heinousness of their sins, and to deter them from
          them; and partly to express God’s hatred of sin, and his punitive
          justice; and also to point out original sin and the corruption of
          nature in infants, and what they must expect when grown up if they
          follow the examples of their parents, and commit the same or like
          sins; but what is all this to infant-baptism; Why,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In like manner promises are made to godly parents and their
          children, and several passages are referred to in proof of it; some of
          these are of a temporal nature, and are designed to stir up and
          encourage good men to the discharge of their duty, and have no manner
          of regard to any spiritual or religious privilege; and such as are of
          a spiritual nature, which respect conversion, sanctification, etc.
          when these take place on the seed of believers, then, and not till
          then, do they appear to have any right to Gospel-ordinances, such as
          baptism and the Lord’s supper; wherefore the argument from promises to
          such privileges, before the things promised are bestowed, is of no
          force.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourth argument is much of the same kind with the foregoing,
          namely, "There are many examples recorded in scripture wherein the
          infants of ungodly men are involved with their parents in heavy
          judgments; therefore as the judgment and curse which belong to the
          wicked, belong also to their seed, so the privileges of the faints
          belong also to their offspring, unless they reject the God of their
          fathers. The justice and wrath of God, is not more extensive to
          destroy the offspring of the wicked, than his grace and mercy is to
          fare those of the faithful; therefore baptism, the sign of the
          promises of God’s mercy, is not to be denied to such infants" (Num
          14:33; 2 Kin 5:27; Jos 7:24-25; Jer 22:28). The answer given to the
          former may suffice for this: to which may be added,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the inflicting judgments on the children of some wicked men,
          is an instance of the sovereign justice of God; and his bellowing
          privileges on the children of some good men, is an instance of his
          sovereign grace, who punishes whom he will, and has mercy on whom he
          will: for,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God does not always proceed in this method; he sometimes bellows
          the blessings of his grace on the children of the wicked, and inflicts
          deserved punishment on the children of good men; the seed of the
          wicked do not always inherit their curses, nor the seed of the godly
          their blessings; wherefore such dispensations of God can be no rule of
          conduct to us; and particularly with respect to baptism. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Whatsoever privileges belong to the seed of believers, we are very
          desirous they should enjoy; nor would we deprive them of any; let it
          be shewn that baptism belongs to them as ruth (compassion, ed.), and
          we will by no means deny it to them. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Whereas it is said that the privileges of faints belong to their
          offspring, adding this exceptive clause, "unless they reject the God
          of their fathers;" it seems most proper, prudent and advisable,
          particularly in the care before us, to wait and see whether they will
          receive or reject, follow or depart from the God of their fathers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fifth argument is formed thus: "The children of believers are to
          be baptized now, as those of the Jews were circumcised formerly; for
          circumcision was then the real of the covenant, as baptism is now,
          which Christ has appointed in lieu thereof. Abraham and his son
          Ishmael, and all that were born in his house, were circumcised the
          same day; and God commanded all Israel to bring their children into
          the covenant with them, to give them the real of it, and circumcise
          them" (Gen 17:1-27; Deut 29:10-12; Col 2:11-12). To all which I reply,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. that circumcision was no real of the covenant of grace; if it was,
          the covenant of grace from Adam to Abraham was without a real. It is
          called a sign in Gen 17:1-27 : the passage referred to, but not a
          real: it is indeed in Rom4:11 said to be a seal of the righteousness
          of the faith, not to infants, not to Abraham’s natural seed, only to
          himself; assuring him, that he should be the father of many nations,
          in a spiritual sense, and that the righteousness of faith he had,
          should come upon the Gentiles: wherefore this mark or sign continued
          until the gospel, in which the righteousness of God is revealed from
          faith to faith, was preached unto the Gentiles, and received by them;
          to which may be added, that there were many living who were interested
          in the covenant of grace, when circumcision was appointed, and yet it
          was not ordered to them; as it would have been, had it been a seal of
          that covenant; and on the other hand, it was enjoined such who had no
          interest in the covenant of grace, and to whom it could not be a real
          of it, as Ishmael, Esau, and others. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. it has been shewn already, that baptism is no seal of the said
          covenant. Nor,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. is it appointed by Christ in lieu of circumcision, nor does it
          succeed it; there is no agreement between them in their subjects, use,
          and manner of administration; and what most clearly shews that baptism
          did not come in the room of circumcision, is, that it was in force and
          use before circumcision was abolished; which was not till the death of
          Christ; whereas, years before that, multitudes were baptized, and our
          Lord himself; and there-tore it being in force before the other was
          out of date, cannot with any propriety be said to succeed it. This
          writer, p. 28. has advanced several things to prove that baptism came
          in the room of circumcision.
        </p>

          1st, He argues from the Lord’s supper being instead of the paschal
          lamb, that therefore baptism must be in the room of circumcision,
          which is ceased; or else there must be a deficiency. But it does not
          appear that the Lord’s supper is in the room of the passover; it
          followed that indeed, in the institution and celebration of it by
          Christ, but it was not instituted by him to answer the like purposes
          as the passover; nor are the same persons admitted to the one as the
          other; and besides, was the Lord’s supper in the room of the passover,
          it does not follow from thence that baptism must be in the room of
          circumcision: but then it is said there will be a deficiency; a
          deficiency of what? all those ceremonial rites, the passover and
          circumcision, with many others, pointed at thrift, and have had their
          fulfillment in him; he is come, and is the body and substance of them;
          and therefore there can be no deficiency, since he is in the room of
          them, and is the fulfilling end of them: nor can any other but he,
          with any propriety, be said to come in the room of them. And there can
          be no deficiency of grace, since he is full of it, nor of ordinances,
          for he has appointed as many as he thought fit.

          2dly, This author urges, that it is proper there should be two
          sacraments under the gospel, as there were two under the law, one for
          adult persons, the other for their children, as were the paschal lamb
          and circumcision. But if every thing that was typical of Christ, as
          those two were, were sacraments, it might as well be said there were
          two and twenty sacraments under the law, as two; and, according to
          this way of reasoning, there should be as many under the gospel.
          Moreover, of these two, one was not for adult persons only, and the
          other for their children; for they were, each of them, both for adult
          persons and children too; they that partook of the one had a right to
          the other; all that were circumcised might eat of the passover, and
          none but they; and if this is a rule and direction to us now, if
          infants have a right to baptism, they ought to be admitted to the
          Lord’s supper.
        </p>
        <p>
          3dly, Baptism, he says, is appointed for a like end as circumcision;
          namely, for the admission of persons into the church, which is not
          true; circumcision was appointed for another end, and not for that:
          the Jewish church was national, and as loon as an infant was born, it
          was a member of it, even before circumcision; and therefore it could
          not be admitted by it; nor is baptism for any such end, nor are
          persons admitted into a visible church of Christ by it; they may be
          baptized, and yet not members of a church: what church was the eunuch
          admitted into, or did he become a member of, by his baptism?
        </p>
        <p>
          4thly, This writer affirms, that "the holy Spirit calls baptism
          circumcision, that is, the circumcision made without hands, having the
          same spiritual design; and is termed the Christian circumcision, or
          that of Christ; it answering to circumcision, and being ordained by
          Christ in the room of it." To say that baptism is ordained by Christ
          in the room of circumcision, is begging the question, nor is there any
          thing in it that answers to circumcision, nor is it called the
          circumcision of Christ, in Col 2:11, which I suppose is the place
          referred to; for not that, but internal circumcision, the circumcision
          of the heart is meant, which Christ by his Spirit is the author of,
          and therefore called his; and the same is the circumcision made
          without hands, in opposition to circumcision in the flesh; it being by
          the powerful and efficacious grace of God, without the assistance of
          men; nor can baptism with any shew of reason, or appearance of truth,
          be so called, since that is made with the hands of men; and therefore
          can never be the circumcision there meant.
        </p>
        <p>
          5thly, He infers that baptism is appointed in the room of
          circumcision, from their signifying like things, as Original
          corruption, regeneration, or the circumcision of the heart (Deut 30:6;
          Titus 3:5), being seals of the covenant of grace (Ezek 16:21; Mat
          16:26), initiating ordinances, and alike laying men under an
          obligation to put off the body of sin, and walk in newness of life
          (Rom4:11) and also being marks of distinction between church-members
          and others (Rom6:4; Rom6:6). But baptism and circumcision do not
          signify the like things; baptism signifies the sufferings, death,
          burial, and resurrection of Christ, which circumcision did not; nor
          does baptism signify original corruption, which it takes not away; nor
          regeneration, which it does not give, but pre-requires it; nor is
          baptism meant in the passage referred to, Titus 3:5, nor are either of
          them seals of the covenant of grace, as has been shewn already; nor
          initiating ordinances, or what enter persons into a church-state:
          Jewish infants were church-members, before they were circumcised; and
          persons may be baptized, and yet not be members of churches; and
          whatever obligations the one and the other may lay men under to live
          in newness of life, this can be no proof of the one coming in the room
          of the other. Circumcision was indeed a mark of distinction between
          the natural seed of Abraham and others; and baptism is a
          distinguishing badge, to be wore by those that believe in Christ, and
          put him on, and are his spiritual seed; but neither of them
          distinguish church-members from others; the passages referred to are
          impertinent. But I proceed to consider—
        </p>
        <p>
          The sixth argument in favor of infant-baptism, taken from "the
          sameness of the covenant of grace made with Jews and Gentiles, of
          which circumcision was the seal; from the seal and dispensation of
          which, the Jews and their children are cut off, and the Gentiles and
          their seed are engrafted in" (Gal 3:14; Acts 15:11; Rom4:11; Rom11:15;
          Rom11:17). In answer to which, let it be observed,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the covenant of grace is indeed the same in one age, and under
          one dispensation, as another; or as made with one sort of people as
          another, whether Jews or Gentiles; the same blessings of it that came
          upon Abraham, come upon all believers, Jews or Gentiles; and the one
          are saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, as the other; but
          then,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The covenant of grace was not made with Abraham and his natural
          seed, or with all the Jews as such; nor is it made with Gentiles and
          their natural seed as such; but with Christ and his spiritual seed,
          and with them only, be they of what nation., or live they in what age
          they will.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Circumcision was no seal of the covenant of grace, nor does
          Rom4:11. prove it, as has been shewn already; and therefore nothing
          can be inferred from hence with respect to baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The root or stock from whence the unbelieving Jews were cut off,
          and into which the believing Gentiles are engrafted, is not the
          covenant of grace, from which those who are interested in it can never
          be cut off; but the gospel church-state, from which the unbelieving
          Jews were rejected and left out, and the believing Gentiles took in,
          who partook of all the privileges of it (Rom11:17-25): though no
          mention is made throughout the whole of the passage of the children of
          either; only of some being broken off through unbelief, and others
          standing by faith; and therefore can be of no service in the cause of
          infant-baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seventh argument is taken from "the extent of the covenant of
          grace being the same under the New Testament, as before the coming of
          Christ, who came not to curtail the covenant, and render worse the
          condition of infants; if they were in the covenant before, they are so
          now; no spiritual privilege given to children or others can be made
          void" (Rom11:29; Jer 30:20). To which may be replied,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the extent of the covenant, as to the constitution of it, and
          persons interested in it, is always the same, having neither more nor
          fewer; but with respect to the application of it, it extends to more
          persons at one time than at another; and is more extensive under the
          gospel-dispensation than before; it being applied to Gentiles as well
          as Jews: and with respect to the blessings and privileges of it, they
          are always the same, are never curtailed or made void, or taken away
          from those to whom they belong; which are all Christ’s spiritual seed,
          and none else, be they Jews or Gentiles. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It should be proved that the infant-seed of believers, or their
          natural seed as such, were ever in the covenant of grace; or that any
          spiritual privileges were given to them as such; or it is impertinent
          to talk of curtailing the covenant, or taking away the privileges of
          the seed of believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If even their covenant-interest could be proved, which it cannot,
          that gives no right to any ordinance, or to a positive institution,
          without a divine direction; there were many who were interested in the
          covenant of grace, when circumcision was appointed, who yet had
          nothing to do with that ordinance.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. baptism not being allowed to infants, does not make their condition
          worse than it was under the former dispensation; for as then
          circumcision could not save them, so neither would baptism, were it
          administered to them; nor was circumcision really a privilege, but the
          reverse; and therefore the abrogation of it, without substituting any
          thing in its room, does not make the condition of infants the worse;
          and certain it is, that the condition of the infants of believing
          Gentiles, even though baptism is denied them, is much better than that
          of the infants of Gentiles before the coming of Christ; yea, even of
          the infants of Jews themselves; since they are born of Christian
          parents, and so have a Christian education, and the opportunity and
          advantage of hearing the gospel preached, as they grow up, with
          greater clearness, and in every place[3] where they are. The text in
          Rom11:29 regards not external privileges, but internal grace; that in
          Jer 30:20 respects not infants, but the posterity of the Jews; adult
          persons in the latter day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eighth argument is taken from the everlastingness of the covenant
          of grace, and runs thus; "The example of Abraham and the Israelites in
          circumcising their children according to the command of God, should
          oblige us to baptize our children; because circumcision was then a
          real of the everlasting covenant, a covenant that was to last for
          ever, and not cease as the legal ceremonies; which God hath confirmed
          with an oath; and therefore can have suffered no alteration for the
          worse in any thing with respect to infants" (Gen 7:17; Heb 6:13; Heb
          6:18; Mic 7:18; Mic 7:20; Gal 3:8.) The answer to which is,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the covenant of grace is everlasting, will never cease, nor
          admit of any alteration, is certain; but the covenant of circumcision,
          which is called an everlasting covenant, Gen 17:7, was only to
          continue during the Mosaic dispensation, or unto the times of the
          Messiah; and is so called for the same reason, and just in the same
          sense as the covenant of the priesthood with Phinehas is called, the
          covenant of an everlasting Priesthood (Num 25:13). Though the covenant
          of grace is everlasting, and whatever is in that covenant, or ever
          was, will never be altered; yet it should be proved there is any thing
          in it with respect to infants, and particularly which lays any
          foundation for, or gives them any claim and right to baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Though circumcision was a sign and token of the covenant made with
          Abraham, and his natural seed, it never was any real of the covenant
          of grace. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The example of Abraham and others, in circumcising their children
          according to the command of God, lays no obligation upon us to baptize
          ours, unless we had a command for their baptism, as they had for their
          circumcision.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ninth argument is formed thus: "baptism is to be administered to
          the seed of believers, because it is certainly very dangerous and
          blameworthy, to neglect and despise a valuable privilege appointed by
          God from the beginning, to the offspring of his people."
        </p>
        <p>
          But it must be denied, and should be proved, that baptism is a
          privilege appointed by God from the beginning, to the offspring of his
          people; let it be shewn, if it can, when and where it was appointed by
          him. This argument is illustrated and enforced by various
          observations; as that "that soul was to be cut off that neglected
          circumcision; and no just excuse can be given for neglecting
          infant-baptism, which is ordained to be the seal of the covenant
          instead of circumcision:" but we have seen already, that baptism does
          not come in the room of circumcision, nor is it a real of the covenant
          of grace; and there is good reason to be given for the neglect of
          infant-baptism, because it never was ordained and appointed of God.
          Moreover it is said, "that the seed of believers were formerly, under
          the Old Testament, in the covenant together with their parents; and no
          one is able to shew that they have been cast out under the New, or
          that their condition is worse, and their spiritual privileges less,
          under the gospel, than under the law:" but that believers with their
          natural seed as such, were together in the covenant of grace under the
          Old Testament, mould not be barely affirmed, but proved, before we are
          put upon to shew that they are cast out under the New; though this
          writer himself, before in the sixth argument, talks of the Jews and
          their children being cut off from the real and dispensation of the
          covenant; which can never be true of the covenant of grace; nor do we
          think that the condition of infants is worse, or their privileges less
          now, than they were before, though baptism is denied them, as has been
          observed already. It is further urged, that "it is not to be imagined,
          without presumption, that Christ ever intended to "cut them off from
          an ordinance, which God had given them a right unto;" nor do we
          imagine any such thing; nor can it be proved that God ever gave the
          ordinance of baptism to them. As for what this writer further
          observes, that had Christ took away circumcision, without ordaining
          baptism in the room of it, for the children of believers; the Jews
          would have cried out against it as an excommunication of their
          children; and would have been a greater objection against him than any
          other; and would now be a hindrance of their conversion; and who, if
          they were converted, would have baptism or circumcision to be a seal
          of the covenant with them and their children, it deserves no answer;
          since the clamors, outcries, and objections of the Jews, and their
          practice on their legal principles, would be no rule of direction to
          us, were they made and gave into, since they would be without reason
          and truth; for though Christ came not to destroy the moral law, but to
          fulfill it (Mat 5:17); yet he came to put an end to the ceremonial
          law, of which circumcision is a part, and did put an end to it[4]: the
          text in Jer 30:20 respects the restoration of the Jews in the latter
          day, but not their old ecclesiastical polity, which shall not be
          established again, but their civil liberties and privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tenth argument stands thus: "Children are to be baptized under the
          covenant of grace, because all the covenants which God ever made with
          men were made not only with them, but also with their children;" and
          instances are given in Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Levi,
          Phinehas, and David. The covenant of works was indeed made with Adam
          and his seed, in which covenant he was a federal head to his
          offspring; but the covenant of grace was not made with him and his
          seed, he was no federal head in that; nor is that made with all
          mankind, as it must, if it had been made with Adam and his seed: this
          is an instance against the argument, and shews that all the covenants
          that ever God made with men, were not made with them and their seed;
          for certainly the covenant of grace was made with Adam, and made known
          to him (Gen 17:19-21), and yet not with his seed with him; nor can any
          instance be given of the covenant of grace being made with any man,
          and his natural seed. There was a covenant made with Noah and his
          posterity, securing them from a future deluge, but not a covenant of
          grace securing them from everlasting destruction; for then it must
          have been made with all mankind, since all are the posterity of Noah;
          and where then is the distinction of the seed of believers and of
          unbelievers? Besides Ham, one of Noah’s immediate offspring, was not
          interested in the covenant of grace. As for the covenant made with
          Abraham, his son Ishmael was excluded from it"; and of Isaac’s two
          sons one of them was rejected (Rom9:10-13) and all were not Israel
          that were of Israel, or of Jacob, Gen 17:6. The covenant of the
          priesthood was indeed made with Levi and Phinehas, and their
          posterity; and though it is called an everlasting one, it is now made
          void; nor is there any other in its room with the ministers of the
          word and their posterity; and yet no outcry is made of the children of
          gospel-ministers being in a worse condition, and their privileges less
          than those of the priests and Levites: and as for David, the sad
          estate of his family, and the wicked behavior of most of his children,
          shew, that the covenant of grace was not made with him and his natural
          offspring; and whatever covenants those were that were made with there
          persons, they furnish out no argument proving the covenant of grace to
          be made with believers and their carnal seed, and still less any
          argument in favor of infant-baptism.[5]
        </p>
        <p>
          The eleventh argument is: "The seed of believers ought to be baptized
          under the covenant of grace, otherwise they would be reckoned pagans,
          and the offspring of infidels and idolaters, to whom there is neither
          a promise nor any sign of hope; whereas the scripture makes a
          difference, calling them holy on account of their relation to the holy
          covenant, when either their father or mother believe (1Cor 7:14),
          disciples (Acts 15:10); reckoning them among them that believe,
          because of their relation to the household of faith (Mat 18:6) styling
          them the seed of the blessed, and their offspring with them (Isa.
          115:23); accounting them for a generation to the Lord (Ps 22:30) as
          David says; who, Ps 22:10 observes, that God was his God from his
          mother’s belly; and also calling them the children of God (Ezek
          16:20-21); therefore they ought to be dedicated to him by that
          ordinance which he has appointed for that purpose." To all which may
          be replied,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the children of believers are by nature children of wrath even
          as others; and are no better than others; and were they baptized, they
          would not be at all the better Christians for it. Though,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It will be allowed that there is a difference between the offspring
          of believers, and those of infidels, pagans and idolaters; and the
          former have abundantly the advantage of the latter, as they have a
          Christian education; and consequently as they are brought up under the
          means of grace, there is hope of them; and it may be expected that the
          promise of God to such who use the means will be accomplished. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. the characters mentioned either do not belong to children, or not
          for the reason given; and those that do, do not furnish out an
          argument for their baptism. Children are said to be holy, born in
          lawful wedlock (1Cor 7:14); not on account of their relation to the
          holy covenant, but on account of the holiness of a believing parent,
          which surely cannot be a federal holiness, but a matrimonial one; the
          marriage of a believer with an unbeliever being valid, or otherwise
          their children muff be unclean or illegitimate, and not holy or
          legitimate. The disciples in Acts 15:10 are not young children, but
          adult persons, the converted Gentiles, on whom the false teachers
          would have put the yoke of the ceremonial law, and particularly
          circumcision. The little ones reckoned among those that believe in
          Christ, Mat 18:6 were not infants in age, but the apostles of our
          Lord, who were little in their own account, and in the account of
          others, whom to offend was criminal, highly provoking to Christ, and
          of dangerous consequence. The text, Isa 65:23, speaks of the spiritual
          seed of the church, and not the carnal seed of believers,[6] and
          therefore are the same who are accounted to the Lord for a generation;
          even a spiritual seed that shall serve him, Ps 22:30 and the words in
          verse 10 are the words, not of David, but of Christ. And the sons and
          daughters born to God, and whom he calls his children, Ezek 16:20-21
          were so, not by grace or by covenant, but by creation. And from the
          whole there is not the least reason why the children of believers
          should be dedicated to God by baptism, which is an ordinance that
          never was appointed by him for any such purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The twelfth argument is: "The seed of believers are to be baptized,
          because church-relation belongs to them, as citizenship belongs to the
          children of freemen; and it is by baptism that they are first admitted
          into the visible church, and there is neither covenant nor promise of
          salvation out of the church, for the church of Christ is his kingdom
          on earth, and Christ says this belongs to the children" (Mk 10:13-14).
          In answer to which.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. There is a manifest contradiction in the argument. Church-relation
          belongs to infants, that is, they are related to the church, and
          members of it, and therefore should be baptized; and yet they are
          first admitted into the church by baptism; what a contradiction this!
          in it, and out of it, related, and not related to it, at one and the
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Church-membership does not pass from father to son, nor is it by
          birth, as citizenship, or the freedom of cities; the one is a civil,
          the other an ecclesiastical affair; the one is of nature, the other of
          grace; natural birth gives a right to the one, but the spiritual birth
          or regeneration only entitles to the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Church-membership gives no right to baptism, but rather baptism to
          church-membership, or however is a qualification requisite to it;
          persons ought to be baptized before they are church-members; and if
          they are church members, and not regenerate persons and believers in
          Christ, for such may be in a church, they have no right to baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. To talk of there being no covenant or promise of salvation out of
          the church, smells rank of popery. The covenant and promise of
          salvation are not made with and to persons as members of churches, or
          as in a visible church-state, but with and to the elect of God in
          Christ, and with persons only considered in him; who have an interest
          in the covenant and promise of salvation, though they may not be in a
          visible church-state; and doubtless many are saved who never were
          members of a visible church.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The kingdom of God, in Mk 10:13-14 be it the church of Christ on
          earth, or eternal glory in heaven, only belongs to such persons who
          are like to little children for their meekness and humility, and
          freedom from malice and rancor, as Mk 10:15 shows.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Could infants in age, or the seed of believers as such be here
          meant, and the kingdom of God be understood of Christ’s visible
          church, and they as belonging to it, it would prove more than this
          writer chooses; namely, that they have a right to all
          church-privileges, and particularly and especially to the Lord’s
          supper.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thirteenth argument is: "Children are the lambs of Christ’s flock
          and sheep; and the lambs ought not to be kept out of Christ’s fold,
          nor hindered from the washing that is in his blood; he particularly
          promises to be their shepherd; and his Spirit has declared, that
          little children should be brought to him under the gospel, in the
          arms, and on the shoulders of their parents" (Isa 40:11; Isa 49:22;
          Song 6:6; Jn 21:15). On which may be observed,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That there is indeed mention made of the lambs of Christ in Isa
          40:11 and Jn 21:15 which he gathers in his arms, and ordered Peter to
          feed; yet not infants in age are intended in either place, but adult
          persons, weak believers, who, in comparison of others, because of
          their small degree of knowledge and strength, are called lambs; and
          are to be gently and tenderly dealt with; and such as these are not
          kept out of Christ’s fold, but are received into it, though weak in
          the faith, but not to doubtful disputations; and are fed with
          knowledge and understanding, which infants in age are not capable of.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The infant-seed of believers are no where called the sheep of
          Christ, nor has he promised to be the shepherd of them; let the
          passages be directed to, if it can be, where this is said.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Those who are truly the lambs and sheep of Christ, am not hindered
          from the washing of his blood; though that is not to be done, nor is
          it done by baptism; persons may be washed with water, as Simon Magus,
          and yet not warned in the blood of Christ: Song 6:6 does not intend
          washing in either sense; but either the regenerating grace of the
          spirit, or the purity of conversation, and respects not infants at
          all.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Nor is it declared by the Spirit of God, that parents should bring
          their children to Christ in their arms, and on their shoulders; the
          passage in Isa 49:22 brought in support of it, speaks of the spiritual
          seed of the church, and not of the carnal seed of believers; and of
          their being brought, not in the arms and on the shoulders of their
          natural parents, but of the Gentiles; and not to Christ, but to the
          church, through the ministry of the word in the latter day, in which
          the Gentiles would be very assisting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourteenth argument runs thus: "The seed of the faithful ought to
          be baptized, because they were partakers of all the former baptisms
          mentioned in scripture, as the children of Noah in the ark (1 Pet
          3:20); the Israelites at the Red Sea, and in the cloud (1Cor 10:1-2;
          Ex 12:37); Several children were baptized with the baptism of the
          Spirit, for several were filled with the holy Ghost from their
          mother’s womb; all the children of Bethlehem under two years old, with
          the baptism of martyrdom (Mat 2:1); and many children with John’s
          baptism, since he baptized the whole country." But,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It unhappily falls out, for the cause of infant-baptism, that
          Noah’s children in the ark were all adult and married persons (Gen
          7:7).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That there were children among the Israelites when they were
          baptized in the cloud, and in the sea, is not denied; but then it
          should be observed, that they did all eat the same spiritual meat, and
          did all drink the same spiritual drink; and therefore, if this does
          not give a sufficient claim to infants to partake of the Lord’s
          supper, neither will the other prove their right to baptism: moreover,
          if any arguments can be formed from this and the former instance, for
          the administration of baptism under the New Testament, they will
          clearly shew, that it ought to be administered by immersion; for, as
          in the former, when the fountains of the great deep were broke up
          under them, and the windows of heaven were opened over them, they were
          as persons immersed in water; so when the waters of the Red Sea stood
          up on each side, and the cloud was over the Israelites, they were, as
          it were overwhelmed in water.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Though this writer says, that several children were filled with the
          holy Ghost from their mother’s womb, yet we read but of one that was
          so, John the Baptist, a very extraordinary person, and extraordinarily
          qualified for extraordinary work, an instance not to be mentioned in
          ordinary cases; betides, it is a rule in logic, a particulari ad
          univer-salem non valet consequentia, "from a particular to an
          universal, the consequence is not conclusive." Moreover, in what sense
          John was filled with the holy Ghost so early, is not easy to say; and
          be it what it will, the same cannot be proved of the seed of believers
          in general; and could it, it would give no right to baptism, without a
          positive institution; it gave no right to John himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. That the infants at Bethlehem were murdered, will be granted, but
          that they suffered martyrdom for Christ, will not easily be proved;
          since they knew nothing of the matter, and were not conscious on what
          account their lives were taken away.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. That many or any children were baptized with John’s baptism we
          deny, and call upon this writer to prove it, and even to give us one
          tingle instance of it; what he suggests is no evidence of it, as that
          the whole country in general were baptized by him, who could not be
          all childless; but I hope he does not think, that every individual
          person in the country of Judea was baptized by John; it is certain,
          that there were many even adult persons that were refused by him, and
          such as were baptized by him, were such as confessed their sins, which
          infants could not do (Mat 3:5-7) and as to the probability of the
          displeasure of Jewish parents, suggested if their children had not
          been baptized by John, since they were used, and under a command of
          God, to bring their children to the covenant and ordinances of God
          (Gen 17:1-27; Deut 29:10; Deut 29:13; Joel 2:16), it deserves no
          regard, since whatever probability there was of their displeasure,
          though I see none, there could be no just ground for it; since in the
          instances given, they had the command of God for what they did, for
          this they had none.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fifteenth argument is: "It is contrary to the apostle’s practice,
          to leave any unbaptized in Christian families; for they baptized whole
          families when the heads of them believed; as the families of Lydia,
          the Jailor, and Stephanas; and it is evident, that the words, family
          and household, in scripture, mean chiefly children, sons, daughters,
          and little ones."[7]
        </p>
        <p>
          To which I reply, that whatever there words signify in some places of
          scripture, though in the passages mentioned they do not chiefly intend
          new-born infants, but grown persons; it should be proved, that there
          were infants in families and households that were baptized, and that
          there were baptized together with the head of the family; for it is
          certain, there are many families and households that have no little
          children in them; and as for those that are instanced in, it is not
          probable that there were any in them; and it is manifest, that such as
          were baptized, were adult persons and believers in Christ. It is not
          evident in what station of life Lydia was, whether married or
          unmarried, and whether one had young children or not; and if one had,
          it is not likely they should be with her, when at a distance from her
          native place, and upon business; it is most probable, that those that
          were with her, called her household, were her servants, that assisted
          her in her business; and it is certain, that when the apostles entered
          her house, those that were there, and who doubtless are the same that
          were baptized, were called brethren, and such as were capable of being
          comforted (Acts 16:15; Acts 16:40) and the Jailor’s household were
          such as had the word of God spoken to them, and received it with joy,
          took pleasure in the company and conversation of the apostles, and
          believed in God together with him, and so were adult persons,
          believers, and very proper subjects of baptism (Acts 16:32-34).
          Stephanas is by some thought to be the same with the Jailor; but if he
          was another person, it is plain his household consisted of adult
          persons, men called by grace, and who were made use of in public work;
          they were the first-fruits of Achaia, and addicted themselves to the
          ministry of the saints.[8]
        </p>
        <p>
          The sixteenth argument is: "None that truly fear God, can seriously
          and with certainty say, that there were not many infants among the
          three thousand baptized by the apostles at once; for the Jews were not
          content with any ordinances without having their children with them.
          The apostle directs those who were at age to repent, but he commands
          every one of them to be baptized, and objects nothing against their
          children; because, as he says, the promise was unto them and their
          children also; and this is a plain command for infant-baptism to all
          that will judge impartially." But,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. A man that carefully reads the account of the baptism of the three
          thousand, having the fear of God before his eyes, may with the
          greatest seriousness and strongest assurance affirm, not only that
          there were not many infants, but that there were not one infant among
          the three thousand baptized by the apostles; for they were all of them
          such as were pricked to the heart, and cried out, Men and brethren
          what shall we do? they gladly received the word of the gospel, joined
          to the church, and continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine, in
          fellowship, and in breaking of bread and prayer; all which cannot be
          said of infants.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What this author suggests, agreeable to what he elsewhere says,
          that the Jews were not pleased with any ordinance unless they had
          their children with them, is without foundation; what discontent did
          they ever shew at a part of their children being left out of the
          ordinance of circumcision, and no other appointed for them in lieu of
          it? And had they been discontented, what argument can be formed from
          it?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The distinction between those that were of age, whom the apostle
          directed to repent, and the every one of them whom he commanded to be
          baptized, has no ground nor reason for it, yea is quite stupid and
          senseless; and even, according to this writer himself, is a
          distinction without any difference, since the every one to be baptized
          are supposed by him to have children, and so to be at age; since he
          adds, "and objects nothing against their children." And a clear case
          it is, that the self-same persons that were exhorted to be baptized,
          were exhorted to repent, and that as previous to their baptism; and
          therefore must be adult persons, for infants are not capable of
          repentance, and of giving evidence of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Those words, the promise is unto you and to your children, are so
          far from being a plain command for infant-baptism, that there is not a
          word of baptism in them, and much less of infant-baptism; nor do they
          regard intents, but the posterity of the Jews, who are often called
          children, though grown up, to whom the promise of the Messiah, and
          remission of sins by him, and the pouring out of the holy Ghost, was
          made; and are spoken for the encouragement of adult persons only, to
          repent and be baptized; and belong only to such as are called by
          grace, and to all truth, whether Jews or Gentiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seventeenth argument is: "The seed of believers should be
          baptized, be-cause the privileges and blessings which are signified
          and sealed in baptism are necessary to their salvation, and there is
          no salvation without them; namely, an interest in the covenant of
          grace, the remission of original sin,. union with Christ,
          sanctification of the holy Spirit, and regeneration, without which
          none can be saved" (Jn 3:5). The answer to which is,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the things indeed mentioned are necessary to salvation, and
          there can be none without them; but then baptism is not necessary to
          the enjoyment of these things, nor to salvation; a person may have an
          interest in these blessings, and be saved, though not baptized; there
          are things necessary to baptism, but baptism is not necessary to them;
          and indeed a person ought to have an interest in these, and appear to
          have one, before he is baptized. Wherefore,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There things are not signified in baptism, and much less sealed by
          it; other things, such as the sufferings, death, and the resurrection
          of Christ, are signified in it; there, as regeneration, etc. are
          prerequisites unto baptism, and are not communicated by it, or sealed
          up to persons in it, who may be baptized, and yet have no share and
          lot in this matter, witness the care of Simon Magus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eighteenth argument is: "The children of the faithful ought to be
          baptized, because this lays them under strong obligation to shun the
          works of Satan; and many have received much benefit from hence in
          their youth. Comfortable symptoms, or signs of a work of grace, have
          appeared very early in several, though perhaps bad company has
          afterwards corrupted them. Betides infant-baptism keeps up a general
          profession of faith and religion, and makes the word and means of
          grace of more virtue and efficacy, than if men had utterly renounced
          Christianity, and declared themselves infidels; and further, it says a
          powerful obligation on their parents and others, to teach them their
          duty, which is a main end of all the ordinances God has instituted"
          (Ps 78:5-6). But,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Is there nothing betides baptism, that can lay persons under strong
          obligation to shun the works of the Devil? certainty there are many
          things: if so, then it is not absolutely necessary on this account;
          besides, though the baptism of adult persons does lay them under
          obligation to walk in newness of life (Rom6:4), yet the baptism of
          infants can lay them under no such obligation as infants, and while
          they are such, because they are not conscious of it, nor can it take
          any such effect upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What that much benefit or advantage is, that many have received
          from infant-baptism, I am at a loss to know, and even what is intended
          by this writer, unless it be what follows, that signs of a work of
          grace have appeared very early in several, which may be, and yet not
          to be ascribed to baptism; baptism has no such virtue and influence,
          as to produce a work of grace in the soul, or any signs of it;
          betides, a work of grace has appeared very early in several, and has
          been carried on in them, who have never been baptized at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Infant-baptism keeps up no public or general profession of faith or
          religion, since there is no profession of faith and religion made in
          it by the person baptized; nor is it of any avail to make the word and
          means of grace powerful and efficacious, which only become so by the
          Spirit and grace of God; and a wide difference there is between the
          diffuse of infant-baptism, and renouncing Christianity, and professing
          infidelity; these things are not necessarily connected together, nor
          do they go together; persons may deny and disuse infant-baptism, as it
          is well known many do, and yet not renounce the Christian faith, and
          declare themselves infidels.

        <p>
          4. Parents and others, without infant-baptism, are under strong
          obligations to teach children their duty to God and men, and therefore
          it is not necessary on that account.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nineteenth argument is: "The seed of believers are to be baptized,
          though they have not actual faith, since Christ speaks not of there
          but of adult persons, Mk 16:16. And certain it is they have as much
          fitness for baptism as for justification and eternal life, without
          which they must all perish; the Spirit of God knows how to work this
          tithers in them, as well as in grown persons: Jeremiah, John the
          Baptist, and several others, were sanctified from their mother’s womb"
          (Jn 3:8-9; Ecc 11:5; Lk 1:15; Lk 1:44; Jer 1:5; Isa 44:3; Ps 8:2). To
          which may be returned for answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That if the text in Mk 16:16 speaks not of infants, but of adult
          persons only, as it certainly does, I hope it will be allowed to be an
          instruction and direction for the baptism of adult believers, and to
          be a sufficient warrant for our practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If the infants of believers have no more fitness for baptism than
          they have for justification and eternal life, they have none at all,
          since they are by nature children of wrath, even as others; and
          therefore can have none, but what is given them by the Spirit and
          grace of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We dispute not the power of the Spirit of God, or what he is able
          to do by the operations of his grace upon the fouls of infants; we
          deny not but that he can and may work a work of grace upon their
          hearts, and clothe them with the righteousness of Christ, and so give
          them both a right and meetness for eternal life; but then this should
          appear previous to baptism; actual faith itself is not sufficient for
          baptism, without a profession of it; the man that has it ought to
          declare it to the satisfaction of the administrator, ere he admits him
          to the ordinance (Acts 8:36-37).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Of the several children said to be sanctified from their mother’s
          womb, no proof is given but of one, John the Baptist, who was filled
          with the holy Ghost from thence, which has been considered in the
          answer to the fourteenth argument; as for Jeremiah, it is only said of
          him that he was sanctified, that is, set apart, designed and ordained,
          in the purpose and counsel of God to be a prophet, before he was born;
          and is no proof of internal sanctification so early, Isa 44:3 speaks
          of the Spirit of God being poured down, not upon the carnal seed of
          believers, but upon the spiritual seed of the church; and Ps 8:2. is a
          prophecy, not of new-born infants, but of children grown up, crying
          Hosanna in the temple (Mat 21:15-16) no argument from a particular
          instance or two, were there more than there are, is of avail for the
          sanctification of infants in general; it should be proved, that all
          the infant-seed of believers are sanctified by the Spirit of God; for
          if some only, and not all, how shall it be known who they are? let it
          first appear that they are sanctified, and then it will be time enough
          to baptize them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The twentieth argument is: "The children of believers are to be
          baptized, because their right to the covenant and church of God is
          established from the first, much clearer than several other necessary
          ordinances; there is no express command nor example of women receiving
          the Lord’s supper; no particular command in the New Testament for
          family-worship, and for the observation of the first day of the week
          as a sabbath; and yet none dare call them in question; and there is no
          objection against infant-baptism, but the like might formerly have
          been made against circumcision; and may now be objected against many
          other ordinances and commands, of God." To which I reply,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That with respect to women, receiving the Lord’s supper, it is
          certain, that not only they were admitted to baptism (Acts 8:12), and
          became members of churches (Acts 1:14-15; Acts 4:37; Acts 5:9; Acts
          5:14; 1Cor 11:5-6; 1Cor 11:13; Acts 14:34, 35). but there is an
          express command for their receiving the Lord’s supper in 1Cor 11:29
          where a word is used of the common gender, and includes both men and
          women; who are both on in Christ, and in a gospel church-state, and
          have a right to the same ordinances (Gal 3:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As to family-worship, that is not peculiar to the New
          Testament-dispensation, as baptism is; it was common to the saints in
          all ages, and therefore needed no express command for it under the
          New; though what else but an express command for it is Eph 6:4? for
          can children be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,
          without family-worship?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As to the observation of the first day, though there is no express
          command for it, there are precedents of it; there are instances of
          keeping it (Jn 20:19; Jn 20:26; Acts 20:7; 1Cor 16:1-2): now, let like
          instances and examples of infant-baptism be produced if they can:
          though no express command can be pointed at, yet if any precedent or
          example of any one infant being baptized by John, or Christ, or his
          apostles, can be given, we should think ourselves obliged to follow
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. That the same objections might be made against circumcision
          formerly, as now against infant-baptism, is most notoriously false; it
          is objected, and that upon a good foundation, that there is neither
          precept nor precedent for infant-baptism in all the word of God; the
          same could never be objected against circumcision, since there was
          such an express command of it to Abraham, Gen 17:1-27, and so many
          instances of it are in the sacred writings; let the same be shewn for
          infant-baptism, and we have done.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. What the other ordinances and commands of God are, to which the
          same objections may be made as to infant-baptism, is not said, and
          therefore no reply can be made. I have nothing more to do, than to
          take some little notice of what this writer says, concerning the mode
          of administering the ordinance of baptism, page 33. We are no more
          fond of contentions and strifes about words, than this author, and
          those of the same way of thinking with himself can be; but surely,
          modestly to inquire into, and attempt to fix the true manner of
          administering an ordinance of Christ, according to the scriptures, and
          the instances of it; according to the signification of the words used
          to express it, and agreeable to the end and design of it; can never be
          looked upon as a piece of impertinence, or be traduced as cavil and
          wrangling. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          1st, Since this writer observes, that he does not find that either the
          sacred scripture or the church of England, have expressly determined,
          whether baptism is to be performed by plunging or sprinkling, but have
          left the one and the other indifferently to our choice; I hope he will
          not be displeased, that we choose the former, as most agreeable to the
          sacred writings, and the examples of baptism in them; as those of our
          Lord and others in Jordan (Mat 3:6; Mat 3:16) and in AEnon, where John
          was baptizing, because there was much water (Jn 3:23) and of the
          Eunuch (Acts 8:36-38) and as best representing the death, burial, and
          resurrection of Christ (Rom6:4; Col 2:12), as well as best suits with
          the primary sense of the Greek word, baptizw, which signifies to
          plunge or dip. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          2dly, Since, according to this writer, one mode is not more essential
          to the ordinance than another, but a reverential receiving of the
          sign; it may be asked, what of this nature, namely, a reverential
          receiving of the sign, the application of the water to the body,
          signifying the spiritual application of Christ and his gifts to the
          soul, can be observed in an infant when sprinkled, which is not
          conscious of what is done to it?
        </p>
        <p>
          3dly, Whereas, he says, "it is not improbable but the apostles
          baptized by sprinkling, since several were baptized in their houses,
          Acts 9:17-18 and Acts 16:33 and others, in former times, sick in their
          beds:" it may be replied, that it is not probable that the apostle
          Paul was baptized by sprinkling (Acts 9:17-18) since had he, he would
          have had no occasion to have arose in order to be baptized, as he is
          said to do, Acts 9:18. It is most probable, that when he arose off of
          his bed or chair, he went to a bath in Judas’s house; or out of the
          house, to a certain place fit for the administration of the ordinance
          by immersion; and since there was a pool in the prison, as Grotius
          thinks, where the Jailor washed the apostles’ stripes, it is most
          probable, that here he and his household were baptized; or since they
          were brought out of the prison, and after baptism brought into the
          Jailor’s house, Acts 9:33-34, it is most likely they went out to the
          river near the city where prayer was wont to be made, and there had
          the ordinance administered to them, Acts 9:13. As for the baptism of
          sick persons in their beds, this was not in the times of the apostles,
          but in after-times, when corruptions had got into the church; and so
          deserves no regard.
        </p>
        <p>
          4thly, In favor of sprinkling, or pouring water in baptism, he urges
          that "it is a sign of the pouring or sprinkling of the holy Ghost, and
          of the blood of Christ" (Ezek 36:25; Heb 12:24), but it should be
          observed, that baptism is not a sign or significative of the
          sprinkling of clean water, or the grace of the Spirit in regeneration,
          or of the blood of Christ on the conscience of a sinner, all which
          ought to precede baptism; but of the death, and burial, and
          resurrection of Christ; which cannot be represented in any other way
          than by covering a person in water, or an immersion of him.

          A BOOK some time ago being published in the Welch language, entitled,
        </p>
        <p>
          "A Guide to a saving Knowledge of the Principles and Duties of
          Religion, viz. Questions and Scriptural Answers, relating to the

        </p>
        <p>
          Some extracts out of it respecting the ordinance of baptism, its
          subject, and mode, being communicated to me, with a request from our
          friends in Wales to make some Reply unto, and also to draw up some
          Reasons for dissenting from the church of England, both which I have
          undertook, and shall attempt in the following manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall take but little notice of what this author says, part 5, page
          40 concerning sponsors in baptism, but refer the reader to what is
          said of them in the Reasons for dissenting, hereunto annexed. This
          writer himself owns, that the practice of having sureties is not
          particularly mentioned in scripture; only he would have it, that it
          has in general obtained in the churches from the primitive times, and
          was enacted by the powers which God has appointed, and whole
          ordinances are to be submitted to, when they are not contrary to those
          of God;[1] and must be allowed to be of great service, if the sureties
          fulfilled their engagements. The answer to all which is, that since it
          is not mentioned in scripture, it deserves no regard; at least, this
          can never recommend it to such, who make the Bible the rule of their
          faith and practice; and as to its obtaining in primitive times, it is
          indeed generally ascribed to Pope Hyginus, as an invention of his; but
          the genuineness of the epistles attributed to him and others, is
          called in question by learned men, and are condemned by them as
          spurious; but were they genuine, neither his office nor his age would
          have much weight and authority with us, who are not to be determined
          by the decrees of popes and councils; the powers spoken of in the
          scriptures referred to, were Heathen magistrates, who surely had no
          authority to enact any thing relating to gospel-worship and
          ordinances; nor can it be reasonably thought they should; and
          submission and obedience to them, are required in things of a civil
          nature, not ecclesiastical, as the scope of the passages, and their
          context manifestly shew; nor has God given power and authority to any
          let of men whatever, to enact laws and ordinances of religious
          worship; nor are we bound to submit to all ordinances of men in
          religious matters, that are not contrary to the appointments of God,
          that is, that are not expressly forbidden in his word; for by this
          means, all manner of superstition and will worship may be introduced.
          Oil and spittle in baptism are no where forbidden, nor is the
          baptizing of bells; yet there ordinances of men are not to be
          submitted to, and a multitude of others of the like kind: we are not
          only to take care to do what God has commanded, but to reject what he
          has not commanded; remembering the care of Nadab and Abihu, who
          offered strange fire to the Lord, which he commanded not. And whereas
          it is suggested, that this practice would be very serviceable were the
          engagements of sureties fulfilled, it is not practicable they should;
          it is impossible to do what they engage to do, even for themselves,
          and much less for others, as is observed in the Reasons, before
          referred to.
        </p>
        <p>
          But passing these things, I shall chiefly attend to the twenty
          arguments, which this writer has advanced in favor of infant-baptism,
          pages 41-45.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first argument runs thus: "Baptism, which is a seal of the
          covenant of grace, should not be forbid to the children of believers,
          seeing they are under condemnation through the covenant of works; and
          if they are left without an interest in the covenant of grace, they
          then would be, to their parents great distress, under a dreadful
          sentence of eternal condemnation, without any sign or promise of the
          mercy of God, or of an interest in Christ; being by nature children of
          wrath as others, and consequently without any hope of salvation, if
          they die in their infancy."
        </p>
        <p>
          In which there are some things true, and others false, and nothing
          that can be improved into an argument in favor of infant-baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is true that the infants of believers, as well as others, are by
          nature the children of wrath, and under condemnation through the
          covenant of works; so all mankind are as considered in Adam, and in
          consequence of his sin and fall (Rom5:12; Rom5:18). But,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is not baptism that can save them from wrath and condemnation; a
          person may be baptized in water, and yet not saved from wrath to come,
          and still lie under the sentence of condemnation, being
          notwithstanding that, in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity,
          as the case of Simon Magus shews. Though this writer seems to be of
          opinion, that baptism is a saving ordinance, and that a person cannot
          be fared without it; and indeed he expressly says, p. 27. that "in
          general it is necessary to salvation;" as if salvation was by it,
          (which is a popish notion) and there was none without it; but the
          instance of the penitent thief, is a proof to the contrary: the text
          does not say, he that is baptized shall be saved, but he that
          BELIEVETH and is baptized; nor is it any where suggested, that a
          person dying without baptism shall be damned. It is CHRIST only, and
          not baptism, that fares from wrath and condemnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Being unbaptized, does not leave without an interest in the
          covenant of grace, or exclude from the hope of salvation, or the mercy
          of God, or an interest in Christ; persons may have an interest in all
          these, and yet not be baptized. See the strange contradictions men run
          into when destitute of truth; one while the covenant of grace is said
          to be made with believers, and their seed, as in the next argument,
          and so their infants being in it, have a right to baptism; at another
          time it is baptism that puts them into the covenant; and if they are
          not baptized they are left without interest in it, and, to the great
          grief of their parents, under a dreadful sentence of eternal
          condemnation. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. as the salvation of an infant dying in its infancy is one of the
          secret things which belong unto the Lord, a judicious Christian parent
          will leave it with him; and find more relief from his distress, by
          hoping in the grace and mercy of God through Christ, and in the virtue
          and efficacy of his blood and righteousness, which may be applied unto
          it without baptism, than he can in baptism; which he may observe, may
          be administered to a person, and yet be damned. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          5. baptism is no seal of the covenant of grace, nor does it give any
          person an interest in it, or seal it to them; a person may be
          baptized, and yet have no interest in the covenant, as Simon Magus and
          others, and to whom it was never sealed; and on the other hand, a
          person may be in the covenant of grace, and it may be sealed to him,
          and he assured of his interest in it, and not yet be baptized: the
          blood of Christ is the seal of the covenant, and the Spirit of Christ
          is the sealer of the saint’s interest in it. And, after all, if
          baptism has such virtue in it, as to give an interest in the covenant
          of grace, to be a sign and promise of mercy, and of our interest in
          Christ, and furnish out hope of salvation, and secure from wrath and
          condemnation, why should not compassion be shewn to the children of
          unbelievers, who are in the same state and condition by nature? for, I
          observe all along, that in this and the following arguments, baptism
          is wholly restrained to the children of believers; upon the whole, the
          argument from the state of infants to their baptism is impertinent and
          fruitless; since there is no such efficacy in baptism, to deliver them
          from it.[2]
        </p>
        <p>
          The second argument is: "The children of believers should be admitted
          to baptism, since as the covenant of works, and the real of it
          belonged to Adam and his children, so the covenant of grace, and the
          real thereof belongs, through Christ, to believers and their
          children:" to which it may be replied,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That it is indeed true, that the covenant of works belonged to Adam
          and his posterity, he being a federal head unto them; but then it does
          not appear, that that covenant had any seal belonging to it, since it
          needed none, nor was it proper it should have any, seeing it was not
          to continue. And if the tree of life is intended, As I suppose it is,
          whatever that might be a sign of, it was no real of any thing, nor did
          it belong to Adam’s children, who were never suffered to partake of
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There is a great disparity between Adam and believers, and the
          relation they stand in to their respective offspring: Adam stood as a
          common head and representative to all his posterity; not so believers
          to theirs: they are no common heads unto them, or representatives of
          them; wherefore though the covenant of works belonged to Adam and his
          posterity, it does not follow, that the covenant of grace belongs to
          believers and their children, they not standing in the same relation
          he did. There never were but two covenant-heads, Adam and CHRIST, and
          between them, and them only, the parallel will run, and in this form;
          that as the covenant of works belonged to Adam and his seed, so the
          covenant of grace belongs to Christ and his seed.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As it does not appear there was any real belonging to the covenant
          of works, so we have seen already, that baptism is not the real of the
          covenant of grace; wherefore this argument in favor of infant-baptism
          is weak and frivolous; the reason this author adds to strengthen the
          above argument, is very lamely and improperly expressed, and
          impertinently urged; "for we are not to imagine, that there is more
          efficacy in the covenant of works, to bring condemnation on the
          children of the unbelieving, through the fall of Adam; than there is
          virtue in the covenant of grace, through the mediation of the son of
          God, the second Adam, to bring salvation to the seed of those that
          believe" (Rom5:15; Rom5:18).
        </p>
        <p>
          For the covenant of works being broken by the fall of Adam, brought
          condemnation, not on the children of the unbelieving only, but of
          believers also, even on all his posterity, to whom he stood a federal
          head; and so the covenant of grace, of which Christ the second Adam is
          the mediator, brings salvation, not to the seed of those that believe,
          many of whom never believe, and to whom salvation is never brought,
          nor they to that; but to all Christ’s spiritual seed and offspring, to
          whom he stands a federal head; which is the sense of the passages of
          scripture referred to, and serves no ways to strengthen the cause of
          infant baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third argument runs thus: "The seed of believers are to be
          baptized into the same covenant with themselves; seeing infants, while
          infants, as ha-aural parts of their parents, are included in the same
          threatenings, which are denounced against wicked parents, and in the
          same promises as are made to godly parents, being branches of one
          root" (Rom11:16; Deut 4:37; Deut 4:40; Deut 28:1-4; Deut 30:6; Deut
          30:19; Ps 102:28; Prov 11:21; Prov 20:7; Jer 32:38-39; Ex 20:5; Ex
          34:7; Deut 28:15; Deut 28:18; Deut 28:45-46; Ps 21:10; Ps 19:9-10; Isa
          14:20-21; Jer 22:28; Jer 36:31). Here let it be observed,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. that it is pleaded that infants should be baptized into the same
          covenant with their parents, meaning no doubt the covenant of grace;
          that is, should by baptism be brought into the covenant as it is
          expressed in Argument 7th, or else I know not what is meant by being
          baptized into the same covenant; and yet in the preceding argument it
          is urged, that the covenant of grace belongs to the infants of
          believers, that is, they are in it, and therefore are to be baptized:
          an instance this of the glaring contradiction before observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Threatenings indeed are made to wicked parents and their children,
          partly to shew the heinousness of their sins, and to deter them from
          them; and partly to express God’s hatred of sin, and his punitive
          justice; and also to point out original sin and the corruption of
          nature in infants, and what they must expect when grown up if they
          follow the examples of their parents, and commit the same or like
          sins; but what is all this to infant-baptism; Why,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In like manner promises are made to godly parents and their
          children, and several passages are referred to in proof of it; some of
          these are of a temporal nature, and are designed to stir up and
          encourage good men to the discharge of their duty, and have no manner
          of regard to any spiritual or religious privilege; and such as are of
          a spiritual nature, which respect conversion, sanctification, etc.
          when these take place on the seed of believers, then, and not till
          then, do they appear to have any right to Gospel-ordinances, such as
          baptism and the Lord’s supper; wherefore the argument from promises to
          such privileges, before the things promised are bestowed, is of no
          force.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourth argument is much of the same kind with the foregoing,
          namely, "There are many examples recorded in scripture wherein the
          infants of ungodly men are involved with their parents in heavy
          judgments; therefore as the judgment and curse which belong to the
          wicked, belong also to their seed, so the privileges of the faints
          belong also to their offspring, unless they reject the God of their
          fathers. The justice and wrath of God, is not more extensive to
          destroy the offspring of the wicked, than his grace and mercy is to
          fare those of the faithful; therefore baptism, the sign of the
          promises of God’s mercy, is not to be denied to such infants" (Num
          14:33; 2 Kin 5:27; Jos 7:24-25; Jer 22:28). The answer given to the
          former may suffice for this: to which may be added,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the inflicting judgments on the children of some wicked men,
          is an instance of the sovereign justice of God; and his bellowing
          privileges on the children of some good men, is an instance of his
          sovereign grace, who punishes whom he will, and has mercy on whom he
          will: for,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God does not always proceed in this method; he sometimes bellows
          the blessings of his grace on the children of the wicked, and inflicts
          deserved punishment on the children of good men; the seed of the
          wicked do not always inherit their curses, nor the seed of the godly
          their blessings; wherefore such dispensations of God can be no rule of
          conduct to us; and particularly with respect to baptism. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Whatsoever privileges belong to the seed of believers, we are very
          desirous they should enjoy; nor would we deprive them of any; let it
          be shewn that baptism belongs to them as ruth (compassion, ed.), and
          we will by no means deny it to them. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Whereas it is said that the privileges of faints belong to their
          offspring, adding this exceptive clause, "unless they reject the God
          of their fathers;" it seems most proper, prudent and advisable,
          particularly in the care before us, to wait and see whether they will
          receive or reject, follow or depart from the God of their fathers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fifth argument is formed thus: "The children of believers are to
          be baptized now, as those of the Jews were circumcised formerly; for
          circumcision was then the real of the covenant, as baptism is now,
          which Christ has appointed in lieu thereof. Abraham and his son
          Ishmael, and all that were born in his house, were circumcised the
          same day; and God commanded all Israel to bring their children into
          the covenant with them, to give them the real of it, and circumcise
          them" (Gen 17:1-27; Deut 29:10-12; Col 2:11-12). To all which I reply,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. that circumcision was no real of the covenant of grace; if it was,
          the covenant of grace from Adam to Abraham was without a real. It is
          called a sign in Gen 17:1-27 : the passage referred to, but not a
          real: it is indeed in Rom4:11 said to be a seal of the righteousness
          of the faith, not to infants, not to Abraham’s natural seed, only to
          himself; assuring him, that he should be the father of many nations,
          in a spiritual sense, and that the righteousness of faith he had,
          should come upon the Gentiles: wherefore this mark or sign continued
          until the gospel, in which the righteousness of God is revealed from
          faith to faith, was preached unto the Gentiles, and received by them;
          to which may be added, that there were many living who were interested
          in the covenant of grace, when circumcision was appointed, and yet it
          was not ordered to them; as it would have been, had it been a seal of
          that covenant; and on the other hand, it was enjoined such who had no
          interest in the covenant of grace, and to whom it could not be a real
          of it, as Ishmael, Esau, and others. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. it has been shewn already, that baptism is no seal of the said
          covenant. Nor,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. is it appointed by Christ in lieu of circumcision, nor does it
          succeed it; there is no agreement between them in their subjects, use,
          and manner of administration; and what most clearly shews that baptism
          did not come in the room of circumcision, is, that it was in force and
          use before circumcision was abolished; which was not till the death of
          Christ; whereas, years before that, multitudes were baptized, and our
          Lord himself; and there-tore it being in force before the other was
          out of date, cannot with any propriety be said to succeed it. This
          writer, p. 28. has advanced several things to prove that baptism came
          in the room of circumcision.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st, He argues from the Lord’s supper being instead of the paschal
          lamb, that therefore baptism must be in the room of circumcision,
          which is ceased; or else there must be a deficiency. But it does not
          appear that the Lord’s supper is in the room of the passover; it
          followed that indeed, in the institution and celebration of it by
          Christ, but it was not instituted by him to answer the like purposes
          as the passover; nor are the same persons admitted to the one as the
          other; and besides, was the Lord’s supper in the room of the passover,
          it does not follow from thence that baptism must be in the room of
          circumcision: but then it is said there will be a deficiency; a
          deficiency of what? all those ceremonial rites, the passover and
          circumcision, with many others, pointed at thrift, and have had their
          fulfillment in him; he is come, and is the body and substance of them;
          and therefore there can be no deficiency, since he is in the room of
          them, and is the fulfilling end of them: nor can any other but he,
          with any propriety, be said to come in the room of them. And there can
          be no deficiency of grace, since he is full of it, nor of ordinances,
          for he has appointed as many as he thought fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          2dly, This author urges, that it is proper there should be two
          sacraments under the gospel, as there were two under the law, one for
          adult persons, the other for their children, as were the paschal lamb
          and circumcision. But if every thing that was typical of Christ, as
          those two were, were sacraments, it might as well be said there were
          two and twenty sacraments under the law, as two; and, according to
          this way of reasoning, there should be as many under the gospel.
          Moreover, of these two, one was not for adult persons only, and the
          other for their children; for they were, each of them, both for adult
          persons and children too; they that partook of the one had a right to
          the other; all that were circumcised might eat of the passover, and
          none but they; and if this is a rule and direction to us now, if
          infants have a right to baptism, they ought to be admitted to the
          Lord’s supper.
        </p>
        <p>
          3dly, Baptism, he says, is appointed for a like end as circumcision;
          namely, for the admission of persons into the church, which is not
          true; circumcision was appointed for another end, and not for that:
          the Jewish church was national, and as loon as an infant was born, it
          was a member of it, even before circumcision; and therefore it could
          not be admitted by it; nor is baptism for any such end, nor are
          persons admitted into a visible church of Christ by it; they may be
          baptized, and yet not members of a church: what church was the eunuch
          admitted into, or did he become a member of, by his baptism?
        </p>
        <p>
          4thly, This writer affirms, that "the holy Spirit calls baptism
          circumcision, that is, the circumcision made without hands, having the
          same spiritual design; and is termed the Christian circumcision, or
          that of Christ; it answering to circumcision, and being ordained by
          Christ in the room of it." To say that baptism is ordained by Christ
          in the room of circumcision, is begging the question, nor is there any
          thing in it that answers to circumcision, nor is it called the
          circumcision of Christ, in Col 2:11, which I suppose is the place
          referred to; for not that, but internal circumcision, the circumcision
          of the heart is meant, which Christ by his Spirit is the author of,
          and therefore called his; and the same is the circumcision made
          without hands, in opposition to circumcision in the flesh; it being by
          the powerful and efficacious grace of God, without the assistance of
          men; nor can baptism with any shew of reason, or appearance of truth,
          be so called, since that is made with the hands of men; and therefore
          can never be the circumcision there meant.
        </p>
        <p>
          5thly, He infers that baptism is appointed in the room of
          circumcision, from their signifying like things, as Original
          corruption, regeneration, or the circumcision of the heart (Deut 30:6;
          Titus 3:5), being seals of the covenant of grace (Ezek 16:21; Mat
          16:26), initiating ordinances, and alike laying men under an
          obligation to put off the body of sin, and walk in newness of life
          (Rom4:11) and also being marks of distinction between church-members
          and others (Rom6:4; Rom6:6). But baptism and circumcision do not
          signify the like things; baptism signifies the sufferings, death,
          burial, and resurrection of Christ, which circumcision did not; nor
          does baptism signify original corruption, which it takes not away; nor
          regeneration, which it does not give, but pre-requires it; nor is
          baptism meant in the passage referred to, Titus 3:5, nor are either of
          them seals of the covenant of grace, as has been shewn already; nor
          initiating ordinances, or what enter persons into a church-state:
          Jewish infants were church-members, before they were circumcised; and
          persons may be baptized, and yet not be members of churches; and
          whatever obligations the one and the other may lay men under to live
          in newness of life, this can be no proof of the one coming in the room
          of the other. Circumcision was indeed a mark of distinction between
          the natural seed of Abraham and others; and baptism is a
          distinguishing badge, to be wore by those that believe in Christ, and
          put him on, and are his spiritual seed; but neither of them
          distinguish church-members from others; the passages referred to are
          impertinent. But I proceed to consider—
        </p>
        <p>
          The sixth argument in favor of infant-baptism, taken from "the
          sameness of the covenant of grace made with Jews and Gentiles, of
          which circumcision was the seal; from the seal and dispensation of
          which, the Jews and their children are cut off, and the Gentiles and
          their seed are engrafted in" (Gal 3:14; Acts 15:11; Rom4:11; Rom11:15;
          Rom11:17). In answer to which, let it be observed,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the covenant of grace is indeed the same in one age, and under
          one dispensation, as another; or as made with one sort of people as
          another, whether Jews or Gentiles; the same blessings of it that came
          upon Abraham, come upon all believers, Jews or Gentiles; and the one
          are saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, as the other; but
          then,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The covenant of grace was not made with Abraham and his natural
          seed, or with all the Jews as such; nor is it made with Gentiles and
          their natural seed as such; but with Christ and his spiritual seed,
          and with them only, be they of what nation., or live they in what age
          they will.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Circumcision was no seal of the covenant of grace, nor does
          Rom4:11. prove it, as has been shewn already; and therefore nothing
          can be inferred from hence with respect to baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The root or stock from whence the unbelieving Jews were cut off,
          and into which the believing Gentiles are engrafted, is not the
          covenant of grace, from which those who are interested in it can never
          be cut off; but the gospel church-state, from which the unbelieving
          Jews were rejected and left out, and the believing Gentiles took in,
          who partook of all the privileges of it (Rom11:17-25): though no
          mention is made throughout the whole of the passage of the children of
          either; only of some being broken off through unbelief, and others
          standing by faith; and therefore can be of no service in the cause of
          infant-baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seventh argument is taken from "the extent of the covenant of
          grace being the same under the New Testament, as before the coming of
          Christ, who came not to curtail the covenant, and render worse the
          condition of infants; if they were in the covenant before, they are so
          now; no spiritual privilege given to children or others can be made
          void" (Rom11:29; Jer 30:20). To which may be replied,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the extent of the covenant, as to the constitution of it, and
          persons interested in it, is always the same, having neither more nor
          fewer; but with respect to the application of it, it extends to more
          persons at one time than at another; and is more extensive under the
          gospel-dispensation than before; it being applied to Gentiles as well
          as Jews: and with respect to the blessings and privileges of it, they
          are always the same, are never curtailed or made void, or taken away
          from those to whom they belong; which are all Christ’s spiritual seed,
          and none else, be they Jews or Gentiles. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It should be proved that the infant-seed of believers, or their
          natural seed as such, were ever in the covenant of grace; or that any
          spiritual privileges were given to them as such; or it is impertinent
          to talk of curtailing the covenant, or taking away the privileges of
          the seed of believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If even their covenant-interest could be proved, which it cannot,
          that gives no right to any ordinance, or to a positive institution,
          without a divine direction; there were many who were interested in the
          covenant of grace, when circumcision was appointed, who yet had
          nothing to do with that ordinance.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. baptism not being allowed to infants, does not make their condition
          worse than it was under the former dispensation; for as then
          circumcision could not save them, so neither would baptism, were it
          administered to them; nor was circumcision really a privilege, but the
          reverse; and therefore the abrogation of it, without substituting any
          thing in its room, does not make the condition of infants the worse;
          and certain it is, that the condition of the infants of believing
          Gentiles, even though baptism is denied them, is much better than that
          of the infants of Gentiles before the coming of Christ; yea, even of
          the infants of Jews themselves; since they are born of Christian
          parents, and so have a Christian education, and the opportunity and
          advantage of hearing the gospel preached, as they grow up, with
          greater clearness, and in every place[3] where they are. The text in
          Rom11:29 regards not external privileges, but internal grace; that in
          Jer 30:20 respects not infants, but the posterity of the Jews; adult
          persons in the latter day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eighth argument is taken from the everlastingness of the covenant
          of grace, and runs thus; "The example of Abraham and the Israelites in
          circumcising their children according to the command of God, should
          oblige us to baptize our children; because circumcision was then a
          real of the everlasting covenant, a covenant that was to last for
          ever, and not cease as the legal ceremonies; which God hath confirmed
          with an oath; and therefore can have suffered no alteration for the
          worse in any thing with respect to infants" (Gen 7:17; Heb 6:13; Heb
          6:18; Mic 7:18; Mic 7:20; Gal 3:8.) The answer to which is,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the covenant of grace is everlasting, will never cease, nor
          admit of any alteration, is certain; but the covenant of circumcision,
          which is called an everlasting covenant, Gen 17:7, was only to
          continue during the Mosaic dispensation, or unto the times of the
          Messiah; and is so called for the same reason, and just in the same
          sense as the covenant of the priesthood with Phinehas is called, the
          covenant of an everlasting Priesthood (Num 25:13). Though the covenant
          of grace is everlasting, and whatever is in that covenant, or ever
          was, will never be altered; yet it should be proved there is any thing
          in it with respect to infants, and particularly which lays any
          foundation for, or gives them any claim and right to baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Though circumcision was a sign and token of the covenant made with
          Abraham, and his natural seed, it never was any real of the covenant
          of grace. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The example of Abraham and others, in circumcising their children
          according to the command of God, lays no obligation upon us to baptize
          ours, unless we had a command for their baptism, as they had for their
          circumcision.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ninth argument is formed thus: "baptism is to be administered to
          the seed of believers, because it is certainly very dangerous and
          blameworthy, to neglect and despise a valuable privilege appointed by
          God from the beginning, to the offspring of his people."
        </p>
        <p>
          But it must be denied, and should be proved, that baptism is a
          privilege appointed by God from the beginning, to the offspring of his
          people; let it be shewn, if it can, when and where it was appointed by
          him. This argument is illustrated and enforced by various
          observations; as that "that soul was to be cut off that neglected
          circumcision; and no just excuse can be given for neglecting
          infant-baptism, which is ordained to be the seal of the covenant
          instead of circumcision:" but we have seen already, that baptism does
          not come in the room of circumcision, nor is it a real of the covenant
          of grace; and there is good reason to be given for the neglect of
          infant-baptism, because it never was ordained and appointed of God.
          Moreover it is said, "that the seed of believers were formerly, under
          the Old Testament, in the covenant together with their parents; and no
          one is able to shew that they have been cast out under the New, or
          that their condition is worse, and their spiritual privileges less,
          under the gospel, than under the law:" but that believers with their
          natural seed as such, were together in the covenant of grace under the
          Old Testament, mould not be barely affirmed, but proved, before we are
          put upon to shew that they are cast out under the New; though this
          writer himself, before in the sixth argument, talks of the Jews and
          their children being cut off from the real and dispensation of the
          covenant; which can never be true of the covenant of grace; nor do we
          think that the condition of infants is worse, or their privileges less
          now, than they were before, though baptism is denied them, as has been
          observed already. It is further urged, that "it is not to be imagined,
          without presumption, that Christ ever intended to "cut them off from
          an ordinance, which God had given them a right unto;" nor do we
          imagine any such thing; nor can it be proved that God ever gave the
          ordinance of baptism to them. As for what this writer further
          observes, that had Christ took away circumcision, without ordaining
          baptism in the room of it, for the children of believers; the Jews
          would have cried out against it as an excommunication of their
          children; and would have been a greater objection against him than any
          other; and would now be a hindrance of their conversion; and who, if
          they were converted, would have baptism or circumcision to be a seal
          of the covenant with them and their children, it deserves no answer;
          since the clamors, outcries, and objections of the Jews, and their
          practice on their legal principles, would be no rule of direction to
          us, were they made and gave into, since they would be without reason
          and truth; for though Christ came not to destroy the moral law, but to
          fulfill it (Mat 5:17); yet he came to put an end to the ceremonial
          law, of which circumcision is a part, and did put an end to it[4]: the
          text in Jer 30:20 respects the restoration of the Jews in the latter
          day, but not their old ecclesiastical polity, which shall not be
          established again, but their civil liberties and privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tenth argument stands thus: "Children are to be baptized under the
          covenant of grace, because all the covenants which God ever made with
          men were made not only with them, but also with their children;" and
          instances are given in Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Levi,
          Phinehas, and David. The covenant of works was indeed made with Adam
          and his seed, in which covenant he was a federal head to his
          offspring; but the covenant of grace was not made with him and his
          seed, he was no federal head in that; nor is that made with all
          mankind, as it must, if it had been made with Adam and his seed: this
          is an instance against the argument, and shews that all the covenants
          that ever God made with men, were not made with them and their seed;
          for certainly the covenant of grace was made with Adam, and made known
          to him (Gen 17:19-21), and yet not with his seed with him; nor can any
          instance be given of the covenant of grace being made with any man,
          and his natural seed. There was a covenant made with Noah and his
          posterity, securing them from a future deluge, but not a covenant of
          grace securing them from everlasting destruction; for then it must
          have been made with all mankind, since all are the posterity of Noah;
          and where then is the distinction of the seed of believers and of
          unbelievers? Besides Ham, one of Noah’s immediate offspring, was not
          interested in the covenant of grace. As for the covenant made with
          Abraham, his son Ishmael was excluded from it"; and of Isaac’s two
          sons one of them was rejected (Rom9:10-13) and all were not Israel
          that were of Israel, or of Jacob, Gen 17:6. The covenant of the
          priesthood was indeed made with Levi and Phinehas, and their
          posterity; and though it is called an everlasting one, it is now made
          void; nor is there any other in its room with the ministers of the
          word and their posterity; and yet no outcry is made of the children of
          gospel-ministers being in a worse condition, and their privileges less
          than those of the priests and Levites: and as for David, the sad
          estate of his family, and the wicked behavior of most of his children,
          shew, that the covenant of grace was not made with him and his natural
          offspring; and whatever covenants those were that were made with there
          persons, they furnish out no argument proving the covenant of grace to
          be made with believers and their carnal seed, and still less any
          argument in favor of infant-baptism.[5]
        </p>
        <p>
          The eleventh argument is: "The seed of believers ought to be baptized
          under the covenant of grace, otherwise they would be reckoned pagans,
          and the offspring of infidels and idolaters, to whom there is neither
          a promise nor any sign of hope; whereas the scripture makes a
          difference, calling them holy on account of their relation to the holy
          covenant, when either their father or mother believe (1Cor 7:14),
          disciples (Acts 15:10); reckoning them among them that believe,
          because of their relation to the household of faith (Mat 18:6) styling
          them the seed of the blessed, and their offspring with them (Isa.
          115:23); accounting them for a generation to the Lord (Ps 22:30) as
          David says; who, Ps 22:10 observes, that God was his God from his
          mother’s belly; and also calling them the children of God (Ezek
          16:20-21); therefore they ought to be dedicated to him by that
          ordinance which he has appointed for that purpose." To all which may
          be replied,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the children of believers are by nature children of wrath even
          as others; and are no better than others; and were they baptized, they
          would not be at all the better Christians for it. Though,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It will be allowed that there is a difference between the offspring
          of believers, and those of infidels, pagans and idolaters; and the
          former have abundantly the advantage of the latter, as they have a
          Christian education; and consequently as they are brought up under the
          means of grace, there is hope of them; and it may be expected that the
          promise of God to such who use the means will be accomplished. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. the characters mentioned either do not belong to children, or not
          for the reason given; and those that do, do not furnish out an
          argument for their baptism. Children are said to be holy, born in
          lawful wedlock (1Cor 7:14); not on account of their relation to the
          holy covenant, but on account of the holiness of a believing parent,
          which surely cannot be a federal holiness, but a matrimonial one; the
          marriage of a believer with an unbeliever being valid, or otherwise
          their children muff be unclean or illegitimate, and not holy or
          legitimate. The disciples in Acts 15:10 are not young children, but
          adult persons, the converted Gentiles, on whom the false teachers
          would have put the yoke of the ceremonial law, and particularly
          circumcision. The little ones reckoned among those that believe in
          Christ, Mat 18:6 were not infants in age, but the apostles of our
          Lord, who were little in their own account, and in the account of
          others, whom to offend was criminal, highly provoking to Christ, and
          of dangerous consequence. The text, Isa 65:23, speaks of the spiritual
          seed of the church, and not the carnal seed of believers,[6] and
          therefore are the same who are accounted to the Lord for a generation;
          even a spiritual seed that shall serve him, Ps 22:30 and the words in
          verse 10 are the words, not of David, but of Christ. And the sons and
          daughters born to God, and whom he calls his children, Ezek 16:20-21
          were so, not by grace or by covenant, but by creation. And from the
          whole there is not the least reason why the children of believers
          should be dedicated to God by baptism, which is an ordinance that
          never was appointed by him for any such purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The twelfth argument is: "The seed of believers are to be baptized,
          because church-relation belongs to them, as citizenship belongs to the
          children of freemen; and it is by baptism that they are first admitted
          into the visible church, and there is neither covenant nor promise of
          salvation out of the church, for the church of Christ is his kingdom
          on earth, and Christ says this belongs to the children" (Mk 10:13-14).
          In answer to which.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. There is a manifest contradiction in the argument. Church-relation
          belongs to infants, that is, they are related to the church, and
          members of it, and therefore should be baptized; and yet they are
          first admitted into the church by baptism; what a contradiction this!
          in it, and out of it, related, and not related to it, at one and the
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Church-membership does not pass from father to son, nor is it by
          birth, as citizenship, or the freedom of cities; the one is a civil,
          the other an ecclesiastical affair; the one is of nature, the other of
          grace; natural birth gives a right to the one, but the spiritual birth
          or regeneration only entitles to the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Church-membership gives no right to baptism, but rather baptism to
          church-membership, or however is a qualification requisite to it;
          persons ought to be baptized before they are church-members; and if
          they are church members, and not regenerate persons and believers in
          Christ, for such may be in a church, they have no right to baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. To talk of there being no covenant or promise of salvation out of
          the church, smells rank of popery. The covenant and promise of
          salvation are not made with and to persons as members of churches, or
          as in a visible church-state, but with and to the elect of God in
          Christ, and with persons only considered in him; who have an interest
          in the covenant and promise of salvation, though they may not be in a
          visible church-state; and doubtless many are saved who never were
          members of a visible church.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The kingdom of God, in Mk 10:13-14 be it the church of Christ on
          earth, or eternal glory in heaven, only belongs to such persons who
          are like to little children for their meekness and humility, and
          freedom from malice and rancor, as Mk 10:15 shows.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Could infants in age, or the seed of believers as such be here
          meant, and the kingdom of God be understood of Christ’s visible
          church, and they as belonging to it, it would prove more than this
          writer chooses; namely, that they have a right to all
          church-privileges, and particularly and especially to the Lord’s
          supper.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thirteenth argument is: "Children are the lambs of Christ’s flock
          and sheep; and the lambs ought not to be kept out of Christ’s fold,
          nor hindered from the washing that is in his blood; he particularly
          promises to be their shepherd; and his Spirit has declared, that
          little children should be brought to him under the gospel, in the
          arms, and on the shoulders of their parents" (Isa 40:11; Isa 49:22;
          Song 6:6; Jn 21:15). On which may be observed,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That there is indeed mention made of the lambs of Christ in Isa
          40:11 and Jn 21:15 which he gathers in his arms, and ordered Peter to
          feed; yet not infants in age are intended in either place, but adult
          persons, weak believers, who, in comparison of others, because of
          their small degree of knowledge and strength, are called lambs; and
          are to be gently and tenderly dealt with; and such as these are not
          kept out of Christ’s fold, but are received into it, though weak in
          the faith, but not to doubtful disputations; and are fed with
          knowledge and understanding, which infants in age are not capable of.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The infant-seed of believers are no where called the sheep of
          Christ, nor has he promised to be the shepherd of them; let the
          passages be directed to, if it can be, where this is said.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Those who are truly the lambs and sheep of Christ, am not hindered
          from the washing of his blood; though that is not to be done, nor is
          it done by baptism; persons may be washed with water, as Simon Magus,
          and yet not warned in the blood of Christ: Song 6:6 does not intend
          washing in either sense; but either the regenerating grace of the
          spirit, or the purity of conversation, and respects not infants at
          all.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Nor is it declared by the Spirit of God, that parents should bring
          their children to Christ in their arms, and on their shoulders; the
          passage in Isa 49:22 brought in support of it, speaks of the spiritual
          seed of the church, and not of the carnal seed of believers; and of
          their being brought, not in the arms and on the shoulders of their
          natural parents, but of the Gentiles; and not to Christ, but to the
          church, through the ministry of the word in the latter day, in which
          the Gentiles would be very assisting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourteenth argument runs thus: "The seed of the faithful ought to
          be baptized, because they were partakers of all the former baptisms
          mentioned in scripture, as the children of Noah in the ark (1 Pet
          3:20); the Israelites at the Red Sea, and in the cloud (1Cor 10:1-2;
          Ex 12:37); Several children were baptized with the baptism of the
          Spirit, for several were filled with the holy Ghost from their
          mother’s womb; all the children of Bethlehem under two years old, with
          the baptism of martyrdom (Mat 2:1); and many children with John’s
          baptism, since he baptized the whole country." But,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It unhappily falls out, for the cause of infant-baptism, that
          Noah’s children in the ark were all adult and married persons (Gen
          7:7).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That there were children among the Israelites when they were
          baptized in the cloud, and in the sea, is not denied; but then it
          should be observed, that they did all eat the same spiritual meat, and
          did all drink the same spiritual drink; and therefore, if this does
          not give a sufficient claim to infants to partake of the Lord’s
          supper, neither will the other prove their right to baptism: moreover,
          if any arguments can be formed from this and the former instance, for
          the administration of baptism under the New Testament, they will
          clearly shew, that it ought to be administered by immersion; for, as
          in the former, when the fountains of the great deep were broke up
          under them, and the windows of heaven were opened over them, they were
          as persons immersed in water; so when the waters of the Red Sea stood
          up on each side, and the cloud was over the Israelites, they were, as
          it were overwhelmed in water.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Though this writer says, that several children were filled with the
          holy Ghost from their mother’s womb, yet we read but of one that was
          so, John the Baptist, a very extraordinary person, and extraordinarily
          qualified for extraordinary work, an instance not to be mentioned in
          ordinary cases; betides, it is a rule in logic, a particulari ad
          univer-salem non valet consequentia, "from a particular to an
          universal, the consequence is not conclusive." Moreover, in what sense
          John was filled with the holy Ghost so early, is not easy to say; and
          be it what it will, the same cannot be proved of the seed of believers
          in general; and could it, it would give no right to baptism, without a
          positive institution; it gave no right to John himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. That the infants at Bethlehem were murdered, will be granted, but
          that they suffered martyrdom for Christ, will not easily be proved;
          since they knew nothing of the matter, and were not conscious on what
          account their lives were taken away.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. That many or any children were baptized with John’s baptism we
          deny, and call upon this writer to prove it, and even to give us one
          tingle instance of it; what he suggests is no evidence of it, as that
          the whole country in general were baptized by him, who could not be
          all childless; but I hope he does not think, that every individual
          person in the country of Judea was baptized by John; it is certain,
          that there were many even adult persons that were refused by him, and
          such as were baptized by him, were such as confessed their sins, which
          infants could not do (Mat 3:5-7) and as to the probability of the
          displeasure of Jewish parents, suggested if their children had not
          been baptized by John, since they were used, and under a command of
          God, to bring their children to the covenant and ordinances of God
          (Gen 17:1-27; Deut 29:10; Deut 29:13; Joel 2:16), it deserves no
          regard, since whatever probability there was of their displeasure,
          though I see none, there could be no just ground for it; since in the
          instances given, they had the command of God for what they did, for
          this they had none.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fifteenth argument is: "It is contrary to the apostle’s practice,
          to leave any unbaptized in Christian families; for they baptized whole
          families when the heads of them believed; as the families of Lydia,
          the Jailor, and Stephanas; and it is evident, that the words, family
          and household, in scripture, mean chiefly children, sons, daughters,
          and little ones."[7]
        </p>
        <p>
          To which I reply, that whatever there words signify in some places of
          scripture, though in the passages mentioned they do not chiefly intend
          new-born infants, but grown persons; it should be proved, that there
          were infants in families and households that were baptized, and that
          there were baptized together with the head of the family; for it is
          certain, there are many families and households that have no little
          children in them; and as for those that are instanced in, it is not
          probable that there were any in them; and it is manifest, that such as
          were baptized, were adult persons and believers in Christ. It is not
          evident in what station of life Lydia was, whether married or
          unmarried, and whether one had young children or not; and if one had,
          it is not likely they should be with her, when at a distance from her
          native place, and upon business; it is most probable, that those that
          were with her, called her household, were her servants, that assisted
          her in her business; and it is certain, that when the apostles entered
          her house, those that were there, and who doubtless are the same that
          were baptized, were called brethren, and such as were capable of being
          comforted (Acts 16:15; Acts 16:40) and the Jailor’s household were
          such as had the word of God spoken to them, and received it with joy,
          took pleasure in the company and conversation of the apostles, and
          believed in God together with him, and so were adult persons,
          believers, and very proper subjects of baptism (Acts 16:32-34).
          Stephanas is by some thought to be the same with the Jailor; but if he
          was another person, it is plain his household consisted of adult
          persons, men called by grace, and who were made use of in public work;
          they were the first-fruits of Achaia, and addicted themselves to the
          ministry of the saints.[8]
        </p>
        <p>
          The sixteenth argument is: "None that truly fear God, can seriously
          and with certainty say, that there were not many infants among the
          three thousand baptized by the apostles at once; for the Jews were not
          content with any ordinances without having their children with them.
          The apostle directs those who were at age to repent, but he commands
          every one of them to be baptized, and objects nothing against their
          children; because, as he says, the promise was unto them and their
          children also; and this is a plain command for infant-baptism to all
          that will judge impartially." But,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. A man that carefully reads the account of the baptism of the three
          thousand, having the fear of God before his eyes, may with the
          greatest seriousness and strongest assurance affirm, not only that
          there were not many infants, but that there were not one infant among
          the three thousand baptized by the apostles; for they were all of them
          such as were pricked to the heart, and cried out, Men and brethren
          what shall we do? they gladly received the word of the gospel, joined
          to the church, and continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine, in
          fellowship, and in breaking of bread and prayer; all which cannot be
          said of infants.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What this author suggests, agreeable to what he elsewhere says,
          that the Jews were not pleased with any ordinance unless they had
          their children with them, is without foundation; what discontent did
          they ever shew at a part of their children being left out of the
          ordinance of circumcision, and no other appointed for them in lieu of
          it? And had they been discontented, what argument can be formed from
          it?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The distinction between those that were of age, whom the apostle
          directed to repent, and the every one of them whom he commanded to be
          baptized, has no ground nor reason for it, yea is quite stupid and
          senseless; and even, according to this writer himself, is a
          distinction without any difference, since the every one to be baptized
          are supposed by him to have children, and so to be at age; since he
          adds, "and objects nothing against their children." And a clear case
          it is, that the self-same persons that were exhorted to be baptized,
          were exhorted to repent, and that as previous to their baptism; and
          therefore must be adult persons, for infants are not capable of
          repentance, and of giving evidence of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Those words, the promise is unto you and to your children, are so
          far from being a plain command for infant-baptism, that there is not a
          word of baptism in them, and much less of infant-baptism; nor do they
          regard intents, but the posterity of the Jews, who are often called
          children, though grown up, to whom the promise of the Messiah, and
          remission of sins by him, and the pouring out of the holy Ghost, was
          made; and are spoken for the encouragement of adult persons only, to
          repent and be baptized; and belong only to such as are called by
          grace, and to all truth, whether Jews or Gentiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seventeenth argument is: "The seed of believers should be
          baptized, be-cause the privileges and blessings which are signified
          and sealed in baptism are necessary to their salvation, and there is
          no salvation without them; namely, an interest in the covenant of
          grace, the remission of original sin,. union with Christ,
          sanctification of the holy Spirit, and regeneration, without which
          none can be saved" (Jn 3:5). The answer to which is,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the things indeed mentioned are necessary to salvation, and
          there can be none without them; but then baptism is not necessary to
          the enjoyment of these things, nor to salvation; a person may have an
          interest in these blessings, and be saved, though not baptized; there
          are things necessary to baptism, but baptism is not necessary to them;
          and indeed a person ought to have an interest in these, and appear to
          have one, before he is baptized. Wherefore,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. There things are not signified in baptism, and much less sealed by
          it; other things, such as the sufferings, death, and the resurrection
          of Christ, are signified in it; there, as regeneration, etc. are
          prerequisites unto baptism, and are not communicated by it, or sealed
          up to persons in it, who may be baptized, and yet have no share and
          lot in this matter, witness the care of Simon Magus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eighteenth argument is: "The children of the faithful ought to be
          baptized, because this lays them under strong obligation to shun the
          works of Satan; and many have received much benefit from hence in
          their youth. Comfortable symptoms, or signs of a work of grace, have
          appeared very early in several, though perhaps bad company has
          afterwards corrupted them. Betides infant-baptism keeps up a general
          profession of faith and religion, and makes the word and means of
          grace of more virtue and efficacy, than if men had utterly renounced
          Christianity, and declared themselves infidels; and further, it says a
          powerful obligation on their parents and others, to teach them their
          duty, which is a main end of all the ordinances God has instituted"
          (Ps 78:5-6). But,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Is there nothing betides baptism, that can lay persons under strong
          obligation to shun the works of the Devil? certainty there are many
          things: if so, then it is not absolutely necessary on this account;
          besides, though the baptism of adult persons does lay them under
          obligation to walk in newness of life (Rom6:4), yet the baptism of
          infants can lay them under no such obligation as infants, and while
          they are such, because they are not conscious of it, nor can it take
          any such effect upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What that much benefit or advantage is, that many have received
          from infant-baptism, I am at a loss to know, and even what is intended
          by this writer, unless it be what follows, that signs of a work of
          grace have appeared very early in several, which may be, and yet not
          to be ascribed to baptism; baptism has no such virtue and influence,
          as to produce a work of grace in the soul, or any signs of it;
          betides, a work of grace has appeared very early in several, and has
          been carried on in them, who have never been baptized at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Infant-baptism keeps up no public or general profession of faith or
          religion, since there is no profession of faith and religion made in
          it by the person baptized; nor is it of any avail to make the word and
          means of grace powerful and efficacious, which only become so by the
          Spirit and grace of God; and a wide difference there is between the
          diffuse of infant-baptism, and renouncing Christianity, and professing
          infidelity; these things are not necessarily connected together, nor
          do they go together; persons may deny and disuse infant-baptism, as it
          is well known many do, and yet not renounce the Christian faith, and
          declare themselves infidels.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Parents and others, without infant-baptism, are under strong
          obligations to teach children their duty to God and men, and therefore
          it is not necessary on that account.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nineteenth argument is: "The seed of believers are to be baptized,
          though they have not actual faith, since Christ speaks not of there
          but of adult persons, Mk 16:16. And certain it is they have as much
          fitness for baptism as for justification and eternal life, without
          which they must all perish; the Spirit of God knows how to work this
          tithers in them, as well as in grown persons: Jeremiah, John the
          Baptist, and several others, were sanctified from their mother’s womb"
          (Jn 3:8-9; Ecc 11:5; Lk 1:15; Lk 1:44; Jer 1:5; Isa 44:3; Ps 8:2). To
          which may be returned for answer,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That if the text in Mk 16:16 speaks not of infants, but of adult
          persons only, as it certainly does, I hope it will be allowed to be an
          instruction and direction for the baptism of adult believers, and to
          be a sufficient warrant for our practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If the infants of believers have no more fitness for baptism than
          they have for justification and eternal life, they have none at all,
          since they are by nature children of wrath, even as others; and
          therefore can have none, but what is given them by the Spirit and
          grace of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We dispute not the power of the Spirit of God, or what he is able
          to do by the operations of his grace upon the fouls of infants; we
          deny not but that he can and may work a work of grace upon their
          hearts, and clothe them with the righteousness of Christ, and so give
          them both a right and meetness for eternal life; but then this should
          appear previous to baptism; actual faith itself is not sufficient for
          baptism, without a profession of it; the man that has it ought to
          declare it to the satisfaction of the administrator, ere he admits him
          to the ordinance (Acts 8:36-37).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Of the several children said to be sanctified from their mother’s
          womb, no proof is given but of one, John the Baptist, who was filled
          with the holy Ghost from thence, which has been considered in the
          answer to the fourteenth argument; as for Jeremiah, it is only said of
          him that he was sanctified, that is, set apart, designed and ordained,
          in the purpose and counsel of God to be a prophet, before he was born;
          and is no proof of internal sanctification so early, Isa 44:3 speaks
          of the Spirit of God being poured down, not upon the carnal seed of
          believers, but upon the spiritual seed of the church; and Ps 8:2. is a
          prophecy, not of new-born infants, but of children grown up, crying
          Hosanna in the temple (Mat 21:15-16) no argument from a particular
          instance or two, were there more than there are, is of avail for the
          sanctification of infants in general; it should be proved, that all
          the infant-seed of believers are sanctified by the Spirit of God; for
          if some only, and not all, how shall it be known who they are? let it
          first appear that they are sanctified, and then it will be time enough
          to baptize them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The twentieth argument is: "The children of believers are to be
          baptized, because their right to the covenant and church of God is
          established from the first, much clearer than several other necessary
          ordinances; there is no express command nor example of women receiving
          the Lord’s supper; no particular command in the New Testament for
          family-worship, and for the observation of the first day of the week
          as a sabbath; and yet none dare call them in question; and there is no
          objection against infant-baptism, but the like might formerly have
          been made against circumcision; and may now be objected against many
          other ordinances and commands, of God." To which I reply,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That with respect to women, receiving the Lord’s supper, it is
          certain, that not only they were admitted to baptism (Acts 8:12), and
          became members of churches (Acts 1:14-15; Acts 4:37; Acts 5:9; Acts
          5:14; 1Cor 11:5-6; 1Cor 11:13; Acts 14:34, 35). but there is an
          express command for their receiving the Lord’s supper in 1Cor 11:29
          where a word is used of the common gender, and includes both men and
          women; who are both on in Christ, and in a gospel church-state, and
          have a right to the same ordinances (Gal 3:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As to family-worship, that is not peculiar to the New
          Testament-dispensation, as baptism is; it was common to the saints in
          all ages, and therefore needed no express command for it under the
          New; though what else but an express command for it is Eph 6:4? for
          can children be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,
          without family-worship?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As to the observation of the first day, though there is no express
          command for it, there are precedents of it; there are instances of
          keeping it (Jn 20:19; Jn 20:26; Acts 20:7; 1Cor 16:1-2): now, let like
          instances and examples of infant-baptism be produced if they can:
          though no express command can be pointed at, yet if any precedent or
          example of any one infant being baptized by John, or Christ, or his
          apostles, can be given, we should think ourselves obliged to follow
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. That the same objections might be made against circumcision
          formerly, as now against infant-baptism, is most notoriously false; it
          is objected, and that upon a good foundation, that there is neither
          precept nor precedent for infant-baptism in all the word of God; the
          same could never be objected against circumcision, since there was
          such an express command of it to Abraham, Gen 17:1-27, and so many
          instances of it are in the sacred writings; let the same be shewn for
          infant-baptism, and we have done.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. What the other ordinances and commands of God are, to which the
          same objections may be made as to infant-baptism, is not said, and
          therefore no reply can be made. I have nothing more to do, than to
          take some little notice of what this writer says, concerning the mode
          of administering the ordinance of baptism, page 33. We are no more
          fond of contentions and strifes about words, than this author, and
          those of the same way of thinking with himself can be; but surely,
          modestly to inquire into, and attempt to fix the true manner of
          administering an ordinance of Christ, according to the scriptures, and
          the instances of it; according to the signification of the words used
          to express it, and agreeable to the end and design of it; can never be
          looked upon as a piece of impertinence, or be traduced as cavil and
          wrangling. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          1st, Since this writer observes, that he does not find that either the
          sacred scripture or the church of England, have expressly determined,
          whether baptism is to be performed by plunging or sprinkling, but have
          left the one and the other indifferently to our choice; I hope he will
          not be displeased, that we choose the former, as most agreeable to the
          sacred writings, and the examples of baptism in them; as those of our
          Lord and others in Jordan (Mat 3:6; Mat 3:16) and in AEnon, where John
          was baptizing, because there was much water (Jn 3:23) and of the
          Eunuch (Acts 8:36-38) and as best representing the death, burial, and
          resurrection of Christ (Rom6:4; Col 2:12), as well as best suits with
          the primary sense of the Greek word, baptizw, which signifies to
          plunge or dip. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          2dly, Since, according to this writer, one mode is not more essential
          to the ordinance than another, but a reverential receiving of the
          sign; it may be asked, what of this nature, namely, a reverential
          receiving of the sign, the application of the water to the body,
          signifying the spiritual application of Christ and his gifts to the
          soul, can be observed in an infant when sprinkled, which is not
          conscious of what is done to it?
        </p>
        <p>
          3dly, Whereas, he says, "it is not improbable but the apostles
          baptized by sprinkling, since several were baptized in their houses,
          Acts 9:17-18 and Acts 16:33 and others, in former times, sick in their
          beds:" it may be replied, that it is not probable that the apostle
          Paul was baptized by sprinkling (Acts 9:17-18) since had he, he would
          have had no occasion to have arose in order to be baptized, as he is
          said to do, Acts 9:18. It is most probable, that when he arose off of
          his bed or chair, he went to a bath in Judas’s house; or out of the
          house, to a certain place fit for the administration of the ordinance
          by immersion; and since there was a pool in the prison, as Grotius
          thinks, where the Jailor washed the apostles’ stripes, it is most
          probable, that here he and his household were baptized; or since they
          were brought out of the prison, and after baptism brought into the
          Jailor’s house, Acts 9:33-34, it is most likely they went out to the
          river near the city where prayer was wont to be made, and there had
          the ordinance administered to them, Acts 9:13. As for the baptism of
          sick persons in their beds, this was not in the times of the apostles,
          but in after-times, when corruptions had got into the church; and so
          deserves no regard.
        </p>
        <p>
          4thly, In favor of sprinkling, or pouring water in baptism, he urges
          that "it is a sign of the pouring or sprinkling of the holy Ghost, and
          of the blood of Christ" (Ezek 36:25; Heb 12:24), but it should be
          observed, that baptism is not a sign or significative of the
          sprinkling of clean water, or the grace of the Spirit in regeneration,
          or of the blood of Christ on the conscience of a sinner, all which
          ought to precede baptism; but of the death, and burial, and
          resurrection of Christ; which cannot be represented in any other way
          than by covering a person in water, or an immersion of him.
