        <h2>The Ancient Mode of Baptizing 2</h2>
        <h2>CHAPTER 5</h2>
        <p>
          The fourth argument taken from Rom6:1-23 and Col 2:1-23 with the sense
          given of those scriptures, by Mr. B. W. considered.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Our next argument for baptism by immersion, which Mr. B. W. has
          thought fit to produce in page 24 and except against, is taken from
          Rom6:4 and Col 2:12 where this ordinance is took notice of by the
          apostle, as a burial, and as representing the burial and resurrection
          of Christ; which argument may be formed thus, and not in the loose
          rambling way, in which he has represented it, and which, no doubt, he
          thought would best answer his purpose; namely, "If the end and design
          of baptism are to represent the burial and resurrection of Christ,
          then it ought to be performed by plunging into, and overwhelming with
          water; but the end and design of baptism, are to represent the burial
          and resurrection of Christ, therefore it ought to be performed by
          plunging into, and overwhelming with water; the reason is, because no
          other mode of baptizing either by pouring or sprinkling a little water
          on the face, can answer this end." But let us attend to what Mr. B. W.
          has to except. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He seems to deny this to be the end and design of the institution
          of this ordinance, when he asks, "But did Christ ever institute
          baptism for any such end? As for the Lord's Supper, he hath said, Do
          this in remembrance of me; and it is plain from the word, that in the
          Lord's Supper we shew forth his death till he come: but where has he
          said, be plunged or baptized, to represent my burial or resurrection?"
          To which I answer, that though we have not the end of this institution
          declared, in so many express words, yet we think it may be fairly
          concluded from those texts now mentioned, and must continue to be of
          the same mind, for ought Mr. B. W. has advanced against it: Nor are we
          alone in our sentiments: For that Christ's burial and resurrection are
          represented by baptism, has been acknowledged by many, both ancient
          and modern divines, whose words I forbear to transcribe, partly
          because they have been many of them produced by others already, and
          partly because I would not fill my book with citations, and therefore
          shall only direct the reader to the reference in the margent.[10]
          Though Mr. B. W. is of opinion, that to infer this from those words,
          buried with him in baptism, is very absurd and inconclusive; and that
          "we may as well be hanged up against a tree, to represent Christ
          crucified, because it is said, that we are crucified with Christ." But
          can any mortal see this to be a parallel case? to say nothing how
          shocking this expression must be to every serious mind, and not to be
          borne with; no more than the wretched jargon which follows it, when he
          says, "and to make a fair end of you, be fore to see you dead under
          the earth or under the water;" which, I doubt not, to every impartial
          intelligent reader, will appear to have as little of argument as it
          has of sense in it. Besides, who does not see that all this, whatever
          he can mean by it, may be leveled as much against the ordinance of the
          Lord's-Supper, as that of Baptism. Moreover, there are other texts,
          besides these mentioned, which demonstrate the representation of
          Christ's resurrection, which supposes his burial to be the end of
          baptism; as for instance, 1 Pet 3:21 where baptism is said to save us,
          by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. But how does it do that, but by
          representing the resurrection, of Christ unto us, and thereby leading
          our faith to it, to behold our justification and discharge, by a risen
          Savior? To which I might also add, 1Cor 15:29 where the apostle
          evincing the truth of the resurrection of the dead, thus argues, else
          what shall they do, which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise
          not? that is, "Who are baptized into the faith of the resurrection of
          Christ, which is represented thereby, and which is the confirmation of
          our resurrection;" the thing that is there debated; and which, if not
          true, the apostle argues that their baptism, as well as their faith,
          and his preaching, was in vain. Besides, if our author removes this
          end of baptism, he ought to have substituted another, and have told us
          what was the end and design of it, which he has not done; for all the
          ordinances of the gospel are, no doubt, designed for the comfort and
          edification of believers, and the confirmation of their faith in the
          person of Christ; and seeing there appears nothing more manifestly to
          be the end of it, than what has been mentioned, we shall think fit to
          abide by it. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Our author asks, "What there is in your plunging that represents
          Christ's burial and resurrection;" and to shew that there is no
          agreement, he runs the parallel between them, and observes, that
          Christ was carried to his grave, where, being dead, he was buried, and
          lay there three days, and three nights, and that in the earth, where a
          great stone was rolled at the mouth of the sepulcher, and when he
          arose, it was by his own power, and thereby declared to be the Son of
          God: But as for us, we go ourselves into the water, are plunged alive,
          and that not three minutes, in water; and that our plunger dares not
          leave us, nor roll a stone upon us; and it is he that puts us in that
          pulls us out, and we are declared to be what we are: What would the
          man have us be declared to be, what we are not? and then in a taunting
          manner says, "and this is the representation and the mighty
          resemblance." These are some of our author's masterly strokes, and
          when the candor of the reader has supplied the want of sense in his
          expression, and charitably conjectured at his meaning, I need only
          reply, that the things instanced in are only circumstantial, and not
          essential to a burial, and therefore unnecessary to be represented in
          baptism; nay, it would have been absurd to have had them: It is enough
          that the things themselves are, namely, the burial and resurrection of
          Christ, which are sufficiently represented by an immersion into water,
          and an immersion out of it. But who does not see that a Quaker, or any
          other person that denies the ordinance of the Lord's-Supper, may argue
          after the same manner, and say, you say that this ordinance represents
          a crucified Christ, and shews forth his death and sufferings, but pray
          how does it appear? you take a loaf of bread, and break it in pieces,
          and a bottle of wine, and pour it out; but Christ, when. he was
          crucified, was hanged on a tree, his head was crowned with thorns, his
          hands and feet were pierced with nails, and his side with a spear; but
          here are no thorns, nails, or spear made use of by you, his real body
          was treated after this manner, but yours is only a loaf of bread; he
          poured out his blood, you only wine; "and this is the representation,
          and the mighty resemblance." And I think all this may be said with as
          much justness as the other. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Mr. B. W. has got another way of getting off the argument taken
          from these texts, in Rom6:3-4 and Col 2:12 and that is, by asserting
          that the baptism of Christ's sufferings, and not water-baptism, is
          intended in them. It would be endless, and perhaps our author will say
          needless, to oppose to him the several expositors and interpreters,
          who understand, by baptism, the ordinance of water-baptism, in those
          texts; as well as a large number of them who think the allusion is
          made to the ancient practice of baptizing by immersion; as Grotius,
          Vorsiius, Paraeus, Piscator, Diodate, and the Assembly of Divines on
          Rom6:4 and Zanchy and Davenant on Col 2:12. I suppose that Mr. B. W.
          will reply, that these are but men, and their judgment fallible; I
          hope he does not think that he is more than a man, or that his
          judgment is infallible; and it wilt scarcely be accounted modestly in
          him, to set himself upon a level with them: Though I confess that his
          sense of the words is not disagreeable to the analogy of faith, yet I
          wonder that he should be so positive as to say that this is the only
          meaning of them, as he does in page 31. As to what he says with
          respect to those texts, one of them being produced as an argument to
          promote holiness in believers, and the other to strengthen their faith
          in the doctrine of justification; I cannot see, but to understand them
          of water-baptism, suits very well with the scope thereof, however it
          is ridiculed by our author: For why may not our baptism, wherein we
          profess our faith in a buried Christ, and that we are dead by him to
          the law, the world, and particularly to sin, be urged and made use of
          by the spirit of God, as an argument why we should not live any longer
          therein. And are there no force, power and cogency in this argument?
          Again, in baptism we profess our faith in the resurrection of Christ,
          which is represented hereby, and that we are risen with him, and
          therefore are under the highest obligations, to walk in newness of
          life, as the apostle himself argues. Moreover, what can have a greater
          tendency to strengthen our faith in the doctrine of justification,
          than this ordinance has? by which it is led to see where our Lord lay,
          and how our sins were left in the grave by him; and he, as our
          glorious representative, rising again for our justification, by whom
          we are acquitted and discharged from all sin and condemnation; and is
          such a way of arguing from hence, to promote holiness, and strengthen
          us in the doctrine of justification, to be wondered at, what is meant
          by it? But to proceed,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Supposing that the baptism of Christ's sufferings is intended here,
          and that we are buried with him therein, as our head and
          representative, it must be allowed, that Christ's sufferings are
          called so, in allusion to water-baptism; and if we are said to be
          buried with him in them, it must be in allusion to a person's being
          buried in water in that ordinance, which cannot be by pouring or
          sprinkling of water upon him, but by an immersion into it. So that our
          argument for plunging, from hence, is like to lose nothing by this
          sense of the words. That Christ's sufferings are called a baptism, in
          Mat 20:22 and Lk 12:50, as also that by a Synechdoche, they are called
          the blood of his cross, is granted; but then the shedding of his blood
          was not the whole of Christ's sufferings, but a part only, and riffs
          is called the blood of sprinkling, not with regard to its being called
          a baptism; but because it is sprinkled upon a believer's conscience,
          and being so, speaks peace and pardon there; but when the greatness
          and multitude of Christ's sufferings are let forth, they are
          represented, not by a sprinkling of water, but by mighty floods of
          water, which overflowed him, so that he seemed, as it were, to be
          plunged into them, and overwhelmed with them; as he says, in Ps 69:2.
          I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me; where the
          Septuagint use the word katapontizw, as they do also in Ps 69:15 which
          Mr. B. W. in page 45 grants is very proper to express plunging by; and
          therefore no wonder then that his sufferings are compared to a
          baptism, and such an one as is administered by immersion: So that the
          argument from hence, notwithstanding all those cavils and exceptions,
          stands firm and unshaken. As to the argument taken from the
          universality of Christ's sufferings in every part of his body, which
          he makes his antagonist plead in page 32 he acknowledges it was never
          made use of by the greatest men of our persuasion, why then does he
          produce it? If every thing that has been dropt by weak Christians, in
          private conversation on the subject of infant-baptism, was published
          to the world, how silly and ridiculous would it appear?
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>CHAPTER 6</h2>
        <p>
          The fifth and last argument taken from the signification of the word
          baptizw, which always signifies to dip or plunge, with Mr. B. W’s.
          exceptions to it, considered.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          The fifth and last argument used by us, for immersion in baptism,
          taken from the constant signification of the word baptizw, baptizo, to
          dip or plunge, Mr. B. W. has thought fit to produce in page 33 and
          except against, which we hope, notwithstanding, to make good, however
          we may be represented by our author, as incapable of reading our
          mother tongue. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Mr. B. W. denies that baptw, bapto, and baptizw, baptizo, signify
          one and the same thing; but the reason he gives, is not a sufficient
          one, and that is, because the holy Ghost never makes use of the
          former, when this ordinance is expressed, but the latter; for the holy
          Ghost may make use of what words he pleases, without destroying the
          sense of others; and by the way, then it may be observed, that ranpzw,
          rantizo, and baptizw, baptizo, do not signify one and the same thing;
          because the holy Ghost never makes use of the former, when the
          ordinance is expressed, but the latter. Besides, all the
          Lexicographers that I have been able to consult, tell me, that baptw
          and baptizw do signify one and the same thing; for they render both by
          the very same words, and they are both promiscuously used by Greek
          authors: And indeed, why should not baptizw, baptizo, the derivative,
          signify the same as its primitive? what, is its signification lessened
          by the addition of a syllable to it? Dr Gale[11] has given instances
          enough of derivatives in zw, which signify the same with their
          primitives. And indeed, some have taken the word, under consideration,
          to be what grammarians call a frequentative, which signifies more than
          the derivative does. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It seems our author will scarcely allow baptw, bapto, to signify
          dip or plunge, and therefore puts it upon us to prove, that Judas,
          when he put his hand in the dish, thrust it all over in the sauce (Mat
          26:23), where the word embapyaV embapsas, is used; but he should have
          observed, that it was not his hand, but the sop in his hand, by a
          metonymy of the subject, as Piscator observes, which he dipt into the
          sauce, as he might have learned, by comparing the text with Jn 13:26.
          And in page 45 he says, "yea, with respect unto baptw itself, it is
          very evident that the Greeks did not directly mean plunging thereby;
          for when the Septuagint tell us in Dan 4:33 that Nebuchadnezzar’s body
          was wet with the dew of heaven, they make use of the very word;" and I
          would also add, very justly, it exactly answered to the Chaldee word
          צכטצי here used. which word always signifies to tinge or dip, as dyers
          dip their clothes in their vats, and so is expressive of what a
          condition Nebuchadnezzar’s body was in, he being as wet with the dew
          of heaven, as if he had been dipt or plunged all over in water. But
          enough of this; let us consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. How we are like to come off with the word baptizo, baptizo; And
          here our author in page 41 tells us, ore rotundo, and with confidence
          enough, in so many words, that "it never does signify plunging;
          washing with water by pouring or sprinkling, is the only meaning of
          it." The man has got a good assurance, but yet by his writing, he does
          not seem to have such a stock of learning; however what he wants in
          one, he makes up in the other. It is strange that all our
          Lexicographers, so many learned critics, and good divines, should be
          so much mistaken, as to render the word to dip or plunge, and allow
          this to be the proper signification of it. I have myself consulted
          several Lexicons, as those of Suidas, Scapula, Hadrian, Junius, Pasor,
          as also another made by Budaeus, Tusanus, Gesner, Junius, Constantine,
          Hartung, Hopper, and Xylander, who all unanimously render the word by
          mergo, immergo, to plunge or dip into: And though they afterwards add
          also, abluo, lava, to wash, yet it is plato they mean such a washing,
          as is by dipping; and we are very willing to grant it, for we know
          that there can be no dipping without washing: But had they meant a
          washing by pouring or sprinkling, they would have rendered it by
          persundo, or aspergo, to pour upon, or sprinkle; but this they never
          do. And, to there I might add a large number of learned critics, and
          good divines, who grant, that the word in its first and primary sense;
          signifies to dip or plunge only; and to wash only in a secondary,
          remote, and consequential one; as Casaubon, Camerarius, Grotius (Mat
          3:6), Calvin,[12] Alting,[13] Alsted,[14] Wendelin,[15] and others.
          But what need I heap up authors, to prove that which no man of any
          tolerable learning will deny: But what will not ignorance, attended
          with a considerable share of confidence, carry a man through? I might
          oppose to him, the use of the word in many Greek authors, but this has
          been done better already than I am capable of doing it, to which I
          refer him,[16] and shall content myself, with just mentioning that
          passage of Plutarch,[17] baptizwn onauton eiV qalasoan, which I think
          the author I have reference to, has took no notice of; and let him try
          how his sense of pouring or sprinkling will agree with it. I am flare
          it will found very harsh, to render the words pour or sprinkle thyself
          into the sea, but will read very well to be rendered thus, plunge
          thyself into the sea: But I suppose he will take this to be a breach
          of the first article agreed upon in this conference; but why the Greek
          authors should not be allowed as evidences, in the sense of a Greek
          word, I cannot see: I am sure this is not very consistent with right
          reason, which the thing in debate was to be cleared up from, as well
          as from the word of God. But let us consider the use of the word with,
          the Septuagint, which I suppose he will not except against, because he
          has himself brought it into the controversy. And there are but two
          places, which I have as yet met with, where the word is used by them,
          and the first is in 2 Kin 5:14 where it is said of Naaman the Syrian,
          that he went down, ki ebappzato, and baptized or dipped himself seven
          times in Jordan: I presume our author will not say, that this is to be
          understood of a washing, by pouring or sprinkling; especially, seeing
          it answers to the Hebrew word לבט, which always signifies to dip or
          plunge, and is the word, which is so often rendered by bapto, bapto,
          and which, by the way, proves there two to be of the same
          signification, seeing they are promiscuously used by them, to express
          one and the same word. The other place is in Isa 21:4 where what we
          read, fearfulness affrighted me, they render, k anomia me baptizei,
          iniquity hath plunged me; for to translate the words, iniquity hath
          washed, or poured, or sprinkled me, would be intolerable; but both the
          language and the sense are smooth and easy, by rendering them,
          iniquity hath plunged me; that is, into the depths of misery and
          distress; so that I am overwhelmed with horror and terror: And hereby
          also the sense of the Hebrew word תצב, here used, is very beautifully
          expressed. But let us now consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. What exceptions Mr. B. W. makes against this universal sense of the
          word, and there are three places in the New Testament which he opposes
          to it. The first is in Mk 7:4 And when they come from the market,
          except they wash, they eat not, and many other things there be, which
          they have received to hold, as the washing of cups and pots, brazen
          vessels, and of tables. Whereupon Mr. B. W. observes, that the words
          of the holy Ghost are, except they first baptize themselves; and many
          other such things they have, as the baptizing of tables. Excellent
          observations indeed! But how does this prove that the word signifies
          only a washing, by pouring or sprinkling? I believe it will appear,
          that this is meant of the washing of the whole body by dipping, which
          might be done, without their going into a pond or a river before they
          came home; for they had, no doubt, proper conveniences for immersion,
          when they came home, seeing bathing was in many cases required of the
          people, as well as of the priests; and to understand it of such a
          washing, seems better to express their superstitious solicitude to
          cleanse themselves from all impurity they might contract by converting
          with others in the market; it seems to be distinct from washing of
          hands in the former verse, where a different word is used. But
          supposing that washing of hands was intended here, does not every body
          know, that the usual manner of doing that, is not by pouring or
          sprinkling water upon them, but by putting them into it. And here I
          cannot but take notice of the observation of Beza[18] upon this text;
          baptizeqai, says he, in this place, is more than cerniptein; for the
          former seems to respect the whole body, the latter only the hands, nor
          does baptizein signify to wash, but only by consequence, for it
          properly denotes to immerse for the sake of dipping."
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the washing or baptizing of cups, pots, etc. it is well known
          that the cleansing of vessels, which were polluted by the falling of
          any dead creature that was unclean into them, was by putting into the
          water, end not by pouring or sprinkling water upon them. The express
          command in Lev 11:32, is, that it must be put into the water, or as
          the Septuagint render it bafmoetai, it must be dipt into water.
          Moreover, their superstitious washing of vessels, which our Lord seems
          here to mean, and justly reprehends, of which we read many things in
          their Misnah,[19] or oral law, their book of traditions, was performed
          this way, where they make use of the word לבט to express it by, which
          always signifies to dip or plunge. But what need I use many words to
          prove this, when every old woman could have informed him of the usual
          manner of washing their vessels, which is not by pouring or sprinkling
          water upon them, but by putting them into it: And if he asks, did the
          Jewish women wash their tables so? There appears no reason to conclude
          the contrary; and if he should say, how and where could they do it? I
          answer, in or near their own houses, where they had conveniences for
          bathing themselves, and washing their garments, at proper times,
          without carrying them to a river.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next place instanced in by him, is Heb 9:10. where the ceremonial
          law is said to stand only in meats and drinks, and divers washings; it
          is in the Greek text, in divers baptisms; and, says our author, "it is
          evident from the word of God, that those washings generally stood in
          pouring or sprinkling of water;" but that is a mistake of his, for
          they neither flood in them generally, nor particularly; for those
          ceremonial ablutions were always performed by bathing or dipping in
          water, and are called diaforio, divers, or different, not because they
          were performed different ways, as some by sprinkling, others by
          pouring, and others by plunging, but because of the different persons
          and things, the subjects thereof; as the priests, Levites, Israelites,
          vessels, garments, etc. And here it may not be atolls to observe what
          Maimonides,[20] who was one of the most learned of the Jewish writers,
          says concerning this matter, "Wherever, says he, the washing of the
          flesh or garments is mentioned in the law, it means nothing else than
          the washing of the whole body; for if a man washes himself all over,
          excepting the very tip of his little finger, he is still in his
          uncleanness." Nay, he says it is necessary that every hair of his head
          should be washed; and therefore the apostle might well call these
          washings, baptisms. The third and last instance produced by him, is
          1Cor 10:1-2, where the apostle says, that all our fathers were under
          the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all baptized unto
          Moses in the cloud, and in the sea; which when our author has
          mentioned, he very briskly arks, "Pray how were our fathers baptized
          there?" to which, I hope, we shall be capable of returning an answer,
          without appearing to be so bitterly graveled with this place, as he is
          pleased to make his friend say we are. As for the manner in which he
          represents some of our friends accounting for it; namely, that when
          the people of Israel passed through the Red sea, they had the waters
          stood up, both on their right hand, and on their left, and a cloud
          over them; so that there was a very great resemblance of a person's
          being baptized, or plunged under water. This, I say, is not so much to
          be despised, nor does it deserve so much ridicule and contempt, as he
          has pleased to cast upon it; and I believe will appear to any
          unprejudiced person, a much better way of accounting for it, than he
          is capable of giving, consistent with his way of administering the
          ordinance: Though I cannot but think that the Israelites were first
          baptized in the cloud, and then in the sea, according to the order of
          the apostle's words; and agreeable to the story in Ex 14:1-31 where we
          read, that the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind
          them, and was between the two camps, to keep off the Egyptians from
          the Israelites. I am therefore of opinion, with the learned
          Gataker,[21] that the cloud when it passed over them, let down a
          plentiful rain upon them, whereby they were in such a condition, as if
          they had been all over dipt in water; so that they were not only
          covered by it, but baptized in it: Therefore our author very
          improperly directs us to Ps 77:17, the clouds poured out water, as the
          better way of resolving the case; for the apostle does not say, that
          they were baptized in the clouds, but in the cloud which went before
          them, but now palling over them, in order to stand behind them, they
          were, as it were, immersed in it. But supporting that the text in Ps
          77:1-20 may be a direction in this case, and seem to explain what the
          apostle means by baptizing, it will no ways agree either with our
          author's sense of the word, nor his way of administering the ordnance:
          For, were the Israelites baptized under the clouds, by their pouring
          or sprinkling a small quantity of water upon their faces? the Hebrew
          word םרז here used, signifies an overflow, or an inundation of water:
          And Ainsworth reads it streamed down or gushed with a tempest; so that
          they were as persons overwhelmed, and plunged over head and ears in
          water; and therefore the apostle might well call it a being baptized.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now let us consider also, how they might be said to be baptized in
          the sea; and there are several things, in which the Israelites passage
          through the Red sea, resembled our baptism. As for instance, their
          following of Moses into it, which may be meant by their being baptized
          into him, was an acknowledgment of their regard unto him, as their
          Guide and Governor; as our baptism is a following of Christ as our
          Prophet, who has taught and led us the way; as well as a profession of
          our faith in him, as our Surety and Savior, and a subjection to him,
          as our King and Governor: Theirs was at their first entrance upon
          their journey to Canaan, as ours is, when, in a way of profession, we
          publicly begin our Christian race: They, when they came out of it,
          could ring and rejoice, in the view of all their enemies being
          destroyed; as the believer also can in this ordinance, in the view of
          all his sins being drowned in the sea of Christ's blood, withers the
          instances of the Eunuch and Jailor. But in nothing is there a greater
          resemblance between them, than in their descending into it, and coming
          up out of it; which is very much expressive of the mode of baptism by
          immersion. And this I choose to deliver in the words of the judicious
          Gataker.[22] "The descent, (that is, of the Israelites) says he, into
          the inmost and lowest parts of the sea, and their ascent out of it
          again upon dry land, hath a very great agreement with the rite of
          Christian baptism, as it was administered in the primitive times;
          seeing in baptizing they went down into the water, and came up again
          out of the same; of which descent and ascent express mention is made
          in the dipping of the Ethiopian Eunuch (Acts 8:38-39). Moreover, as in
          the Christian rite, when they were immersed, they were overwhelmed in
          water, and as it were buried; and in some measure, seemed to be buried
          together with Christ. And again, when they immersed, they seemed to
          rise, even as out of a grave, and to be risen with Christ (Rom6:4-5;
          Col 2:12). "So likewise, the waters of the sea standing up higher than
          the heads of those that passed through it, they might seem to be
          overwhelmed; and in some respects, to be buried therein, and to
          immerse and rise out again, when they came out safe on the other side
          of the shore." And having now considered all those exceptions, which
          our author has made against this sense of the word, which is contended
          for, I hope it will appear, that he has little reason to make that
          vain triumph he does, in page 38 where, he asks, "Where now is your
          baptizo, that signifies nothing else but plunging and overwhelming?"
          As for his comparing the passage of the Israelites through the Red
          sea, to his travelling to Scotland with the Irish Sea on his left
          hand, and the German on his right, and to his journeying to Cornwall,
          with the British channel at some distance from him, on his left hand,
          and the channel of Bristol on his right, I cannot see it can be of any
          service, unless it be to lay aside the Israelites’ passage through the
          sea as a miracle, and so furnish the atheist and deist with an
          argument, such an one as it is, for their purpose. As for his sneer
          upon plunging in it, I can easily forgive him, and pass it by, as well
          as that of the plunging of the Egyptians, with the same contempt in
          which he delivers them. Having thus considered his exceptions to those
          arguments produced for plunging, I shall in the next chapter take
          notice of his reasons against it.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>CHAPTER 7</h2>
        <p>Mr. B. W.’s reasons against plunging in baptism, considered.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Mr. B. W. in the next place, proceeds to give us some reasons in page
          43 why he is against the administration of the ordinance of baptism by
          plunging. And his
        </p>
        <p>
          First reason is, "because there is not any foundation for it in the
          word of God; no precept, no example, says he, no necessary
          consequence, no words nor found of words to favor it;" and a little
          lower, "There is not a word, he means of plunging, nor the shadow of a
          word; and therefore I think I have good reason against it." Words are
          the shadows, representations, and expressions of our minds; but what
          the shadow of a word is, I cannot devise, unless he means the least
          appearance of a word: as perhaps he may; and that I suppose is an
          initial letter of a word, or an abbreviation, etc. But the holy Ghost
          does not write in such a manner, and therefore we expect to find whole
          words, or none at all. But to proceed, does he want a precept? let him
          read Mat 28:19 or an example? let him take Christ for one (Mat 3:16),
          the Eunuch (Acts 8:38-39). And is no necessary consequence to be
          deduced from the places John and the apostles baptized in? nor from
          the circumstances which attended it, of going down and coming up out
          of the water? I hope it will appear to every thinking, and
          unprejudiced person, that it has been proved that not only the found
          of words, but the true sense of words favor it.
        </p>
        <p>
          His other reason is, "because it is not only without foundation in the
          word of God, but it is directly against it;" but how does that appear?
          Why, suppose some poor creatures, says he, upon a bed of languishing,
          under consumptions, catarrhs, pains, sores, and bruises, be converted,
          and that perhaps in the depth of winter, it is their duty to be
          baptized, that is true? but is it their duty to be plunged? no, to be
          sure; for the whole word of God commands self-preservation; and
          therefore it is evident, that plunging is against the commands of
          God."
        </p>
        <p>
          I suppose he takes it to be contrary to the sixth command; but if it
          is the duty of persons to be baptized, it is their duty to be plunged;
          for there is no true baptism without it? But what, in the depth of
          winter? why not? what damage is like to come by it? Our climate is not
          near so cold as Muscovy, where they always dip their infants in
          baptism, to this very day; as does also the Greek church in all parts
          of the world. But what, plunge persons when under consumptions,
          catarrhs, etc? why not? perhaps it may be of use to them for the
          restoration of health; and its being performed on a sacred account,
          can never be any hindrance to it. Whoever reads Sir John Floyer’s
          History of Cold-bathing, and the many cures that have been performed
          thereby, which he there relates, will never think that this is a
          sufficient objection against plunging in baptism; which learned
          physician has also of late published An Essay to restore the dipping
          of Infants in their Baptism; which he argues for, not only from the
          signification of baptism, and its theological end, but likewise from
          the medicinal use of dipping, for preventing and curing many
          distempers. If it may be useful for the health of tender infants, and
          is in many cases now made use of, it can never be prejudicial to grown
          persons: He argues from the liturgy and rubric of the church of
          England, which requires dipping in baptism, and only allows pouring of
          water in case of weakness, and never so much as granted a permission
          for sprinkling. He proves in this book, and more largely in his
          former, that the constant practice of the church of England, ever
          since the plantation of Christianity, was to dip or plunge in baptism;
          which he says continued after the reformation until King Edward the
          sixth's time and after. Nay, that its disuse has been within this
          hundred years: And here I cannot forbear mentioning a passage of his,
          to this purpose,[23] "Our fonts are built, says he, with a sufficient
          capacity for dipping of infants, and they have been so used for five
          hundred years in England, both Kings and Common people have been
          dipped; but now our fonts stand in our churches as monuments, to
          upbraid us with our change or neglect of our baptismal immersion." And
          I wish he had not reason to say as he does,[24] that sprinkling was
          first introduced by the Assembly of Divines, in 1643, by a vote of 25
          against 24, and established by an ordinance of parliament in 1644.
          Which complaint Mr. Wall[25] has taken up, who wrote the last in this
          controversy, having studied it for many years; and has fairly
          acknowledged, that immersion is the right mode of baptism; for which
          reason he calls upon his brethren, the clergy, to a reformation in it:
          As for those who would willingly conform to the liturgy, he says
          before them the difficulties they must expect to meet with; which,
          betides the general one of breaking an old custom, he mentions two
          more: The one is from those who are presbyterianly inclined, who as
          they were the first introducers of it, will be tenacious enough to
          keep it. And the other is, from midwives and nurses, etc. whole pride
          in the fine dressing of the child will be entirely lost. But to return
          from whence I have digressed. Mr. B. W. it seems, is of opinion, that
          baptism by plunging, is not only against the sixth, but also against
          the seventh command, for which reason he must be against it. To
          baptize by plunging, he insinuates is "a practice contrary to the
          whole current of Christ's pure precepts, of an uncomely aspect, and
          seemingly scandalous and ignominious to the honor of Christianity; and
          that one would think a man would as soon deny all right reason, and
          religion, as believe Christ would ever command such a practice."
        </p>
        <p>
          But I appeal to any, even our worst adversaries, that make any
          conscience of what they say or do, who have seen the ordinance
          administered, whether it is of such an uncomely aspect, and so
          seemingly scandalous, as this defamer has represented it. "And, says
          he, to use the words of a servant of Christ, can we therefore imagine,
          that Christ's baptism should entrench so much upon the laws of
          civility, charity, and modesty, as to require women and maids to
          appear openly in the light of the fun, out of their wonted habit, in
          transparent and thin garments, next to nakedness, and in that posture
          be took by a man in his arms, and plunged in the face of the whole
          congregation, before men and boys!" Who this servant of Christ is,
          whose words he uses, and has made his own, he does not tell us. I
          shall therefore inform the reader, they are the words of one Ruffen,
          an author he might well be ashamed to mention in the manner he does:
          However I shall not be ashamed to give Mr. Stennett’s reply to this
          paragraph, in his excellent answer to that scurrilous writer, which I
          have put in the margent;[26] and would also recommend that book to the
          readers of our author, but especially to himself; for had he read it
          before he published his, perhaps it might have prevented it, or at
          least, have made him ashamed to quote those expressions, with such a
          complement upon the author of them. How does this become one, who
          calls himself a minister of the gospel, to be guilty of such a scandal
          and defamation as this is? What, did the man never see the ordinance
          administered? If he has, his wickedness in publishing this is the
          greater; if not, he ought to have took an opportunity to have informed
          himself, before he had made so free with the practice, as to asperse
          it after this manner. It is well known, that the clothes we use in
          baptism, are either the person's wearing apparel, or else those which
          are on purpose provided, which are made of as thick, or thicker stuff,
          than what are usually worn in the performance of the most servile
          work. those who have seen the ordinance administered, know with what
          decency it is performed, and with couth, I am persuaded what our
          author says will find but little credit. I have nothing else, I think,
          to observe now, unless it be, his arguing for the preferableness of
          applying water to the person, to any other mode of baptism, from the
          application of grace to us, and not us to that, in page 46 which I
          suppose was forgot in the conference, or else he had not an
          opportunity to crowd it in. To which I need only reply, that there
          does not appear to be any necessity of using a mode in baptism, that
          must be conformable to that; besides, if there was, does not every
          body know, that in plunging a person, there is an application of the
          water to him, as well as an application of him to the water? For as
          soon as ever a person is plunged, the water will apply itself to him.
          As to the vanity which he thinks we are guilty of, in monopolizing the
          name of baptists to ourselves, he may take the name himself if he
          pleases, seeing he thinks we have nothing to do with it, for we will
          not quarrel with him about it: But since it is necessary to make use
          of some names of distinction in civil conversation, he does well to
          tell us, what name we should be called by, and that is plungers; but
          then he will be hard put to it to shew the difference between a
          Baptist and a plunger. Betides, the old objection against the name
          Baptist being peculiar to John, or so an administrator, may as well be
          objected against this name as the other, because we are not all
          plungers, but by far the greatest part, are only persons plunged.
          However I could wish, as well as he, that all names were laid aside,
          especially as terms of reproach, and the great name of Christ alone
          exalted.

        <h2>CHAPTER 8.</h2>
        <p>Concerning the free or mixt communion of churches.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Mr. B. W. here and there drops a sentence, signifying his love and
          affection to persons of our persuasion, as in page 42 "Christians of
          your persuasion, I hope, I dearly love;" this and such like
          expressions, I can understand no otherwise than as a wheedling and
          cajoling of those of his members, who are of a different persuasion
          from him in this point, whom he knows he must have grieved and
          offended, by this shameful and scandalous way of writing. And at the
          same time, when he expresses so much love to them, he lets them know,
          that he "does not admire their plunging principle, though he does not
          love to make a great noise about it." I think he has made a great
          noise about it, and such an one as, perhaps by this time, he would be
          glad to have said. He signifies his readiness "to carry on evangelical
          fellowship, in all the acts thereof, with chearfulness," with those
          who are differently minded from him. That those of a different
          persuasion from us, should willingly receive into their communion such
          whom they judge believers in Christ, who have been baptized by
          immersion; I do not wonder at, seeing they generally judge baptism
          performed so, to be valid; but how Mr. B. W. can receive such, I
          cannot see, when he looks upon it to be no ordinance of God, page 41
          and a superstitious invention, page 23. nay, will-worship, page 24.
          There are two churches in London, which, I have been informed, will
          not receive persons of our persuasion into their communion; but
          whether it is, because they judge our baptism invalid, and so we not
          proper persons for communion, or whether it is a prudential step, that
          their churches may not be over-run by us, I cannot tell; I think those
          of our persuasion act a very weak part in proposing to belong to any
          such churches, who, when they are in them, are too much regarded only
          for the sake of their subscriptions, are but noun substantives
          therein, and too many like Issachar’s ass, bow down between two
          burdens. But to return, Mr. B. W. has thought fit, in the close of
          this conference, to produce "some few reasons for the equity and
          necessity of communion with saints as saints, without making
          difference in judgment about water-baptism, a bar unto evangelical
          church fellowship;" which I shall now consider.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. "God has received them, and we should be followers of God as dear
          ildren. We are commanded to receive one another, as Christ hath
          received us to the glory of God." That we should be followers of God
          in all things, which he has made our duty, is certain, but his, and
          his Son's reception of persons, is no rule for the reception of church
          members. A sovereign lord may do what he pleases himself, but his
          servants must act according to his orders: God and Christ have
          received unconverted sinners, but that is no rule for churches; God
          the Father has so received them into his love and affections, as to
          let them apart for himself, provide all blessings of grace for them,
          nay, give himself in covenant to them, send his Son to die for them,
          his Spirit to convert them, and all previous to it. Christ also hath
          received them, so as to become a surety for them, take the charge both
          of their persons and grace, give himself a ransom for them, and bestow
          his grace upon them; for we are first apprehended by Christ, before we
          are capable of apprehending and receiving him: must we therefore
          receive unconverted persons into church-fellowship, because God and
          Christ have received them? It is what God has commanded us to do, and
          not all that he himself does, that we are to be followers of him in,
          or indeed can be; besides, the churches of Christ are oftentimes
          obliged, according to Christ's own rules, to reject those whom Christ
          has received, and cut them off from church-communion; witness the
          incestuous person; so that they are not persons merely received by
          Christ, but persons received by Christ, subjecting themselves to his
          ordinances, and to the laws of his house, that we are to receive, and
          retain in churches. The text in Rom15:7 which speaks of receiving one
          another, as Christ, hath received us to the glory of God, can never be
          understood of the receiving of persons into church-fellowshipping For
          the persons who are exhorted both to receive and be received, were
          members of churches already; therefore that text only regards the
          mutual love and affection which they should have to one another, as
          brethren and church-members; which is enforced by the strong love and
          affection Christ had to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. "All saints are alike partakers of the great and fundamental
          privileges of the gospel." If by the great and fundamental privileges
          of the gospel, he means union to Christ, justification by him, faith
          in him, and communion with him, who denies that saints are partakers
          of these things? Though in some of them, not all alike; for some have
          more faith in Christ, and more communion with him, than others have:
          But what is this argument produced for? Or indeed, is there any
          argument in it? does he mean that therefore they ought to partake of
          gospel ordinances? who denies it? And we would have them partake of
          them alike too, both of Baptism and the Lord's supper; it is the thing
          we are pleading for.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. "All believers, though in lesser things differently minded, are in
          a capacity to promote mutual edification in a church state." But then
          their admittance into it, and walk with it, must be according to
          gospel order, or else they are like to be of little service to promote
          mutual edification in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. "It is observable that the churches for the free communion of
          saints, are "the most orderly and prosperous." This observation is
          wrong, witness the churches in Northamptonshire, where there is
          scarcely an orderly or prosperous one of that way; they having been
          made a prey of, and pillaged by others, to whole capricious humors
          they have been too much subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. "Many waters should not in the least quench love, nor should the
          floods drown it." This is foolishly and impertinently applied to
          water-baptism: But what is it that some men cannot see in some texts
          of Scripture?
        </p>
        <p>
          6. "Behold how good and how pleasant it is!" I think I must also make
          a note of admiration too, as wondering what the man means by giving us
          half a sentence! But perhaps this is to give us a specimen of what
          shadows of words are, though I suppose he means for brethren to dwell
          together in unity; it would have been no great trouble to have
          expressed it; but he is willing to let us know that he has got a
          concise way of speaking and writing. For brethren to dwell together in
          unity, is indeed very pleasant and delightful: But how can two walk,
          or dwell together thus, except they are agreed!
        </p>
        <p>
          7. "All the saints shall for ever dwell in glory together." Who denies
          it? But does it from thence follow, that they must all dwell together
          on earth? And if he means that it may be inferred from hence, that
          they ought to be admitted, whilst here, to church-fellowship, who
          denies it? But I hope it must be in a way agreeable to gospel order;
          and he ought to have first proved, that admission to church-fellowship
          without water baptism, is according to gospel order, Jesus Christ, no
          doubt, receives many unbaptized persons into heaven; and so he does no
          doubt, such who never partook of the Lord's supper; nay, who never
          were in church-fellowship: But are these things to be laid aside by us
          upon that account? We are not to take our measures of acting in
          Christ's church here below, from what he himself does in heaven, but
          from those rules which he has left us on earth to go by. Having thus
          considered our author's reasons, for the free and mixt communion of
          saints, without making water baptism a bar to it; I shall take the
          liberty to subjoin some reasons against it, which I desire chiefly
          might be regarded and considered by those who are of the same
          persuasion with us, with respect to the ordinance of water-baptism.
          They are as follow:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Because such a practice is contrary to Christ's commission, in Mat
          28:19 where Christ's orders are to baptize those that are taught. It
          is not only without a precept of Christ, which in matters of worship
          we should be careful that we do not act without, (for he has no where
          commanded to receive unbaptized persons into churches) but it is also
          contrary to one which requires all believers to be baptized; and this
          must be either before they are church members or after they are so, or
          never. The two latter, I dare say, will not be asserted, and therefore
          the former is true.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is contrary to the order and practice of the primitive churches;
          it is not only without a precept, but without a precedent: The
          admission of the first converts after Christ's death, resurrection,
          and ascension, into church fellowship, was after this manner. First,
          they gladly received the word, then were baptized, and after that,
          added to the church (Acts 2:41). So the apostle Paul first believed,
          then was baptized, and after that assayed to join himself to the
          disciples (Acts 9:18; Acts 9:26). Who therefore that has any regard to
          a command of Christ, and an apostolic practice, would break in upon
          such a beautiful order as this? I challenge any person, to give one
          single instance of any one that was ever received into those primitive
          churches without being first baptized.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It has a tendency to lay aside the ordinance entirely. For upon the
          same foot that persons, who plead their baptism in their infancy,
          which to us is none at all, may be received, those who never make
          pretensions to any, yea, utterly deny water-baptism, may also.
          Moreover, if once it is accounted an indifferent thing, that may, or
          may not be done; that it is unnecessary and unessential to
          church-communion, to which persons may be admitted without it, they
          will lie under a temptation wholly to omit it, rather than incur the
          trouble, shame, and reproach that attend it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It has a tendency to lay aside the ordinance of the Lord's-Supper,
          and indeed all others. For, suppose a person should come and propose
          for communion, to any of those churches who are upon this foundation,
          and give a satisfactory account of his faith and experience to them,
          so that they are willing to receive him; but after all, he tells them
          he is differently minded from them, with respect to the ordinance of
          the Lord's-Supper: I am willing to walk with you, says he, in all
          other ordinances but that; and, as to that, I am very willing to meet
          when you do, and with you; to remember Christ's dying love: I hope I
          shall be enabled to feed by faith, upon his flesh and blood as well as
          you; but I think to eat the bread, and drink the wine, are but outward
          ceremonies, and altogether needless. I should be glad to know, whether
          any of these churches would reject this man? I am lure, according to
          their own principles, they cannot. Therefore has not this a tendency
          to lay aside the ordinance of the Lord's Supper? For if it is
          warrantable for one man, it is for ten or twenty, and so on ad
          infinitum. All that I can meet with, as yet, that is objected to this,
          is, that the Lord's-Supper is a church-ordinance, and cannot be
          dispensed with in such a case; but baptism is not, and therefore may.
          But baptism is an ordinance of Christ, and therefore cannot be
          dispensed with no more than the other: By a church-ordinance, they
          either mean an ordinance of the church's appointing; or else one that
          is performed by persons when in a church state. The former, I presume,
          they do not mean, because the Lord's-Supper is not in that sense a
          church-ordinance: And if they mean in the latter sense, that baptism
          is not a church-ordinance, then certainly it ought to be performed
          before they are in a church state; which is the thing pleaded for.
          When they talk of baptism's not being essential to salvation, who says
          it is? but will this tolerate the abuse, neglect, or omission of it?
          Is any thing relating to divine worship essential to salvation? but
          what, must it all be laid aside because it is not? is not this an idle
          way of talking?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It is a rejecting the pattern which Christ has given us, and a
          trampling upon his legislative power; is this doing all things
          according to his direction, when we step over the first thing, after
          believing, that is enjoined us? Is not this making too free with his
          legislative power, to alter his rules at pleasure? and what else is
          it, but an attempt to jostle Christ out of his throne? It is no other
          than an imputation of weakness to him, as if he did not know what was
          best for his churches to observe; and of carelessness, as if he was
          unconcerned whether they regarded his will or no. Let such remember
          the case of Nadab and Abihu. In matters of worship, God takes notice
          of those things that seem but small, and will contend with his people
          upon that account. A power to dispense with Christ's ordinances, was
          never given to any men, or set of men or churches upon earth. An
          ordinance of Christ does not depend upon so precarious a foundation,
          as persons having, or not having light into it: If they have not, they
          must make use of proper means, and wait till God gives them it.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. We are commanded to withdraw from every brother that walks
          disorderly; not only from persons of an immoral conversation, but also
          from those who are corrupt in doctrine, or in the administration of
          ordinances; if this is not a disorderly walking, to live in the abuse,
          or neglect and omission of a gospel ordinance,. I know not what is: We
          are not to suffer sin upon a brother, but reprove him for it; bear our
          testimony against it, lest we be partakers of his guilt; and if we are
          to withdraw from such disorderly persons, then we ought not to receive
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. This practice makes our separation from the Established church,
          look more like a piece of obstinacy, than a case of conscience: What,
          shall we boggle at reading the Common-prayer-book, wearing the
          surplice, kneeling at the Lord's supper, etc. and can at once drop an
          ordinance of Christ? If this is not straining at gnats, and swallowing
          of camels, I must confess myself mistaken. To all this I might have
          added also, that it is contrary to the constant and universal practice
          of the churches of Christ, in all ages of the world. To receive an
          unbaptized person into communion, was never once attempted among all
          the corruptions of the church of some: This principle of receiving
          only baptized persons into communion, was maintained by the authors of
          the glorious Reformation from Popery, and those who succeeded them. As
          for the present practice of our Presbyterians and Independents, they
          proceed not upon the same foot as our Semi-Quakers do. They judge our
          baptism to be valid, and their own too; and therefore promiscuously
          receive persons; but, according to their own principles, will not
          receive one that is unbaptized. And could we look upon their baptism
          valid too, what we, call mixed communion would wholly cease, and
          consequently the controversy about it be entirely at an end; therefore
          the Presbyterians and Independents do not maintain a free and mixt
          communion in the same sense, and upon the same foundation, as some of
          our persuasion do, which those persons would do well to consider. It
          may be thought necessary by some, that before I conclude, I should
          make an apology for taking notice of such a trifling pamphlet as this
          is, which I have been considering. Had it not been for the importunity
          of some of my friends, as well as the vain ovations, and silly
          triumphs, which those of a different persuasion from us are ready to
          make upon every thing that comes out this way, however weak it be, I
          should never have given myself the trouble of writing, nor others of
          reading hereof. If it should be asked, why I have been so large in
          considering several things herein, to which a shorter reply would have
          been sufficient? I answer, It is not because I thought the author
          deserved it, but having observed that the arguments and exceptions
          which he has licked up from others, have been, and still are, received
          by persons of far superior judgment and learning to himself, and who
          are better versed in this controversy than he appears to be; it is
          upon that account, as well as to do justice to the truth I have been
          defending, I have taken this method. But if any should think me
          blame-worthy, in taking notice of some things herein, which do not
          carry in them the appearance of an argument, I persuade myself they
          will easily forgive me, when they consider how ready some captious
          persons would have been to say, I had passed over some of his material
          objections. However, without much concerning myself what any one shall
          say of this performance, I commit it to the blessing of God, and the
          consideration of every impartial reader.

          [22] Magnum habet convenientiam ille in maris intima infimaque
          descensus, ex eodem ascensus denuo in aridam, cum baptismi christiani
          ritu, prout is primis temporibus administrabatur. Siquidem inter
          baptizandum in aquas descendebant, & ex eisdem denuo ascendebant:
          Cujus kataazasewv ki anazasewv in Eunachi AEthiopis tinctione mentio
          expressia reperitur (Acts 8:38-39). Quin &, sicuti in ritu christiano,
          quum immergerentur aquis obruti, & quasi sepulti & Christo ipsi
          consepulti quodammodo videbantur; rursusque cum emergerent, a
          sepulchro quodammodo resur-gere, ac cum Christo resuscitare prae se
          serebant (Rom6:4-5; Col 2:12). Ita maris illius aquis capitibus ipsis
          transeuntium altius extantibus obruti ac sepulti quodammodo poterunt
          videri & cruet-gere ac resurgere denuo, cum ad littus objectum
          exeuntes evasissent. Gatak. ibid.

          [26] It does not shock me so much, to find Mr. R. use such terms as
          are scarce reconcilable to good sense, as it does to find him using
          such expressions, and making such descriptions, as are hardly
          consistent with that civility and modesty, for which he would appear
          to be an advocate. I can bear with him, when, on this occasion, he
          calls thin garments a posture instead of a habit, and tells us of
          things that are ignominious to the honor of Christianity, being now
          pretty well acquainted with his stile. But I must confess myself
          offended with that air of levity, and those indecent terms, in which
          he condemns the pretended immodesty of others. For the words by which
          he sometimes describes the vicious acts and inclinations which he
          censures, seem not so much adapted to excite horror and aversion in
          the reader, as to defile his imagination, end to dispose him to that
          imprudent temper of making a mock of fin. And the true reason why I do
          not quote Mr. R's words at large in this place, as I do in many
          others, is not to evade the force of his argument, but to avoid the
          mode of his expression, by which he has given too much occasion of
          offense to virtuous minds, and perhaps too much gratified those that
          are viciously inclined. Stennett'a Answ. to Ruffen. page 137.
