        <h2>Reply to Divine Right of Infant Baptism 1</h2>
        <p>By</p>
        <p>Peter Clark, A.M. Minister at Salem</p>
        <p>
          In A Letter To A Friend At Boston In New-England. To Which Are Added,
          Some Strictures On A Late Treatise, Called, A Fair And Rational
          Vindication Of The Right Of Infants To The Ordinance Of Baptism.
        </p>
        <p>Written by David Bostwick, A.M.</p>
        <p>Late Minister of the Presbyterian Church in the City of New-York</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>The Preface</h2>
        <p>
          It is necessary that the reader should be acquainted with the reason
          of the republication of the following treatise. In the year 1746, a
          pamphlet was printed at Boston in New England, called, "A brief
          Illustration and Confirmation of the Divine Right of Infant-baptism,"
          written by Mr.. Dickinson; which being industriously spread about in
          great numbers, to hinder the growth of the Baptist-Interest in those
          parts, it was sent over to me by some of our friends there, requesting
          an answer to it; which I undertook, and published in the year 1749,
          entitled, "The Divine Right of Infant-baptism examined and disproved."
          Upon which Peter Clark, A.M. Minister at Salem in New England, was
          employed to write against it, and which he did; and what he wrote was
          printed and published at Boston in 1752, called, "A Defense of the
          Divine Right of Infant-baptism." This being sent over to me, I wrote a
          Reply, in a letter to a friend at Boston, in the year 1753, as the
          date of my letter shews, giving leave to make use of it, as might be
          thought fit; and which was printed and published at Boston in 1734,
          together with a Sermon of mine on Baptism preached at Barbican, 1750.
          The controversy lying beyond the seas, I chose it should continue
          there, and therefore never reprinted and republished my Reply here,
          though it has been solicited; but of late Mr. Clark’s Defense has been
          sent over here, and published, and advertised to be sold; which is the
          only reason of my reprinting and republishing the following Reply; to
          which I have added some scriptures on a treatise of Mr. Bostwick’s on
          the same subject, imported from America, with the above Defense, and
          here reprinted. The Paedobaptists are ever restless and uneasy,
          endeavoring to maintain and support, if possible, their unscriptural
          practice of Infant-baptism; though it is no other than a pillar of
          Popery; that by which antichrist has spread his baneful influence over
          many nations; is the basis of national churches, and worldly
          establishments; that which unites the church and the world, and keeps
          them together; nor can there be a full separation of the one from the
          other, nor a thorough reformation in religion, until it is wholly
          removed: and though it has so long and largely obtained, and still
          does obtain; I believe with a firm and unshaken faith, that the time
          is hastening on, when Infant-baptism will be no more practiced in the
          world; when churches will be formed on the same plan they were in the
          times of the apostles; when gospel-doctrine and discipline will be
          restored to their primitive luster and purity; when the ordinances of
          baptism and the Lord’s supper will be administered as they were first
          delivered, clear of all present corruption and superstition; all which
          will be accomplished, when the Lord shall be king over all the earth,
          and there shall be one Lord, and his name one.

        <h2>A REPLY, ETC.</h2>
        <p>IN A LETTER TO A FRIEND.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>SIR,</p>
        <p>
          I Acknowledge the receipt of your Letter on the 22d of last March, and
          with it Mr. Clark’s Defense of the Divine Right of Infant-baptism,
          etc. which I have since cursorily read over; for I thought it a too
          great waste of time to give it a second reading. Nor will my
          engagement in a work of greater importance permit me to write a set
          and labored answer to it; nor am I willing to bestow so much time and
          pains as are necessary to cleanse that Augean stable, and remove all
          the dirt and rubbish this writer has collected together. The remarks I
          made in reading, I here send you. At first setting out, I soon found I
          must expect to be dealt rudely and roughly with, and accordingly
          prepared myself for it; and I assure you, Sir, I was not disappointed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first chapter of my book, which the above Gentleman has undertook
          to answer, is short, and only an introduction, observing the author’s
          title, method, and occasion of writing the pamphlet before me. In Mr.
          Clark’s Reply to which I observe;
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That he is displeased at calling the ordinance of baptism as truly
          and properly administered, Believer’s-baptism, and the pretended
          administration of it, to infants, Infant-sprinkling; whereas this is
          calling things by their proper names: it is with great propriety, we
          call baptism as administered to believers, the proper subjects of it,
          Believer’s-baptism; and with the same propriety we call that which is
          administered to infants, Infant-sprinkling; from the nature of the
          action performed, and the persons on whom it is performed. Does this
          Gentleman think, we shall be so complaisant to suit our language and
          way of speaking to his mistaken notion and practice? though indeed we
          too often do, through the common use of phrases which obtain.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He is unwilling to allow of any increase of the Baptist interest in
          New England, either at Boston or in the country; whereas I am credibly
          informed, and you, Sir, I believe, can attest the truth of it, that
          there have been considerable additions to the Baptist interest at
          Boston; and that many hundreds in the country have been baptized
          within a few years
        </p>
        <p>
          3. He says, it is an egregious mistake, that the ministers of New
          England applied to Mr. Dickinson (the author of the pamphlet I wrote
          against) to write in favor of Infant-sprinkling; and he is certain
          that not one of the ministers in Boston made application to him,
          (which was never affirmed,) and is persuaded it was not at the motion
          of any ministers in New England, that he wrote his Dialogue, but of
          his own mere motion; and yet he is obliged to correct himself by a
          marginal note, and acknowledge that it was wrote through ministerial
          influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This writer very early gives a specimen of his talent at reasoning;
          from the rejection of Infant-baptism, as an human invention, he argues
          to the rejection of baptism itself, as such; that if Infant-baptism is
          entirely an human invention, and a rite not to be observed, then
          baptism itself is an human invention, and not to be observed: this is
          an argument drawn up secundum artem, like a master of arts; and to
          pretend to answer so strong an argument, and set aside such a masterly
          way of reasoning, would be weakness indeed!
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It being observed of the Dialogue-writer, "that he took care, not
          to put such arguments and objections into the mouth of his antagonist
          as he was not able to answer;" this Gentleman rises up, and blusters
          at a great rate, and defies the most zealous, learned, and subtle of
          the Antipaedobaptists to produce any other arguments and objections
          against Infant-baptism, for matter or substance, different from, or of
          greater weight, than those produced in the Dialogue; but afterwards
          lowers his topsail, and says, that the design of the author of that
          pamphlet was to represent in a few plain words, the most material
          objections against Infant-baptism, with the proper answers to them;
          and at last owns, that a great deal more has been said by the
          Antipaedobaptists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second chapter, you know, Sir, treats of "the consequences of
          embracing Believer’s-baptism; such as, renouncing Infant-baptism,
          vacating the covenant, and renouncing all other ordinances of the
          gospel;" that Christ must have forsaken his church for many ages, and
          not made good the promise of his presence, and that there now can be
          no baptism in the world. In Mr. Clark’s Reply to what I have said on
          those heads, I observe the following things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first consequence is the renunciation of Infant-baptism; which
          consequence, to put him out of all doubt and pain, about my owning or
          not owning it, I readily allow, follows upon a person’s being
          sprinkled in infancy, embracing adult-baptism by immersion; in which
          he is to be justified, the one being an invention of man’s, the other
          according to the word of God; nor is there any thing this Gentleman
          has said, that proves such a renunciation to be an evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He is very wrong in supposing it must be my intention, that the age
          of a person, or the time of receiving baptism, are essential to the
          ordinance. The Antipaedobaptists do not confine this ordinance to any
          age, but admit old or young to it, if proper subjects; let a man be as
          old as Methuselah, if he has not faith in Christ, or cannot give a
          satisfactory account of it, he will not be admitted to this ordinance
          by reason of his age; on the other hand, if a little child is called
          by grace, and converted, and gives a reason of the hope that is in it,
          of which there have been instances; such will not be refused this
          ordinance of baptism. The essentials to the right administration of
          baptism, amongst other things, are, that it be performed by immersion,
          without which it cannot be baptism; and that it be administered upon a
          profession of faith; neither of which are to be found in Infant
          sprinkling.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is in vain and to no purport in this writer to urge, that
          infants are capable of baptism; so are bells, and have been baptized
          by the Papists. But it is said, infants are capable of being cleansed
          by the blood of Christ; of being regenerated; of being entered into
          covenant, and of having the seal of it administered to them. And what
          of all this? are they capable of understanding the nature, design, and
          use of the ordinance, when administered to them? are they capable of
          professing faith in Christ, which is a pre-requisite to this
          ordinance? are they capable of answering a good conscience towards God
          in it? are they capable of submitting to it in obedience to the will
          of Christ, from a love to him, and with a view to his glory? they are
          not. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It seems, in baptism, infants are dedicated unto God; wherefore to
          renounce Infant baptism, is for a man to renounce his solemn
          dedication to God; and much is said to prove that parents have a Right
          to dedicate their children to him. It will be allowed, that parents
          have a right to devote or dedicate their children to the Lord; that
          is, to give them up to him in prayer; or to pray for them, as Abraham
          did for Ishmael, that they may live in his light; and it is their duty
          to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; but they
          have no direction to baptize them, nor warrant to dedicate them by
          baptism; nor is baptism an ordinance of dedication, either of a man’s
          self, or of others; a dedication ought to be previous to baptism; and
          Believers first give up themselves to the Lord, and then are baptized
          in his name.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. After all, a renunciation of baptism in infancy must be a matter of
          great impiety, because witches are solicited by the Devil to renounce
          it, in order to their entering into confederacy with them. I thought,
          Sir, your country of New-England had been cured of these fooleries
          about witchcraft, and diabolical confederacies long ago, but I find
          the distemper continues. This argument, I own, is unanswerable by me;
          I must confess myself quite a stranger to this dark business.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. What the story of Mr. Whiston is told for, is not easy to say;
          since it seems, he did not renounce his Infant-baptism: it looks, by
          the reference, as if it was intended to suggest, that an
          Antitrinitarian could not so well shelter himself among a people of
          any denomination, as the Baptists; whereas the ordinance as
          administered by them, as strongly militates against such a principle,
          as it does by being administered by Paedobaptists: but it may be, it
          is to recommend a spirit of moderation among us, to receive unbaptized
          persons into our communion by this example; but then unhappy for this
          writer, so it is, that the congregation Dr. Foster was pastor of, and
          Mr. Whiston joined himself to, is, and always was of the Paedobaptist
          denomination, and have for their present minister one of the
          Presbyterian persuasion. The second consequence of receiving the
          principle of adult-baptism, and acting up to it, is, vacating the
          covenant between God and the person baptized in infancy, into which he
          was brought by his baptism. Now you will observe, Sir,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That Mr. Clark has offered nothing in proof of infants being
          brought into covenant with God, by baptism; and indeed I cannot see
          how he can consistently with himself undertake it; since he makes
          covenant relation to God, the main ground of infants right to baptism;
          and therefore they must be in it before their baptism, and
          consequently are not brought into it by it; wherefore since they are
          not brought into covenant by it, that cannot be vacated by their
          renouncing of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It being observed, that no man can be brought into the covenant of
          grace by baptism, since it is from everlasting, and all interested in
          it were so early in covenant, and consequently previous to their
          baptism; this writer lets himself with all his might and main to
          oppose this sentiment, that the covenant of grace was from
          everlasting; this, he says, is unscriptural, irrational, and contrary
          to scripture. But if Christ was set up from everlasting as mediator;
          for only as such could he be set up (Prov 8:12); if there was a
          promise of eternal life made before the world began, and this promise
          was in Christ, who then existed as the federal head and representative
          of his people, in whom they were chosen so early, to receive all
          promises and grace for them (Titus 1:2; 2 Tim 1:1); and if grace was
          given to them in him before the world was, and they were blessed with
          all spiritual blessings in him so early (2 Tim 1:9; Eph 1:3-4); then,
          surely, there must be a covenant transaction between the Father and
          the Son on their account so early; for could there be all this and no
          covenant subsisting? The distinction between a covenant of redemption
          and a covenant of grace, is without any foundation in the word of God.
          Nor is this notion irrational; two parties were so early existing,
          when the covenant was made; Jehovah the Father was one, and the Son of
          God the other, in the name of his people; who, though they had not
          then a personal, yet had a representative being in Christ their head;
          and this was sufficient for them to have grace given them in him
          before the world was.
        </p>
        <p>
          His metaphysical arguments from eternal acts being imminent, will
          equally militate against eternal election, as against an eternal
          covenant; and perhaps this writer has as little regard to the one, as
          he has to the other: nor is this notion contrary to scripture; for
          though the covenant is called a new and second covenant, yet only with
          respect to the former administration of it, under the legal
          dispensation; and both administrations of it, under the law and under
          the gospel, are only so many exhibitions and manifestations of the
          covenant under different forms, which was made in eternity. The
          scriptures which promise the making of a covenant, only intend a
          clearer manifestation and application of the covenant of grace to
          persons to whom it belongs; things are said in scripture to be made,
          when they are made manifest or declared (Acts 2:36): it is a previous
          interest in the covenant of grace that gives persons a right to the
          blessings of it; and the application of there blessings, such as
          pardon of sin, etc. flows from this previous interest: nor does this
          notion render the ministry of the word and the operation of the Spirit
          for that end useless, and superfluous; but on the contrary so early an
          interest in the covenant of grace is the ground and reason of the
          Spirit being sent down in time to make the word effectual to
          salvation. Nor is the state of unregeneracy, the elect of God are in
          by nature, inconsistent with this eternal covenant; since that
          covenant supposes it, and provides for, promises, and secures the
          regeneration and sanctification of all interested in it; assuring them
          that the heart of stone shall be taken away, and an heart of flesh
          given them; a new heart and a new Spirit, yea the Spirit of God shall
          be put into them, and the laws of God written in their minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text in Eph 2:12. describes the Gentiles only, who were strangers
          from the covenants of promise; the covenant of circumcision, and the
          covenant at Sinai; covenants peculiar to the Jews; as well as
          strangers to the scriptures, which contain the promise of the Messiah;
          all which might be, and was, and yet be interested in the covenant of
          grace. If this is to be an Antinomian, I am quite content to be called
          one; such bug-bear names do not frighten me. It is not worth while to
          take notice of this man’s Neonomian rant; of the terms and conditions
          of the covenant; of its being a rule of moral government over man in a
          flare of unregeneracy, brought hereby into a state of probation; which
          turns the covenant into a law, and is what the Neonomians call a
          remedial law, (as this writer calls the covenant a remedial one) a law
          of milder terms; nor of his Arminian strokes in making the endeavors
          and acts of men to be the turning point of their salvation, and
          conversion, as being foreign to the controversy, in hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This writer makes a distinction between a man’s being in covenant
          in respect of the spiritual dispensation of the grace of it, and in
          respect of the external administration of it: by the spiritual
          dispensation of it, I apprehend, he means the application of spiritual
          blessings in the covenant to persons regenerated and converted, by
          which they must appear to be in it; and in this sense, all the
          persons, I have instanced in, must be manifestly in the covenant of
          grace, previous to baptism: and consequently not brought into it by
          it. By the external administration of it, I suppose, he means the
          administration of the ordinances of the gospel, particularly baptism;
          and then it is only saying a man is not baptized before he is
          baptized; which no body will contest with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. No man, I observe, is entered into the covenant of grace by
          himself, or others; this is an act of the sovereign grace of God, who
          says, I will be their God, and they shall be my people; which this
          writer owns, though not exclusive of human endeavors; as if God could
          not take any into his covenant without their own endeavors; such
          wretched divinity deserves the utmost contempt. Since the above
          phrase, I will be their God, etc. is a proof of the sovereign grace of
          God in bringing men into covenant; he hopes it will be allowed that a
          like phrase, I will be the God of thy seed, will be admitted as
          strongly to conclude the reception of the Infant-children of believers
          into covenant. I answer, whenever it appears that there is such an
          article in the covenant of grace, that so runs, that God will be the
          God of the natural Seed of believers as such, it will be admitted; and
          whereas I have observed, that the phrase of bringing into the bond of
          the covenant, which the Paedobaptists often make use of, is but once
          mentioned in scripture, and then ascribed to God; this, as it no ways
          contradicts a being in covenant from everlasting, so it fails not of
          being a proof of the sovereign grace of God in that act. By the bond
          of the covenant, is not meant faith and repentance on man’s part;
          which some stupidly call the terms and conditions of the covenant,
          when they are parts and blessings of it; but the everlasting love of
          God, which is the force and security of it, and which says men under
          obligation to serve their covenant-God; and to be brought into it, is
          to be brought into a comfortable view of interest in it, and to an
          open participation of the blessings of it; which is all according to,
          and consistent with the eternal constitution of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The covenant of grace can never be vacated, since it is
          everlasting, ordered in all things and sure: this is owned by our
          author in respect of its divine constitution, and of the immutability
          of the divine promise, to all under the spiritual dispensation of it;
          but there are others who are only in it by a visible and baptismal
          dedication; and these may make void the covenant between God and them;
          and this it seems is the case of the greatest part of infants in
          covenant. Now let me retort this Gentleman’s argument upon himself,
          which he makes use of against the covenant being from everlasting.
          "Those, whom God admits into the covenant of grace, have an interest
          in the benefits of that covenant, pardon of sin, the gift of the
          Spirit, reconciliation, adoption, etc. for it is a sort of
          contradiction to say, that any man is admitted into the covenant, and
          yet debarred from an interest in all the privileges of it." Now,
          either infants are admitted into the covenant of grace, or they are
          not; if they are, then they have an interest in the benefits of it,
          pardon of sin, and the other blessings, and so shall all certainly be
          saved with an everlasting salvation, and not apostatize, as it seems
          the greatest part of them do; for to say they are in the external, but
          not in the spiritual part of the covenant, is to make a poor business
          of their covenant-interest indeed. The instance of Simon Magus, which
          he thinks I have forgot, will not make for him, nor against me; it is
          a clear proof, that a man is not brought into covenant by baptism;
          since though baptism was administered to this person in the pure,
          primitive way, by an apostolic man, yet he was in the gall of
          bitterness and bond of iniquity.
        </p>
        <p>
          3dly, The other three consequences following upon the renouncing of
          Infant-baptism, as renouncing all other ordinances, the promise of
          Christ’s presence not made good, and no baptism now in the world, are
          in some fort given up, and are allowed not to be clear, at least not
          alike clear; and are only adverted to in a general way, and some
          expressions of mine catched at, and remarked upon, and these mistaken
          or perverted.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. I observe, this author repeats his former mistake, that we make age
          essential to baptism, which is but circumstantial; and then uses an
          argument from the lesser to the greater, as he thinks, that if a
          defect in such a circumstance nullifies the ordinance, then much more
          the want of proper administrators: but it is not age that we object
          to, but a want of understanding, and faith, and an incapacity to make
          a profession of it, as well as the mode of administration; things of
          greater importance in this ordinance; at least they are so with us.
          However, it is kind in this Gentleman to direct us how we may avoid
          this inconvenience his argument has thrown us into, by exercising a
          little more moderation and charity for Infant-baptism; and upon this
          foot he seems to be willing to compound the matter with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As to the presence of Christ with his church and ministers, it is
          sufficient to make that good, that he grants it where his Church is,
          and wheresoever he has a people, be they more, or fewer, and
          wheresoever his ordinances are administered according to his
          direction; but he has no where promised, that he will have a continued
          succession of visible congregated churches. Certain indeed it is, that
          he will have a number of chosen ones in all ages; that his invisible
          church, built on Christ the rock, shall not fail; and he will have a
          seed to serve him, or some particular persons, whom he will reserve to
          himself from a general corruption; but that there shall be gathered
          always into a visible gospel church-state, is no where promised; and
          for many hundreds of years it will be hard to find any one such
          church, unless the people in the valleys of Piedmont are allowed to be
          such.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This writer is not willing to admit such a supposition, that any of
          the laws and institutions of Christ have failed, ceased, or been
          annulled in any one age, and much more for several ages together; but,
          besides the ordinance of baptism, which through the change of mode and
          subjects, together with the impure mixtures of salt, oil, and spittle,
          and other superstitious rites, which became quite another thing than
          what was instituted by Christ, and practiced by his apostles; the
          ordinance of the Lord’s-supper was so sadly perverted and corrupted,
          as to be a mere mass indeed of blasphemy and idolatry; in the
          communion of which the gracious presence of Christ cannot be thought
          to be enjoyed: and yet this continued some hundreds of years; only now
          and then some single persons rose up, and bore a testimony against it,
          who for a while had their followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. He seems to triumph from Dr. Wall’s account of things, that there
          never was, nor is, to this day, any national church in the world but
          Paedobaptists, either among the Greeks, or Roman Catholics, or the
          Reformed; and that Antipaedobaptism never obtained to be the
          established religion of any country in the world. We do not envy his
          boast; we know that national churches are good for nothing, as not
          being agreeable to the rule of the divine word; one small church or
          congregation, gathered out of the world by the grace of God, according
          to gospel-order, and whole principles and practices are agreeable to
          the word of God, is to be preferred before all the national churches
          in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. According to this Gentleman’s own account of the English
          Antipaedobaptists, there could be none to administer the ordinance to
          them in their way; since those that came from Holland, it seems,
          gained no proselytes, but were soon extinct, being cruelly persecuted
          and destroyed; so that it was necessary they should send abroad for an
          administrator, or make use of an unbaptized one: but which way soever
          they took, they are able to justify their baptism on as good a
          foundation as the Reformers are able to justify theirs received from
          the Papists, with all the fooleries, corruptions, and superstitious
          rites attending it.
        </p>
        <p>
          My third chapter, you will remember, Sir, is concerning The Antiquity
          of Infant-baptism, and the practice of the Waldenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The enquiry is, whether Infant-baptism constantly and universally
          obtained in the truly primitive church, which truly pure and primitive
          church must be the church in the times of Christ and his apostles;
          since towards the close of those times, and in the two following Ages,
          there arose such a see of impure men, both for principle and practice,
          under the Christian name, as never were known in the world: now by an
          induction of particular instances of churches in this period of time,
          it does not appear, that Infant-baptism at all obtained. In Mr.
          Clark’s reply to which, I observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That he says, the evidence of Infant-baptism is not pretended to
          lie in the history of fact, or in any express mention of it in the New
          Testament. That the penman of the Acts of the Apostles did not descend
          to so minute a particular, as the baptizing of infants,—and that the
          baptism of the adult was of the greatest account to be recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Yet he thinks there are pretty plain intimations of it in most of
          the characters instanced in, and particularly in the church at
          Jerusalem; which he endeavors to make good by a criticism on Acts
          2:41. And it is pleasant to observe, how he toils and labors to find
          out an antecedent to a relative not expressed in the text; for the
          words, to them, are not in the original; it is only and the same day
          there were added about three thousand souls; or, the same day there
          was an addition of about three thousand souls; and all this pains is
          taken to support a whimsical notion, that this addition was made, not
          to the church, but to the new converts; and by a wild fancy he
          imagines, that infants are included among the three thousand souls
          that were added: his argument from verse 39. and the other instances
          mentioned, as well as some other passages alleged, such as Lk 18:16;
          Acts 15:10 and 1Cor 7:14 as they come over in the debate again, are
          referred to their proper places. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It must not be forgotten, what is said, that this may be a reason
          why Infant-baptism is so sparingly mentioned, (not mentioned at all)
          because the custom of the Jews to baptize the children of proselytes
          to their religion with their parents, was well known; and there can be
          little doubt, that the apostles proceeded by the same rule in
          admitting the infants of Christian proselytes into the Christian
          covenant by baptism. This is building Infant-baptism on a bog indeed;
          since this Jewish custom is not pretended to be of divine institution;
          and so a poor argument in the Defense of the Divine Right of
          Infant-baptism; and at most and best, is only a tradition of the
          elders, which body of traditions was inveighed against by Christ and
          his apostles; and besides, this particular tradition does not appear
          to have obtained so early among the Jews themselves, as the times of
          the apostles, and therefore could be no rule for them to proceed by;
          and about which the first reporters of it disagree, the one affirming
          there was such a custom, and the other denying it; and had it then
          obtained, it is incredible the apostles should make this the rule of
          their procedure in administering an ordinance of Christ and after all,
          was this the case, this would be a reason for, and not against the
          express mention of Infant-baptism by the divine historian; since it is
          necessary that in agreement with this Jewish custom, some instance or
          instances of Christian proselytes being baptized with their children
          should be recorded, as an example for Christians in succeeding ages to
          go by. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A supposition is made of some Paedobaptists sent into an heathen
          country to preach, and giving an account of their success, declaring
          that some families were baptized, such a man and all his, such another
          and his household; upon which a question is asked, who could raise a
          doubt whether any infants were baptized in those several families? To
          which I answer, there is no doubt to be made of it, that Paedobaptists
          would baptize infants; and if the apostles were Paedobaptists, which
          is the thing to be proved, they no doubt baptized infants too; but if
          no other account was given of the baptizing of households, than what
          the apostles give of them, Infant-baptism would still remain a doubt.
          For who can believe, that the brethren in Lydia’s house whom the
          apostles comforted, and of whom her household consisted, or that the
          Jailor’s household, that believed and rejoiced with him, or the
          household of Stephanas, who addicted themselves to the ministry of the
          saints, were infants? however it seems, as there is no evidence of
          fact for Infant-baptism in the New Testament, it is referred to the
          testimony of the ancient fathers; and to them then we must go.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The testimony of the fathers of the three first centuries is
          chiefly to be attended to; and whereas none in the first century are
          produced in favor of Infant-baptism, we must proceed to the second. In
          it, I observe, there is but one writer, that it is pretended speaks of
          Infant-baptism, and that is Irenaeus, and but one passage in him; and
          this is at best of doubtful meaning, and by some learned men judged
          spurious; as when he says, Christ "came to save all, all, I say, who
          are regenerated (or born again) unto God; Infants, and little ones,
          and children, and young men, and old men." Now, admitting the chapter
          in which this passage stands, is genuine and not spurious, which yet
          is not a clear case; it is objectionable to, as being a translation,
          as the most of this author’s works are, and a very foolish, uncouth
          and barbarous one it is, as learned men observe; wherefore there is
          reason to believe that justice is not done him; and it lies not upon
          us, but upon our antagonists that urge this passage against us, to
          produce the original in support of it: but allowing it to be a just
          translation, yet what is there of Infant-baptism in it? Not a word.
          Yes, to be regenerated, or born again, is to be baptized; this is the
          sense of the ancients, and particularly of Irenaeus, it is said; but
          how does this appear? Dr. Wall has given an instance of it out of Lib.
          3 chap. 19 where this ancient writer says, "when he gave the disciples
          the commission of regenerating (or rather of regeneration) unto God,
          he said unto them, Go, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name
          of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," where the
          commission of regenerating, adds Dr. Wall, plainly means the
          commission of baptizing; whereas, it more plainly means the commission
          of teaching the doctrine of regeneration by the spirit, and the
          necessity of that unto salvation, and in order to baptism; and which
          was the first and principal part of the apostles’ commission, as the
          very order of the words shews; and certain it is, that Irenaeus uses
          the word Regeneration in a different sense from baptism,[1] as an
          inward work, agreeable to the scriptures; and besides, such a sense of
          his words contended for, is to make him at least to suggest a doctrine
          which is absolutely false, as if Christ came to save all, and only
          such, who are baptized unto God; whereas he came to save baptized and
          unbaptized ones, Old and New Testament saints; and many no doubt are
          saved by him who never were baptized at all, and some baptized not
          saved; but on the other hand nothing is more true than that he came to
          save all, and only those, who are regenerated by the spirit and grace
          of God, of whatsoever age; and which is clearly this ancient writer’s
          sense, and so no proof of Infant-baptism. To support this notion of
          regeneration signifying baptism so early, our author urges a passage
          cited by me from Justin; who, speaking of converted persons, says,
          "they are brought by us where water is, and they are regenerated in
          the same way of regeneration as we have been regenerated; for they are
          then washed in water in the name of the Father, etc."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it is evident, that those persons are not represented as
          regenerated by baptism; because they are spoken of before as believers
          and converted ones; and it is as clear, that their baptism is
          distinguished from their regeneration, and not the same thing; for
          Justin uses the former, as an argument of the latter; which, if the
          same, his sense must be, they were baptized, because they were
          baptized; which is making him guilty of what Logicians call proving
          Idem per Idem: whereas, Justin’s sense, consistent with himself, and
          the practice of the primitive churches, is, that those persons when
          brought to the water, having made a profession of their regeneration,
          were owned and declared regenerated persons, as is manifest from their
          being admitted to the ordinance of water-baptism: and that Justin
          speaks of the baptism of the adult, is owned by this writer; though he
          thinks it is unquestionable, that he speaks only of such who were
          converted from Heathenism; and is sure of it, that there were none
          among them born of Christian parents; this he will find a hard talk,
          with all his confidence, to prove. And he has ventured to produce a
          passage out of Justin, as giving suffrage to Infant-baptism in the
          second century; and it is this from Dr. Wall; "We also, who by him
          have had access to God, have not received this carnal circumcision,
          but the spiritual circumcision, which Enoch and those like him
          observed; and we have received it by baptism, by the mercy of God,
          because we were sinners, and it is enjoined to all persons to receive
          it the same way."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let it be observed, that this spiritual circumcision, whatever
          Justin means by it, can never design baptism; since the patriarch
          Enoch, and others like him, observed it; and since with Christians it
          is received by baptism, he says; and therefore must be different from
          it: and, after all, not a word of infants in the passage; nor is
          baptism called a spiritual circumcision; nor, as our author elsewhere
          stiles it, Christian circumcision, in Col 2:11 since the circumcision
          there spoken of, is called a circumcision made without hands, which
          surely cannot be said of baptism. In short, I must once more triumph,
          if it may be so called, and say, this is all the evidence, the
          undoubted evidence of Infant-baptism from the fathers of the two first
          centuries. Proceed we to
        </p>
        <p>
          The third century; and the fathers of this, brought into the
          controversy about baptism are Tertullian, Origen, and Cyprian. The
          first of these, is the first writer we know of that ever made mention
          of Infant-baptism; and he dissuades from it, and advises to defer
          baptism to riper years; and is therefore claimed on our side of the
          question: nor can he be made to unsay what he has said; and therefore
          is traduced as a man of heterodox notions, and of odd and strange
          opinions; and, it seems, afterwards turned Montanist; and all this is
          said, to weaken the credit of his testimony, when not a word is said
          of Origen’s gross errors and monstrous absurdities: the reason is,
          because it seems he was a Paedobaptist, and Tertullian an
          Antipaedobaptist; though it is some comfort to this writer, that he
          was not quite so bad as the present Antipaedobaptists are. As to
          Origen, there are three passages quoted out of him; to which we
          object, not only, that they are translations, the fidelity of which
          cannot be depended upon, when there is much of this writer still
          extant in the language in which he wrote, and yet nothing from thence
          produced; but that there are interpolated, and confessedly so. His
          homilies on Leviticus and exposition of the epistle to the Romans,
          from whence two of the passages are taken, were translated by
          Ruffinus, who owns he took liberty to add of his own to them; so that,
          as Erasmus[2] observes, it is uncertain whether one reads Origen or
          Ruffinus; and Scultetus[3] says the same thing; and Huetius, who has
          given us a good edition of the Greek commentaries of this father, and
          well understood him, says,[4] that "his writings are so corrupted by
          him, that you are at a loss to find Origen in Origen, and so deformed
          and unlike the original, they can scarce be known;" and one of there
          particular passages Vossius[5] takes to be an interpolation, and so of
          the greater force against the Pelagians, because Ruffinus the
          translator and interpolator was inclined to them: the homilies on
          Luke, out of which is the other passage, are said to be translated by
          Jerom, of whom Du Pin says,[6] that his versions are not more exact
          than the other’s; so no credit is to be given to them, nor are they to
          be depended on. Cyprian is the next that is produced, and it will be
          allowed that Infant-baptism began to be practiced in his time in some
          churches, though it seems to be an upstart notion; since it was not
          till then determined at what time it should be administered; and also
          at the same time, and in the same churches, Infant-communion was
          practiced; of which Cyprian gives an instance; and that is more than
          is, or can be given of the practice of Infant-baptism so early; and if
          his testimony is of any weight for the one, it ought to be of the same
          for the other; and if infants are admitted to baptism, it is but
          reasonable they should partake of the Lord’s-supper, and especially as
          there is as early antiquity for the one as for the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quotations out of Gregory Nazianzen, Optatus, Ambrose, Chrysostom,
          and Austin, fathers of the fourth century, which Mr. Clark has
          collected from Dr. Wall, might have been spared; seeing this does not
          come into his own account of the truly primitive church; and since it
          is not denied, Infant-baptism obtained in it; and yet it is certain,
          there were persons in this age against it, as will be observed
          hereafter; nor was Pelagius, in this age, so pressed and puzzled with
          the argument taken from it in favor of original sin; since it was not
          contrary to his doctrine, who allowed baptism to be administered to
          them "on account of the kingdom of God, but not for forgiveness of
          sin;" and the controversy did not lead to dispute about the subject,
          but the end of baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next thing, you will remember, Sir, brought into the controversy,
          is, whether the practice of Infant-baptism was called in question
          before the mad-men of Munster let themselves against it. As to the
          troubles in Germany, and in Munster itself, it is certain beyond all
          contradiction, that they were begun by Paedobaptists, and whilst they
          were such; and as for the German Anabaptists, as they are called, who
          joined with them, they were Sprinklers, and not Baptists, and so
          belong rather to this writer’s party, than to us; but be this as it
          will, nothing in the controversy, depends upon that; the state of the
          case is, whether Infant-baptism was called in question, or made matter
          of doubt of before there men opposed it; and here I observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That it is allowed there were debates about Infant-baptism before
          the affair of Munster, and between that and the reformation; by which
          it appears that it was quickly opposed after the reformation begun.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The letter to Erasmus out of Bohemia shews, that there were a
          people there near one hundred years before the reformation, who
          baptized anew, in mere water, such as came over to their sect: this
          those people did, as our author would have it, not because they judged
          baptism in infancy invalid, but what was received in the corrupt way
          of the church of Rome. This he says after Dr. Wall, (though with the
          Doctor it is uncertain which was the case) inclining to the latter.
          But it should be observed, that there is no proof from any ancient
          history, that these people, or any Protestants and reformers that
          retained Infant-baptism, did, upon leaving the church of Rome, reject
          the baptism of that church, and receive a new one; and besides, Thomas
          Waldensis,[7] who lived and wrote at this very time, affirms, that
          there were a people in Bohemia then, that maintained that "believers
          children were not to be baptized, and that baptism was to no purpose
          administered to them;" to which I would add the testimony of
          Luther,[8] who says, "the Waldenses in Bohemia, ground the sacrament
          of baptism upon the person’s faith; and for that reason, they
          annihilate the baptizing of children; for they say, children must be
          taught before they be baptized."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This Gentleman is not well pleased with Dr. Wall in making this
          concession, that the Petrobrusians were Antipaedobaptists; though it
          is some comfort to him, that he tells him, that their opinion seems to
          have been in a short time extinguished and forgotten. But this opinion
          of theirs not only continued among Henry and his followers, who
          succeeded the Petrobrusians, but among the people afterwards called
          Waldenses; who to this day own Peter Bruis for one of their Barbs or
          Parrots, as will be seen hereafter. However, that we may have no
          credit from these people, they are branded as denying the other
          ordinance of the Lord’s Supper; and as saying, it is not to be
          administered since Christ’s time. But what Dr. Wall[9] afterwards
          cites from the abbot of Clugny, will serve to explain this, and shew,
          that their meaning is only, that the real presence of Christ in the
          supper, was only at the time when it was administered by him to the
          disciples; who makes them to say, "the body of Christ was only once
          made by himself the supper, before his passion, and was only, namely
          at this time, given to his disciples; since that time it was never
          made by any one, nor given to any one;" or as it is expressed from the
          same popish writer by Dr. Allix,[10]
        </p>
        <p>
          "The fourth (article ascribed by the abbot to the Petrobrusians)
          consisted not only in denying the truth of the body and blood of our
          Lord, which is offered up every day, and continually by the sacrament
          of the church; but also in maintaining, that it was nothing, and ought
          not to be offered." Upon which the Doctor makes this remark: "The
          fourth heresy is expressed in very odious terms, and after the popish
          manner, who own nothing to be real in the sacrament, if the flesh of
          Jesus Christ and his blood be not there in substance; and who do not
          believe he is present at the sacrament upon any other account, but as
          he is offered up to God before he is eaten." It was the real presence
          in the supper, and not that itself, these people denied; so that they
          were brave champions for the purity of both ordinances, equally
          rejecting Infant-baptism and the doctrine of transubstantiation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As for the other instances of persons denying Infant-baptism after
          Peter Bruis, produced by me; this writer, from Dr. Wall, would fain
          fasten the charge of Manicheism upon them, and so as denying all
          water-baptism; I say, from Dr. Wall, for what he here says, and indeed
          there is scarce any thing in this whole chapter about the antiquity of
          Infant-baptism, but what is borrowed from him, this Gentleman having
          no stock of his own; that, in fact, instead of answering Mr. Clark, I
          am answering Dr. Wall. As for those Evervinus writes of to Bernard,
          about the year 1140, there he observes, from Dr. Wall, held a tenet
          which shews them to be Manichees; though Evervinus[11] distinguishes
          them from the Manichees, namely, "all marriage they call fornication,
          except that which was between two virgins;" but this was not one of
          the principles of the Manichees, who condemned all marriage; whereas
          these allowed of the marriage of persons who had never been married
          before; they only condemned second marriage; a notion which had
          prevailed with some of the Christian fathers before the Manichees were
          in being; and this was the notion of some of the apostolics, and very
          probably of them all, the same Bernard makes mention of; and who, very
          likely, as I have observed, were the followers of Henry; and against
          these, this author has nothing of Manicheism: Here Dr. Wall fails him;
          and here it may be remarked what Mezeray says, "in the year 1163,
          there were two sorts of heretics; the one ignorant and loose, who were
          a sort of Manichees; the other more learned, and remote from such
          filthiness, who held much the same opinions as the Calvinists, and
          were called Henricians;" so that the followers of Henry were a
          distinct people from the Manichees; but as for those the Bishop of
          Arles takes notice of, our author’s remark upon them is, "it may be
          said, these heretics might be some of "the Manichean sect;" fine proof
          indeed! what he farther adds is more probable, "as perhaps they were
          some remains of the Petrobrusians;" so that it appears, that their
          opinion, which seems to have been in a short time extinguished and
          forgotten, continued however to the year 1215. As for the Gascoiners,
          that came over into England in the year 1158, and asserted, that
          infants ought not to be baptized till they come to the age of
          understanding; this, our author says, is no more than what a Manichee
          might say then, and a Quaker now; though they both disown all
          water-baptism. What! to say, that infants ought not to be baptized
          till they come to the age of understanding? is this talking like a
          Manichee or a Quaker? Does not this suppose that they may be baptized,
          when they come to the age of understanding, and know what they do? But
          this writer adds, it appears that these rejected both the sacraments
          of the New Testament, detecting holy baptism, and the Eucharist: so
          they did, they detested Infant-baptism as an human invention, and
          transubstantiation as an idol of the Pope of Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. To what I have said concerning Bruno and Berengarius, and their
          opposition to Infant-baptism 100 years before the Petrobrusians, I
          would only add; that Peter Bruis was not the author of a new sect,
          though his followers were so called by the Papists, to suggest that
          they were so; whereas, they were the same with the Berengarians, and
          held the same principles as the Berengarians did, both with respect to
          baptism and the Lord’s-Supper; and what were their sentiments
          concerning these are well known.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Gundulphus and his followers, another instance of persons denying
          Infant-baptism as early as the year 1025, are represented as Manichees
          and Quakers, in the point of baptism; and both Mr. Stennett and myself
          are charged with great unfairness, partiality and disingenuity, in
          leaving out what Dr. Allix has said concerning these men, namely,
          "that in the same examination, being further interrogated, these men
          confessed, that they thought water-baptism of no use or necessity to
          any one, infants or adult."[12] This is cited from Dr. Wall, an author
          not always to be depended upon, and particularly here; for Dr. Allix
          gives no account of any further interrogation of these men, by Gerard
          bishop of Cambray, as is suggested; nor are these words to be found in
          him; for though the men at their first, and only interrogation, speak
          of the non-necessity and unavailableness of baptism to salvation; and,
          as Dr. Allix observes, said some things slightly of baptism, in
          opposition to the prevailing notions of those times, about the
          absolute necessity and efficacy of baptism to salvation; yet he is
          quite clear, that they were for the thing itself: "It is easy to
          judge, says he,[13] that they looked upon baptism only as a mystical
          ceremony, the end of which was to express the engagement of him who is
          baptized, and the vow he makes to live holy." Gundulphus, adds he,
          "seeing them, (the popish priests) assert, that whosoever was baptized
          could never be damned, falls to an indifference for baptism; thinking
          it sufficient to keep to the essentials of that sacrament." From
          whence it is plain, he did not deny it, nor disuse it; and upon the
          whole it is evident, Dr. Wall has abused Mr. Stennett, and this
          Gentleman both him and myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. It is observed, that a large stride is taken by me from the
          Eleventh to the Fourth century, not being able in the space of more
          than 600 years to find one instance of an opposer of Infant-baptism:
          this will not seem so strange to those who know what a time of
          ignorance this was; partly through the prevalence of popery, and
          partly through the inundation of the barbarous nations, which brought
          a flood of darkness upon the empire; and very few witnesses arose
          against the superstitions of the church of some; yet there were some
          in the valleys of Piedmont, even from the times of the apostles, and
          during this interval, as learned men have observed, that bore their
          testimony against corruptions in doctrine and practice; among which,
          this of Infant-baptism must be reckoned one; and whole successors, as
          we have seen already in the Berengarians, and the Petrobrusians, and
          will be seen again in the Waldenses, bore witness against this
          innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Though I did not insist upon the Pelagians and others being against
          Infant-baptism, which some have allowed; this writer is pleased to
          reproach me with a good-will to admit such heretics, as our
          predecessors; and this is not the only instance of this sort of
          reflection; whereas truth is truth, let it be espoused by whom it
          will; and it might be retorted, that Infant-baptism has been practiced
          by the worst of heretics, and retained by the man of sin and his
          followers in all the Antichristian states; and this writer thinks it
          worth his pains to rescue the above heretics and schismatics out of
          our hands; and yet, after all, some of the followers of Pelagius at
          least argued, that the infants of believers ought not to be baptized;
          and that for this reason, because they were holy, as[14] Austin
          affirms; and who also observes,[15] that some other patrons argued
          against it, and the unprofitableness of it to infants, who for the
          most part died before they knew any thing of it; and Jerom,[16] his
          contemporary, supposes it, and reasons upon it, that some Christians
          refused to give baptism to their children. So that even in the fourth
          century, though Infant-baptism greatly prevailed, yet it was not so
          general, as that not one man contemporary with Austin can be produced,
          as setting himself against it, as our author avers; nay Stephen
          Marshall, a great stickler for Infant-baptism, in his famous sermon on
          this subject,[17] owns, that some in the times of Austin questioned
          it, and refers to a discourse of his in proof of it; and the canon of
          the council at Carthage, produced by me, notwithstanding all that this
          writer says, is a full proof of the same. For surely, no man in his
          senses can ever think, that a council consisting of all the bishops in
          Africa, should agree to anathematize their own brethren, who were in
          the same opinion with them about Infant-baptism; only thought it
          should not be administered to them as soon as born, but be deferred
          till they were eight days old; they that can believe this, can believe
          any thing; and besides, is not a child of eight days old a child newly
          born? Lastly, after all, Tertullian, in the beginning of the third
          century, as he was the first we know of that made mention of
          Infant-baptism, did oppose it, and dissuade from it; so that it must
          be once more said, it was called in question, debated and opposed
          twelve or thirteen hundred years before the madmen of Munster, as well
          as in some of the intervening centuries. It remains now, Sir, to
          defend what I have said concerning the Waldenses; and it should be
          observed,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That these people had not their name from Waldus, as the first
          founder of their sect: this Dr. Allix has undertook to make out beyond
          all possible contradiction, and he has done it. These people were
          before his time called Vaudois, Vallenses or Wallenses, from their
          inhabiting the valleys; which name was afterwards changed to
          Waldenses, when the design was said to make men believe that Valda or
          Waldus was their first founder, that they might be taken for a new and
          upstart people; whereas they were in being long before Waldus, who
          received his light and doctrine from them, and whose followers joined
          them; and this observation sets aside the exceptions of our author to
          the testimonies of Peter Bruis, their confession of faith in 1120, and
          their noble lesson 1100, as being before the times of the Waldenses;
          that is, before the times of Waldo, more properly speaking; and by how
          much the more ancient these testimonies are, by so much the greater is
          their evidence in point of antiquity, as to these peoples denial of
          Infant-baptism; and more strongly prove that the ancient Vallenses,
          afterwards corruptly called Waldenses, were against it, and for adult
          baptism. These people were not divided into various sects, but were a
          body of people of one and the same faith and practice, which they
          retained from father to son, as their usual phrase is, time out of
          mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is true, they were called by different names, by their
          adversaries; some given them by way of reproach, others from their
          leaders and teachers, as Petrobrusians, Henricians, Arnoldists,
          Waldensians, Etc. from Peter Bruis, Henry, Arnold, Waldus; but still
          they were the same people; just as the Papists, at the Reformation,
          made as many heads of distinct parties, as these were men of note in
          that work. Thus for instance, the Petrobrusians were not a distinct
          sect of this people, but the very people called Vallenses, afterwards
          Waldenses; and the same may be said of the rest: nor were there any
          sect among them of the Manichean principle, or any of them tinctured
          with that heresy, as Dr. Allix has abundantly proved. The care, as he
          makes it appear, was this; that there were Manichees in the places
          where the Valdenses and Albigenses lived, but not that joined them;
          their enemies took the advantage of this, and called them by the same
          name, and ascribed the same opinions to them, especially if they could
          find any thing in them familiar to them: thus for instance, because
          they denied Infant-baptism, therefore they were against all
          Water-baptism, and so Manichees; for as Dr. Allix[18] observes, "in
          those barbarous and cruel ages, a small conformity of opinions with
          the Manichees, was a sufficient ground to accuse them of Manicheism,
          who opposed any doctrine received by the church of some: Thus would
          they have taken the Anabaptists for downright Manichees, says he,
          because they condemned the baptism of infants:" and Mr. Clark cannot
          object to this observation, since he himself argues from the denial of
          Infant-baptism, to the denial of baptism itself; and has represented
          me as a Manichee, or a Quaker, for no other reason, but for the denial
          of Infant-baptism; and if his book lives to the next age, and is of
          any authority, and can find people foolish enough to believe it, I
          must be set down for a Manichee or a Quaker. Indeed I must confess, I
          once thought, giving too much credit to Dr. Wall, that there were
          different sects among the Waldenses, and some of them Manichees, and
          of other erroneous principles, which I now retract.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is not true what this writer from Dr. Wall affirms; "This is
          certain, that no one author, that calls the people he writes of
          Waldenses, does impute to them the denial of Infant-baptism;" for
          Claudius Couffard, writing against them, under this name, gives an
          extract of their errors out of Raynerius, and this is one of them;
          "They say, then first a man is baptized, when he is received into
          their sect; some of them hold that baptism is of no advantage to
          infants, because they cannot yet actually believe;" and concludes this
          extract thus, "from whence you may see, courteous reader, that this
          sect of the Waldenses, and the chief, yea almost all heretics now in
          vogue, are not of late invention, etc." and were this true, yet it is
          a mere evasion, and a foolish one; since the names of Henricians,
          Arnoldists, Cathari, Apostolici, etc. under which they are
          represented, as opposers of Infant-baptism, are the names of the
          Waldenlses, as Perrin[19] observes, a writer whom our author says he
          has read.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is a most clear case, that the ancient barbs or pastors of the
          Waldensian churches, so called, were opposers of Infant-baptism. Sir
          Samuel Moreland, as I have observed, reckons Peter Bruis and Henry
          among their ancient pallors; to does Perrin likewise, though he is
          mistaken in making them to follow Waldo; and these are allowed to be
          Antipaedobaptists by several Paedobaptists themselves. Arnoldus,
          another of their parrots, according to the above writer, from whence
          they were called Arnoldists, was out of all doubt a denier of
          Infant-baptism, for which he was condemned by a council, as Dr. Wall
          owns. Lollardo was another of their pastors, according to the same
          authors, and from whole name, Perrin says, the Waldenses were called
          Lollards; and so Kilianus says,[20] a Lollard is also called a
          Waldensian heretic. These were not the followers of Wickliff, as our
          author wrongly asserts; for they were, as Dr. Allix[21] observes, more
          ancient than the Wicklifites; and though this name was afterwards
          given to the latter, Lollardo was here in England, and had his
          followers before Wickliff’s time; and so he had in Flanders and
          Germany; and of the Lollards there, Trithemius[22] says, they derided
          the sacrament of baptism; which cannot be understood of their deriding
          baptism in general, but of their deriding Infant-baptism; which was
          common among the Papists to say; and the same is the sense of the
          Lollards in England, who are charged with making light of the
          sacrament of baptism. Now since these were the sentiments of the
          ancient pastors of the Waldenses, it is reasonable to believe the
          people themselves were of the same mind with them; nor are there any
          confessions of their faith, which make any mention of Infant-baptism;
          nor any proofs of its being practiced by them until the sixteenth
          century, produced by our author, or any other.

          5. The Albigenses, as Perrin[23] says, differ nothing at all from the
          Waldenses, in their belief; but are only so called of the country of
          Albi; where they dwelt, and had their first beginning; and who
          received the belief of the Waldenses by means of Peter Bruis, Henry
          and Arnold; who, as it clearly appears, were all Antipaedobaptists;
          and Dr. Allix[24] observes, that the Albigenses have been called
          Petrobrusians; owned to be a sect of the Waldenses, that denied
          Infant-baptism: and that the Albigenses denied it, at least some of
          them, yea the greatest part of them, is acknowledged by some
          Paedobaptists themselves. Chassanion in his history of these people
          says;[25] "some writers have affirmed, that the Albigeois approved not
          of the baptism of infants. —I cannot deny that the Albigeois for the
          greatest part were of that opinion. —The truth is, they did not reject
          this sacrament, or say it was useless, (as some, he before observes,
          asserted they did) but only counted it unnecessary to infants, because
          they are not of age to believe, or capable of giving evidence of their
          faith." Which is another proof of the ancient Waldenses being against
          Infant-baptism, these being the same with them. Upon the whole, if I
          have been too modest, in saying that the ancient Waldenses practiced
          Infant-baptism, wants proof, I shall now use a little more boldness
          and confidence, and alarm, that the ancient Vallenses, or as corruptly
          called Waldenses, were opposers of Infant-baptism; and that no proof
          can be given of the practice of it among them till the sixteenth
          century; and that the author of the dialogue had no reason to say,
          that their being in the practice of adult baptism, and denying
          Infant-baptism, was a mere chimaera and a groundless figment.

          My fourth chapter, you know, Sir, respects the argument for
          Infant-baptism, taken from the covenant made with Abraham, and from
          circumcision. Here our author runs out into a large discussion of the
          covenant of grace, in his way; in which he spends about fourscore
          pages, which I take to be the heads of some old sermons, he is fond
          of, and has taken this opportunity of publishing them to the world,
          without any propriety or pertinence. For, 1. not to dispute the point
          with him, whether there are two distinct covenants of redemption and
          grace, or whether they are one and the same, which is foreign to the
          argument; be it that they are two distinct ones, the spiritual seed
          promised to Christ, or the people given him in the one, are the same
          that are taken into the other; they are of equal extent; there are no
          more in the one, than there are concerned in the other; and this
          writer himself allows, "that the salvation of the spiritual seed of
          Christ is promised in both covenants." Now let it be proved, if it
          can, that there are any in the covenant of grace but the spiritual
          seed of Christ; and that the natural seed of believers, and their
          infants as such, are the spiritual seed: and if they are, then they
          were given to Christ, who undertook to save them, and whose salvation
          was promised to him, and to whom in time the communications of grace
          according to the covenant are made; then they must be all of them
          regenerated, renewed, and sanctified, justified, pardoned, adopted,
          persevere in grace, and be eternally saved; all which will not, cannot
          be said of all the infants of believers; and consequently cannot be
          thought to be in the covenant of grace.

          2. As to what he says concerning the conditionality of the covenant,
          it is all answered in one word; let him name what he will, as the
          condition of this covenant, which God has not absolutely promised, or
          thrift: has not engaged to perform, or to see performed in his people,
          or by them. Are the conditions, faith and repentance? These are both
          included in the new heart, and spirit, and heart of flesh, God has
          absolutely promised in the covenant, Ezek 36:26. Is new, spiritual,
          and evangelical obedience, the condition? This is absolutely promised
          as the former, verse 27. Or is it actual consent? Thy people shall be
          willing (Ps 110:3). And after all, if it is a conditional covenant,
          how do infants get into it? Or is it a conditional covenant to the
          adult, and unconditional to them? If faith and repentance are the
          conditions of it, and these must be, as this author says, "the
          sinner’s own voluntary chosen acts, before he can have any actual
          saving interest in the privileges of the covenant;" it follows, that
          they cannot be in it, or have interest in the privileges of it, till
          they repent and believe, and do these as their own voluntary chosen
          acts; and if "man’s consent and agreement bring him into covenant with
          God," as this writer says; it should be considered, whether infants
          are capable of this consent, or no; and if they are not, according to
          this man, they stand a poor chance for being in the covenant.
        </p>

          3. Whereas the covenant of grace, as to the essence of it, has been
          always the same, as is allowed, under the various forms and
          administrations of it, both under the Old and New Testament; so the
          subjects of it have been, and are the same, the spiritual seed of
          Christ, and none else; and not the carnal seed of men as such: and if
          the conditions of it are the same, faith and obedience, as our author
          observes, then infants must stand excluded from it, since they can
          neither believe nor obey.
