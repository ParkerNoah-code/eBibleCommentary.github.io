            of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost ; teaching them
            t, observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and, Lo, I am

          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >1. That baptism was divinely instituted as an ordinance of the
            Christian religion and administered by inspired apostles to both
            Jews and Gentiles is plain from the preceding remarks.</span
          >

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >2. There is no intimation that the law of baptism was designed to
            be restricted to any nation or limited to any period of time. It is
            a general law, without any restriction, except that which refers to
            character—"he that believeth."</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >3. A divine law must continue obligatory until it is repealed by
            divine authority. There is no intimation in the Scriptures that the
            law of baptism has been repealed, and therefore there is no reason
            to suppose its obligation has ceased.</span
          >

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >4. The perpetuity of this Christian ordinance is plainly implied in
            the promise: "Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the
            world." Matt. 28:20. This important promise was given at the time
            the ordinance was instituted, and it plainly supposes the
            continuance of baptism "even to the end of the world."</span
          >

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >5. Baptism is connected with the most important doctrines, duties,
            and privileges of the gospel. The Saviour connects it with the
            doctrine of the Trinity; preaching and believing the gospel;
            fulfilling all righteousness; and the promise of salvation. (Matt.
            28:19; Mark 16:16; Matt. 3:15) Paul connects it with the death,
            burial, and resurrection of Christ; with the believer's dying unto
            sin, living unto God, and putting on Christ. (I Cor. 15:3, 4; Gal.
            3:27) He connects it also with "one body, one Spirit, one hope, one
            Lord, one faith, one God and Father of all." (Eph. 4:4-6) Peter
            connects it with the "remission of sins." (Acts 2:38) And also, with
            salvation, and a good conscience. (I Peter 3:21) To discontinue the
            ordinance would be to dissolve its connection with all these
            doctrines, duties, and privileges. And who, without authority from
            the divine Author of the institution, can do this with
            impunity?</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >6. Baptism answers all the purposes at this day which is answered
            in the first age of Christianity, and these are as needful now as
            they were then. No reason can be assigned for the observance of the
            ordinance in the apostles' days, which will not apply in all its
            force to believers in every age of the Christian church.</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >7. The above considerations afford incontestable proof of the
            perpetuity of Christian baptism, and shew that its observance is as
            obligatory at present as it was in the days of the apostles, and
            that it will continue to be so until the consummation of all
            things.</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >To suppose that the necessity of water baptism is superseded by the
            baptism of the Holy Ghost is manifestly erroneous. For supposing
            every believer were as truly baptized in the Holy Ghost as Cornelius
            was, this would in no wise diminish his obligation to be baptized in
            water. Did not the apostle Peter command the Pentecostian converts
            to be baptized? And is it not expressly recorded that they were
            baptized?

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >Did not the same inspired apostle command Cornelius and his friends
            to be baptized in water, and assign their being baptized in the Holy
            Ghost as a reason for their being baptized in water? "Can any man
            forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received
            the Holy Ghost as well as we?" Is it not strange that what an
            inspired apostle urged as a reason for the observance of water
            baptism should be adduced by some professing Christians as a reason
            for their neglect of that baptism?</span
