            >The following reasons have been given by the Baptists why they
            baptize ONLY professing Christians:</span
          >
        </p>

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >1. Because our Lord Jesus Christ, when he was about to ascend to
            heaven commanded it. Matt. 28:19-20; Mark 16:15. As the command is
            so plain, positive, and solemn, they feel bound to reverence his
            authority and will.</span
          >
        </p>

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >2. Because the Saviour condescended to set his people an example,
            and requires them to follow in his steps. Matt. 3:13-19. Mark
            1:9-11. Luke 3:21-22. 1 Pet. 2:21. He came from Galilee to Jordan,
            three days' journey, to John to be baptized of him, and he was
            baptized of John in Jordan.</span
          >
        </p>

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >3. Because baptism is acknowledged to be from heaven, or a divine
            institution. John was sent by God himself to baptize in water. John
            1:33. This the Jews knew, though when Jesus put the question to them
            they pleaded ignorance, because they were ashamed or afraid to
            confess it. Matt. 11:24-27. Mark 11:29-33.</span
          >
        </p>

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >4. Because baptism is a part of the counsel of God which they dare
            not reject, oppose, or disregard. Luke 7:29-30. If God by his
            servants commands us to do it, shall we not obey? If the Pharisees
            and lawyers are found guilty for rejecting it, how can Christians be
            excused if they imitate their conduct?</span
          >
        </p>

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >5. Because baptism was administered by the Apostles of our Lord in
            his presence, by his command, and under his sanction. John 3:22.
            4:2. If the Apostles baptized because Jesus commanded, so should we;
            and if he sanctioned them, no doubt but he will sanction us.</span
          >
        </p>

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >6. Because primitive Christians considered it a privilege to be
            baptized in the name of Jesus, and it has undergone no change since
            that time. Acts 8:36-39. 10:46-48. 18:8. How anxious the Eunuch
            appeared to be baptized, and Peter demanded a reason why the
            Centurion, and his friends who believed, should not enjoy the same
            privilege.</span
          >
        </p>

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >7. Because baptism is the answer of a good conscience toward God. 1
            Pet. 3:21. When a man believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, he begins
            to search the Scriptures with prayer and anxious desire to know the
            will of God; whatever he discovers to be plainly revealed he
            receives, and whatever is positively commanded an honest conscience
            requires him to perform: seeing baptism to be a plain and positive
            institution of the Lord Jesus Christ, he cannot answer the demands
            of his conscience but by attending to it. He must be baptized or sin
            against his conscience and against God: but in baptism the
            requirement of conscience is answered, and his mind is set at
            rest.</span
          >
        </p>

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >8. Because baptism is an instructive ordinance, setting forth the
            doctrine of salvation by the vicarious sufferings, death, and
            resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. Luke 12:50. Rom. 6:3-5 Col.
            2:12. Jesus was baptized in sufferings, sorrows, and death: he arose
            from the grave, and so effected our deliverance from the law, sin,
            and death. Paul tells us that we were circumcised IN him as our
            Representative, but we are buried WITH him by baptism, as our living
            head.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >We are planted TOGETHER in the likeness of his death, and we shall
            be also in the likeness of his resurrection. It teaches us also what
            is requisite to church membership under the gospel, as REPENTANCE,
            Acts 2:38: FAITH, Acts 8:36-37: CONFESSION, Rom. 10:9-10. Those only
            ought to be church-members who are in the way of salvation, but
            those only can be said to be in the way who repent of sin, believe
            in Jesus, and confess his name. Mark 8:38.</span
          >
        </p>

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >9. Because God still honors the baptism of believers by immersion,
            to the conversion of sinners and the edification of saints: we
            seldom find the ordinance administered without this being the case,
            and would God thus sanction what is contrary to his word or opposed
            to his will?</span
          >
        </p>

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >10. Because they desire to glorify God in obeying his commands;
            they believe all his commands flow from wisdom, love, and grace; and
            therefore desire to walk in them to his glory, and their own profit:
            and we find that in keeping his commandments there is a great
            reward. Ps. 19:11.</span

        </p>

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >11. Because baptism by immersion is now generally considered to be
            a cross; and they would not avoid any cross which is laid in their
            way by their divine Master: but would take it up and cheerfully
            carry it after him, singing:</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P1">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4">
              "Through floods and flames, if Jesus lead,<br />
                 I'll follow where he goes<br />
                 Hinder me not, shall be my cry,<br />
                Though earth and hell oppose."</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >12. Because they would not live in any allowed sin, which they must
            do if they did not baptize; for:</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P2">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >a. They view baptism as a good and holy ordinance of Jesus Christ,
            and are told that he that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to
            him it is sin. James 4:17.</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P2">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >b. They view it as a part of the divine Master's perceptive will,
            and they consider that they are bound to obey him; and he that
            knoweth his Master's will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many
            stripes. Luke 12:47.</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P2">
          <span class="Normal-C-C4"
            >c. They view it as an acknowledgment of Christ's kingly office and
            authority; therefore, neglecting to attend to it would be sin. Rom.

            people, that they should believe on him which should come after him,
            that is, on Christ Jesus,' Acts 19:4. All baptized by John in the
            river Jordan, confessed their sins, Mark 1:5. John's baptism of
            repentance, confession of sins, and faith in the coming Messiah,
            could not be the baptism of infants.</span

            hearts' inquired 'What shall we do? Peter said unto them, Repent and
            be baptized every one of you.' And 'they that gladly received his
            word were baptized,' Acts 2:37-41. On this occasion 'about three

            infants never. This would be unaccountable, were it the will of God
            that infants should be baptized.

            >“Had the Saviour commissioned the apostles to baptize; infants, it
            would have been their duty to baptize all infants. Had they baptized
            all infants, their baptism would have been one of the most important
            acts of the apostles; in that case would it not be strange indeed
            that Luke, in writing the Acts of the Apostles, never mentions; the
            baptism of infants as one of their acts? He plainly tells us they
            baptized men and women, but never tells us they baptized infants. We
            cannot account for the entire omission of infant baptism in the
            written Acts of the Apostles, without admitting its entire omission
            in their living acts."</span

            He says, "The Church adhered rigidly to the principle, as
            constituting the true purport of the baptism ordained by Christ,
            that no one can be a member of the communion of saints, but by his
            own solemn vow made in the presence of the Church. It was with this
            understanding that the candidate for baptism was immersed in water,
            and admitted as a brother, upon his confession of the Father, the
            Son, and the Holy Ghost."</span

            ably edited and published, “Pedobaptism, in the more modern sense,
            meaning thereby the baptism of new-born infants, with the vicarious
            promises of parents or sponsors, was utterly unknown in the early
            church; not only down to the end of the second, but indeed to the
            middle of the 3rd century.”</span
