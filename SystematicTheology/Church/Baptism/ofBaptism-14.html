        <h2>Infant Baptism: A Part and Pillar of Popery</h2>
        <p>
          Being called upon, in a public manner, to give proof of what I have
          said concerning infant-baptism, in a preface to my reply to Mr.
          Clarke’s Defense, etc. or to expunge it, I readily agree to the
          former, and shall endeavor to explain myself, and defend what I have
          written; but it will be proper first to recite the whole paragraph,
          which stands thus: "The Paedobaptists are ever restless and uneasy,
          endeavoring to maintain and support, if possible, their unscriptural
          practice of infant-baptism; though it is no other than a pillar of
          popery; that by which Antichrist has spread his baneful influence over
          many nations; is the basis of national churches and worldly
          establishments; that which unites the church and world, and keeps them
          together; nor can there be a full separation of the one from the
          other, nor a thorough reformation in religion; until it is wholly
          removed: and though it has so long and largely obtained, and still
          does obtain; I believe with a firm and unshaken faith, that the time
          is hastening on, when infant-baptism will be no more practiced in the
          world; when churches will be formed on the same plan they were in the
          times of the apostles; when gospel-doctrine and discipline will be
          restored to their primitive luster and purity; when the ordinances of
          baptism and the Lord’s Supper will be administered as they were first
          delivered, clear of all present corruption and superstition; all which
          will be accomplished, when "The Lord shall be king over all the earth,
          and there shall be one Lord and his name one." Now the whole of this
          consists of several articles or propositions, which I shall reconsider
          in their order.
        </p>
        <p>
          That infant-baptism is a part and pillar of popery; that by which
          Antichrist has spread his baneful influence over many nations: I use
          the phrase infant-baptism here and throughout, because of the common
          use of it; otherwise the practice which now obtains, may with greater
          propriety be called infant-sprinkling. That unwritten traditions with
          the Papists are equally the rule of faith and practice as the holy
          Scriptures will not be doubted of by any conversant with their
          writings. The Council of Trent asserts that "Traditions respecting
          both faith and manners orally delivered and preserved successfully in
          the Catholic church, are to be received with equal affection of piety
          and reverence as the books of the Old and New Testaments;" yea the
          Popish writers prefer traditions to the Scriptures. Bellarmine says,
          "Scriptures without tradition, are neither simply necessary, nor
          sufficient, but unwritten traditions are necessary. Tradition alone is
          sufficient, but the Scriptures are not sufficient." Another of their
          writers asserts, that "The authority of ecclesiastic traditions is
          more fit than the scriptures to ascertain anything doubtful, even that
          which may be made out from scripture, since the common opinion of the
          church and ecclesiastical tradition are clearer, and more open and
          truly inflexible; when, on the contrary, the scriptures have
          frequently much obscurity in them, and may be drawn here and there
          like a nose of wax; and, as a leaden rule, may be applied to every
          impious opinion." Bailey the Jesuit, thus expresses himself, "I will
          go further and say, we have as much need of tradition as of scripture,
          yea more; because the scripture ministers to us only the dead and mute
          letter, but tradition, by means of the ministry of the church, gives
          us the true sense, which is not had distinctly in the scripture;
          wherein, notwithstanding, rather consists the word of God than in the
          alone written letter; it is sufficient for a good Catholic, if he
          understands it is tradition, nor need he to inquire after anything
          else;" and by tradition, they mean not tradition delivered in the
          Scripture, but distinct from it and out of it; unwritten tradition,
          apostolical tradition, as they frequently call it, not delivered by
          the apostles in the sacred Scriptures, but by word of mouth to their
          successors, or to the churches; that we may not mistake them.
          Andradius tells us, "That of necessity those traditions also must be
          believed, which can be proved by no testimony of scripture:" and
          Petrus a Soto still more plainly and openly affirms: "It is," says he,
          "a rule infallible and catholic, that whatsoever things the church of
          Rome believeth, holdeth and keepeth, and are not delivered in the
          scriptures, the same came by tradition from the apostles; also all
          such observations and ceremonies, whose beginning, author, and
          original are not known, or cannot be found, out of all doubt they were
          delivered by the apostles." This is what is meant by apostolic
          tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the essentials of popery, or the peculiarities of it, are all
          founded upon this, even upon apostolic and ecclesiastic tradition;
          this is the Pandora from whence they all spring; this is the rule to
          which all are brought, and by which they are confirmed; and what is
          it, be it ever so foolish, impious and absurd, but what may be proved
          hereby, if this is admitted of as a rule and test? It is upon this
          foot the Papists assert and maintain the observation of Easter, on the
          Lord’s Day following the 14th of March, the fast of Quadragesima or
          Lent, the adoration of images and relics, the invocation of saints,
          the worship of the sign of the cross, the sacrifices of the mass,
          transubstantiation, the abrogation of the use of the cup in the Lord’s
          Supper, holy water, extreme unction or the chrism, prayers for the
          dead, auricular confession, sale of pardons, purgatory, pilgrimages,
          monastic vows, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among apostolical traditions infant-baptism is to be reckoned, and it
          is upon this account it is pleaded for. The first person that asserted
          infant-baptism and approved it, represents it as a tradition from the
          apostles, whether he be Origen, or his translator and interpolator,
          Ruffinus; his words are, "For this (i.e., for original sin) the church
          has received a tradition from the apostles, even to give baptism unto
          infants." Austin, who was a warm advocate for infant-baptism, puts it
          upon this footing, as a custom of the church, not to be despised, and
          as an apostolic tradition generally received by the church; he lived
          in the fourth century, the same Ruffinus did; and probably it was from
          his Latin translation of Origen, Austin took the hint of
          infant-baptism being an apostolic tradition, since no other
          ecclesiastical writer speaks of it before as such; so that, as Bishop
          Taylor observes, "This apostolical tradition is but a testimony of one
          person, and he condemned of many errors; so that, as he says, to
          derive this from the apostles on no greater authority, is a great
          argument that he is credulous and weak, that shall be determined by so
          weak a probation, in a matter of so great concernment.;" and yet it is
          by this that many are determined in this affair: and not only Popish
          writers, as Bellarmine and others make it to be an apostolical
          tradition unwritten; but some Protestant-Paedobaptists show a good
          will to place infant-baptism among the unwritten sayings and
          traditions of Christ or His apostles, and satisfy themselves
          therewith. Mr. Fuller says, "We do freely confess that there is
          neither express precept nor precedent in the New Testament for the
          baptizing of infants;" yet observes that St. John saith, (Jn 21:25),
          "And there are also many other things, which Jesus did, which are not
          written; among, which for ought appears to the contrary, the baptizing
          of these infants (those whom Christ took in his arms and blessed)
          might be one of them." In like manner, Mr. Walker argues, "It doth not
          follow our Savior gave no precept for the baptizing of infants,
          because no such precept is particularly expressed in the scripture;
          for our Savior spoke many things to his disciples concerning the
          kingdom of God, both before his passion, and also after his
          resurrection, which are not written in the scriptures; and who can
          say, but that among those many unwritten sayings of his, there might
          be an express precept for infant-baptism?" And Mr. Leigh, one of the
          disputants in the Portsmouth-Disputation , suggests, that though
          infant-baptism is not to be found in the writings of the apostle Paul
          extant in the scriptures, yet it might be in some writings of his
          which are lost, and not now extant; all which is plainly giving up
          infant-baptism as contained in the sacred writings, and placing it
          upon unwritten, apostolical tradition, and that too, conjectural and
          uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now infant-baptism, with all the ceremonies attending it, for which
          also apostolical tradition is pleaded, makes a very considerable
          figure in the Popish pageantry; which according to pretended
          apostolical tradition, is performed in a very pompous manner, as by
          consecration of the water, using sponsors, who answer to the
          interrogatories, and make the renunciation in the name of the infant,
          exorcisms, exsufflations, crossings, the use of salt, spittle, and
          oil. Before the party is baptized, the water is consecrated in a very
          solemn manner; the priest makes an exorcism first; three times, he
          exsufflates or breathes into the water, in the figure of a cross,
          saying, "I adjure thee, O creature of water;" and here he divides the
          water after the manner of a cross, and makes three or four crossings;
          he takes a horn of oil, and pours it three times upon the water in the
          likeness of a cross, and makes a prayer, that the font may be
          sanctified, and the eternal Trinity be present; saying, "Descend from
          heaven and sanctify this water, and give grace and virtue, that he who
          is baptized according to the command of thy Christ, may be crucified,
          and die, and be buried, and rise again with him." The sponsors, or
          sureties, instead of the child, and in its name, recite the creed and
          the Lord’s prayer, make the renunciation of the devil and all his
          works, and answer to questions put in the name of the child: the form,
          according to the Roman order, is this:
        </p>
        <p>
          "The name of the infant being called, the presbyter must say, Dost
          thou renounce Satan? A. I do renounce; and all his works? A. I do
          renounce; and all his pomps? A. I do renounce: three times these
          questions are put, and three times the sureties answer." The
          interrogations are sometimes said to be made by a priest, sometimes by
          a presbyter, and sometimes by an exorcist, who was one or the other,
          and to which the following question also was added: "Dost thou believe
          in God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth, etc.? A. I
          believe." Children to be baptized are first exsufflated or breathed
          and blown upon and exorcised, that the wicked spirit might be driven
          from them, that they might be delivered from the power of darkness,
          and translated into the kingdom of Christ: the Roman order is, "Let
          him (the minister, priest, deacon or exorcist) blow into the face of
          the person to be baptized, three times, saying, Go out thou unclean
          spirit, and give place to the Holy Ghost, the Comforter." The form,
          according to St. Gregory, is, "I exorcise thee, O unclean spirit, in
          the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, that
          thou go out and depart from this servant of God." Salt also is put
          into the mouth of the infant, after it is blessed and exorcised, as a
          token of its being seasoned with the salt of wisdom; and that it might
          be preserved from the corruption and ill savor of sin: the priest
          first blesses the salt after this manner: "I exorcise thee, O creature
          of salt; and then being blessed, it is put into the mouth of the
          infant saying, Receive the salt of wisdom unto life everlasting." The
          nose and ears of infants at their baptism are touched with spittle by
          the priest, that they may receive the savor of the knowledge of God,
          and their ears be opened to hear the commands of God; and formerly
          spittle was put upon the eyes and upon the tongue, though it seems now
          disused as to those parts; and yet no longer than the birth of King
          James the First, it seems to have been in use; since at his baptism
          his mother sent word to the archbishop to forbear the use of the
          spittle, saying, "She would not have a pocky priest to spit in her
          child’s mouth,;" for it seems the queen knew that the archbishop, who
          was Hamilton, Archbishop of St. Andrews, then had the venereal disease
          . And so in the times of the martyrs in Queen Mary’s days; for Robert
          Smith, the martyr, being asked by Bonner, in what point do we dissent
          from the word of God? meaning as to baptism; he answered, "First, in
          hallowing your water, in conjuring of the same, in baptizing children
          with anointing and spitting in their mouths, mingled with salt, and
          many other lewd ceremonies, of which not one point is able to be
          proved in God’s word." All which he calls a mingle mangle. Chrism, or
          anointing both before and after baptism, is another ceremony used at
          it; the parts anointed are the breast and shoulders; the breast, that
          no remains of the latent enemy may reside in the party baptized; and
          the shoulders, that he may be fortified and strengthened to do good
          works to the glory of God: this anointing is made in the form of a
          cross; the oil is put on the breast and beneath the shoulders, making
          a cross with the thumb; on making the cross on the shoulders, the
          priest says, "Flee, thou unclean spirit, give honor to the living and
          true God;" and when he makes it on the breast, he says, "Go out, thou
          unclean spirit, give place to the Holy Ghost:" the form used in doing
          it is "I anoint thee with the oil of salvation, that thou mayest have
          life everlasting." The next ceremony is that of signing the infant
          with the sign of the cross: this is made in several parts of the body,
          especially on the forehead, to signify that the party baptized should
          not be ashamed of the cross of Christ, and not be afraid of the enemy
          Satan, but manfully fight against him. After baptism, in ancient
          times, honey and milk, or wine and milk, were given to the baptized,
          though now disused; and infants were admitted to the Lord’s Supper,
          which continued some hundreds of years in the Latin church, and still
          does in the Greek church. Now for the proof of the use of these
          various ceremonies, the reader may consult Joseph Vicecomes, a learned
          Papist as Dr. Wall calls him, in his Treatise de Antiquis Baptismi
          Ritibus ac Ceremoniis, where and by whom they are largely treated of,
          and the proofs of them given. All which are rehearsed and condemned by
          the ancient Waldenses in a treatise of theirs, written in the year
          1120. It may be asked to what purpose is this account given of the
          ceremonies used by Papists in the administration of baptism to infants
          by them, since they are not used by Protestant-paedobaptists? I
          answer, it is to show what I proposed, namely, what a figure
          infant-baptism, with these attending ceremonies, makes in popery, and
          may with propriety be called a part of it; besides though all these
          ceremonies are not used, yet some of them are used in some
          Protestant-paedobaptist churches, as sureties, the interrogations made
          to them, and their answers in the name of infants; the renunciation of
          the devil and all his works, and signing with the sign of the cross;
          and since these and the others, all of them claim apostolic authority,
          and most, if not all of them, have as good and as early a claim to it
          as infant-baptism itself; those who admit that upon this foot, ought
          to admit these ceremonies also. See a treatise of mine, called The
          Argument from Apostolic Tradition in Favor of Infant-baptism
          Considered. Most of the above ceremonies are mentioned by Basil, who
          lived in the 4th century, and as then in use, and which were had from
          apostolic tradition as said, and not from the scriptures; and says he,
          "Because this is first and most common, I will mention it in the first
          place, as that we sign with the sign of the cross; —Who has taught
          this in Scripture? We consecrate the water of baptism and the oil of
          unction as well as him who receives baptism; from what scriptures? Is
          it not from private and secret tradition? Moreover the anointing with
          oil, what passage in scripture teaches this? Now a man is thrice
          immersed, from whence is it derived or delivered? Also the rest of
          what is done in baptism, as to renounce Satan and his angels, from
          what scripture have we it? Is not this from private and secret
          tradition?" And so Austin speaks of exorcisms and exsufflations used
          in baptism, as of ancient tradition, and of universal use in the
          church. Now whoever receives infant-baptism on the foot of apostolic
          tradition, ought to receive those also, since they stand upon as good
          a foundation as that does.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Papists attribute the rise of several of the above ceremonies to
          their popes, as sponsors, chrisms, exorcisms, etc., though perhaps
          they were not quite so early as they imagine, yet very early they
          were; and infant-baptism itself, though two or three doctors of the
          church had asserted and espoused it, yet it was not determined in any
          council until the Milevitan Council in 418, or thereabouts, a
          provincial of Africa, in which was a canon made for Paedobaptism and
          never till then: So says Bishop Taylor , with whom Grotius agrees ,
          who calls it the Council of Carthage; and who says in the councils no
          earlier mention is made of infant-baptism than in that council; the
          canons of which were sent to Pope Innocent the First , and confirmed
          by him: And Austin, who must write his book against the Donatists
          before this time, though he says the church always held it
          (infant-baptism) and that it is most rightly believed to be delivered
          by apostolic tradition; yet observes that it was not instituted, or
          determined and settled in or by councils; that is, as yet it was not,
          though it afterwards was in the above council confirmed by the said
          pope; in which council Austin himself presided, and in which is this
          canon, "Also it is our pleasure, that whoever denies that new-born
          infants are to be baptized, --- let him be anathema," and which is the
          first council that established infant-baptism, and anathematized those
          that denied it; so that it may justly be called a part of popery:
          besides baptism by immersion, which continued 1300 years in the Latin
          church, excepting in the case of the Clinicks, and still does in the
          Creek church, was first changed into sprinkling by the Papists; which
          is not an indifferent thing, whether performed with much or a little
          water, as it is usually considered; but is of the very essence of
          baptism, is that itself, and without which it is not baptism; it being
          as Sir John Floyer says, no circumstance, but the very act of
          baptizing; who observes that aspersion, or sprinkling, was brought
          into the church by the Popish schoolmen , and our dissenters, adds he,
          had it from them; the schoolmen employed their thoughts how to find
          out reasons for the alteration to sprinkling, brought it into use in
          the 12th century: and it must be observed, to the honor of the Church
          of England, that they have not established sprinkling in baptism to
          this day; only have permitted pouring in case it is certified the
          child is weakly and not able to bear dipping; otherwise, by the
          Rubric, the priest is ordered to dip the child warily: sprinkling
          received only a Presbyterian sanction in times of the civil war by the
          Assembly of Divines; where it was carried for sprinkling against
          dipping by one vote only, by 25 against 24, and then established by an
          ordinance of Parliament, 1644: and that this change has its rise from
          the authority of the Pope, Dr. Wall himself acknowledges , and that
          the sprinkling of infants is from popery. "All the nations of
          Christians," says he, "that do now, or formerly did, submit to the
          authority of the Bishop of Rome do ordinarily baptize their infants by
          pouring or sprinkling; and though the English received not this custom
          till after the decay of Popery, yet they have since received it from
          such neighbor-nations as had began it in the times of the pope’s
          power; but all other Christians in the world, who never owned the
          pope’s usurped power, do, and ever did, dip their infants in their
          ordinary use;" so that infant-baptism, both with respect to subjects
          and mode, may with great propriety be called a part and branch of
          popery.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is not only a part of popery, and so serves to strengthen it,
          as a part does the whole; but it is a pillar of it, what serves
          greatly to support it; and which furnishes the Papists with one of the
          strongest arguments against the Protestants in favor of their
          traditions, on which, as we have seen, the essentials of popery are
          founded, and of the authority of the church to alter the rites of
          divine worship: they sadly embarrass Paedobaptist Protestants with the
          affair of infant-baptism, and urge them either to prove it by
          scripture, both with respect to mode and subjects, or allow of
          unscriptural traditions and the authority of the church, or give it
          up; and if they can allow of unwritten traditions, and the custom and
          practice of the church, as of authority in one point, why not in
          others? This way of arguing, as Mr. Stennet observes , is used by
          Cardinal Du Perron, in his reply to the answer of King James the
          First, and by Mr. John Ainsworth, against Mr. Henry Ainsworth, in the
          dispute between them, and by Fisher the Jesuit, against Archbishop
          Laud; a late instance of this kind, he adds, we have in the
          controversy between Monsieur Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux, and a learned
          anonymous writer, said to be Monsieur de la Roque, late pastor of the
          Reformed church at Roan in Normandy. The Bishop, in order to defend
          the withholding the cup in the Lord’s Supper from the laity, according
          to the authority of the church, urged that infant-baptism, both as to
          mode and subject, was unscriptural, and solely by the authority of
          tradition and custom, with which the pretended Reformed complied, and
          therefore why not in the other case; which produced this ingenuous
          confession from his antagonist, that to baptize by sprinkling was
          certainly an abuse derived from the Romish church, without due
          examination, as well as many other things, which he and his brethren
          were resolved to correct, and thanked the bishop for undeceiving them;
          and freely confessed, that as to the baptism of infants, there is
          nothing formal or express in the gospel to justify the necessity of
          it; and that the passages produced do at most only prove that it is
          permitted, or rather, that it is not forbidden to baptize them. In the
          times of King Charles the Second, lived Mr. Jeremiah Ives, a Baptist
          minister, famous for his talent at disputation, of whom the king
          having heard, sent for him to dispute with a Romish priest; the which
          he did before the king and many others, in the habit of a clergyman:
          Mr. Ives pressed the priest closely, showing the whatever antiquity
          they pretended to, their doctrine and practices could by no means be
          proved apostolic; since they are not to be found in any writings which
          remain of the apostolic age; the priest, after much wrangling, in the
          end replied, that this argument of Mr. Ives was as of much force
          against infant-baptism, as against the doctrines and ceremonies of the
          church of Rome: to which Mr. Ives answered, that he readily granted
          what he said to be true; the priest upon this broke up the dispute,
          saying, he had been cheated, and that he would proceed no further; for
          he came to dispute with a clergyman of the established church, and it
          was now evident that this was an Anabaptist preacher. This behavior of
          the priest afforded his majesty and all present not a little
          diversion: and as Protestant Paedobaptists are urged by this argument
          to admit the unwritten traditions of the Papists; so dissenters of the
          Paedobaptist persuasion are pressed upon the same footing by those of
          the Church of England to comply with the ceremonies of that church,
          retained from the church of Rome, particularly by Dr. Whitby; who
          having pleaded for some condescension to be made to dissenters, in
          order to reconcile them to the church, adds: "and on the other hand",
          says he, "if notwithstanding the evidence produced, that baptism by
          immersion, is suitable both to the institution of our Lord and his
          apostles; and was by them ordained to represent our burial with
          Christ, and so our dying unto sin, and our conformity to his
          resurrection by newness of life; as the apostle doth clearly maintain
          the meaning of that rite: I say, if notwithstanding this, all our
          dissenters (i.e. who are Paedobaptists, he must mean) do agree to
          sprinkle the baptized infant; why may they not as well submit to the
          significant ceremonies imposed by our church? for, since it is as
          lawful to add unto Christ’s institutions a significant ceremony, as to
          diminish a significant ceremony, which he or his apostles instituted;
          and use another in its stead, which they never did institute; what
          reason can they have to do the latter, and yet refuse submission to
          the former? and why should not the peace and union of the church be as
          prevailing with them, to perform the one, as is their mercy to the
          infant’s body to neglect the other?" Thus infant-baptism is used as
          the grand plea for compliance with the ceremonies both of the church
          of Rome and of the church of England.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have added in the preface referred to, where stands the above
          clause, that infant-baptism is "that by which Antichrist has spread
          his baneful influence over many nations;" which is abundantly evident,
          since by the christening of children through baptism, introduced by
          him, he has made whole countries and nations Christians, and has
          christened them by the name of Christendom; and thereby has enlarged
          his universal church , over which he claims an absolute power and
          authority, as being Christ’s vicar on earth; and by the same means he
          retains his influence over nations, and keeps them in awe and in
          obedience to him; asserting that by their baptism they are brought
          into the pale of the church, in which there is salvation, and out of
          which there is none; if therefore they renounce their baptism,
          received in infancy, or apostatize from the church, their damnation is
          inevitable; and thus by his menaces and anathemas, he holds the
          nations in subjection to him: and when they at any time have courage
          to oppose him, and act in disobedience to his supreme authority, he
          immediately lays a whole nation under an interdict; by which are
          prohibited, the administration of the sacraments, all public prayers,
          burials, christenings, etc., church-doors are locked up, the clergy
          dare not or will not administer any offices of their function to any,
          but such as for large sums of money obtain special privileges from
          Rome for that purpose: now by means of these prohibitions, and
          particularly of christening or baptizing children, nations are obliged
          to comply and yield obedience to the bishop of Rome; for it appears
          most dreadful to parents, that their children should be deprived of
          baptism, by which they are made Christians, as they are taught to
          believe, and without which there is no hope of salvation; and
          therefore are influenced to give-in to anything for the sake of what
          is thought so very important. Once more, the baneful influence spread
          by Antichrist over the nations by infant-baptism, is that poisonous
          notion infused by him, that sacraments, particularly baptism, confer
          grace ex opere operate, by the work done; that it takes away sin,
          regenerates men, and saves their souls; this is charged upon him, and
          complained of by the ancient Waldenses in a tract of theirs, written
          in the year 1120, where speaking of the works of Antichrist, they say,
          "the third work of Antichrist consists in this, that he attributes the
          regeneration of the Holy Spirit unto the dead, outward work, baptizing
          children in that faith, and teaching that thereby baptism and
          regeneration must be had; and therein he confers and bestows orders
          and other sacraments, and groundeth therein all his Christianity,
          which is against the Holy Spirit": and which popish notion is argued
          against and exposed by Robert {Smith} the martyr; on Bonner’s saying
          "if they (infants) die, before they are baptized, they be damned;" he
          asked this question, "I pray you, my lord, shew me, are we saved by
          water or by Christ?" to which Bonner replied, "by both;" "then," said
          Smith, "the water died for our sins, and so must ye say, that the
          water hath life, and it being our servant, and created for us, is our
          Savior; this my lord is a good doctrine, is it not?" And this
          pernicious notion still continues, this old leaven yet remains, even
          in some Protestant churches, who have retained it from Rome; hence a
          child when baptized is declared to be regenerate; and it is taught,
          when capable of being catechized to say, that in its baptism it was
          made a child of God, a member of Christ, and an inheritor of the
          kingdom of heaven, which has a tendency to take off all concern, in
          persons when grown up, about an inward work of grace, in regeneration
          and sanctification, as a meetness for heaven, and to encourage a
          presumption in them, notwithstanding their apparent want of grace,
          that they are members of Christ, and shall never perish; are children
          and heirs of God, and shall certainly inherit eternal life. Wherefore
          Dr. [John] Owen rightly observes "That the father of lies himself
          could not easily have devised a doctrine more pernicious, or what
          proposes a more present and effectual poison to the minds of sinners
          to be drank in by them."
        </p>
        <p>
          The second article or proposition in the preface is, as asserted by
          me, that infant-baptism "is the basis of national churches and worldly
          establishments; that which unites the church and world, and keeps them
          together;" than which nothing is more evident: if a church is
          national, it consists of all in the nation, men, women, and children;
          and children are originally members of it, either so by birth, and as
          soon as born, being born in the church, in a Christian land and
          nation, which is the church, or rather by baptism, as it is generally
          put; so according to the order of the Church of England, at the
          baptism of a child, the minister says, "We receive this child into the
          congregation of Christ’s flock." And by the Assembly of Divines,
          "Baptism is called a sacrament of the New Testament, whereby the
          parties baptized are solemnly admitted into the visible church." And
          to which there is a strange contradiction in the following answer,
          where it is said, that "baptism is not to be administered to any that
          are out of the visible church;" but if by baptism the parties baptized
          are solemnly admitted into the visible church, then before baptism by
          which they are admitted, they must be out of it: one or other must be
          wrong; either persons are not admitted into the visible church by
          baptism, or if they are, then before baptism they are out of it, and
          have baptism administered to them in order to their being admitted
          into it; and Calvin says, according to whose plan of church-government
          at Geneva, that of the Scotch church is planned, that baptism is a
          solemn introduction to the church of God. And Mr. Baxter argues, that
          "if there be neither precept nor example of admitting church-members
          in all the New Testament but by baptism; then all that are now
          admitted ought to come in by baptism; but there is neither precept nor
          example in all the New Testament of admitting church members but by
          baptism; therefore they ought to come in the same way now." So then
          infants becoming members of a national church by baptism, they are
          originally of it; are the materials of which it consists; and it is by
          the baptism of infants it is supplied with members, and is supported
          and maintained; so that it may be truly said, that infant-baptism is
          the basis and foundation of a national church, and is indeed the
          sinews, strength, and support of it: and infants being admitted
          members by baptism continue such when grown up, even though of the
          most dissolute lives and conversations, as multitudes of them are; and
          many, instead of being treated as church members, deserve to be sent
          to the house of correction, as some are, and others are guilty of such
          flagitious crimes that they die an infamous death; yet even these die
          in the communion of the church; and thus the church and the world are
          united and kept together till death doth them part.

          The Independents would indeed separate the church and the world
          according to their principles; but cannot do it, being fettered and
          hampered with infant-church-membership and baptism, about which they
          are at a loss and disagreed on what to place it; some place it on
          infants’ interest in the covenant of grace; and here they sadly
          contradict themselves or one another; at one time they say it is
          interest in the covenant of grace that gives infants a right to
          baptism, and at another time, that it is by baptism they are brought
          and entered into the covenant; and sometimes it is not in the inward
          part of the covenant they are interested, only in the external part of
          it, where hypocrites and graceless persons may be; but what that
          external part is no mortal can tell: others not being satisfied that
          their infant-seed as such are all interested in the covenant of grace,
          say, it is not that, but the church-covenant that godly parents enter
          into, which gives their children with them a right to church
          membership and baptism: children in their minority, it is said,
          covenant with their parents, and so become church members, and this
          entitles them to baptism; for according to the old Independents of New
          England, none but members of a visible church were to be baptized;
          though Dr. [Thomas] Goodwin is of a different mind: hence only such as
          were children of members of churches, even of set members , as they
          call them, were admitted, though of godly and approved Christians; and
          though they may have been members, yet if excommunicated, their
          children born in the time of their excommunication might not be
          baptized; but those children that are admitted members and baptized,
          though not confirmed members, as they style them, till they profess
          faith and repentance; yet during their minority, which reaches till
          they are more than thirteen years of age, according to the example of
          Ishmael, and till about sixteen years of age, they are real members to
          such intents and purposes, as, that if their parents are dismissed to
          other churches, their children ought to be put into the letter of
          dismission with them; and whilst their minority continues, are under
          church-watch, and subject to the reprehensions, admonitions, and
          censures thereof for their healing and amendment as need shall
          require; though with respect to public rebuke, admonition, and
          excommunication, children in their minority are not subject to
          church-discipline, only to such as is by way of spiritual watch and
          private rebuke. The original Independents, by the covenant-seed, who
          have a right to church membership and baptism, thought only the seed
          of immediate parents in church-covenant are meant, and not of
          progenitors. Mr. Cotton says infants cannot claim right unto baptism
          but in the right of one of their parents or both; where neither of the
          parents can claim right to the Lord’s Supper, there their infants
          cannot claim right to baptism; though he afterwards says it may be
          considered whether the children may not be baptized where either the
          grandfather or grandmother have made profession of their faith and
          repentance before the church, and are still living to undertake for
          the Christian education of the child; or if these fail, what hinders
          but that if the parents will resign their infant to be educated in the
          house of any godly member of the church, the child may be lawfully
          baptized in the right of its household-governor, But Mr. Hooker, as he
          asserts, that children as children have no right to baptism, so it
          belongs not to any predecessors, either nearer or farther off removed
          from the next parents to give right of this privilege to their
          children; by which predecessors, he says, he includes and comprehends
          all besides the next parent; grandfather, great grandfather, etc.. So
          the ministers and messengers of the congregational churches that met
          at the Savoy declare "that not only those that do actually profess
          faith in, and obedience unto Christ, but also the infants of one or
          both believing parents are to he baptized, and those only": and the
          commissioners for the review of the Common Prayer, in the beginning of
          the reign of King Charles the Second; those of the Presbyterian
          persuasion moved on the behalf of others, that "there being divers
          learned, pious, and peaceable ministers, who not only judge it
          unlawful to baptize children whose parents both of them are Atheists,
          Infidels, Heretics, or unbaptized; but also such whose parents are
          excommunicate persons, fornicators, or otherwise notorious and
          scandalous sinners; we desire, say they, they may not be enforced to
          baptize the children of such, until they have made open profession of
          their repentance before baptism.": but now I do not understand that
          the present generation of dissenters of this denomination adhere to
          the principles and practices of their predecessors, at least very few
          of them; but admit to baptism, not only the children of members of
          their churches, but of those who are not members, only hearers, or
          that apply to them for the baptism of their infants, whether gracious
          or graceless persons: and were only the first sort admitted, children
          of members, what are they? No better than others, born in sin, born of
          the flesh, carnal and corrupt, are of the world, notwithstanding their
          birth of religious persons, until they are called out of it by the
          effectual grace of God; and as they grow up, appear to be of the world
          as others, and have their conversation according to the course of it;
          and many of them are dissolute in their lives, and scandalous in their
          conversation; and yet I do not understand, that any notice is taken of
          them in a church-way, as to be admonished, censured, and
          excommunicated; but they retain their membership, into which they were
          taken in their infancy, and continue in it to the day of their death:
          and if this is not uniting and keeping the world and church together,
          I know not what is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover all the arguments that are made use of to prove the church of
          Christ under the gospel-dispensation to be congregational, and against
          a national church, are all destroyed by the baptism and membership of
          infants. It is said in favor of the one, and against the other, that
          the members of a visible church are saints by calling, such, as in
          charitable discretion may be accounted so; but are infants who are
          admitted to membership and baptized, such? The holiness pleaded for as
          belonging to them, is only a federal holiness, and that is merely
          chimerical: are they called to be saints, or saints by effectual
          calling? Can they in charitable discretion, or in rational charity be
          thought to be truly and really holy, or saints, as the churches of the
          New Testament are said to be? and if they cannot in a judgment of
          charity, be accounted real saints, and yet are admitted members of
          churches, why not others, of whom it cannot be charitably thought,
          that they are real saints? Besides, it is said by the Independents,
          "that members of gospel churches are saints by calling, visibly
          manifesting and evidencing by their profession and walk their
          obedience to that call; who are further known to each other by their
          confession of faith wrought in them by the power of God; and do
          willingly consent to walk together according to the appointment of
          Christ, giving up themselves to the Lord and to one another by the
          will of God, in professed subjection to the ordinances of the gospel":
          now are infants such? Do they manifest and evidence by a profession
          and walk their obedience to a divine call? And if they do not, and yet
          are admitted members, why not others, who give no more evidence than
          they do? Do they make a confession of faith wrought in them? Does it
          appear that they have such a faith? and in a confession made, and so
          made as to be known by fellow-members? and if not, and yet received
          and owned as members, why not others that make no more confession of
          faith than they do? Do infants consent to walk with the church of
          Christ, and give up themselves to the Lord and one another, and
          profess to be subject to the ordinances of the gospel? and if they do
          not, as most certainly they do not, and yet are members, why may not
          others be also members on the same footing? It is objected to a
          national church, that persons of the worst of characters are members
          of it; and by this means the church is filled with men very
          disreputable and scandalous in their lives. And is not this true of
          infant members admitted in their infancy, who when grown up are very
          wicked and immoral, and yet their membership continues? and why not
          then national churches be admitted of, notwithstanding the above
          objection? So that upon the whole, I think, I have good reason to say,
          "that there cannot be a full separation of the one from the other,
          that is, of the church from the world, nor a thorough reformation in
          religion, until it (infant-baptism) is wholly removed."

          In the said preface, I express my firm belief of the entire cessation
          of infant-baptism, in time to come: my words are, "though it
          (infant-baptism) has so long and largely obtained (as it has from the
          4th century till now, and over the greater part who have since borne
          the Christian name) and still does obtain; I believe with a firm and
          unshaken faith, that the time is hastening on, when infant-baptism
          will be no more practiced in the world," I mean in the spiritual reign
          of Christ; for in His personal reign there will be no ordinances, nor
          the administration of them; and this is explained by what I farther
          say, "when churches will be formed on the same plan they were in the
          times of the apostles; when gospel-doctrine and discipline will be
          restored to their primitive purity and lustre; when the ordinances of
          baptism and the Lord’s Supper will be administered as they were first
          delivered; all which will be accomplished, when ‘the Lord shall be
          king over all the earth, and there shall be one Lord and his name
          one;"’ that is, when there shall be one Lord, one faith, and one
          baptism, acknowledged by all Christians; and they will be all of one
          mind with respect to the doctrines and ordinances of the gospel. And
          as it becomes every man to give a reason of the faith and hope he has
          concerning divine things, with meekness and fear; the reasons of my
          firm belief, that infant-baptism will be no more practiced in the
          latter day and spiritual reign of Christ, are, some of them suggested
          in the above paragraph, and others may be added, as
        </p>
        <p>
          FIRST, Because churches in the time referred to, will be formed on the
          plan churches were in the time of the apostles; that this will be the
          case, see the prophecies in Isa 1:25-26; Jer 30:18; Jer 30:20; Rev
          11:19. Now the apostolic churches consisted only of baptized
          believers, or of such who were baptized upon profession of their
          faith; the members of the first Christian church, which was at
          Jerusalem, were first baptized upon their conversion, and then added
          to it; the next Christian church at Samaria, consisted of men and
          women baptized on believing the gospel, preached by Philip; and the
          church at Corinth, of such who hearing, believed and were baptized;
          and on the same plan were formed the churches at Rome, Philippi,
          Colosse, and others; nor is there one single instance of
          infant-baptism and of infant-church-membership in them; wherefore if
          churches in the latter day will be on the same plan, then
          infant-baptism will be no more practiced.
        </p>
        <p>
          SECONDLY, Because, then the ordinances of the gospel will be
          administered, as they were first delivered, clear of all present
          corruption and superstition; this is what is meant by the temple of
          God being opened in heaven, on the sounding of the seventh trumpet
          (Rev 11:19; Rev 15:5), which respects the restoration of worship,
          discipline, doctrines and ordinances, to the free use of them, and to
          their original purity; when, as the ordinance of the Lord’s Supper
          will be administered clear of all corruptions and ceremonies
          introduced by Papists and retained by Protestants; so likewise the
          ordinance of baptism both with respect to subject and mode, which as
          it was first delivered was only administered to persons professing
          faith and repentance, and that by immersion only; and if this will be
          universally administered in the latter day, as in the first ages of
          Christianity, infant sprinkling will be practiced no more.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIRDLY, Because Christ will then be king over all the earth in a
          spiritual sense; one Lord, whose commands will be obeyed with great
          precision and exactness, according to His will revealed in His Word;
          and as baptism is one of His commands He has prescribed, as He is and
          will be acknowledged the one Lord and head of the church, and not the
          pope, who will be no more submitted to; so there will be one baptism,
          which will be administered to one sort of subjects only, as He has
          directed, and in one manner only, by immersion, of which His baptism
          is an example; and therefore, I believe that infant sprinkling will be
          no more in use.
        </p>
        <p>
          FOURTHLY, At this same time the name of Christ will be one, that is,
          His religion; which will be the same, it was at first instituted by
          Him. Now it is various, as it is professed and practiced by different
          persons that bear His name; but in the latter day, it will be one and
          the same, in all its branches, as embraced, professed, and exercised
          by all that are called Christians; and as baptism is one part of it,
          this will be practiced in a uniform manner, or by all alike, that
          shall name the name of Christ; for since Christ’s name or the
          Christian religion in all its parts, will be the same in all the
          professors of it; I therefore firmly believe, that baptism will be
          practiced alike by all, according to the primitive institution, and
          consequently, that infant-baptism will be no more: for
        </p>
        <p>
          FIFTHLY, As at this time, the watchmen will see eye to eye (Isa 52:8),
          the ministers of the gospel will be of one mind, both with respect to
          the doctrines and duties of Christianity; will alike preach the one,
          and practice the other; so the people under their ministrations will
          be all agreed, and receive the truths of the gospel in the love of
          them, and submit to the precepts and institutions of it, without any
          difference among themselves, and without any variation from the word
          of God; and among the rest, the ordinance of baptism, about which
          there will be no longer strife; but all will agree that the proper
          subjects of it are believers, and the right mode of it immersion; and
          so infant-sprinkling will be no more contended for; saints in this as
          in other things will serve the Lord with one consent (Zeph 3:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          SIXTHLY, Another reason why I firmly believe, infant-baptism will
          hereafter be no more practiced, is, because Antichrist will be
          entirely consumed with the spirit or breath of Christ’s mouth, and
          with the brightness of His coming (2 Thes 2:8), that is, with the pure
          and powerful preaching of His word, at His coming to take to Himself
          His power, and reign spiritually in the churches, in a more glorious
          manner; when all Antichristian doctrines and practices will be
          entirely abolished and cease, even the whole body of Antichristian
          worship; not a limb of Antichrist shall remain, but all shall be
          consumed. Now as I believe, and it has been shown, that infant-baptism
          is a part and pillar of popery, a limb of Antichrist, a branch of
          superstition and will-worship, introduced by the ‘man of sin, when he
          shall be destroyed, this shall be destroyed with him and be no more.
        </p>
        <p>
          SEVENTHLY, Though the notion of infant-baptism has been embraced and
          practiced, by many good and godly men in several ages; yet it is part
          of the wood, hay and stubble, laid by them upon the foundation; is one
          of those works of theirs, the bright day of the gospel shall declare
          to be a falsehood; and which the fire of the word will try, burn up,
          and consume, though they themselves shall be saved; and therefore
          being utterly consumed, shall no more appear in the world: for
        </p>
        <p>
          EIGHTHLY, When the angel shall descend from heaven with great power,
          and the earth be lightened with his glory, which will be at the fall
          of Babylon and ruin of Antichrist (Rev 18:1-2), such will be the blaze
          of light then given, that all Antichristian darkness shall be removed,
          and all works of darkness will be made manifest and cast off, among
          which infant-baptism is one; and then the earth will be full of the
          knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea (Isa 11:9), even of
          the knowledge of the word, ways, worship, truths, and ordinances of
          God, and all ignorance of them vanish and disappear; and then the
          ordinance of baptism will appear in its former lustre and purity, and
          be embraced and submitted to in it; and every corruption of it be
          rejected, of which infant-baptism is one.
        </p>
        <p>
          NINTHLY, Whereas the ordinances of the gospel, baptism and the Lord’s
          Supper, are to continue until the second coming of Christ, or the end
          of the world (Mat 28:19-20; 1Cor 11:26), and whereas there have been
          corruptions introduced into them, as they are generally administered,
          unless among some few; it is not reasonable to think, that those
          corruptions will be continued to the second coming of Christ, but that
          they will be removed before, even at His spiritual coming, or in His
          spiritual reign: and as with respect to baptism particularly, there
          must be a mistake on one side or the other, both with respect to
          subject and mode; and as this mistake I firmly believe is on the side
          of the Paedobaptists; so, I as firmly believe for the reason given,
          that it will be removed, and infant-sprinkling for the future no more
          used.
        </p>
        <p>
          TENTHLY, the Philadelphian church-state, which answers to and includes
          the spiritual reign of Christ in His churches, is what I refer unto in
          the preface, as the time when the practice of infant-baptism will
          cease; in which I am confirmed, by the characters given of that church
          and the members of it; as that it kept the word of Christ; that is,
          not only the doctrines of the gospel, which will be then purely
          preached and openly professed, but the ordinances of it, baptism and
          the Lord’s Supper; which have been (particularly baptism) sadly
          corrupted in almost all the periods of the churches hitherto,
          excepting the apostolic one; but will in this period be restored to
          their pristine purity and glory; hence it is promised to this church,
          and that it represents, that because it kept the word of Christ’s
          patience, truly and faithfully, it should be kept from the hour of
          temptation that should come on all the earth; and is exhorted to hold
          fast what she had, both the doctrines and ordinances, as they were
          delivered by Christ and His apostles, and as she now held them in the
          truth and purity of them. These are the reasons why I believe with a
          firm and unshaken faith, that the time is coming, and I hope will not
          be long, when infant-baptism will be no more practiced in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since, now at this time, we are greatly and justly alarmed with the
          increase of popery; in order to put a stop to it, let us begin at
          home, and endeavor to remove all remains of it among ourselves; so
          shall we with the better grace, and it may be hoped, with greater
          success oppose and hinder the spread of it.
        </p>
        <h2>POSTSCRIPT</h2>
        <p>
          The writer who lately appeared in a newspaper, under the name of
          Candidus, having been obliged to quit his mountebank-stage on which he
          held forth to the public for a few days; has, in his great humility,
          condescended to deal out his packets, in a less popular way; under the
          title of, The True Scripture-Doctrine of the Mode and Subjects of
          Christian Baptism, etc., in six letters. It is quite unreasonable that
          we should be put, by every impertinent scribbler, to the drudgery of
          answering, what has been answered over and over again in this
          controversy. However I shall make short work of this writer, and
          therefore I have only put him to, and shall only give him a little
          gentle correction at the cart’s tail, to use the phrase of a late,
          learned professor, in one of our universities, with respect to the
          discipline of a certain Bishop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first and second letters of Candidus, in the newspaper, are
          answered in marginal notes on my sermon upon baptism, and published
          along with it. His third letter is a mean piece of bufoonery and
          scurrility; it begins with a trite, vulgar proverb, in low language,
          fit only for the mouth of a hostler or a carman; and his friends seem
          to have spoiled one or other of these, by making him a parson. He goes
          on throughout the whole of the letter, as one that is in great haste,
          running after his wits, to seek for them, having lost them, if ever he
          had any; and it concludes with a poor, pitiful, foolish burlesque,
          mixed with slander and falsehood, on an innocent gentleman; quite a
          stranger to him, and could never have offended him, but by a
          conscientious regard to what he believed was his duty. However, by
          this base and inhumane treatment, it appears that his moral character
          is unimpeachable, or otherwise it would have been nibbled at. His
          fourth letter begins with representing the sermon published, as so
          mangled, changed, altered and added to, that it has scarce any remains
          of its original; in which he must be condemned by all that heard it:
          and he has most unluckily charged one clause as an addition, which,
          there cannot be one in ten but will remember it; it is this, "if any
          man can find any others in his (the jailer’s) house, besides all that
          were in it, he must be reckoned a very sagacious person;" and he
          himself, in his first letter published before the sermon was, has an
          oblique glance at it; calling me, in a sneering way, "the sagacious
          doctor." What he says in the following part of the letter, concerning
          the subjects of baptism, and what he intended to say concerning the
          mode in another letter, which was prevented, I suppose are contained
          in a set of letters now published; and which are addressed, not to Mr.
          Printer, who cast him off, but to a candid Anti-paedobaptist, and
          indeed the epithet of candid better agrees with that sort of people
          than with himself, of which he seems conscious, if he has any
          conscience at all; for it looks as if he had not, or he could never
          have set out with such a most notorious untruth, and impudent
          falsehood; affirming that I said in my sermon, that "the ten
          commandments, styled the moral law, were not binding on Christ’s
          disciples:" a greater untruth could not well have been told: my
          writings in general testify the contrary, and particularly two sermons
          I have published, one called "The Law Established by the Gospel," and
          the other, "The Law in the Hand of Christ;" which are sufficient to
          justify me from such a wicked calumny; and the paragraph with which my
          sermon begins, attacked by him, and which I declare, are the words I
          delivered in the pulpit, that "the ten commandments, are the commands
          of God, and to be observed by Christians under the present
          dispensation;" for which I quoted 1Cor 9:21, this I say, must stare
          him in the face, and awaken his guilty conscience, if not seared as
          with a red hot iron; which I fear is his case. As for his flings at
          eternal justification, which he has lugged into this controversy, and
          his grand concluding and common argument against it, that it is
          eternal nonsense, I despise; he has not a head for that controversy:
          and I would only put him in mind of what Dr. [John] Owen said to
          [Richard] Baxter, who charged him with holding it, "What would the man
          have me say? I have told him, I am not of that opinion; would he have
          me sware to it, that I am not? but though I am not, I know better and
          wiser men than myself that do hold it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Somebody in the newspaper observing that this man was froward and
          perverse, and fearing he should do hurt to religion in general, in
          order to divert him from it, and guide him another way; complimented
          him with being a man of wit, and of abilities; and the vain young man
          fancies he really is one: and being a witty youth, and of abilities,
          he has been able to produce an instance of infant-baptism about 1500
          years before Christian baptism was instituted; though he must not have
          the sole credit of it, because it has been observed before him: the
          instance is of the passage of the Israelites through the sea, at which
          time, he says, their children were baptized, as well as they: come
          then, says he, in very polite language, this is one
          scripture-instance; but if he had had his wits about him, he might
          have improved this instance, and strengthened his argument a little
          more; by observing that there was a mixed multitude, that came with
          the Israelites out of Egypt, and with them passed through the sea,
          with their children also. And since he makes mention of
          Nebuchadnezzar’s baptism, it is much he did not try to make it out
          that his children were baptized also, then or at some other time. This
          is the true scripture doctrine, of the subjects of Christian baptism,
          according to his title.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the Jews received their proselytes by baptism, before the times
          of Christ, he says, I know; but if I do, he does not. I observe, he is
          very ready to ascribe great knowledge of things to me, which he
          himself is ignorant of; I am much obliged to him: the great names he
          opposes to me, don’t frighten me; I have read their writings and
          testimonies, and know what they were capable of producing, and to what
          little purpose; though I must confess, it is amazing to me, that any
          men of learning should give into such a notion, that Christian baptism
          is founded upon a tradition of the baptism or dipping of proselytes
          with the Jews; of which tradition there is not the least hint, neither
          in the Old nor in the New Testament; nor in the Apocryphal writings
          between both; nor in Josephus; nor in Philo the Jew; nor in the Jewish
          Misnah, or book of traditions; compiled in the second century, or at
          the beginning of the third, whether of the Jerusalem or Babylonian
          editions. I am content to risk that little reputation I have for
          Jewish learning, on this single point; if any passage can be produced
          in the Misnah, mentioning such a tradition of the Jews, admitting
          proselytes by baptism or dipping, whether adult or children. I own it
          is mentioned in the Gemara, both Jerusalem and Babylonian, a work of
          later times, but not in the Misnah; though Dr. Gale has allowed it
          without examination. The only passage in it which Dr. Wall refers to
          from Selden, though not fully expressed, is this "a female stranger, a
          captive, a maiden, which are redeemed and become proselytes, and are
          made free; being under (the next paragraph is above) three years and
          one day old, are allowed the matrimonial dowry;" i.e., at marriage:
          but not a tittle is here or anywhere else in the Misnah, of receiving
          either minors or adult as proselytes by baptism or dipping: and
          supposing such a Jewish tradition, five hundred, or three hundred, or
          two hundred years after Christ; or even so many years before Christ,
          of what avail would it be? He must be strangely bigoted to an
          hypothesis, to believe that our Lord, who so severely inveighed
          against the traditions of the Jews, and particularly those concerning
          their baptisms or dippings; should found His New Testament ordinance
          of baptism, on a tradition of theirs, without excepting it from the
          other traditions, and without declaring His will it should be
          continued, which He has not done; and yet this, as Dr. Hammond
          suggests, in the basis of infant-baptism: to what wretched shifts must
          the Paedobaptists be driven for a foundation to place infant-baptism
          on, as to place it on such a rotten one; a tradition of men, who at
          other times, are reckoned by them, themselves, the most stupid,
          sottish, and despicable of all men upon the face of the earth? For the
          farther confutation of this notion, see Sir Norton Knatchbull on 1 Pet
          3:20-21; Stennett against Ruffen, p. 61; Gale’s Reflections on Wall’s
          History of Baptism, letters 9 and 10; Rees on Infant-Baptism, P.
          17-29.

          I shall not pursue this writer any farther, by giving particular
          answers to his arguments, objections, and queries, such as they are;
          but shall only refer the reader to the answers that have been already
          given to them: as to the threadbare argument, from Abraham’s covenant,
          and from circumcision; for Old Testament times and cases, are chiefly
          dealt in, to settle a New Testament ordinance, see Ewer’s Answer to
          Hitchin, Rees against Walker, and my answers to Dickinson, Clarke, and
          Bostwick. Of the unreasonableness of requiring instances of the adult
          baptism of children of Christian parents, in the scriptures, see my
          Strictures on Bostwick’s Fair and Rational Vindication, etc., p. 106.
          Of the testimonies of the ancient Christian writers, in favor of

          I called upon this writer, in the notes on my sermon, to name any
          lexicographer of note, that ever rendered the word baptize by
          "perfundo" or "aspergo," "pour" or "sprinkle;" and behold! Leigh’s
          Critica Sacra, is the only book quoted! and he the only lexicographer
          mentioned, if he may be so called! a book which every one of our
          illiterate lay-preachers, as they are called, are capable of quoting,
          and of confronting this writer with it; by observing that Leigh says,
          that "the native and proper signification of the word, is to dip into
          water, or to plunge under water, Jn 3:22-23; Mat 3:16; Acts 8:38." In
          proof of baptism by immersion, and of the true signification of the
          word, see Gale’s Reflections, etc., letters 3 and 4;

          Rees on Infant-baptism, p. 121; and my treatises of The Ancient Mode
          of Baptizing and the Defense Of It, with The Divine Right of
          Infant-baptism Examined, etc., p. 90, etc.

          I bid this writer adieu: God give him repentance for his sins, and the
          pardon of them; and this I am sure he cannot charge, neither with
          uncharitableness, nor with Antinomianism.

          When the Paedobaptists write again, it may be expected they will
          employ a better hand; or should they choose to fix upon one of their
          younger sort again; let them take care, first to wring the milk well
          out of his nose, before they put a pen in his hand.
