          The Introduction, observing the Author, Title, method and occasion of
          writing the Pamphlet under consideration.

          Many being converted under the ministry of the word in New-England,
          and enlightened into the ordinance of believers baptism, whereby the
          churches of the Baptist persuasion at Boston and in that country have
          been much increased, has alarmed the paedobaptist ministers of that
          colony; who have applied to one Mr. Dickenson, a country minister,
          who, as my correspondent informs me, has wrote with some success
          against the Arminians, to write in favor of infant sprinkling; which
          application he thought fit to attend unto, and accordingly wrote a
          pamphlet on that subject; which has been printed in several places,
          and several thousands have been published, and great pains have been
          taken to spread them about, in order to hinder the growth of the
          Baptist interest. This performance has been transmitted to me, with a
          request to take some notice of it by way of reply, which I have
          undertook to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          The running title of the pamphlet, is The Divine Right of
          Infant-Baptism; but if it is of divine right, it is of God; and if it
          is of God, if it is according to his mind, and is instituted and
          appointed by him, it must be notified somewhere or other in his word;
          wherefore the scriptures must be searched into, to see whether it is
          so, or no: and upon the most diligent search that can be made, it will
          be found that there is not the least mention of it in them; that there
          is no precept enjoining it, or directing to the observation of it; nor
          any instance, example, or precedent encouraging such a practice; nor
          any thing there laid or done, that gives any reason to believe it is
          the will of God that such a rite should be observed; wherefore it will
          appear to be entirely an human invention, and as such to be rejected.
          The title-page of this work promises an Illustration and Confirmation
          of the said divine right; but if there is no such thing, as it is
          certain there is not, the author must have a very difficult task to
          illustrate and confirm it; how far he has succeeded in this
          undertaking, will be the subject of our following inquiry. The writer
          of the pamphlet under consideration has chose to put his thoughts
          together on this subject, in the form of a dialogue between a minister
          and one of his parishioners, or neighbors. Every man, that engages in
          a controversy, may write in what form and method he will; but a
          by-stander will be ready to conclude, that such a way of writing is
          chose, that he may have the opportunity of making his antagonist speak
          what he pleases; and indeed he would have acted a very unwise part,
          had he put arguments and objections into his mouth, which he thought
          he could not give any tolerable answer to; but, inasmuch as he allows
          the person the conference is held with, to be not only a man of piety
          and ingenuity, but of considerable reading, he ought to have
          represented him throughout as answering to such a character; whereas,
          whatever piety is shewn in this debate, there is very little ingenuity
          discovered; since, for the most part, he is introduced as admitting
          the weak reasonings of the minister, at once, without any further
          controversy; or if he is allowed to attempt a defense of the cause and
          principles he was going over to, he is made to do it in a very mean
          and trifling manner; and, generally speaking, what he offers is only
          to lead on to the next thing that presents itself in this dispute: Had
          he been a man of considerable reading, or had he read Mr. Stennett,
          and some others of the Antipaedobaptist authors, as is said he had,
          which had occasioned his doubt about his baptism, he would have known
          what answers and objections to have made to the minister’s reasonings,
          and what arguments to have used in favor of adult-baptism, and against
          infant-sprinkling. What I complain of is, that he has not made his
          friend to act in character, or to answer the account he is pleased to
          give of him: However he has a double end in all this management; on
          the one hand, by representing his antagonist as a man of ingenuity and
          considerable reading, he would bethought to have done a very great
          exploit in convincing and silencing such a man, and reducing him to
          the acknowledgment of the truth; and, on the other hand, by making him
          talk so weakly, and so easily yielding to his. arguments, he has acted
          a wise part, and taken care not to suffer him to say such things, as
          he was not able to answer; and which, as before observed, seems to be
          the view of writing in this dialogue-way.

        <h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>
        <p>Of the Consequences of renouncing Infant baptism.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          The minister, in order to frighten his parishioner out of his
          principle of adult-baptism, he was inclined to, suggests terrible
          consequences that would follow upon it; as his renouncing his baptism
          in his infancy; vacating the covenant between God and him, he was
          brought into thereby; renouncing all other ordinances of the gospel,
          as the ministry of the Word, and the sacrament of the Lord’s-Supper;
          that upon this principle, Christ, for many ages, must have forsaken
          his church, and not made good his promise of his presence in this
          ordinance; and that there could be no such thing as baptism in the
          world now, neither among Paedobaptists, nor Antipaedobaptists.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st, The first dreadful consequence following upon a man’s espousing
          the principle of believers baptism, is a renunciation of his baptism;
          not of the ordinance of baptism, that he cannot be laid to reject and
          renounce; for when he embraces the principle of adult-baptism, and
          acts up to it, he receives the true baptism, which the word of God
          warrants and directs unto, as will be seen hereafter: But it seems it
          is a renunciation of his baptism in his infancy; and what of that? it
          should be proved first, that that is baptism, and that it is good and
          valid, before it can be charged as an evil to renounce it; it is right
          to renounce that which has no warrant or foundation in the word of
          God: But what aggravates this supposed evil is, that in it a person in
          his early infancy is dedicated to God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost;
          it may be asked, by whom is the person in his infancy dedicated to
          God, when baptism is said to be administered to him? Not by himself,
          for he is ignorant of the whole transaction; it must be either by the
          minister, or his parents: The parents indeed desire the child may be
          baptized, and the minister uses such a form of words, I baptize thee
          in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the holy Ghost; but what
          dedication is here made by the one, or by the other? However, seeing
          there is no warrant from the word of God, either for such baptism, or
          dedication; a renunciation of it need not give any uneasiness to any
          person so baptized and dedicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          2dly, To embrace adult-baptism, and to renounce infant-baptism, is to
          vacate the covenant into which a person is brought by his baptism,
          [page 4] by which covenant the writer of the dialogue means the
          covenant of grace, as appears from all his after-reasonings from
          thence to the right of infants to baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. He supposes that unbaptized persons are, as to their external and
          visible relation, strangers to the covenants of promise; are not in
          covenant with God; not so much as visible Christians; but in a state
          of heathenism; without hope of salvation, but from the uncovenanted
          mercies of God, [pages 4, 5, 6]. The covenant of grace was made from
          everlasting; and all interested in it were in covenant with God, as
          early, and so previous to their baptism, as to their secret relation
          God-wards; but this may be thought to be sufficiently guarded against
          by the restriction and limitation, "as to external and visible
          relation:" But I ask, are not all truly penitent persons, all true
          believers in Christ, though not as yet baptized, in covenant with God,
          even as to their external and visible relation to him, which faith
          makes manifest? Were not the three thousand in covenant with God
          visibly, when they were pricked to the heart, and repented of their
          fins, and gladly received the word of the gospel, promising the
          remission of them, though not as yet baptized? Was not the Eunuch in
          covenant with God? or was he in a state of heathenism, when he made
          that confession of his faith, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son
          of God, previous to his going down into the water, and being baptized?
          Were the believers in Samaria, or those at Corinth, in an uncovenanted
          state, before the one were baptized by Philip, or the other by the
          apostle Paul? Was Lydia, whole heart the Lord opened, and who attended
          to the things that were spoken; and the Jailer, that believed and
          rejoiced in God, with all his house, in an uncovenanted state, before
          they submitted to the ordinance of baptism? Are there not some
          persons, that have never been baptized, of whom there is reason to
          believe they have an interest in the covenant of grace? Were not the
          Old Testament saints in the covenant of grace, before this rite of
          baptism took place? Should it be said, that circumcision did that
          then, which baptism does now, enter persons into covenant, which
          equally wants proof, as this; it may be replied, that only commenced
          at a certain period of time; was not always in use, and belonged to a
          certain people only; whereas there were many before that, who were in
          the covenant of grace, and many after, and even at the same time it
          was enjoined, who yet were not circumcised; of which more hereafter:
          From all which it appears, how false that assertion is.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That a man is brought into covenant by baptism, as this writer
          affirms; seeing the covenant of grace is from everlasting; and those
          that are put into it, were put into it so soon; and that by God
          himself, whole sole prerogative it is. Parents cannot enter their
          children into covenant, nor children themselves, nor ministers by
          sprinkling water upon them; it is an act of the sovereign grace of
          God, who says, I will be their God, and they shall be my people: The
          phrase of bringing into the bond of the covenant, is but once used in
          scripture; and then it is ascribed to God, and not to the creature;
          not to any act done by him, or done to him (Ezek 20:37), and much
          less,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Can this covenant be vacated, or made null and void, by renouncing
          infant-baptism: The covenant of grace is ordered in all things, and
          sure; its promises are Yea and Amen in Christ; its blessings are the
          sure mercies of David; God will not break it, and men cannot make it
          void; it is to everlasting, as well as from everlasting; those that
          are once in it can never be put out of it; nor can it be vacated by
          any thing done by them. This man must have a strange notion of the
          covenant of grace, to write after this rate; he is said to have wrote
          against the Arminians with some success; if he has, it must be in a
          different manner from this; for upon this principle, that the covenant
          of grace may be made null and void by an act of the creature, how will
          the election of God stand sure? or the promise of the covenant be sure
          to all the seed? What will become of the doctrine of the faints
          perseverance? or of the certainty of salvation to those that are
          chosen, redeemed, and called?
        </p>
        <p>
          3dly, Another consequence said to follow, on espousing the principle
          of adult-baptism, and renouncing that of infants, is a renouncing all
          other ordinances of the gospel, as the ministry of the word, and the
          sacrament of the Lord’s supper, practically denying the influences of
          the Spirit in them, and all usefulness, comfort and communion by them.
          All which this author endeavors to make out, by observing, that if
          infant-baptism is a nullity, then those, who have received no other,
          if ministers, have no right to administer sacred ordinances, being
          unbaptized; and, if private persons, they have no right to partake of
          the Lord’s supper, for the same reason; and so all public ordinances
          are just such a nullity as infant-baptism; and all the influence: of
          the Spirit, in conversion, comfort, and communion, by them, must be
          practically denied, [pages 5, 6]. To which may be replied, that though
          upon the principle of adult-baptism, as necessary to the communion of
          churches, it follows, that no unbaptized person is regularly called to
          the preaching of the word, and administration ordinances, or can be a
          regular communicant; yet it does not follow, that a man that renounces
          infant baptism, and embraces believers baptism, must renounce all
          other ordinances, and look upon them just such nullities as
          infant-baptism is, and deny all the comfort and communion he has had
          in them; because the word may be truly preached, and the ordinance of
          the Lord’s supper be duly administered, by an irregular man, and even
          by a wicked man; yea, may be made useful for conversion and comfort;
          for the use and efficacy of the word and ordinances, do not depend
          upon the minister or administrator; but upon God himself, who can, and
          does sometimes, make use of his own word for conversion, though
          preached by an irregular, and even an immoral man; and of his own
          ordinances, for comfort, by such an one, to his people, though they
          may be irregular and deficient in some things, through ignorance and
          inadvertency.
        </p>
        <p>
          4thly, Another consequence following upon this principle, as supposed,
          is, that if infant-baptism is no institution of Christ, and to be
          rejected, then the promise of Christ, to be with his ministers in the
          administration of the ordinance of baptism, to the end of the world
          (Mat 28:19-20), is not made good; since for several ages, even from
          the fourth to the sixteenth century, infant baptism universally
          obtained, [pages 6-8]. To which the following answer may be returned;
          That the period of time pitched upon for the prevalence of infant,
          baptism is very unhappy for the credit of it, both as to the beginning
          and end; as to the beginning of it, in the fourth century, a period in
          which corruption in doctrine and discipline flowed into the church,
          and the man of sin was ripening apace, for his appearance; and
          likewise as to the end, the time of the reformation, in which such
          abuses began to be corrected: The whole is a period of time, in which
          the true church of Christ began gradually to disappear, or to be
          hidden, and at last fled into the wilderness; where she has not been
          forsaken of Christ, but is, and will be, nourished, for a time, and
          limes, and half a time; this period includes the gross darkness of
          popery, and all the depths of Satan; and which to suffer was no ways
          contrary to the veracity of Christ, in his promise to be with his true
          church and faithful ministers to the end of the world. Christ has no
          where promised, that his doctrines and ordinances should not be
          perverted; but, on the contrary, has given clear and strong
          intimations, that there should be a general falling-away and departure
          from the truth and ordinances of the gospel, to make way for the
          revelation of antichrist; and though it will be allowed, that during
          this period infant-baptism prevailed, yet it did not universally
          obtain. There were witnesses for adult-baptism in every age; and
          Christ had a church in the wilderness, in obscurity, at this time;
          namely, in the valleys of Piedmont; who were, from the beginning of
          the apostasy, and witnessed against it, and bore their testimony
          against infant-baptism, as will be seen hereafter, and with these his
          presence was; nor did he promise it to any, but in the faithful
          ministration of his word and ordinances, which he has always made
          good; and it will lie upon this writer and his friends, to prove the
          gracious presence of Christ in the administration of infant-baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          5thly, It is said, that, upon these principles, rejecting
          infant-baptism, and espousing believers-baptism, it is not possible
          there should be any baptism at all in the world, either among
          Paedobaptists or Antipaedobaptists; the reason of this consequence is,
          because the madmen of Munster, from whom this writer dates the first
          opposition to infant-baptism; and the first Antipaedobaptists in
          England, had no other baptism than what they received in their
          infancy; that adult-baptism must first be administered by unbaptized
          persons, if infant-baptism is no ordinance of Christ, but a mere
          nullity; and so by such as had no claim to the gospel ministry, nor
          right to administer ordinances; and consequently the whole succession
          of the Antipaedobaptist churches must remain unbaptized to this day;
          and so no more baptism among them, than among the Paedobaptists, until
          there is a new commission from heaven, to renew and restore this
          ordinance, which is, at present, lost out of the world, [pages 6, 8,
          9]. As for the madmen of Munster, as this writer calls them, and the
          rife of the Antipaedobaptists from them, and what is said of them, I
          shall consider in the next chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The English Antipaedobaptists, when they were first convinced of
          adult-baptism, and of the mode of administering it by immersion, and
          of the necessity of letting a reformation on foot in this matter, met
          together, and consulted about it: when they had some difficulties
          thrown in their way, about a proper administrator to begin this work;
          some were for fending messengers to foreign churches, who were the
          successors, of the ancient Waldenses in France and Bohemia; and
          accordingly did send over some, who being baptized, returned and
          baptized others. And this is a sufficient answer to all that this
          writer has advanced. But others thought that this was a needless
          scruple, and looked too much like the popish notion of an
          uninterrupted succession, and a right conveyed through that to
          administer ordinances; and therefore judged, in such a care as theirs,
          there being a general corruption as to this ordinance, that an
          unbaptized person, who appeared to be otherwise qualified to preach
          the word, and administer ordinances, should begin it; and justified
          themselves upon the same principles that other reformers did, who,
          without any regard to an uninterrupted succession, let up new
          churches, ordained pastors, and administered ordinances: It must be
          owned, that in ordinary cases, he ought to be baptized himself, that
          baptizes another, or preaches the word, or administers other
          ordinances; but in an extraordinary care, as this of beginning a
          reformation from a general corruption, where such an administrator
          cannot be had, it may be done; nor is it essential to the ordinance
          that there should be such an administrator, or otherwise it could
          never have been introduced into the world at all at first; the first
          administrator must be an unbaptized person, as John the Baptist was.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to this man’s train of reasoning, there never was, nor could
          be any valid baptism in the world; for John, the first administrator,
          being an unbaptized person, the whole succession of churches from that
          time to this day must remain unbaptized. It will be said, that he had
          a commission from heaven to begin this new ordinance; and a like one
          should be shewn for the restoration of it. To which I answer, that
          there being a plain direction for the administration of this
          ordinance, in the Word, there was no need of a new commission to
          restore it from a general corruption; it was enough for any person,
          sensible of the corruption, to attempt a reformation, and to
          administer it in the right way, who was satisfied of his call from God
          to preach the gospel, and administer ordinances, according to the
          word. I shall close this chapter with the words of Zanchy,[1] a
          Protestant Divine, and a Paedobaptist, and a man of as great learning
          and judgment, as any among the first reformers: "It is a fifth
          question, he says, proposed by Augustin, [contra Parmen. 1.2. c. 13.
          col. 42] but not solved, whether he that never was baptized may
          baptize another; and of this question he says, that is, Austin,
          nothing is to be affirmed without the authority of a council.
          Nevertheless, Thomas (Aquinas) takes upon him to determine it, from an
          answer of Pope Nicholas, to the inquiries of the Dutch, [as it is had
          in Decr. de Consec. dist. 4. can. 22] where we thus read; "You say, by
          a certain Jew, whether a Christian or a heathen, you know not, (that
          is, whether baptized or unbaptized) many were baptized in your
          country, and you desire to know what is to be done in this care; truly
          if they are baptized in the name of the holy Trinity, or only in the
          name of Christ, they ought not to be baptized again."
        </p>
        <p>
          And Thomas confirms the same, by a laying of Isidore, which likewise
          is produced in the same distinction, [can. 21] where he says, "that
          the Spirit of Christ ministers the grace of baptism, though he be a
          heathen that baptizes. Wherefore, says Thomas, if there should be two
          persons not yet baptized, who believe in Christ, and. They have no
          lawful administrator by whom they may be baptized, one may, without
          sin, be baptized by the other; the necessity of death obliging to it.
          All this, adds Zanchy, proceeds from hence, that they thought
          water-baptism absolutely necessary; but what cannot be determined by
          the word of God, we should not dare to determine. But, says he, I will
          propose a question, which, I think, may be easily answered; supposing
          a Turk in a country where he could not easily come at Christian
          churches; he, by reading the New Testament, is favored with the
          knowledge of Christ, and with faith; he teaches his family, and
          converts that to Christ, and so others likewise; the question is,
          whether he may baptize them whom he has converted to Christ, though he
          himself never was baptized with water-baptism? I do not doubt but he
          may; and, on the other hand, take care that he himself be baptized, by
          another of them that were converted by him; the reason is, because he
          is a minister of the Word, extraordinarily raised up by Christ; so
          that such a minister may, with them, by the consent of the church,
          appoint a colleague, and take care that he be baptized by him." The
          reason which Zanchy, gives, will, I think, hold good in the case of
          the first Antipaedobaptists in England.

        <h2>CHAPTER 3.</h2>
        <p>
          Of the Antiquity of Infant- baptism; when first debated; and
          concerning the Waldenses.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          The minister, in this dialogue, in order to stagger his neighbor about
          the principle of adult-baptism, he had espoused, suggests to him, that
          infant-baptism did universally obtain in the church, even from the
          apostles times; that undoubted evidence may be had from the ancient
          fathers, that it constantly obtained in the truly primitive church;
          and that it cannot be pretended that this practice was called in
          question, or made matter of debate in the church, till the madmen of
          Munster set themselves against it; and affirms, that the ancient
          Waldenses being in the constant practice of adult-baptism, is a mere
          imagination, a chimerical one, and to be rejected as a groundless
          figment, [pages 7, 9].
        </p>
        <p>
          I. This writer intimates, that the practice of infant-baptism
          universally and constantly obtained in the truly primitive church. The
          truly primitive church is the church in the times of Christ and his
          apostles: The first Christian church was that at Jerusalem, which
          consisted of such as were made the disciples of Christ, and baptized;
          first made disciples by Christ, and then baptized by his apostles; for
          Jesus himself baptized none, only they baptized by his order (Jn
          4:1-2; Acts 1:15). This church afterwards greatly increased; three
          thousand persons, who were pricked to the heart under Peter’s
          ministry, repented of their sins, and joyfully received the good news
          of pardon and salvation by Christ, were baptized, and added to it;
          these were adult persons; nor do we read of any one infant being
          baptized, while this truly primitive church subsisted. The next
          Christian church was that at Samaria; for that there was a church
          there, is evident from Acts 9:31. This seems to have been founded by
          the ministry of Philip; the original members of it were men and women
          baptized by Philip, upon a profession of their faith in the things
          preached by him, concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus
          Christ (Acts 8:12); nor is there the least intimation given that
          infant-baptism at all obtained in this church. Another truly primitive
          Christian church, was the church at Philippi; the foundation of which
          was said in the two families of Lydia and the Jailer, and which
          furnish out no proof of infant-baptism obtaining here, as we shall see
          hereafter; for Lydia’s household are called brethren, whom the
          apostles visited and comforted; and the Jailer’s household were such
          as were capable of hearing the word, and who believed in Christ, and
          rejoiced in God as well as he (Acts 16:14-15; Acts 16:32-34; Acts
          16:40). So that it does not appear that infant-baptism obtained in
          this church. The next Christian church we read of, and which was a
          truly primitive one, is the church at Corinth, and consisted of
          persons who, hearing the apostle Paul preach the gospel, believed in
          Christ, whom he preached, and were baptized (Acts 18:8): but there is
          no mention made of any infant being baptized, either now or hereafter,
          in this truly primitive church state. These are all the truly
          primitive churches of whole baptism we have any account in the Acts of
          the apostles, excepting Cornelius, and his family and friends, who
          very probably founded a church at Caesarea; and the twelve disciples
          at Ephesus, who very likely joined to the church there, and who are
          both instances of adult-baptism (Acts 10:48; Acts 19:1-7). Let it be
          made appear, if it can, that any one infant was ever baptized: in any
          of the above truly primitive churches, or in any other, during the
          apostolic age, either at Antioch or Thessalonica, at some, or at
          Colosse, or any other primitive church of those times. But though this
          cannot be made out from the writings of the New Testament, we are
          told,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That undoubted evidence may be had from the ancient fathers, that
          infant-baptism constantly obtained in the truly primitive church. Let
          us a little inquire into this matter:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The Christian writers of the first century, besides the evangelists
          and apostles, are Barnabas, Herman, Clemens Romanus, Ignatius and
          Polycarp. As to the two first of there, Barnabas and Hermas, the
          learned Mr. Stennett[2] has cited some passages out of them; and after
          him Mr. David Rees;[3] for which reason, I forbear transcribing them;
          which are manifest proofs of adult-baptism, and that as performed by
          immersion; they represent the persons baptized, the one[4] as hoping
          in the cross of Christ, the other[5] as having heard the word, and
          being willing to be baptized in the name of the Lord; and both as
          going down into the water, and coming up out of it. Clemens Romanus
          wrote an epistle to the Corinthians, still extant; but there is not a
          syllable in it about infant-baptism. Ignatius wrote epistles to
          several churches, as well as to particular persons; but makes no
          mention of the practice of infant-baptism in any of them: what he lays
          of baptism, favors adult-baptism; since he speaks of it as attended
          with faith, love and patience: "Let your baptism, says he[6] remain as
          armor; faith as an helmet, love as a spear, and patience as whole
          armor." Polycarp wrote an epistle to the Philippians, which is yet in
          being; but there is not one word in it about infant-baptism. So that
          it is so far from being true, that there is undoubted evidence from
          the ancient fathers, that this practice universally and constantly
          obtained in the truly primitive church, that there is no evidence at
          all that it did obtain, in any respect, in the first century, or
          apostolic age; and which is the only period in which the truly
          primitive church of Christ can be said to subsist. There is indeed a
          work called The constitutions of the apostles, and sometimes the
          constitutions of Clemens, because he is laid to be the compiler of
          them; and another book of Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, ascribed to
          Dionysius the Areopagite, out of which, passages have been cited in
          favor of infant-baptism; but there are manifestly of later date than
          they pretend to, and were never written by the persons whose names
          they bear, and are condemned as spurious by learned men, and are given
          up as such by Dr. Wall, in his History of Infant Baptism.[7]
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Christian writers of the second century, which are extant, are
          Justin Martyr, Athenagoras, Theophilus of Antioch, Tatian, Minutius
          Felix, Irenaeus, and Clemens of Alexandria; and of all these writers,
          there is not one that lays any thing of infant-baptism; there is but
          one pretended to, and that is Irenaeus, and but a single passage out
          of him; and that depends upon a single word, the signification of
          which is doubtful at best; and besides the passage is only a
          translation of Irenaeus, and not expressed in his own original words;
          and the chapter, from whence it is taken, is by some learned men
          judged to be spurious; since it advances a notion inconsistent with
          that ancient writer, and notoriously contrary to the books of the
          evangelists, making Christ to live to be fifty years old, yea, to live
          to a senior age: The passage, produced in favor of infant-baptism, is
          this; speaking of Christ, he says,[8] "Sanctifying every age, by that
          likeness it had to him; for he came to save all by himself; all, I
          say, qui per eum renascuntur in Deum, "who by him are born again unto
          God;" infants, and little ones, and children, and young men, and old
          men; therefore he went through every age, and became an infant, to
          infants sanctifying infants; and to little ones a little one,
          sanctifying those: of that age; and likewise became an example of
          piety, righteousness, and subjection:" Now, the question is about the
          word renascuntur, whether it is to be rendered born again, which is
          the literal sense of the word, or baptized; the true sense of Irenaeus
          seems to be this, that Christ came to fare all that are regenerated by
          his grace and spirit; and none but they, according to his own words
          (Jn 3:3; Jn 3:5), and that by assuming human nature, and parting
          through the several stages of life, he has sanctified it, and let an
          example to men of every age. And this now is all the evidence, the
          undoubted evidence of infant-baptism, from the fathers of the first
          two centuries; it would be easy to produce passages out of the above
          writers, in favor of believers-baptism; I shall only cite one out of
          the first of them; the account, that Justin Martyr gave to the emperor
          Antoninus Pius of the Christians of his day; though it has been cited
          by Mr. Stennett and Mr. Rees, I shall choose to transcribe it;
          because, as Dr. Wall says,[9] it is the most ancient account of the
          way of baptizing next the scripture. "And now, says Justin,[10] we
          will declare after what manner, when we were renewed by Christ, we
          devoted ourselves unto God; lest, omitting this, we should seem to act
          a bad part in this declaration. As many, as are persuaded, and believe
          the things, taught and said by us, to be true, and promise to live
          according to them, are instructed to pray, and to ask, fasting, the
          forgiveness of their past sins of God, we praying and fasting together
          with them. After that, they are brought by us where water is, and they
          are regenerated in the same way of regeneration, as we have been
          regenerated; for they are then washed in water, in the name of the
          Father and Lord God of all, and of our Savior Jesus Christ, and of the
          holy Spirit." There is a work, which bears the name of Justin, called
          Answers to the orthodox, concerning some necessary questions; to which
          we are sometimes referred for a proof of infant-baptism; but the book
          is spurious, and none of Justin’s, as many learned men have observed;
          and as Dr. Wall allows; and is thought not to have been written before
          the fifth century. So stands the evidence for infant-baptism, from the
          ancient fathers of the first two centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As to the third century, it will be allowed, that it was spoken of
          in it; though as loon as it was mentioned, it was opposed; and the
          very first man that mentions it, speaks against it; namely,
          Tertullian. The truth of the matter is, that infant-baptism was moved
          for in the third century; got footing and establishment in the fourth
          and fifth; and so prevailed until the time of the reformation: Though,
          throughout these several centuries, there were testimonies bore to
          adult-baptism; and at several times, certain persons rose up, and
          opposed infant-baptism; which brings me,
        </p>
        <p>
          III. To consider what our author affirms, that it cannot be pretended
          that this practice was called in question, or made matter of debate in
          the church, until the madmen of Munster let themselves against it,
          [page 7]. Let us examine this matter, and,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It should be observed, that the disturbances in Germany, which our
          Paedobaptist writers so often refer to in this controversy about
          baptism, and so frequently reproach us with, were first begun in the
          wars of the boors, by such as were Paedobaptists, and them only; first
          by the Papists, some few years before the reformation; and after that,
          both by Lutherans and Papists, on account of civil liberties; among
          whom, in process of time, some few of the people called Anabaptists
          mingled themselves; a people that scarce in any thing agree with us,
          neither in their civil, nor religious principles; nor even in baptism
          itself; for if we can depend on those that wrote the history of them,
          and against them; they were for repeating adult-baptism, not performed
          among them; yea, that which was administered among themselves, when
          they removed their communion to another society; nay, even in the same
          community, when an excommunicated person was received again;[11]
          besides, if what is reported of them is true, as it may be, their
          baptism was performed by sprinkling, which we cannot allow to be true
          baptism; it is laid, that when a community of them was satisfied with
          the person’s faith and conversation, who proposed for baptism, the
          payor took water into his hand, and sprinkled it on the head of him
          that was to be baptized, using there words, I baptize thee in the name
          of the Father, of the Son, and of the holy Ghost:[12] And even the
          disturbances in Munster, a famous city in Westphalia, were first begun
          by Bernard Rotman, a Paedobaptism minister of the Lutheran persuasion,
          assisted by other ministers of the reformation, in opposition to the
          Papists in the year 1532; and it was not till the year 1533, that John
          Matthias of Harlem, and John Bocoldus of Leyden came to this
          place;[13] who, with Knipperdolling and others, are, I suppose, the
          madmen of Munster this writer means; and he may call them madmen, if
          he pleases; I shall not contend with him about it; they were mad
          notions which they held, and mad actions they performed; and both dip
          avowed by the people who are now called Anabaptists; though it is not
          reasonable to suppose, that there were the only men concerned in that
          affair, or that the number of their followers should increase to such
          a degree in so small a time, as to make such a revolution in so large
          a city: However, certain it is, that it was not their principle about
          baptism, that led them into such extravagant notion, and actions: But
          what I take notice of all this for, is chiefly to observe the date of
          the confusions and distractions, in which there madmen were concerned;
          which were from the year 1533 to 1536: And our next inquiry therefore
          is, whether there was any debate about the practice of infant-baptism
          before this time. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It will appear, that it was frequently debated, before these men
          set themselves against it, or acted the mad part they did: In the
          years 1532 and 1528, there were public disputations at Berne in
          Switzerland, between the ministers of the church there and some
          Anabaptist teacher;[14] in the years 1529, 1527 and 1525,
          Oecolampadius had various disputes with people of this name at Basil
          in the same country;[15] in the year 1525, there was a dispute at
          Zurich in the same country about Paedobaptism, between Zwinglius, one
          of the first reformers, and Balthasar Hubmeierus,[16] who afterwards
          was burnt, and his wife drowned at Vima, in the year 1528; of whom
          Meshovius,[17] though a Papist, give, this character; that he was from
          his childhood brought up in learning; and for his singular erudition
          was honored with a degree in divinity; was a very eloquent man, and
          read in the scriptures, and fathers of the church. Hoornbeck[18] calls
          him a famous and eloquent preacher, and lays he was the first of the
          reformed preachers at Waldshut: There were several disputations with
          other, in the same year at this place; upon which an edict was made by
          the senate at Zurich, forbidding rebaptization, under the penalty of
          being fined a silver mark, and of being imprisoned, and even drowned,
          according to the nature of the offense. And in the year 1526, or 1527,
          according to Hoornbeck, Felix Mans, or Mentz, was drowned at Zurich;
          this man, Meshovius says,[19] whom he calls Felix Mantscher, was of a
          noble family; and both he, and Conrad Grebel, whom he calls Cunrad
          Grebbe, who are said to give the first rise to Anabaptism at Zurich,
          were very learned men, and well skilled in the Latin, Greek, and
          Hebrew languages. And the same writer affirms, that Anabaptism was set
          on foot at Wittenberg, in the year 1522, by Nicholas Pelargus, or
          Stork, who had companions with him of very great learning, as
          Carolostadius, Philip Melancthon, and others; this, he says, was done,
          whilst Luther was lurking as an exile in the cable of Wartpurg in
          Thuringia; and that when he returned from thence to Wittenberg he
          banished Carolostadius, Pelargus, More, Didymus, and others,[20] and
          only received Melancthon again. This carries the opposition to
          Paedobaptism within five years of the reformation, begun by Luther;
          and certain it is, there were many and great debates about
          infant-baptism at the first of the reformation, years before the
          affair of Munster: And evident it is, that some of the first reformers
          were inclined to have attempted a reformation in this ordinance,
          though they, for reasons best known to themselves, dropped it; and
          even Zwinglius himself, who was a bitter persecutor of the people
          called Anabaptists afterwards, was once of the same mind himself, and
          against Paedobaptism. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It will appear, that this was a matter of debate, and was opposed
          before the time of the reformation. There was a set of people in
          Bohemia, near a hundred years before that, who appear to be of the
          same persuasion with the people, called Anabaptists; for in a letter,
          written by Costelecius out of Bohemia to Erasmus, dated October 10,
          1519,[21] among other things said of them, which agree with the said
          people, this is one; "such as come over to their sect, must every one
          be baptized anew in meer water;" the writer of the letter calls them
          Pyghards; so named, he says, from a certain refugee, that came thither
          ninety-seven years before the date of the letter. Pope Innocent the
          third, under whom was the Lateran council, A.D. 1215, has, in the
          decretals, a letter, in answer to a letter from the bishop of Arles in
          Provence, which had represented to him,[22] that "some Heretics there
          had taught, that it was to no purpose to baptize children, since they
          could have no forgiveness of sins thereby, as having no faith,
          charity, etc." So that it is a clear point, that there were some that
          let themselves against infant-baptism in the thirteenth century, three
          hundred years before the reformation; yea, in the twelfth century
          there were some that opposed Paedobaptism. Mr. Fax, the martyrologist,
          relates from the history of Robert Guisburne,[23] that two men,
          Gerhardus and Dulcinus, in the reign of Henry the second, about the
          year of our Lord 1158; who, he supposes, had received some light of
          knowledge of the Waldenses, brought thirty with them into England;
          who, by the king and the prelates, were all burnt in the forehead, and
          so driven out of the realm; and after were slain by the Pope.
          Rapin[24] calls them German Heretics, and places their coming into
          England at the year 1166: But William of Newbury[25] calls them
          Publicans, and only mentions Gerhardus, as at the head of them; and
          whom he allows to be somewhat learned, but all the rest very
          illiterate, and says they came from Gascoigne; and being convened
          before a council, held at Oxford for that purpose, and interrogated
          concerning articles of faith, said perverse things concerning the
          divine sacraments, detesting holy baptism, the Eucharist and marriage:
          And his annotator, out of a manuscript of Radulph Picardus, the monk,
          shews, that the Heretics, called Publicans, affirm, that we must not
          pray for the dead; that the suffrages of the saints were not to be
          asked; that they believe not purgatory; with many other things; and
          particularly, afferunt isti parvulos non baptisandos donec ad
          intelligibilem perveniant etatem; "they assert that infants are not to
          be baptized, till they come to the age of understanding."[26]
        </p>
        <p>
          In the year 1147, St Bernard wrote a letter to the earl of St Gyles,
          complaining of his harboring Henry, an Heretic; and among other things
          he is charged with by him, are there; "the infants of Christians are
          hindered from the life of Christ, the grace of baptism being denied
          them; nor are they suffered to come to their salvation, though our
          Savior compassionately cries out in their behalf, Suffer little
          children to come unto me, etc." and, about the same time, writing upon
          the Canticles, in his 65th and 66th sermons, he takes notice of a sort
          of people, he calls Apostolici; and who, perhaps, were the followers
          of Henry; who, says he, laugh at us for baptizing infants;[27] and
          among the tenets which he ascribes to them, and attempts to confute,
          this is the first, "Infants are not to be baptized:" In opposition to
          which, he affirms, that infants are to be baptized in the faith of the
          church; and endeavors, by instances, to show, that the faith of one is
          profitable to others;[28] which he attempts from Mat 9:2 and Mat
          15:28; 1Tim 2:15.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the year 1146, Peter Bruis, and Henry his follower, set themselves
          against infant-baptism. Petrus Cluniacensis, or Peter the Abbot of
          Clugny, wrote against them; and among other errors he imputes to them,
          are there: "That infants are not baptized, or saved by the faith of
          another, but ought to be baptized and saved by their own faith; or,
          that baptism without their own faith does not save; and that those,
          that are baptized in infancy, when grown up, should be baptized again;
          nor are they then rebaptized, but rather rightly baptized:"[29] And
          that there men did deny infant-baptism, and pleaded for adult-baptism,
          Mr. Stennett[30] has proved from Cassander and Prateolus, both
          Paedobaptists: And Dr. Wall[31] allows these two men to be
          Antipaedobaptists; and says, they were "the first Antipaedobaptist
          preachers that ever let up a church, or society of men, holding that
          opinion against infant-baptism, and rebaptizing such as had been
          baptized in infancy;" and who also observes,[32] that the Lateran[33]
          council, under Innocent the II, 1139, did condemn Peter Bruis, and
          Arnold of Brescia, who seems to have been a follower of Bruis, for
          rejecting infant-baptism: Moreover, in the year 1140, or a little
          before it, Evervinus, of the diocese of Cologn, wrote a letter to St
          Bernard; in which he gives him an account of some heretics, lately
          discovered in that country; of whom he says, "they condemn the
          sacraments, except baptism only; and this only in those who are come
          to age; who, they say, are baptized by Christ himself whoever be the
          minister of the sacraments; they do not believe infant-baptism;
          alleging that place of the gospel, he that believeth, and is baptized,
          shall be saved."[34]
        </p>
        <p>
          There seem also to be the disciples of Peter Bruit, who began to
          preach about the year 1126; so that it is out of all doubt, that this
          was a matter of debate, four hundred years before the madmen of
          Munster let themselves against it: And a hundred years before there,
          there were two men, Bruno, bishop of Angiers, and Berengarius,
          archdeacon of the same church, who began to spread their particular
          notions about the year 1035; which chiefly respected the sacraments of
          baptism and the Lord’s-Supper. What they said about the former, may be
          learned from the letter sent by Deodwinus, bishop of Liege, to Henry
          I. King of France; in which are the following words:[35] "There is a
          report come out of France, and which goes through all Germany, that
          there two (Bruno and Berengarius) do maintain, that the Lord’s body
          (the Host) is not the body, but a shadow and figure of the Lord’s
          body; and that they do disannul lawful marriages; and, as far as in
          them lies, overthrow the baptism of infants:" And from Guimundus,
          bishop of Aversa, who wrote against Berengarius, who says, "that he
          did not teach rightly concerning the baptism of infants, and
          concerning marriage."[36] Mr. Stennett[37] relates from Dr. Allix, a
          passage concerning one Gundulphus and his followers, in Italy; divers
          of whom, Gerard, bishop of Cambray and Arras, interrogated upon
          several heads in the year 1025. And, among other things, that bishop
          mentions the following reason, which they gave against infant-baptism;
          "because to an infant, that neither wills, nor runs, that knows
          nothing of faith, is ignorant of its own salvation and welfare; in
          whom there can be no desire of regeneration, or confession; the will,
          faith and confession of another seem not in the least to appertain."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Wall, indeed, represents these men, the disciples of Gundulphus,
          as Quakers and Manichees in the point of baptism; holding that
          water-baptism is of no use to any: But it must be affirmed, whatever
          their principles were, that their argument against infant-baptism was
          very strong. So then we have testimonies, that Paedobaptism was
          opposed five hundred years before the affair of Munster. And if the
          Pelagians, Donatists, and Luciferians, so called from Lucifer
          Calaritanus, a very orthodox man, and a great opposer of the Arians,
          were against infant-baptism, as several Paedobaptist writers affirm;
          this carries the opposition to it still higher; and indeed it may seem
          strange, that since it had not its establishment till the times of
          Austin, that there should be none to let themselves against it: And if
          there were none, how comes it to pass that such a canon should be made
          in the Milevitan council, under pope Innocent the first, according to
          Carranza;[38] and in the year 402, as say the Magdeburgensian
          centuriators;[39] or be it in the council at Carthage, in the year
          418, as says Dr. Wall[40] which runs thus, "Also, it is our pleasure,
          that whoever denies that new-born infants are to be baptized; or says,
          they are indeed to be baptized for the remission of sins; and yet they
          derive no original sin from Adam to be expiated by the washing of
          regeneration; (from whence it follows, that the form of baptism for
          the forgiveness of sins in them, cannot be understood to be true, but
          false) let him be anathema:"
        </p>
        <p>
          But if there were none, that opposed the baptism of new-born infants,
          why should the first part of this canon be made, and an anathema
          annexed to it? To say, that it respected a notion of a single person
          in Cyprian’s time, 150 years before this, that infants were not to be
          baptized, until eight days old; and that it seems there were some
          people still of this opinion, wants proof. But however certain it is,
          that Tertullian[41] in the beginning of the third century, opposed the
          baptism of infants, and dissuaded from it, who is the first writer
          that makes mention of it: So it appears, that as soon as ever it was
          set on foot, it became matter of debate; and sooner than this, it
          could not be: And this was thirteen hundred years before the madmen of
          Munster appeared in the world. But,
        </p>

          IV. Let us next consider the practice of the ancient Waldenses, with
          respect to adult-baptism, which this author affirms to be a chimerical
          imagination, and groundless figment. It should be observed, that the
          people called Waldenses, or the Vaudois, inhabiting the valleys of
          Piedmont, have gone under different names, taken from their principal
          leaders and teachers; and so this of the Waldenses, from Peter Waldo,
          one of their barbs, or pastors; though some think, this name is only a
          corruption of Vallenses, the inhabitants of the valleys: And certain
          it is, there was a people there before the times of Waldo, and even
          from the apostles time, that held the pure evangelic truths, and bore
          a testimony to them in all ages,[42] and throughout the dark times of
          popery, as many learned men have observed; and the sense of there
          people concerning baptism may be best understood,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. By what their ancient barbs or pastors taught concerning it. Peter
          Bruis, and Henry his successor, were both, as Morland affirms,[43]
          their ancient barbs and pastors; and from them there people were
          called Petrobrussians and Henricians; and we have seen already, that
          there two men were Antipaedobaptists, denied infant-baptism, and
          pleaded for adult-baptism. Arnoldus of Brixia, or Brescia, was another
          of their barbs, and is the first mentioned by Morland, from whom there
          people were called Arnoldists. Of this man Dr. Allix says,[44] that
          besides being charged with some ill opinions, it was said of him, that
          he was not found in his sentiments concerning the sacraments of the
          altar and the baptism of infants; and Dr. Wall allows,[45] that the
          Lateran council, under Innocent the second, in 1139, did condemn Peter
          Bruis, and Arnold of Brescia, who seems to have been a follower of
          Bruis, for rejecting infant-baptism, Lollardo was another of their
          barbs, who, as Morland says, was in great reputation with them, for
          having conveyed the knowledge of their doctrine into England, where
          his disciples were known by the name of Lollards; who were charged
          with holding, that the sacrament of baptism used in the church by
          water, is but a light matter, and of small effect; that Christian
          people be sufficiently baptized in the blood of Christ, and need no
          water; and that infants be sufficiently baptized, if their parents be
          baptized before them:[46] All which seem to arise from their denying
          of infant baptism, and the efficacy of it to take away sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. By their ancient confessions of faith, and other writings which
          have been published. In one of there, bearing date A.D. 1120, the 12th
          and 13th articles run thus:[47] "We do believe that the sacraments are
          signs of the holy thing, or visible forms of the invisible grace;
          accounting it good that the faithful sometimes use the said signs, or
          visible forms, if it may be done. However we believe and hold, that
          the above said faithful may be saved without receiving the signs
          aforesaid, in case they have no place, nor any means to use them. We
          acknowledge no other sacrament but baptism and the Lord’s-Supper." And
          in another ancient confession, without a date, the 7th article is:[48]
          "We believe that in the sacrament of baptism, water is the visible and
          external sign, which represents unto us that which (by the invisible
          virtue of God operating) is within us; namely, the renovation of the
          Spirit, and the mortification of our members in Jesus Christ; by which
          also we are received into the holy congregation of the people of God,
          there protesting and declaring openly our faith and amendment of
          life." In a tract,[49] written in the language of the ancient
          inhabitants of the valleys, in the year 1100, called The Noble Lesson,
          are there words; speaking of the apostles, it is observed of them,
          "they spoke without fear of the doctrine of Christ; they preached to
          Jews and Greeks, working many miracles, and those that believed they
          baptized in the name of Jesus Christ." And in a treatise concerning
          Antichrist, which contains many sermons of the barbs, collected in the
          year 1120, and so speaks the sense of their ancient pastors before
          this time, stands the, following passage:[50] "The third work of
          antichrist consists in this, that he attributes the regeneration of
          the holy Spirit, unto the dead outward work (or faith) baptizing
          children in that faith, and teaching, that thereby baptism and
          regeneration must be had, and therein he confers and bellows orders
          and other sacraments, and groundeth therein all his Christianity,
          which is against the Holy Spirit."
        </p>
        <p>
          There are indeed two confessions of theirs, which are said to speak of
          infant-baptism; but there are of a late date, both of them in the
          sixteenth century; and the earliest: is not a confession of the
          Waldenses or Vaudois in the valleys of Piedmont, but of the Bohemians,
          said to be presented to Ladislaus king of Bohemia, A.D. 1508, and
          afterwards amplified and explained, and presented to Ferdinand king of
          Bohemia, A.D. 1535; and it should be observed, that those people say,
          that they were fairly called Waldenses;[51] whereas it is certain
          there were a people in Bohemia that came out of the valleys, and
          sprung from the old Waldenses, and were truly so, who denied
          infant-baptism, as that sort of them called Pyghards, or Picards; who,
          near a hundred years before the reformation, as we have seen by the
          letter sent to Erasmus out of Bohemia, rebaptized persons that joined
          in communion with them; and Scultetus,[52] in his annals on the year
          1528, says, that the united brethren in Bohemia, and other godly
          persons of that time, were rebaptized; not that they patronized the
          errors of the Anabaptist’s, (meaning such that they were charged with
          which had no relation to baptism) but because they could not see how
          they could otherwise separate themselves from an unclean world. The
          other confession is indeed made by the ministers and heads of the
          churches in the valleys, assembled in Angrogne, September 12,
          1532.[53] Now it should be known, that this was made after that "Peter
          Masson and George Morell were sent into Germany in the year 1530, as
          Morland[54] says, to treat with the chief ministers of Germany,
          namely, Oecolampadius, Bucer, and others, touching the reformation of
          their churches; but Peter Masson was taken prisoner at Dijon."
        </p>
        <p>
          However, as Fox says[55] "Morell escaped, and returned alone to
          Merindol, with the books and letters he brought with him from the
          churches of Germany; and declared to his brethren all the points of
          his commission; and opened unto them how many and great errors they
          were in; into the which their old ministers, whom they called Barbs,
          that is to say Uncles, had brought them, leading them from the right
          way of true religion." After which, this confession was drawn up,
          signed, and swore to: From hence we learn, where they might get this
          notion, which was now become matter of great debate in Switzerland and
          Germany; and yet, after all this, I am inclined to think, that the
          words of the article in the said confession, are to be so understood,
          as not to relate to infant-baptism: They are these;[56] "We have but
          two sacramental signs left us by Jesus Christ; the one is baptism; the
          other is the Eucharist, which we receive, to shew that our
          perseverance in the faith, is such, as we promised, when we were
          baptized, being little children." This phrase, being little children,
          as I think, means, their being little children in knowledge and
          experience, when they were baptized; since they speak of their
          receiving the Eucharist, to shew their perseverance in the faith, they
          then had promised to persevere in: Besides, if this is to be
          understood of them, as infants in a literal sense; what promise were
          they capable of making, when such? Should it be said, that "they
          promised by "their sureties;" it should be observed, that the
          Waldenses did not admit of godfathers and godmothers in baptism; this
          is one of the abuses their ancient Barbs complained of in baptism, as
          administered by the Papists.[57]
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, in a brief confession of faith, published by the reformed
          churches of Piedmont, so late as A.D. 1655, they have there words in
          favor of adult-baptism;[58] "that God does not only instruct and teach
          us by his word, but has also ordained certain sacraments to be joined
          with it, as a means to unite us unto Christ, and to make us partakers
          of his benefits. And there are only two of them belonging in common to
          all the members of the church under the New Testament; to wit, baptism
          and the Lord’s-Supper; that God has ordained the sacrament of baptism
          to be a testimony of our adoption, and of our being cleansed from our
          sins by the blood of Jesus Christ, and renewed in holiness of life:"
          Nor is there one word in it of infant-baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon the whole, it will be easily seen, what little reason the writer
          of the dialogue under consideration had to say, that the ancient
          Waldenses, being in the constant practice of adult-baptism, is a
          chimerical imagination, and a groundless fiction; since there is
          nothing appears to the contrary, but that they were in the practice of
          it until the sixteenth century; for what is urged against it, is since
          that time: And even at that time, there were some, that continued in
          the practice of it; for Ludovicus Vives, who wrote in the said
          century, having observed, that "formerly no person was brought to the
          holy baptistery, till he was of adult age, and when he both understood
          what that mythical water meant, and desired to be washed in it, yea,
          desired it more than once," adds the following words; "I hear, in some
          cities of Italy, the old custom is still in a great measure
          preferred."[59]
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what people should he mean by some cities of Italy, unless the
          remainders of the Petrobrussians, or Waldenses, as Dr. Wall
          observes,[60] who continued that practice in the valleys of Piedmont:
          And it should be observed, that there were different sects, that went
          by the name of Waldenses, and some of them of very bad principles;
          some of them were Manichees, and held other errors: And indeed, it was
          usual for the Papists in former times, to call all by this name, that
          dissented from them; so that it need not be wondered at, if some,
          bearing this name, were for infant-baptism, and others not. The
          Vaudois in the valleys, are the people chiefly to be regarded; and it
          will not be denied, that of late years infant-baptism has obtained
          among them: But that the ancient Waldenses practiced it, wants proof.

        <h2>CHAPTER 4.</h2>
        <p>
          The Argument for Infant-baptism, taken from the Covenant made with
          Abraham, and from Circumcision, the Sign of it, considered.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          The minister in this debate, in answer to his neighbor’s requiring a
          plain scripture institution of infant-baptism, tells him; if he would
          "consider the covenant of grace, which was made with Abraham, and with
          all his seed, both after the flesh, and after the Spirit, and by God’s
          express command to be sealed to infants, he would there find a
          sufficient scripture instance for infant-baptism:" And for this
          covenant he directs him to Gen 17:2; Gen 17:4; Gen 17:7; Gen 17:10;
          Gen 17:12. He argues, that this covenant was a covenant of grace; that
          it was made with all Abraham’s seed, natural and spiritual, Jews and
          Gentiles; that circumcision was the seal of it; and that the same
          institution, which requires circumcision to be administered to
          infants, requires baptism to be also administered to them, that
          succeeding circumcision, [page 10-18]. Wherefore,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, The leading inquiry is, whether the covenant made with Abraham
          (Gen 17:1-27), was the covenant of grace; that is, the pure covenant
          of grace, in distinction from the covenant of works; which is the
          sense in which it is commonly understood, and in which this writer
          seems to understand this covenant with Abraham; for of it, he says [p.
          13], "it was the covenant of grace, that covenant by which alone we
          can have any grounded hope of salvation:" But that it was the covenant
          of grace, or a pure covenant of grace, must be denied: For,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is never called the covenant of grace, nor by any name which
          shews it to be so; it is called the covenant of circumcision, which
          God is said to give to Abraham (Acts 7:8) but not a covenant of grace;
          circumcision and grace are opposed to one another; circumcision is a
          work of the law, which they that sought to be justified by, fell from
          grace (Gal 5:2-4).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It seems rather to be a covenant of works, than of grace; for this
          was a covenant to be kept by men. Abraham was to keep it, and his seed
          after him were to keep it; something was to be done by them; they were
          to circumcise their flesh; and not only he and his seed were to be
          circumcised, but all that were born in his house, or bought with his
          money; and a severe penalty was annexed to it: In care of neglect, or
          disobedience, such a soul was to "be cut off from his people" (Gen
          17:9-14). All which favor nothing of a covenant of grace, a covenant
          by which we can have a grounded hope of salvation, but the contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This was a covenant that might be broken, and in some instances was
          (Gen 17:14); but the covenant of grace cannot be broken; God will not
          break it (Ps 89:34), nor man cannot: It is a covenant ordered in all
          things, and sure; it cannot be moved; it stands firmer than hills, or
          mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It must be owned, that there were temporal things promised in this
          covenant, such as a multiplication of Abraham’s natural seed; a race
          of kings from him, with many nations, and a possession of the land of
          Canaan (Gen 17:6; Gen 17:8). Things which can have nothing to do with
          the pure covenant of grace, any more than the change of his name from
          Abram to Abraham [Gen 17:5].
        </p>
        <p>
          5. There were some persons, included in this covenant made with
          Abraham, of whom it cannot be thought they were in the covenant of
          grace, as Ishmael, Esau, and others; and on the other hand, there were
          some, and even living at the time when this covenant was made, and yet
          were not in it; who, nevertheless, were in the covenant of grace, as
          Arphaxad, Melchizedek, Lot, and others; wherefore this can never be
          reckoned the pure covenant of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The covenant of grace was only made with Christ, as the federal
          head of it; and who is the only head of the covenant, and of the
          covenant-ones; wherefore, if the covenant of grace was made with
          Abraham, as the federal head of his natural and spiritual seed, of
          Jews and Gentiles; then there must be two heads of the covenant of
          grace, contrary to the nature of such a covenant, and the whole
          current of scripture: Yea, this covenant of Abraham’s, so far as it
          respected his spiritual seed, or spiritual blessings for them, it and
          the promises were made to Christ (Gal 3:16). No mere man is capable of
          covenanting with God, of stipulation and restipulation; for what has
          man to restipulate with God? The covenant of grace is not made with
          any single man; and much less with him on the behalf of others: When,
          therefore, at any time we read of the covenant of grace, being made
          with a particular person, or with particular persons, it must always
          be understood of making it manifest to them; of a revelation of the
          covenant, and of an application of covenant-blessings to them; and not
          of any original contract with them; for that is only made with them in
          Christ. To which may he added,
        </p>
        <p>
          7. That the covenant of grace was made with Christ, and with his
          people, as considered in him, from everlasting; for so early was
          Christ set up as the mediator of it; the promise of eternal life in it
          was before the world was; and those interested in it, were blessed
          with all spiritual blessings and grace before the foundation of it;
          now could there be a mediator so early, a promise of eternal life so
          soon, and blessings of grace provided, and no covenant subsisting?
          wherefore the covenant made with Abraham in time, could not, strictly
          and properly speaking, be the covenant of grace. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          8. To shorten this debate, it will be allowed, that the covenant made
          with Abraham was a peculiar covenant, such as was never made with any
          before, or since; that it was of a mixed kind; that it had in it
          promises and mercies of a temporal nature, which belonged to his
          natural seed; and others of a spiritual sort, which
