            Scriptures, but there is not one instance in which the original of
            them is either </span
          ><span class="Normal-C-C5">bapto</span
          ><span class="Normal-C-C3"> or </span
          ><span class="Normal-C-C5">baptizo</span
          ><span class="Normal-C-C3"
            >. The word "dip" or "dipt" occurs six times in the New Testament,
            and in every instance the original word is </span
          ><span class="Normal-C-C5">bapto</span
          ><span class="Normal-C-C3"> or </span
          ><span class="Normal-C-C5">embapt</span

          ><span class="Normal-C-C5">bapto</span
          ><span class="Normal-C-C3"
            >, from which the word "baptize" is derived, means to "dip" or to

            word “baptism” so as to make good sense; but the word "sprinkling"
            will not, neither will the word "pouring." This the reader may
            easily prove by examining all the passages in which the word
            "baptism" occurs. Is not this a plain evidence that baptism is
            immersion and not sprinkling or pouring?</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C3"
            >4.  The words which in the original language of the Scriptures
            properly mean "sprinkling" and "pouring" are never used by the
            sacred writers to describe baptism. If baptism were either
            sprinkling or pouring, would not the term which properly expresses
            such act have been sometimes used by the sacred writers to describe
            the ordinance? If the term which properly means immersion is the
            only one used in the Scriptures to denote the ordinance, must not
            the ordinance be immersion? Would the Holy Ghost have invariably
            used a word which means immersion, if He had intended the ordinance
            to be administered by sprinkling or pouring?</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C3"
            >5.  John baptized "in the river of Jordan." Mark 1:5. And Jesus
            "was baptized of John in Jordan." Mark 1:9. If John immersed our
            Lord and others, this account of his administering the rite "in the
            river Jordan" is plain and natural. Is it reasonable to suppose a
            prudent man would go into a river merely to sprinkle another? Can an
            instance be produced from history of people racing into a river for
            the purpose of being sprinkled? Do those who sprinkle in the present
            day ever go into a river for that purpose?</span

          <span class="Normal-C-C3"
            >6. Jesus "went up straightway out of the water." Matt. 3:16. A
            proof that he was baptized in the water, and an evidence that
            baptism is immersion.</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C3"
            >7.  "John was baptizing in Ænon because there was much water
            there." John 3:23. "Because there was a great quantity of water
            there."—Doddridge. Is this reason satisfactory if he sprinkled the
            people? Would that have required much water? Would not a single
            spring or a small rivulet have been sufficient? If John immersed the
            people the reason is a good one.</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C3"
            >8.  Philip and the eunuch "came to a certain water; and they went
            down both into the water; both Philip and the eunuch; and he
            baptized him. And when they were come up out of the water, the
            Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip." Acts 8:36-39. They "came to"
            this water, and then "went down into it," and when "he baptized him"
            they "came up out of the water." This is exactly what immersion
            would require, but what would have been unnecessary for sprinkling
            or pouring. The sacred historian could not have described the
            immersion of the eunuch in more clear and forcible language.</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C3"
            >9.  Our Lord calls his sufferings a baptism; "I have a baptism to
            be baptized with." Luke 12:50. Jesus here refers to those deep
            waters of divine justice into which he was soon to sink for man's
            redemption. In reference to which he might truly say, "I am come
            into deep waters, where the floods overflow me." "All thy waves and
            thy billows are gone over me." If baptism is immersion there is an
            obvious propriety in calling these sufferings a baptism because
            there is a striking resemblance.</span

            >10.  The Israelites "were baptized unto Moses, in the cloud and in
            the sea" 1 Cor. 10:1, 2. Dr. Whitby says,  "Both the cloud and the
            sea had some resemblance to our being covered with water in baptism;
            their going into the sea resembled the ancient rite of going into
            the water, and their coming out of it, their rising up out of the
            water."</span

            >Moses was a type of Christ, as a prophet and a lawgiver. Acts 3:22,
            23. As the people on this occasion surrendered themselves to the
            guidance of Moses, so a believer, in baptism yields himself to the
            direction of Christ to be conducted in the way of holiness to the
            heavenly Canaan.</span

          <span class="Normal-C-C3"
            >11.  Believers were "buried with Christ in baptism." That the
            apostle here alludes to immersion is generally admitted. Mr. Wesley
            is constrained to allow that this is an allusion "to the ancient
            manner of baptizing by immersion." In Rom. 6:4, and Col. 2:12, the
            apostle speaks of baptism as an emblem of a burial and of a
            resurrection; there must therefore be in baptism something that
            corresponds to these. Neither sprinkling nor pouring in any way
            resembles either a burial or a resurrection; but an immersion in the
            water, end a rising out of it strikingly resemble both. This must be
            obvious to every unprejudiced mind.</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C3"
            >12.  If, as Mr. Scott says, "immersion is doubtless baptism"—if the
            term "immersion" will in every case translate the term "baptism,"
            and the words "sprinkling" and "pouring" will not—if the terms
            properly meaning "sprinkling" and "pouring" are not once used in the
            Scriptures to denote the ordinance—if baptism was administered "in
            the river Jordan" and where there was "much water"—if the baptizer
            and the baptized "went down both into the water"--if baptism
            resembles the sufferings of Christ—if it resembles the state of the
            Israelites in the cloud and in the sea"—and if it resembles a death,
            burial, and resurrection—then let the unbiased reader judge whether
            baptism must not be immersion, and whether it is not an error to
            consider either sprinkling, or pouring to be baptism. And if he thus
            judge, must he not conclude that those who have been sprinkled only,
            have not been baptized, and that to practise sprinkling instead of
            immersion is to set aside the law of God?</span
