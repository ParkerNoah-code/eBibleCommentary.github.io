            become common through the Christian world. The Romish Church, the
            Greek Church, and most of the Protestant churches, practice it. Yet
            Baptists condemn it as unscriptural, unreasonable, and injurious.
            They believe that repentance and faith should always precede baptism
            and that whenever one exercises these, whether old or young, then he
            should be admitted to the holy ordinance of baptism, but never till
            he has believed. Infants, incapable of faith, are unfit for
            baptism.</span

            sins were washed away, and the soul by it was fitted for heaven.

            the general principles on which it rests are there found; the
            fundamental truths are there taught, from which this custom may be
            inferred. This is a strange mode of reasoning. For if we may, by
            remote deduction and vague inference, originate ceremonies, call
            them gospel ordinances, and impose them on the consciences of men,
            then the whole Jewish ceremonial, and the entire ritual service of
            the Papal Church, may be adopted and used and taught as of divine

            for baptism. Here again is mere inference, a foundation quite
            insufficient for positive institutions to rest upon. It is inferred
            that these households had infant children in them, and that such
            infant children were baptized, both of which are wholly gratuitous.
            There are probably few Baptist churches in the world of any
            considerable standing and history that have not one or more entire

            "she was baptized, and her household." There is not the least
            evidence that she had either husband or children. If she had a
            husband, why was she so far from home on business? If she had infant
            children, they would not likely have been with her on such a

            adults, either members of her family, or persons employed in service
            such as her business required. The most reckless sophism alone could

            Paul says: "And I baptized also the household of Stephanas."It is
            inferred here, in like manner, that because a household was
            baptized, therefore, that household had infants in it, incapable of
            faith, and they too were baptized. How entirely gratuitous is such
            an inference, and how utterly without foundation must be a theory
            based on such an assumption. If there were children, why not
            somewhere some mention of them? Households are constantly being
            baptized, and admitted to the fellowship of Baptist churches, but
            without infant baptism. Doddridge, Guise, Hammond, Macknight, and

            Baptism is an external sign of an inward and spiritual work of
            grace, already wrought in the heart; and indicates, not the
            separation of races, but the unity of the true people of God, of all

            false in the very performance of what should be a most sacred
            service. He declares what is false when he says: "I baptize thee;"
            since he rantizes, or sprinkles, and does not baptize at all. Still
            more, and if possible more recklessly, when he asserts that in this
            act the child, "is regenerate, and grafted into the body of Christ's
            church;" and also when in prayer he thanks God, "that it hath
            pleased thee to regenerate this infant, with thy Holy Spirit, to
            receive him for thine own child by adoption; and to incorporate him
            into thy holy church." This is solemnly declared, when no such thing
            is done, and when the minister who says it, and all who hear it
            said, know that no such thing is done:—unless indeed, they do, in
            their hearts, believe in baptismal regeneration. But the child is
            not regenerate, nor adopted of God, nor incorporated into the church
            of Christ by this act. The service falsifies the facts.</span

            a certain extent, baptismal regeneration; of which false and
            dangerous dogma this rite was born. It is more than a false
            statement —it is a pernicious and destructive error to teach, or
            allow the notion, that a few drops of water on the face with any
            form of words, no matter what, can make that child regenerate, a
            child of God by adoption, and a member of Christ's church. If the
            child when grown believes all this,--and why may he not believe it,
            if thus solemnly taught by parents and minister? He believes himself
            a child of God and an heir of heaven, sealed and sanctified by the
            Spirit, and in the narrow way of life, while blind to the fact that
            he is still unregenerate, in the gall of bitterness, a child of sin,
            an heir of wrath, and in the broad road to death. Such perversions,
            —such blind leadings of the blind,—are too serious, and too sad, to
            be countenanced by Christian men or Christian churches.</span

            agreed in what sense,—makes the child a church member, and thus
            introduces an unsanctified, unregenerate membership into the nominal
            body of Christ, making that body carnal instead of keeping it
            spiritual, thus destroying the distinction which the Founder of the
            church designed should be maintained between it, and the world. For
            even if the infant, as such, is not a member, yet when grown to
            maturity he is admitted to full membership, with no other demand
            for, or evidence of, regeneration. The purely spiritual character of
            the church is thereby destroyed, and like other associations, the
            spiritual and the carnal indifferently make up its communion.</span
