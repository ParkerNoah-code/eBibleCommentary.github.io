        <p>
          Some Remarks upon the Title of the Book, and the Author’s method of
          writing.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          The controversy about baptism, both with respect to its mode of
          administration, and proper subjects, has been of late so diligently
          searched into, and thoroughly discussed, that it may well seem
          needless to trouble the world with any further writings upon that
          subject, it being in a great measure only actum agere, to do the same
          thing over again, which has been well done already; but those of a
          different persuasion from us, being continually thrusting their crambe
          millies cocta upon us, and repeating the same things over and over
          again, though they have been sufficiently answered already, makes it
          necessary for us, in the defense of truth, and for the honor of Christ
          in his ordinance, to reply. A late anonymous author has thought fit to
          let the world know what a talent he has in that part of the
          controversy, which concerns the mode of administering this ordinance,
          by publishing a tract, whose title page runs thus, The Manner of
          baptizing with Water, cleared up from the Word of God, and right
          Reason, in a plain free Debate upon that subject, between Mr.. J.P.
          and Mr.. B. W. June 6th, 1726. Published for instruction in
          righteousness. How he has acquitted himself in the management thereof,
          and what improvements and discoveries he has made beyond others, is
          our present business to consider. It seems our author has not thought
          fit to say any thing concerning the subjects of baptism, but has
          confined himself to the mode of administration of it; whether it was
          because he did not care to engage in that part of the controversy, or
          whether he thought that it has been sufficiently handled already, and
          this not so, is what I do not pretend to determine; therefore seeing
          he has not thought proper to take notice of it, I shall not think
          my-self concerned to say any thing about it. From the title page we
          are given to expect, that the manner of baptizing with water shall be
          cleared up to us; for it seems we were all in the dark before about
          it, or at least, there were such mists and fogs beclouding our
          apprehensions concerning this ordinance, that there was no seeing
          clearly into it, until the publication of this treatise, by which the
          author fancies these are dissipated, and the affair let in a clear
          light; but I hope to make it appear, before I have done, that instead
          of giving more light, he has darkened counsel by words without
          knowledge. The title also promises that this shall be cleared up from
          the word of God, and right reason. By the word of God, I suppose he
          means the written word of God, the scriptures of truth, which indeed
          are the only rule of our faith and practice; and from whence, under
          the conduct of the blessed Spirit, all our light in faith and worship
          springs; but what he means by right reason, needs explaining, and is
          not so easy to determine. If he means a just and strong way of
          reasoning, one might justly expect to find somewhat of it in this his
          performance; but the case being otherwise, I shall not, at present,
          farther inquire what else he designed by it; but only observe to him,
          that we ought to believe and act in matters of faith and worship, upon
          the sole credit and authority of the great God, as he has revealed his
          mind and will in the sacred writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The method which our author has taken, in order to set this matter in
          a clear light, is dialogue-wise, or in the form of a conference
          between two persons, or to use his own words, in a plain free debate.
          What moved him to take this method does not indeed much concern me to
          know, but yet I cannot forbear thinking, one reason might be, that he
          might have the opportunity of making his antagonist speak what he
          himself pleased; for it would have betrayed his weakness yet more, to
          have produced such arguments and objections which he was not, in his
          own way, able to solve: though at the same time it is an instance of
          his disingenuity, not fairly to propose those arguments which are made
          use of, nor give them their full weight and force, which he ought to
          have done in handling a controversy honestly and faithfully; as well
          as making his friend speak such weak and ridiculous things as never
          were, at least publicly, made use of in this controversy. Had he had a
          mind to have made a trial of his skill and his talents and abilities
          this way, why did not he take out the arguments of some such writers
          as Tombs, Danvers, Keach, Stennet, or Gale, and fairly propose them in
          their own words, and give an answer to them? But this would not have
          answered his design, which seems to be, exposing to ridicule and
          contempt the ordinance of baptism, by plunging or dipping; and would,
          moreover, have been a task too difficult and laborious for him.
          Perhaps he also thought, this method best to conceal himself from
          being known to be the author of it; but if it is truth he is in search
          of, and bearing a testimony to, why should he be ashamed of it? why
          did not he put his name to his book? This is such a poor, mean, and
          cowardly way of writing, as manifestly betrays either shame or fear to
          appear publicly in the cause he has espoused; if he thinks he is
          fighting the Lord’s battles, why does not he appear like a man, in the
          open field, and not lie scouting behind the hedge? But perhaps this is
          to keep off a full blow that he is afraid might be given to him. But
          to go on, this debate or conference is represented, as managed by two
          persons, under the fictitious names of Mr.. J. P. a plunger in water,
          and Mr.. B. W. a baptizer with water; for it seems, according to our
          author, that plunging in water, and baptizing with water, are directly
          opposite to each other; but unless he can tell us, how a person can be
          baptized or dipped into water, without being baptized with it, they
          will not appear so opposite as he imagines, but of this more
          hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is scarce worth my while to take any notice of the time when this
          conference was held, unless it be just to remark, that it would have
          been as well for the credit of the author, the good and peace of the
          churches of Christ, and the glory of his name, or better, if it had
          never been, or at least, if it had never been published; but it seems
          it is published for instruction in righteousness; but if any are
          instructed by it in that way, in which our blessed Lord thought it
          became him and his followers to fulfill all righteousness, it will be
          contrary to the design and intention of the author; though I am
          credibly informed, that two persons have been already convinced by
          reading his book, that plunging or dipping the whole body in water, is
          the right way and mode of administering Baptism; such is the force of
          truth, that it will break out and appear, in spite of all opposition
          made against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have nothing more to observe here, but only, that seeing the author
          has not thought fit to discover his name, the reader is desired to
          observe, that I shall call him by the name of Mr.. B. W, which is what
          he has been pleased to assume to himself; and so proceed to the
          consideration of this wild, jumbling, and confused debate, in the best
          order and method into which I am capable of ranging it: Though I
          should have observed to the reader, the terms or articles agreed upon
          in this conference. As,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. "That whatever was spoke, should be tried by the written word of
          God, and that only." But I thought from the title page, that right
          reason was to be joined to the word of God, in the management of this
          debate; but perhaps the mode of baptizing, the thing debated, is to be
          tried by the one, and cleared up by the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. "That in all they should use plainness of speech, without any
          cunning craftiness; granting unto him that spoke, the liberty of
          explaining his own words, and meaning;" but if cunning craftiness is
          not made use of, and a handling the word of God deceitfully, in this
          debate, by Mr. B. W. I am much mistaken.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. "That all be done with the spirit of meekness, and true
          Christianity; without passion, prejudice, bitter reflection, or
          railing accusation." How Mr. B. W. has conformed and acted agreeably
          to this article, may be very easily observed, when he calls baptism,
          as administered by plunging, a superstitious invention; and a pleading
          for it, fathering foolish lies upon God, page 23 and will-worship,
          page 24. The last article is, "That they both should keep within the
          bounds of brevity "and civility; the one must not be tedious in
          speaking, nor the other troublesome in interrupting:" Which terms
          being agreed upon, to work they go, and what they made of it, is now
          our business to inquire.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>
        <p>
          The first argument for dipping or plunging in water, as the right mode
          of baptizing, taken from John’s practice, and our Lord’s example, in
          Mat 3:1-17 with the objections of Mr. B.W. thereunto, considered.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Mr. B. W. introduces his antagonist in page 6 producing the instance
          of Christ's being baptized by John in Jordan, in favor of plunging or
          dipping in water, as the right and only mode of baptizing: the text
          cited is, Mat 3:16, And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up
          straightway out of the water; from whence he argues, that he had been
          in it, seeing he could never be said to go out of that wherein he had
          not been. To which Mr. B. W. replies:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the words signify no more than that he went up from the water;
          as, says he, persons of your judgment have been often told. It is
          true, it is kind in such learned Gentlemen as Mr. B. W. that they will
          condescend to instruct such poor ignorant creatures as we plungers are
          commonly represented, and as I suppose this author takes us to be; but
          when they have done their part, we are left without excuse, and cannot
          say, that we have not been told to the contrary; though it is
          prodigiously affronting, that after all the pains they have taken to
          instruct us, yet that we should strenuously insist on the justness of
          our translation, as we think, to be a little more serious, we have
          just reason to do. The reason of this low criticism is, because the
          preposition apw, and not ejk, is here made use of, but apw signifies
          out of, as well as from, and answers to the Hebrew זמ, which also is
          of the same signification; and the rather it should be rendered so
          here, not only because it suits best with the scope of the place, but
          agrees with that parallel text in Acts 8:39 where ejk is made use of:
          So that there can be no foundation there for this trifling criticism.
          But if Mr. B. W. should question whether the word apw is ever used in
          this sense, let him turn to the Septuagint in Ps 40:2 which he seems
          to have some regard for, and there he will find it, where David says,
          the Lord brought him up out of an horrible pit, ki apw phlou iluov,
          and out of the miry clay. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. He adds, "Supposing the translation very right, I wonder, says he,
          where "dipping, overwhelming, or plunging, can be seen therein!" What
          a prodigious deal of strong reasoning is here? And I as much wonder
          too, where washing with water, either by pouring or sprinkling, can be
          seen therein. He goes on, "you say, he went out of the water,
          therefore he had been in it; but if you had said, he had been dipped,
          overwhelmed, or plunged, I should have denied the consequence."
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems, however, that he is willing to grant, that Christ's going
          into the water, and being there, is a necessary inference and
          consequence, justly deduced from his coming up out of the water;
          though he is unwilling to allow plunging to be so, for otherwise I
          doubt not, but that he would have denied the one as well as the other;
          and I hope he will be willing to grant, that Christ went down into the
          water, in order to be baptized, and that he came up out of it as a
          baptized person; therefore he is desired to observe, that we do not
          infer plunging merely from Christ's going down into the water, nor
          from his coming up out of it, but from his going down into it in order
          to be baptized, and from his coming up out of it as a baptized person;
          for that a person may go into water, and come again out of it, and not
          be plunged into it, we know as well as he; but that a person should go
          into water, and be baptized in it, as Christ was, without being dipped
          or plunged into it, is what we deny; and if those circumstance, of
          John's administering this ordinance in the river Jordan, and Christ,
          when baptized, coming up out of the water, are not demonstrative
          proofs of plunging, yet they are at least strong presumptive ones, and
          such as I challenge him to produce the like, in favor of this
          ordinance being administered to Christ, by washing with water, either
          by pouring or sprinkling. If plunging is not a necessary inference
          from what is revealed concerning Christ's baptism, I am sure
          sprinkling or pouring of water can never be; and I will leave it to
          any impartial man of judgment, to use his own phrase, whether there is
          not a greater probability, to put it upon no other foot, of Christ's
          being baptized by immersion, when he went into the river Jordan to be
          baptized, and accordingly was baptized there by John, than there is of
          his being baptized in that river only by an affusion or sprinkling of
          water upon him: So that he has but little reason, with that air of
          assurance, and in that dogmatical way, to say, "that John baptized in
          Jordan is true, but he never dipped nor plunged any in his life;" as
          he does in page 10. And here I cannot forbear mentioning a passage of
          those excellent divines, John Polyander, Andrew Rivet, Anthony WaLeus,
          and Anthony Thysius, who at the same time that they are endeavoring to
          have the mode of baptism, either by plunging or sprinkling, accounted
          an indifferent thing, acknowledge this instance of Christ's baptism to
          be an example of plunging. Their words are these,[1] "Whether baptism
          is to be administered by a single or a trine immersion, was always
          judged a thing indifferent in the Christian church; as also whether
          plunging or sprinkling is to be used, seeing no express command is
          extant concerning it; and examples of sprinkling as well as of
          plunging may be found in scripture; for as in Mat 1:1 Christ went into
          the water, and came out of it, as also the Ethiopian, Acts 8:1-40. So,
          many thousands are said to be baptized in one day, in the city of
          Jerusalem, Acts 2:1-47. Likewise many in private houses (Acts 16:1-40;
          Acts 18:1-28; 1Cor 1:16), where such a going into water was scarcely
          possible:" Which, by the way, is a mistake in those great men, for
          none of the texts alleged, though they prove a baptism of whole
          households, yet they do not prove that it was administered in their
          houses; for most of them plainly shew, that this was performed before
          the apostles entrance into them; and if it had been done there, it
          would be no proof or evidence that it was done by sprinkling, seeing
          proper accommodations to baptize by immersion might be had, even in a
          house: Though there is no reason, as I have hinted, to suppose it was
          done there; all that I produced this passage for, is to show, that
          though those valuable writers were fond of these instances, as
          evidences of sprinkling; yet they could not but acknowledge, that the
          baptism of Christ, and of the Eunuch, were examples of plunging. But
          to return: I desire, when our author insinuates, that Christ's being
          plunged by John in the river Jordan, when he was baptized by him, is a
          human conjecture, which he is not willing to build his faith upon; I
          desire, I say, that he would consider whether his suppositions that
          Christ went ankle or knee deep into the water, and was baptized by
          pouring or sprinkling water upon him, and that the multitudes baptized
          by John in Jordan, went down some little way into the water, from
          whence, being baptized, without any such thing as stripping, and
          shifting, and plunging, as his words are, "they straightway came up,
          and went about their business," are not human conjectures; and
          whether, seeing things are so, he may not be justly numbered among
          those who build their faith upon human conjectures, which he seems to
          be resolved against. And if nothing but conjectures can be formed from
          Christ's baptism, concerning the mode of it, I persuade myself, that
          to every thinking and unprejudiced person, the conjecture, if it must
          be called so, of Christ's being plunged, when baptized, will appear
          more probable, and much preferable to that of his having water poured
          or sprinkled on him. As for his rejecting the observation which same
          have made on Mk 1:9 and saying, that it might as well be let alone, I
          do not much wonder at it, it no ways agreeing with his notion of
          baptism. The observation is this, that whereas it is said in Mk 1:9
          that Jesus was baptized of John in Jordan, it might have been rendered
          eiV ton Iordanhn, into Jordan, as the preposition eiV is frequently
          translated. Now to say, that he was poured or sprinkled of John into
          Jordan, would want sense, but to say, that he was plunged or dipped
          into Jordan, runs very smooth, and is very good sense; for a person
          cannot be said to be baptized, or dipped in a river, without being
          baptized or dipped into it; and indeed this is the meaning of all
          those scriptures which speak of John’s baptizing in Jordan, as Mat 3:6
          and Mk 1:5. And whereas he says, that the Holy Ghost intends by it a
          baptizing in Jordan; he ought to observe, that this cannot be without
          a baptizing into it; to which, I suppose, he will readily reply, that
          this is taking for granted that the word properly signifies to dip or
          plunge; and he may take it for granted that we will do so, until he,
          or somebody else, can give us an instance where the word is otherways
          used; which I believe he, and greater masters of the Greek tongue than
          himself, will never be able to do. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Mr. B. W. not only represents plunging, as urged from Christ's
          baptism, to be a mere non sequitur, and an human conjecture, but also
          attended with nonsense, and very gross absurdities; as when he says,
          page 9 "By the same way of reasoning, you may as well persuade an
          impartial man of judgment, that Christ is under water still, because
          it is said, that he went into the place where John at first baptized,
          and there he abode (Jn 10:40)." As if Christ's going to Bethabara, a
          place where John had formerly baptized, and Christ had dwelt in, was a
          parallel case to his going down into the river Jordan, to be baptized
          by John there. But I am persuaded, that the very mention of this,
          without making any further remarks upon it, will much more expose our
          author to the scorn and contempt of every impartial man of judgment,
          than our way of reasoning, for plunging, from Christ's baptism, ever
          will do us. He goes on in a trifling manner, to shew how weak and
          ridiculous our method of arguing from John’s baptism is, "they were
          baptized in Jordan, says he; therefore they were plunged over head and
          ears;" which he fancies is as absurd, and as inconsequential, as if
          one should say, the staff stands in the corner, therefore it rains; or
          because, says he, it is said that John baptized in the wilderness,
          therefore in baptizing he thrust the people into thorns and briars."
        </p>
        <p>
          What he means by all this ludicrous stuff I cannot tell, unless it be
          to banter the ordinance of water-baptism in general, and so join
          forces with the Quakers, utterly to explode it; for what he seems here
          to direct against the mode of baptizing by immersion, may be retorted
          upon any other, and particularly his own; thus, they were baptized in
          Jordan, therefore they went ankle or knee deep into it, and had water
          poured or sprinkled on them; which is equally as filly and ridiculous,
          as if one should say, "the staff stands in the corner, therefore it
          rains;" or because it is said, that John baptized in the wilderness,
          therefore in baptizing, he put the people knee deep into thorns and
          briars, and scratched their faces with them. But away with such
          ridiculous impertinencies as these. Could not the man distinguish
          between the place where John was preaching the doctrine of baptism
          unto repentance, and the place where he was administering the
          ordinance of it, the one being in the wilderness, and the other in the
          river Jordan, as he might have been informed, if he had more
          diligently consulted the text he has reference to, in Mk 1:4-5. But
          what he fancies will most affect us, is, that John is said to baptize
          with water: now says our author, if "baptizing and. plunging signify
          the same thing, then John might have said, I plunge you indeed with
          water;" all persons, adds our author, but those of your judgment,
          would readily conclude, that such an expression wanted sense;" that
          is, because he looks upon us plungers, as he is pleased to call us, no
          doubt, as persons exceeding illiterate, and who are altogether
          unacquainted with language; whilst he, and those of his persuasion,
          must be considered as the only men of sense and learning; but if this
          penetrating man, this man of sense, can tell us, how a person can be
          plunged in water, without being plunged with it, what a prodigious
          discovery would he make to the world! and if it would want sense to
          read the words, "I plunge you indeed with water;" then pray let them
          be read, I plunge you indeed in water, and I hope they will not want
          sense then; aye, "but, says Mr. B. W. John tells us himself, that he
          baptized them with water; and, says he, lest plungers should not
          observe this, all the four evangelists take notice of it" (Mat 3:11;
          Mk 1:8; Lk 3:16; Jn 1:26). I confess I have consulted all those texts,
          and find the words to be read thus, I indeed baptize you, en udap, in
          water, only in Lk 3:16 the preposition en is omitted, which some, as
          Pasor and Schmidius think, in the other texts, is an Hebraism, or an
          Attic pleonasm, and then the sense and reading will be, either way,
          the same as what I have given; but then here is another prodigious
          absurdity behind, which those of a different persuasion from us think
          we are inevitably thrown into by this reading, and that is, that then
          we must be obliged to read the other part of the text thus, he shall
          baptize you in the holy Ghost and in fire; and this our author seems
          to have regard unto, when he says, "It is impossible that any
          impartial man of judgment can so much as imagine, that by being
          baptized with the holy Ghost, a being plunged in the holy Ghost should
          be understood; for the Lord himself tells us, that by baptizing he
          means pouring;" for the proof of which, he mentions Isa 44:3 and Acts
          10:44.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the donation of the Spirit is sometimes expressed by pouring,
          sometimes by sprinkling, I frankly own; but this which John has
          reference to, is the extraordinary donation of the Spirit on the day
          of Pentecost, as is manifest from Acts 1:5. and therefore another word
          is made use of, as being more expressive of the glory and greatness of
          that dispensation; and when we consider the account that is given of
          it, by the inspired writer, as that there came a sound from heaven, as
          of a rushing mighty wind, which filled the house where they were
          sitting; and that cloven tongues, like as of fire, sat upon each of
          them; and that they were all filled with the holy Ghost; it will not
          seem so very strange, incongruous, and disagreeable to say, that they
          were as if they had been dipped or plunged all over therein. I am
          persuaded our author will acknowledge the learned Casaubon to be an
          impartial man of judgment, and yet he speaks of, and explains this
          affair much in the same language. His words are there, with which I
          shall conclude this chapter: "Although, says he,[2] do not disapprove
          of the word baptizare being retained here, that the antithesis may be
          full, yet I am of opinion, that a regard is had in this place to its
          proper signification, for baptizein is to immerse, so as to tinge or
          dip, and in this sense the apostles are truly said to be baptized, for
          the house in which this was done, was filled with the holy Ghost so
          that the apostles seemed to be plunged into it as into a fish-pool."
          And in the same way, their being baptized or dipped in fire, may be
          accounted for, that being expressive of the same thing, unless our
          author should think, that this is still a much more improper way of
          speaking, but among the best Greek authors, we have this phrase of
          dipping in fire made use of, and particularly in Moschus.[3]
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>CHAPTER 3</h2>
        <p>
          The second argument in favor of baptism by immersion, taken from the
          place John chose to baptize in, and the reason of that choice (1 Jn
          3:1-24). with the weak replies, and foolish shifts and evasions which
          Mr. B. W. makes thereunto, considered.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Mr. B. W. next introduces his friend Mr. P. in page 11, 12 arguing for
          immersion, from those words in Jn 3:26. And John also was baptizing in
          Enon, near to Salim, because there was much water there, after this
          manner; namely, "John was baptizing in Enon, because there was much
          water there; therefore all that were baptized were overwhelmed with
          water. They were dipped, they were plunged, because there was much
          water there."
        </p>
        <p>
          But this argument is not very fairly represented; for we do not argue
          merely from there being much water there, that they were dipped or
          plunged, but from their being baptized in a place of much water, and
          which was chose for that very reason. We know that there may be much
          water where no person is dipped or plunged into it; but that any
          person should be baptized in a place of much water, without being
          dipped or plunged into it, is what we deny. Moreover the
          reasonableness of concluding that baptism, in those times, was
          performed by immersion, we think may be fairly argued from John's
          choosing of, and baptizing in a place where there was much water, and
          we believe it will appear so to every thinking and unprejudiced
          person; but let us consider what Mr. B. W. has to reply. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          1st, To shew his learning and skill in choreography, he inquires what
          Enon was, whether it was a river or no, and seems to call in question
          its being so, and therefore tells us, page 13. That such a river
          cannot be found in the best accounts we have of the land of Israel:
          and adds, and it is very probable, that Enon was either a village, or
          a tract of land, where there were abundance of springs and little
          rivulets of water. Whether Enon is the name of a river, or of a city,
          town or village, or of a trace of land abounding with water, does not
          much affect our controversy, if it is but granted that there was much
          water there, for which reason John made choice of it to baptize in;
          and I hope it will be granted, that there was a sufficiency of water
          to baptize by immersion, especially seeing Mr. B. W. tells us in page
          17 that for plunging of people there need not be much water. The
          Arabic version divides the word into two, and calls it Ain-Nun, which
          may be rendered, the fountain of Nun; as does also the Syriac,
          Ain-Yon, which Junius renders the fountain of the Dove: And as for
          Salim, near to which was Enon, and which is the best direction for the
          finding where it was; this was either Shalem, a city of Shechem,
          mentioned in Gen 33:18 as some think, though this is not very likely,
          seeing that was in Samaria, with the inhabitants of which John had
          nothing to do; or else it is the same with Shalim, in 1 Sam 9:4 as
          Junius and others think, though it seems rather to be that place which
          Arias Montanus[4] calls Salim juxta torrentem, Salim by the brook,
          which he places in the tribe of Issachar, not far from the lake of
          Genesaret; and may be called so, perhaps, either because it was near
          this Enon, where there was much water, or else because it was not far
          from the place where the two rivers Jaboc and Jordan met; as Calvin,
          from the geographers, observes upon this place. But supposing that our
          present best accounts of the land of Israel, make no mention of any
          such river as Enon; nor can it be determined by them what it was, or
          where it was; yet I hope it will be acknowledged, that the account of
          it in the sacred text is just, and that whether it be a river,
          village, or tract of land, yet there was much water there; for which
          reason John made choice of it as a proper place to baptize in, which
          is sufficient for our purpose. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          2dly, From inquiring into the place itself, he proceeds to give us the
          notation of the word, or the reason of its name; for he says, the
          learned tell us, that the word does signify a place of springs: And
          the learned[5] also tell us, that it signifies an eye, as well as a
          spring or fountain; and also soothsaying, and clouds, or a beclouding;
          so that there is not much to be learned from that. And here I cannot
          forbear mentioning the observation of Aretius, upon this place; though
          I suppose that Mr. B. W. will think that he might as well have let it
          alone, who, after he had said that it was a town near Jordan,
          observes,[6] that it signifies affliction, humility, and weeping: I
          suppose he derives it from the Hebrew word hn[ Anab, which sometimes
          signifies to humble and afflict; "thereby, says he, teaching us, "that
          such we are required to be in baptism and true repentance." But to go
          on: In order to strengthen this sense of the word, which Mr. B. W.
          says is given by the learned, he informs us, that "it is observable,
          that the town called. Middin, in Jos 15:61 is called Enon, by the
          seventy Greek interpreters of the Old Testament;" whether this is an
          observation of his own, or of the learned with whom he converses, he
          does not tell us; if of the latter, he might have been so kind as to
          have told us who they were, that we might have consulted them, and
          have considered their proofs of it. By what goes before and after, it
          seems as if he meant that it was one of theirs; which when one comes
          to examine, it looks, according to the order of the text, as if it was
          Secacah, and not Middin, that is rendered Enon; the words in Jos 15:61
          in the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin & Secacah, are by the
          Septuagint thus rendered, etc. Baddargeis, etc Tharabaam, etc. Aenon;
          so that if a regard is to be had to the order of the words, then as
          Baddargeis answers to Beth-arabah, so Tharabaam to Middin, and Aenon
          to Secacah; and if so, here is a fine piece of critical learning
          spoiled: But supposing that Baddargeis answers to Bamidbar, which we
          render, in the wilderness; and Tharabaam to Beth-arabah, and so AEnon
          to Middin, because the Septuagint make seven cities here, and in the
          following verse, when there are but fix, to what purpose is this
          produced? or what is gained by it? or how does this prove that the
          word signifies a place of springs? Yes, in Mr. B. W’s imagination, it
          serves a very good purpose, and sufficiently proves this signification
          of the word; but how? why they (the learned) also observe, says he,
          "that in Jdg 5:10, there is mention made of those that fit in, upon,
          or near Middin, we read injudgment, where immediately the holy Ghost
          takes notice of the places of drawing water; so that, if any body
          would know wherefore Middin is rendered Enon by the Septuagint, the
          reason is ready, because of the places of drawing water."
        </p>
        <p>
          A fine way of arguing indeed! what, because Middin, in Jos 15:61 is
          rendered Aenon by the Septuagint, and because a word of the same form
          and found, is rendered in Jdg 5:10. by the same ep Krithriou, "upon
          the judgment-seat;" and we read in judgment, where the holy Ghost
          immediately takes notice of the places of drawing water; therefore the
          reason is ready for any body to know why Middin is rendered by Enon,
          in the former text, and that is, because of the places of drawing
          water." Can any man in the world see any connection here? and how does
          this appear to be the ready, plain and easy reason of this version:
          Had either Middin or Enon been in the Septuagint text of Jdg 5:10
          there had been some tolerable color and pretense for all this, though
          that would have fell short of proving it to be the reason of such a
          version in Jos 15:61 but here is not the least appearance of either;
          though it is true, there are some interpreters who think that the word
          rendered judgment, is the proper name of a place either of that city
          mentioned in Jos 15:6,. or of a path or road-way which bore this name;
          so the Masora, R. David Kimchi, and R. Levi Ben Gersom; though the
          Targum, Septuagint, R. Solomon Jarchi, R. Isaiah, understood it of
          judgment, as we do, as well as many other interpreters and expositors;
          but granting that the word does signify a place of fountains and
          springs, and was so called, because of the places of drawing water,
          then I hope there was aplenty of water there, and what was sufficient
          for the baptizing of persons by immersion of the whole body; for which
          reason John made choice of it. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. He goes on and says, "You and your friends must grant, that the
          words of the holy Ghost do not denote much water in one great channel,
          but many waters, streams or rivulets, in a certain tract or
          neighborhood." By the words of the holy Ghost, I suppose he means
          polla udata, which our translators have very well rendered much water;
          and he seems in this passage to have reference to that poor low
          criticism, which those of his persuasion are often obliged to have
          recourse to, which is, that there words are not expressive of a large
          quantity of water, but signify only, many little streams and rivulets,
          which are not sufficient for an immersion of the whole body, and
          therefore should have been rendered, not much water, but many waters.
          We grant that udata polla may be literally rendered many waters; but
          that they signify some little small streams and rivulets of water, and
          not a large quantity thereof, is what we deny. That John intends a
          large and not a small quantity of water, is manifest from his use of
          the phrase in other of his writings, as for instance, in Rev 1:15, it
          is said of Christ, that his voice was as the sound, udatoin pollan, of
          many waters; but what found does little purling streams, and small
          rivulets of water make? And who can imagine the allusion should be
          made to them; or that these should be expressive of the voice of
          Christ in the gospel, especially in the ministry of it by the
          apostles, whose sound went into all the earth, and their words unto
          the end of the world? Again, in Rev 17:1 the great whore is
          represented as fitting epi twn uditwn twn pollwn, "upon many waters,"
          by which are metaphorically set forth unto us, those many people,
          kingdoms, and nations over whom she exercised a lawless and tyrannical
          power, as appears from Rev 17:15 where the angel tells John, that the
          waters which he saw, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and
          multitudes, and nations, and tongues: from whence it is manifest, that
          by this phrase is intended, not a small quantity of people, or some
          little petty nations and kingdoms, which were subject to the see of
          Rome; but a large quantity of people, even multitudes, and of nations
          and kingdoms, the chief and greatest; besides, our author, as well as
          others, would do well to consider, that udata polla is an Hebraism,
          and answers to םיבר םימ Rabbim Mayim, and by which the Septuagint
          frequently render there words; and that where small streams and
          rivulets cannot be intended, but large and great waters are spoken of,
          nay where indeed, the waters of the sea are plainly meant: As for
          instance, in Ps 77:19 it is said concerning God's leading his people
          through the Red Sea, Thy way is in the sea, and thy path, ejn udaoi
          wolloiv, in many waters, or as we justly read it, in the great waters;
          for surely the waters of the sea may be called so, and I hope that
          udata polla, here, does not signify many little streams and rivulets.
          Again, in Ps 107:23, sea-faring persons are thus described, they that
          go down to the sea in ships, that do business, ejn udaoi polloiv, in
          many waters, that is, in great waters, as the waters of the sea are;
          and I persuade myself, that none can be so weak as to imagine, that
          ships can sail in small streams and rivulets, or the business that the
          Psalmist speaks of, to be done in such places where there is not a
          sufficiency of water to dip or plunge into.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, if this phrase may not be allowed to be an Hebraism, it will
          be hard to prove that many waters signify a small quantity, and only
          some little streams or rivulets: Sure I am, some persons, of far
          superior learning to what Mr. B. W. discovers, have thought the
          contrary, as Grotius, Piscator, Lightfoot, and others; but if there
          may not be allowed to be good judges of the Greek tongue, I hope
          Nonnus Panopolitanus may, who flourished about the year 420 was a
          famous Greek and Christian poet, and turned this gospel, according to
          John, into Greek verse, who not only says, that the place where John
          was baptizing, was baqukumonov, "a place of deep waters," but also
          expresses udata polla by afqonon udwr, copiosa aqua, "a large water,
          or abundance of water:" But because his version of the whole text
          makes much for the elucidation of it, I will transcribe it from
          him:—Hn de ki autov qeoV IwannhV qeopeiqea laon alhthn Udati baptizwn
          baqukumonoV enduqi salhm Keiqi gar euruporoio kulendomenou potamoio
          Ceumasin aenaoiV kumainetai afqonon udwr Arkion eim eni pasin, Which
          may be rendered in English thus, "And the divine John himself also was
          baptizing in water, the straying people, who were obedient to God, at
          or in a place of deep waters, near to Salem, because there abundance
          of water, sufficient for them altogether, flowed in the ever-running
          streams of the winding river, whole passage over is very broad." But
          supposing that much water in one great channel is not intended, though
          I must confess I can see no reason why it should not, and that many
          waters, streams, or rivulets are here meant; yet, who does not know
          that many of these together, can not only fill large and capacious
          pools, sufficient enough for immersion, but also frequently form and
          feed very great rivers? so that I do not see that this will much help
          his cause, or affect our argument. But Mr. B. W. says, page 14. "But
          what and if the holy Ghost intends to give us the reason why the place
          was called Enon, because there were many waters, springs or rivulets
          there? what will become of your argument then, and how will you help
          yourself?" Where he insinuates, as if the design of the holy Ghost in
          there words, because there was much water there, is not to inform us
          of the convenience of this place for baptizing, or that it was the
          reason why John made choice of it, but to explain the meaning of the
          word Enon, and to let us know, that the place was so called, because
          there was much water, or many springs or rivulets there: How trifling
          and ridiculous is this? Does the holy Ghost take such a method as this
          in other parts of the Bible, where the proper names of places are
          mentioned? and what necessity can there be for explaining of this any
          more than there is of others? and why is not the meaning of Salim as
          well as Enon given? Surely we need not be afraid of losing our
          argument from such interpretations and senses of scriptures as there,
          which will appear vain and trifling at the first view, to every
          impartial man of judgment; nor need we be much solicitous about
          helping ourselves, when pressed with such silly nonsense as this. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Mr. B. W. proceeds to charge the argument for plunging in baptism,
          taken from hence, not only with want of consequence, but as a vain
          conjecture: his words are there; "Granting, says he, that Enon was a
          great river, or a great water, yet it can never be proved that John
          plunged persons all over in it; that is nothing at all but your vain
          conjecture;" and then in his usual, positive, and dogmatical way,
          adds, "he baptized them, but he never plunged them." Here I need only
          reason as I did before, with regard to the baptism of Christ, and
          others, in Jordan, that if John’s pitching upon Enon, as a convenient
          place to baptize in, because there was much water there, and his
          baptizing in that place is not a demonstrative proof of his baptizing
          by plunging, yet at least must be a strong presumptive one, and such
          an one as he can never produce in favor of his baptizing there by an
          affusion or sprinkling of water: And again, is to suppose that John
          baptized there by immersion, is a vain and trifling conjecture, I am
          sure, and I believe it will appear to every unprejudiced person, that
          to suppose that he did it by sprinkling or pouring, is much more so.
          And if we poor ignorant creatures may not be allowed to infer and
          conclude immersion from hence, without being charged with making vain
          and trifling conjectures; yet I hope he will be a little more sparing
          of the great Calvin, for whom, I do not doubt, from some few hints I
          have observed in this conference, he has a value and respect, and whom
          I persuade myself he will allow to be an impartial man of judgment,
          and to whole judgment he will always pay a deference: His note upon
          this text, is this; "Geographers write, says he, that there two towns,
          Enon and Salim, were not far from the confluence of Jaboc and Jordan,
          nigh to which they place Scythopolis. Moreover, from those words we
          may gather that baptism was performed by John and Christ, by a
          plunging of the whole body under water;"[7] and I think we may
          conclude this very fairly too, whatever Mr. B W. may think of it. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          5thly, Our ingenious author, by a new turn and mighty stretch of
          thought, has found out another reason, besides that of convenience,
          for baptizing, which made John fix upon, and determined him in the
          choice of this place, there being much water there, and that is, that
          the vast multitudes which flocked to, and attended upon his ministry,
          might be refreshed; as also their horses, or their camels, or
          whatsoever we may suppose many of them did ride upon; by which, I
          suppose, he means asses. I cannot but observe, that he seems to speak
          this with some caution or guard upon himself, as he does also in page
          17 where he says, speaking of the people which flocked to John’s
          ministry, "a great number of them, doubtless, must travel many miles;
          and we must suppose, many on foot, and many otherwise:" and this I
          cannot but attribute to a self-consciousness in him, that he deserved
          to be numbered among those animals, or at least, to his being aware
          that this would be turned upon him, for his foolish and ridiculous
          glosses on the sacred writings. What seems the most to strengthen him
          in his folly, and upon which he says much stress, is the vast
          multitudes of people which followed John, and attended upon his
          ministry; and the unwise part John would have acted, if he had not
          chore places where refreshment might be had for themselves and their
          cattle: But surely the man forgets himself, or at least, does not give
          himself time to consider, that John was now upon the declining hand,
          and had not those vast numbers and multitudes following him as
          formerly he had; the crowd was now after Christ, and not John; and
          though he had some which came to him, and were baptized, yet they were
          but few in comparison of what he had formerly, or what now followed
          Christ; as he might easily have observed, by reading this third
          chapter of John; and therefore there was no need for him to be so
          solicitous for accommodations for the people and their cattle, as is
          here by our author intimated; and to make his sense appear the more
          plausible, he tells us, that "by John’s baptizing, we are to
          understand John’s preaching, administering in his office, and
          fulfilling his course;" for which he cites, Mat 21:25 and Acts 10:47.
          It is readily granted, that sometimes by John’s baptism, we are to
          understand his whole ministry, and particularly the doctrine of
          baptism, preached by him, as distinct from the administration of the
          ordinance; but that by his baptizing here is meant his preaching, must
          be denied; for that it intends his administration of the ordinance of
          water-baptism, not only his act of baptizing, but the people's
          submission to it; for the text says, they came and were baptized,
          manifestly prove it; to say nothing of the place where it was
          performed, being a place of much water, the thing now in debate. He
          also insinuates, that great part of the land of Judea was sandy and
          barren; but not so barren as his arguments are. "You may understand,
          says he, what fort of a country, for water, a great part of that land
          was, from the great contentions between Isaac’s servants, and others,
          about digging, finding, and enjoying wells of water;" but there
          contentions did not arise so much from the scarcity of water, as from
          the envy of the Philistines on the one hand, and from Isaac’s
          servants, stiffly insisting upon their right and property, on the
          other: For though persons may have never such plenty of things, yet
          they are not willing to be defrauded of what is their just right.
        </p>
        <p>
          He goes on: "Glad at heart they were when they found plenty of water,
          for their own refreshment, and the refreshment of their cattle." One
          would be almost tempted to think that the man was describing the sandy
          deserts of Arabia, rather than the fertile land of Canaan, and
          representing the travelling companies of Dedanim who being almost
          scorched with heat, are thrown into a transport of joy, at the sight
          of a spring of water; but who will it be most proper to give credit
          to, Moses, an inspired writer, who told the people of Israel, that God
          was bringing them into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of
          fountains and depths, that spring out of valleys and hills; or our
          blundering geographer, who represents it as a desert and wilderness.
          Moreover, it seems, that there need not be much water for the plunging
          of persons, and therefore John need not have chore this place upon
          that account; but I hope, so much is needful, as will cover the
          persons all over. And there is one thing therefore that we need not be
          afraid of being pressed with by our author, as we are by some, and
          that is, the scarcity of water in some parts. But what he says of the
          practice of our friends in London, is entirely false, which is, that
          they plunge in little holes or tubs; for I cannot see, but he must
          mean them, and not those in other places; because he adds, rather than
          the Thames, that is just by. Now there are but two places, in and
          about London, that I know of, which are made use of for the
          administration of this ordinance, the one is in the midst of a public
          meeting-house, and the other in an open place, where there are
          conveniences for a large number of spectators; and it is very rare
          that this ordinance is administered by us in a private manner, as same
          other performances commonly are, in a lying-in chamber; and that only
          in the presence of a midwife, a nurse, and two or three gossiping
          women. As for the instance of a certain plunger in the country,
          performing the ordinance in an horse-pond, in the middle of a town, I
          shall suspend my thoughts about it, and neither condemn nor commend
          his practice, unless I had a better account of it, with its
          circumstances, than Mr. B. W. has given; though I can see no great
          damage in it, as he has related it, provided the water was not dirty
          and filthy: But I suppose he designs it as a banter upon us, and a
          diversion for his reader; much good may do him with it, and let him
          make the best of it he can.

        <h2>CHAPTER 4.</h2>
        <p>
          The third argument insisted on, in favor of plunging or dipping, as
          the right mode of baptizing, taken from the practice of the apostles,
          and particularly from the instance of the Eunuch’s baptism in Acts
          8:1-40 with the cavils and exceptions of Mr. B. W. against it,
          considered.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          The next argument which our author, page 18 produces, as insisted on
          by us, for the proof of baptism by immersion, and which he excepts
          against, is taken from the practice of the apostles, and particularly
          the instance of Philip’s baptizing the Eunuch, recorded in Acts
          8:38-39. thus; And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they
          went dawn both into the water, bath Philip and the Eunuch, and he
          baptized him. And when they were came up out of the water, etc. Here I
          must again observe, as I have already, in a parallel case, that we do
          not from this instance infer plunging, merely from Philip and the
          Eunuch’s going down into, and coming up out of the water; for we know,
          as well as he, that persons may go hundreds of times into water, as he
          says, without any design of plunging, or of being plunged; but we
          argue from both of them going down into the water; the one in order to
          administer the ordinance of water-baptism, and the other to submit
          unto it; and from their coming up out of it, as having performed it;
          from whence we think we have sufficient reason to conclude, that this
          was performed by immersion, or a plunging of the whole body under
          water; for to what purpose should they both go down into the water, if
          the ordinance was to be performed any other way? or what need would
          there have been of it? But if plunging cannot be inferred from hence,
          I am sure it is impossible that pouring or sprinkling should. But let
          us see what Mr. B. W. will infer from this instance, and has to except
          against our argument from hence. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          1st, From Philip and the Eunuch’s both going down into the water, and
          coming up out of it, in a profane and irreligious manner, he infers,
          that neither of them were drowned there. Does this become a minister
          of the gospel, to treat the sacred writings, and the accounts they
          give of a solemn ordinance of Christ, after this manner? Whatever
          profane loose he may give himself in his attempts to be witty on the
          mode of baptizing by immersion, which he supposes to be unscriptural,
          yet, at least, he ought to set bounds to himself, and not be so free
          in playing with, and bantering the very words of the holy Ghost. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          2dly, If that is rejected, why then he infers from hence, that they
          were both plunged over head and ears in the water. This, I suppose, is
          designed to shew the absurdity of our way of reasoning, as he
          imagines: But does not the man consider, that the one went down as an
          administrator, the other as a subject of baptism; the one to baptize,
          the other to be baptized? But suppose the ordinance was administered
          by pouring or sprinkling water, might it not be as justly inferred,
          that because they both went down into the water, one to perform, and
          the other to have it performed, and came up again out of it, when it
          was done, therefore they both had water poured upon them, or were
          sprinkled with it? And then,
        </p>
        <p>
          3dly, When he is asked why he could not have concluded, that one was
          plunged and the other not: he replies, "Why truly, says he, because I
          thought it out "of the way of all sense, reason and revelation so to
          infer." I hope he will not say that it is out of the way of all sense,
          reason, and revelation to infer, that the one went down in order to
          administer the ordinance of baptism, and the other to have it
          administered to him; but I suppose he means that it is out of the way
          of all sense, reason and revelation, to infer plunging from hence: But
          how then came the judicious Calvin to be so much out of the way, to
          conclude from hence that plunging was the ancient mode of baptizing,
          as he does, when he says, "here we see what was the rite of baptizing
          with the ancients; for they plunged the whole body into water?"[8] How
          came this great man to be guilty of matting such a vain conjecture as
          our author says it is? especially when he affirms there is not in
          sacred history, the least shadow of a foundation for it. But to
          proceed,
        </p>
        <p>
          4thly, In order to elude the force of our argument, from their going
          down into the water, he observes, that whosoever goes to any water,
          especially out of a chariot, must go down to it. But he is desired to
          observe, that it is not said, that they both went down to the water,
          but they both went into it. As for the text in Ps 107:23 which speaks
          of persons going down to the sea in ships, I hope our author does not
          think that they went by land in ships to the sea-side: If he would
          know what is meant by this, let him read Ps 107:26 where the distress
          that seafaring men are often in, is thus elegantly and beautifully
          described, they mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the
          depths, their soul is melted because of trouble; and what this means,
          those who have used the seas know full well, when their ships have
          been tossed up as it were to the heavens, and then again plunged into
          the depths of the sea, where they have been immersed in, and covered
          over with the waves thereof for a while, and on a sudden, have sprang
          out from thence. It is then they see the wondrous works of the Lord,
          in his remarkable appearance for them, and providential preservation
          of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          5thly, He tells us, that "had he been in the Eunuch's place, he should
          not have chosen to have water poured upon him in the chariot, but for
          several reasons should have been entirely for going down to the
          water." He does not tell us what these designs are, that we might have
          considered them; but with his usual air of confidence affirms, that
          "there was no stripping, nor plunging, nor putting on change of
          raiment in the case;" and all the reason he has to assign for it, is,
          because "Philip was directly caught away by the Spirit of the Lord,
          and the Eunuch immediately went on his way rejoicing:" But I hope he
          will allow that Philip was come up out of the water first, before he
          was caught away, and that the Eunuch was got into his chariot, before
          he went on his way; and to suppose so much time as was necessary to
          change their raiment, is no way contrary to the account in the sacred
          text, and he would also do well to consider, that those words
          directly, and immediately, are not to be found there. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          6thly, He argues, that if those who were baptized by the apostles were
          plunged or overwhelmed, "then what prodigious labor must the apostles
          go though, when three thousand were baptized in one day, yea perhaps
          in less than half of it!" To which I answer; There does not seem to be
          any necessity of concluding from Acts 2:41 that they were all baptized
          in one day; but if they were, when we consider that there were twelve
          apostles, and seventy disciples, who were employed in the ministry of
          the word, Lk 10:1 and so no doubt in baptizing, it will not appear so
          prodigiously fatiguing as our author intimates; for a single person,
          without having the strength either of Hercules, or Samson, and without
          much fatiguing himself, may baptize, in this way, a considerable
          number in a very little time. But then here is another difficulty
          behind, and that is, "What great trouble must they be at in stripping,
          and shifting, and changing apparel! and what abundance of plunging
          garments they must have ready!" To which I reply, no more trouble than
          a single person has for himself, and no more plunging garments to be
          provided than every one to provide for themselves, which is no more
          trouble than when five or ten persons only are baptized: and when we
          consider how much bathing was in use among the Jews, it will not seem
          so strange, where, and how they should be so easily provided with
          plunging garments. Our objector goes on, and adds, "In what a poor
          condition was Paul, when he was plunged, having been so ill, and so
          long without eating or drinking! and after that, how unfit must Paul
          himself be under his wounds and bruises, and in the dead of the night,
          to go into some deep water, and take up the jailor and plunge him!"
          Here I cannot but remark the wretched blunder that our author makes,
          or at least the inadvertency, to say no worse of it, that he is guilty
          of, in talking as if the baptism Paul and the jailor was in one and
          the same night. But if he objects this is not his meaning, why did he
          write in such a blundering manner, and many times with want of sense,
          as when he talks of Paul’s taking up the jailor, and many such like
          passages which are to be found in this his performance. But to
          proceed, that Paul was three-days before his baptism without eating or
          drinking, is true, but that he was so very ill as our author
          represents, does not appear so manifest; however, it is plain, that he
          was not so ill, but he was able to arise and be baptized, which he
          need not have done, had it been performed by pouring or sprinkling
          water upon him. As to Paul’s unfitness, under his wounds and bruises,
          to plunge the jailor, I need only act, how he and Silas were capable
          of praying and singing the praises of God, and that so loud as the
          other prisoners heard them? and after thee preached the gospel to the
          jailor and his family, which must be a much more laborious work, and
          more spending and fatiguing to them, than baptizing of them was; but
          that same God who enabled them to perform the one, carried them
          through the other. Again, he says, "how improperly did Peter speak in
          Cornelius’s house, when he talked of forbidding water! whereas he
          should have said, can any man forbid these men from going to the river
          to be plunged?" to which I answer; if there is any impropriety in this
          text, it is not to be charged upon the words or sense of the holy
          Ghost, but upon our translation; for udwr "water," ought not to be put
          in construction, with keilusai, "forbid," but with baptizhnai, "to be
          baptized;" and so the whole be rendered thus, "Can any man forbid,
          that these should be baptized with water, which have received the holy
          Ghost as well as we?" and then the sense is this; has any man any
          thing to object why these who have received the holy Ghost, even as
          we, should not be admitted to the ordinance of water-baptism? for
          seeing they have received the greater privilege, why should they be
          deprived of the lesser? And this reading and sense of the words are
          confirmed by the learned Erasmus, in his notes upon the text, which
          are these," the Greeks, says he,[9] read after this manner, mhti udwr,
          etc. and the sense appears to be this: "Can any man forbid that there
          should be baptized in water, who have received the holy Ghost as well
          as we? for as the spirit is preferable to water, and seeing they have
          him, it will be no great matter if this be added also: Moreover the
          accusative to udwr. "water;" either depends upon the preposition kata,
          which may be understood, or else adheres to the verb baptizhnai, "to
          be baptized;" just in the same form in which we say, baptizomoi
          baptizisma, "to be baptized with a baptism."

          As to what Mr. B. W. says, concerning the use of plunging garments in
          baptism, that therefore the water comes to the body only a filtering,
          or as it can work its way through, which, says he, at best is only
          equivalent to sprinkling. I need only reply, it is sufficient in
          baptism that the whole body be plunged into and covered under water;
          nor does it much concern us, to observe and know, how it works its way
          through to the body. I hope he will acknowledge, that a corpse may be
          said to be truly buried, when covered with earth, though it is wrapt
          up in a shroud, or in its funeral clothes, and put up close in a
          coffin, so that the earth with which it is covered, does not as yet
          touch it; even so a person may be truly said to be baptized, when in
          the name of the three Divine Persons, he is plunged into, and covered
          over with water, even though the water may not be supposed to have had
          time enough to have worked its way through to his body; and hen it has
          done so, how that is equivalent to sprinkling, no man can evise. But
          enough of this, I proceed to the next argument.
