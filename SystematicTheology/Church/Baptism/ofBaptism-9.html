        <h2>Antipaedobaptism or Infant-Baptism an innovation</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Being a Reply To A Late Pamphlet, Entitled, PAEDOBAPTISM;</p>
        <p>Or, A Defence of Infant-baptism, in point of Antiquity, etc.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          A pamphlet being published some time ago by a nameless author,
          entitled, The baptism of Infants a reasonable Service, etc. I wrote an
          answer to it, chiefly relating to the antiquity of infant-baptism,
          called, The argument from Apostolic tradition, in favor of
          Infant-baptism, etc. considered; and of late another anonymous writer
          has started up in defense of the antiquity of it, from the exceptions
          made by me to it; for it seems it is not the same author, but another
          who has engaged in this controversy; but be he who he will, it does
          not greatly concern me to know; though methinks, if they judge they
          are embarked in a good cause, they should not be ashamed of it, or of
          their names, and of letting the world know who they are, and what
          share they have in the defense of it: but just as they please, it
          gives me no uneasiness; they are welcome to take what method they
          judge most agreeable, provided truth and righteousness are attended
          to.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my answer, I observe that apostolic tradition at most and best is a
          very uncertain and precarious thing, not to be depended upon; of which
          I give an instance so early as the second century, which yet even then
          could not be settled; and that it is doubtful whether there is any
          such thing as apostolic tradition, not delivered in the sacred
          writings; and demand of the Gentleman, whole performance was before
          me, to give me one single instance of it; and if infant-baptism is of
          this kind, to name the apostle or apostles by whom it was delivered,
          and to whom, when, and where; to all which no answer is returned; only
          I observe a deep silence as to undoubted apostolic tradition, so much
          boasted of before.
        </p>
        <p>
          The state of the controversy between us and the Paedobaptists, with
          respect to the antiquity of infant-baptism, lies here; and the
          question is, whether there is any evidence of its being practiced
          before the third century; or before the times of Tertullian. We allow
          it began in the third century, and was then practiced in the African
          churches, where we apprehend it was first moved; but deny there was
          any mention or practice of it before that age; and affirm that
          Tertullian is the first person known that spoke of it, and who speaks
          against it: I have therefore required of any of our learned
          Paedobaptists to produce a single passage out of any authentic writer
          before Tertullian, in which infant-baptism is expressly mentioned, or
          clearly hinted at, or plainly supposed, or manifestly referred to: if
          this is not done, the controversy must remain just in the same state
          where it was, and infant-baptism carried not a moment higher that it
          was before; and whatever else is done below this date, is all to no
          purpose. How far this Gentleman, who has engaged in this controversy,
          has succeeded, is our next business to inquire.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only Christian writers of the first century, any of whose writings
          are extant, are Barnabas, Clemens Romanus, Hermas, Polycarp, and
          Ignatius; nothing out of Barnabas, Polycarp, and Ignatius, in favor of
          infant-baptism, is pretended to. "The most ancient writer that we have
          (says this Gentleman, in the words of Mr. Bingham) is Clemens Romanus,
          who lived in the time of the apostles; and he, though he doth not
          directly mention infant-baptism, yet says a thing that by consequence
          proves it; for he makes infants liable to original sin, which is in
          effect to say that they have need of baptism to purge it away, etc."
          The passage or passages in Clemens, in which he lays this thing, are
          not produced; I suppose they are the same that are quoted by Dr Wall,
          in neither of which does he say any such thing; it is true, in the
          first of them he makes mention of a passage in Job 14:4 according to
          the Greek version, no man is free from pollution, no not though his
          life is but of one day; which might be brought indeed to prove
          original sin, but is not brought by Clemens for any such purpose, but
          as a self-accusation of Job; shewing, that though he had the character
          of a good man, yet he was not free from sin: and the other only speaks
          of men coming into the world as out of a grave and darkness, meaning
          out of their mother’s womb; and seem, not to refer to any moral death
          and darkness men are under, or to the sinful state of men as they come
          into the world: but be it so, that in these passages Clemens does
          speak of original sin, what is this to infant-baptism, or the
          necessity of it? is there no other way to purge away original sin, but
          baptism? nay, is there any such virtue in baptism as to purge it away?
          there is not; it is the blood of Christ, and that only, that purges
          away sin, whether original or actual. Should it be said that this was
          the sense of the ancients in some after-ages, who did ascribe such a
          virtue to baptism, and did affirm it was necessary to be administered,
          and did administer it to infants for that purpose, what is this to
          Clemens? what, because some persons in some after-ages gave into this
          stupid notion, that baptism took away original sin, and was necessary
          to infants, and ought to be given them for that reason, does it follow
          that Clemens was of that mind? or is there the least hint of it in his
          letter? What though he held the doctrine of original sin, does it
          follow therefore that he was for infant-baptism? how many
          Antipaedobaptists are there who profess the same doctrine? will any
          man from hence conclude that they are for and in the practice of
          infant-baptism? It follows in the words of the same writer; "Hermes
          pastor (Hermas I suppose it should be) lived about the same time with
          Clemens; and hath several passages to shew the general necessity of
          water, that is, baptism, to save men:" the passages referred to are
          those Dr Wall has produced. Hermas had a vision of a tower built on
          water; inquiring the reason of it, he is told, it was "because your
          life is, and will be saved by water:" and in another place, "before
          any one receives the name of the Son of God, he is liable to death;
          but when he receives that seal, he is delivered from death, and is
          assigned to life; and that seal is water."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now by water Hermas is supposed to mean baptism; but surely he could
          not mean real material water, or the proper ordinance of
          water-baptism, since he speaks of the patriarchs coming up through
          this water, and being sealed with this seal after they were dead, and
          so entering into the kingdom of God: but how disembodied spirits could
          be baptized in real water, is not easy to conceive; it must surely
          design something mystical; and what it is, I must leave to those who
          better understand these visionary things: but be it so, that baptism
          in water is meant, salvation by it may be understood in the same sense
          as the apostle Peter ascribes salvation to it, when he says, that
          baptism saves by the resurrection of Christ from the dead; that is, by
          directing the baptized person to Christ for salvation, who was
          delivered for his offenses, and rose again for his justification; of
          which resurrection baptism by immersion is a lively emblem; and Hermas
          is only speaking of adult persons, and not of infants, or of their
          baptism, or of the necessity of it to their salvation: in another
          place indeed he speaks of some that were as infants without malice,
          and so more honorable than others; and, adds he, all infants, are
          honored with the Lord, and accounted of first of all; that is, all
          such infants as before described: but be it that infants in age are
          meant, they may be valued and loved by the Lord; he may shew mercy to
          them, choose, redeem, regenerate, and save them, and yet not order
          them to be baptized; nor has he ordered it: however Hermas has not a
          word about the baptism of them, and therefore these passages are
          impertinently referred to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now these are all the passages of the writers of the first century
          brought into this controversy; in which there is so far from being any
          express mention of infant-baptism, that it is not in the least hinted
          at, nor referred unto; nor is any thing of this kind pretended to,
          till we come to the middle of the next age; and yet our author upon
          the above passages concludes after this manner: "thus—we have traced
          up the practice of infant baptism to the time of the apostles;" when
          those writers give not the least hint of infant-baptism, or have any
          reference to it, or the practice of it. It is amazing what a face some
          men have!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now proceed to the second century. The book of Recognitions,
          this writer seems to be at a loss where to place it, whether after or
          before Justin; however, Mr. Bingham tells him, "it is an ancient
          writing of the same age with Justin Martyr, mentioned by Origen in his
          Philocalia, and by some ascribed to Bardesanes Syrus, who lived about
          the middle of the second century." It is indeed mentioned by Origen,
          though not under that name, and is by him ascribed to Clemens, as it
          has been commonly done; and if so, might have been placed among the
          testimonies of the first century; but this Gentleman’s author says it
          is ascribed by some to Bardesanes Syrus: it is true, there is inserted
          in it a fragment out of a dialogue of his concerning fate, against
          Abydas an astrologer; but then it should rather be concluded from
          hence, as Fabricius observes,[1] that the author of the Recognitions,
          is a later writer than Bardesanes: but be it so that it is him, who is
          this Bardesanes? an arch-heretic, one that first fell into the
          Valentinian heresy; and though he seemed afterwards to change his
          mind, he was not wholly free, as Eusebius says,[2] from his old
          heresy; and he became the author of a new sect, called after his name
          Bardesanists; who held that the devil was not a creature of God; that
          Christ did not assume human flesh; and that the body rises not.[3] The
          book of Recognitions, ascribed to him, is urged by the Papists, as Mr.
          James observes[4] to prove the power of exorcists, free-will, faith
          alone insufficient, the chrysm in baptism, and Peter’s succession;
          though the better sort of writers among them are ashamed of it. Sixtus
          Senensis says[5] that "most things in it are uncertain, many fabulous,
          and some contrary to doctrines generally received." And Baronius[6]
          has these words concerning it: "Away with such monstrous lies and mad
          dotages, which are brought out of the said filthy ditch of the
          Recognitions, which go under the name of Clemens:" but all this is no
          matter, if infant-baptism can be proved out it; but how? "This author
          speaks of the necessity of baptism in the same stile as Justin Martyr
          did—was undeniably an assertor of the general necessity of baptism to
          salvation:" wherever this wretched tenet, this false notion of the
          absolute necessity of baptism to salvation is met with, the
          Paedobaptists presently smell out infant-baptism, one falsehood
          following upon another; and true it is, that one error leads on to
          another; and this false doctrine paved the way for infant-baptism; but
          then the mystery of iniquity worked by degrees; as soon as it was
          broached infant-baptism did not immediately commence: it does not
          follow, because that heretic asserted this notion, that therefore he
          was for or in the practice of infant-baptism; besides this book, be
          the author of it who will, is not made mention of before the third
          century, if so soon; for the work referred to by Origen has another
          title, and was in another form; he calls it the circuits of Peter, an
          apocryphal, fabulous and romantic writing; and though the passage he
          quotes is in the Recognitions, which makes some learned men conclude
          it to be the same with that; yet so it might be, and not be the same
          with it. But I pass on to a more authentic and approved writer of the
          second century: Justin Martyr, who lived about the year 150; and the
          first passage produced from him is this:[7] "We bring them (namely,
          the new converts) to some place where there is water, and they are
          regenerated by the same way of regeneration by which we were
          regenerated; for they are washed with water in the name of God the
          Father and Lord of all things, and of our Savior Jesus Christ, and of
          the holy Spirit." In this passage, it is owned, "Justin is describing
          the manner of adult baptism only; having no occasion to descend to any
          farther particulars; nor is it alleged, it is said, as a proof of
          infant-baptism directly; but only to shew, that this ancient writer
          used the word regeneration so as to connote baptism—yet his words
          cannot be thought to exclude the baptism of infants in these days:"
          but if infant-baptism had been practiced in those days, it is not
          consistent with that sincerity and impartiality which Justin sets out
          with, when he proposed to give the Roman Emperor an account of
          Christian baptism, not to make any mention of that; for he introduces
          it thus: "We will declare after what manner, when we were renewed by
          Christ, we devoted ourselves unto God, lest omitting this we should
          seem to act a bad part (prevaricate or deal unfairly) in this
          declaration;" whereas it was not dealing fairly with the Emperor, and
          not giving him a full and fair account of the administration of the
          ordinance of baptism to all its proper subjects, if infants had used
          to be baptized; which he could easily have introduced the mention of,
          and one would think could not have omitted it: betides, as Dr. Gale[8]
          observes, he had an occasion to speak of it, and to descend to this
          particular, had it been used; since the Christians were charged with
          using their infants barbarously; which he might have removed, had this
          been the case, by observing the great regard they had to them in
          devoting them to God in baptism, and thereby initiating them into
          their religion, and providing for the salvation of their souls: but
          Justin is so far from saying any thing of this kind, that he leaves
          the Emperor and every body else to conclude that infants were not the
          subjects of baptism in this early age; for as the above writer
          observes, immediately follow such words as directly oppose
          infant-baptism; they are these: "And we have been taught by the
          apostles this reason for this thing; because we being ignorant of our
          first birth, were generated by necessity, etc. that we should not
          continue children of that necessity and ignorance, but of will (or
          choice) and knowledge; and should obtain forgiveness of the sins in
          which we have lived, by water:" so that in order to obtain these
          things by water or baptism, which Justin speaks of, there must be free
          choice and knowledge, which infants are not capable of: but it seems
          the main thing this passage is brought to prove, is, that the words
          regenerated and regeneration are used for baptized and baptism; and
          this agreeing with the words of Christ in Jn 3:5 shews that this
          construction of them then obtained, that baptism is necessary to
          salvation. Now, it should be observed, that the persons Justin speaks
          of are not represented by him as regenerated by baptism, because they
          are spoken of before as converted persons and believers; and it is as
          clear and plain that their baptism is distinguished from their
          regeneration, and is not the same thing; for Justin uses the former as
          an argument of the latter; which if the same, his sense must be, they
          were baptized because they were baptized; whereas his sense,
          consistent with himself, and the practice of the primitive churches,
          is; that there persons, when brought to the water, having made a
          profession of their regeneration, were owned and declared regenerated
          persons; as was manifest from their being admitted to the ordinance of
          water-baptism; and from hence it appears, that, then no such
          construction of Jn 3:5 obtained, that baptism is necessary to
          salvation: and this now seems to be the passage referred to, in which
          Justin is said to speak of the necessity of baptism, in a stile the
          author of the Recognitions agreed with him in; but without any reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next passage out of Justin is in his dialogue with Trypho the Jew;
          where he says that "concerning the influence and effect of Adam’s sin
          upon mankind, which the ancient writers represent as the ground and
          reason of infant-baptism—" The words, as cited by Dr Wall, to whom our
          author refers us, are there: Justin, speaking of the birth, baptism,
          and crucifixion of Christ, says[9] "he did this for mankind, which by
          Adam was fallen under death, and under the guile of the serpent;
          beside the particular cause which each man had of sinning."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, allowing that this is spoken of original sin, as it seems to be,
          what is this to infant-baptism? I have already exposed the folly of
          arguing from persons holding the one, to the practice of the other. It
          is added by our author, "in the same book, he (Justin) speaks of
          baptism being to Christians in the room of circumcision, and so points
          out the analogy between those two initiatory rites." The passage
          referred to is this:[10] "We also who by him have had access to God,
          have not received this carnal circumcision, but the spiritual
          circumcision, which Enoch, and those like him, have observed; and we
          have received it by baptism by the mercy of God, because we were
          sinners; and it is enjoined to all persons to receive it the same
          way." Now let be observed, that this spiritual circumcision, whatever
          Justin means by it, can never design baptism; since the patriarch
          Enoch, and others like him, observed it: and since Christians are said
          to receive it by baptism, and therefore must be different from baptism
          itself: nor does Justin say any thing of the analogy between baptism
          and circumcision, or of the one being in the room of the other; but
          opposes the spiritual circumcision to carnal circumcision; and speaks
          not one word of infants, only of the duty of adult persons, as he
          supposes it to be. The last passage, and on which this Gentleman
          intends to dwell awhile, is this:[11] "Several persons (says Justin)
          among us of both sexes, of sixty and seventy years of age, oi ek
          paidwn emaqhteuqh san tw Crisw, "who were discipled to Christ in their
          childhood, etc." which I have observed should be rendered, "who from
          their childhood were instructed in Christ;" and which I have confirmed
          by several passages in Justin, in which he uses the word in the sense
          of instruction; and from whom can we better learn his meaning than
          from himself? all which this author takes no notice of; but puts me
          off with a passage out of Plutarch, where Antiphon the son of
          Sophilus, according to his version, is said to be discipled or
          proselyted to his father: I leave him to enjoy his own sense; for I do
          not understand it; and should have thought that maqhteusav de tw
          patri, might have been rendered more intelligibly, as well as more
          truly, "instructed by his father;" since, as it follows, his father
          was an orator. He thinks he has catched me off of my guard, and that I
          suppose the word disciple includes baptism; because in my commentary
          on Acts 19:3 I say, "the apostle takes it for granted that they were
          baptized, since they were not only believers, but disciples;" but had
          he read on, or transcribed what follows, my sense would clearly
          appear; "such as not only believed with the heart, but had made a
          profession of their faith, and were followers of Christ:" nor is the
          sense of the word disciple, as including the idea of baptism,
          confirmed by Acts 14:21 where it is said, when they had preached the
          gospel to that city, ki maqhteusanteV , "and taught many, or made them
          disciples;" which may be interpreted without tautology, and yet not
          include the idea of baptism; since the first word, preached, expresses
          the bare external ministry of the word; and the latter, taught, or
          made disciples, the influence and effect of it upon the minds of men;
          the former may be where the latter is not; and both, where baptism is
          not as yet administered. The reason why ekpaidwn must be rendered in,
          and not from their childhood, because the baptism of any persons being
          not a continued, but one single transient act, to speak of their being
          baptized from their childhood would be improper, is merry indeed; when
          Justin is not speaking of the baptism of any person at all; but of
          their being trained up in the knowledge of Christ, and the Christian
          religion from their childhood, in which they had persevered to the
          years mentioned. Upon the whole, in all there passages of Justin
          quoted, there is no express mention of infant-baptism, nor any hint
          given of it, nor any reference unto it. Proceed we now to the next
          writer in this century, brought into this controversy:
        </p>
        <p>
          Irenaeus; who lived towards the close of it, and wrote about the year
          180; the only passage in him, and which has been the subject of debate
          a hundred years past, is this; speaking of Christ, he says,[12] "he
          came to save all, all I say, qui per eum renascuntur in Deum, "who by
          him are born again unto God;" infants, and little ones, and children,
          and young men, and old men." Now not to insist upon the works of
          Irenaeus we have being mostly a translation, and a very poor one,
          complained of by learned men; nor upon this chapter wherein this
          passage is, being reckoned spurious by others; which weaken the force
          of this testimony, and will have their weight with considering
          persons; I shall only take notice of the sense of the phrase, born
          again unto God; and the injury done to the character of Irenaeus, to
          make it signify baptism, or any thing else but the grace of
          regeneration. Our author begins his defense of this passage in favor
          of infant-baptism, with a remark of the learned Feuardentius, as he
          calls him; "that by the name of regeneration, according to the phrase
          of Christ: and his apostles, he (Irenaeus) understands baptism,
          clearly confirming the apostolical tradition concerning the baptism of
          infants." As for the learning of this monk, I cannot discern it,
          unless his lies and impudence against the reformers, which run through
          his notes, are to be so called. Whether our author is a junior or
          senior man, I know not; by his writing he seems to be the former, but
          the advice of Rivet, who was without doubt a man of learning, is good;
          only, says he,[13] "I would have the younger, that shall light on the
          works of Irenaeus advised, to beware of those editions, which that
          most impudent monk Feuardentius, a man of large assurance, and
          uncommon boldness, and of no faith nor faithfulness, has in many
          things foully corrupted and defiled with impious and lying
          annotations:" and a false gloss this of his is, which is quoted; for
          Christ and his apostles no where call baptism by the name of the new
          birth. I have observed, that as yet, that is, in Irenaeus’ time, it
          had not obtained among the ancients, to use the words regenerated or
          regeneration for baptized or baptism; nor is this author able to prove
          it. The passage in Justin before-mentioned falls short of it, as has
          been shewn; and the passages in Tertullian and Clemens of Alexandria,
          concerning being born in water, and begotten of the womb of water, are
          too late; and beside, the one is to be interpreted of the grace of God
          compared to water; this is clearly Tertullian’s sense; for he adds[14]
          "nor are we otherwise safe or saved, than by remaining in water;"
          which surely can never be understood literally of the water of baptism
          and as for Clemens,[15] he is speaking not of regeneration, but of the
          natural generation of man, as he comes out of his mother’s womb,
          naked, and free from sin, as he supposes; and as such, converted
          persons ought to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          To have recourse to heathens to ascertain the name of Christian
          baptism, is monstrous; though this, it is said, there is no need of,
          "since several Christian writers, who lived with or before Irenaeus,
          speak the same language, as will be seen hereafter:" and yet none are
          produced but Barnabas and Justin; the latter of which has been
          considered already, and found not to the purpose; and his reasoning
          upon the former is beyond my comprehension; for whatever may be said
          for the giving of milk and honey to persons just baptized, being a
          symbol of their being born again, it can be no proof of the words
          regeneration and regenerated being used for baptism and baptized; when
          there words neither the one nor the other are mentioned by Barnabas;
          so that I have no reason to retract what I have said on that point.
          And now we are returned to Irenaeus himself; and two passages from him
          are produced in proof of the sense of the word contended for; and one
          is where he thus speaks[16] "and again giving the power of
          regeneration unto God to his disciples, he said unto them, Go and
          teach all nations, baptizing them, etc." By which power or commission
          is meant, not the commission of baptizing, but more plainly the
          commission of teaching the doctrine of regeneration by the Spirit of
          God, and the necessity of that to salvation, and in order to baptism;
          and which was the first and principal part of the apostles commission,
          as the order of the words shew; and it is molt reasonable to think,
          that he should so call the commission, not from its more remote and
          less principal part, but from the first and more principal one. The
          other passage is where Irenaeus mentions[17] by name "the baptism of
          regeneration to God:" but this rather proves the contrary, that
          baptism and regeneration are two different things, and not the same;
          just as the scriptural phrase, the baptism of repentance, and which
          seems to have led the ancients to such a way of speaking, means
          something different from repentance, and not the same: baptism is so
          called, because repentance is a prerequisite to it, in the subjects of
          it; and for the same reason it is called the baptism of regeneration,
          because regeneration is absolutely necessary in order to it: to all
          which I only add, that Irenaeus not only uses the word regeneration in
          a different sense from baptism elsewhere,[18] but most clearly uses it
          in another sense in this very passage; since he says, Christ came to
          save all who by him are born again unto God; who are regenerated by
          Christ, and not by baptism; and which is explained both before and
          after by his sanctifying all sorts of persons, infants, little ones,
          young men, and old men; which cannot be understood of his baptizing
          them, for he baptized none; and therefore they cannot be said to be
          regenerated by him in that sense: and I say again, to understand
          Irenaeus as speaking of baptism, is to make him speak what is
          absolutely false; that Christ came to save all and only such who are
          baptized unto God. It seems LeClerc is of the same sentiment with me,
          an author I am a stranger to; whom this writer lets pass without any
          reasoning against him, only with this chastisement; "he should have
          understood (being an ecclesiastical historian) the sentiments and
          language of the primitive fathers better;" but what their language and
          sentiments were, we have seen already; and let them be what they will,
          Irenaeus must express a downright falsehood, if he is to be understood
          in the sense contended for: on the one hand, it cannot be true that
          Christ came to save all that are baptized; no doubt but Judas was
          baptized, as well as the other apostles, and yet it will not be said
          Christ came to save him; Simon Magus was certainly baptized, and yet
          was in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity, and by all the
          accounts of him continued so till death; there were many members of
          the church at Corinth, who doubtless were baptized, and yet were
          unworthy receivers of the Lord’s supper, and eat and drank damnation
          to themselves, for which reason there were many weak, sickly, and
          asleep;[19] and it is to be feared, without any breach of charity,
          that this has been the case of thousands besides: and on the other
          hand, it cannot be with truth suggested, that Christ came to save only
          such as are baptized; he came to die for the transgressions that were
          under the First Testament, or to save persons under that dispensation,
          who never received Christian baptism; he said to one and to another,
          unbaptized persons, thy sins are forgiven thee; (Mat 9:5; Lk 7:48) and
          no doubt there are many saved, and whom Christ came to save, who never
          were baptized in water; and the Paedobaptists themselves will stand a
          bad chance for salvation, if this was true; for they will find it a
          hard task to prove that any one of them, only sprinkled in infancy,
          was ever truly baptized; and yet as uncharitable as we are said to be,
          we have so much charity to believe that every good man among them,
          though unbaptized, shall be saved. And now since the words of Irenaeus
          taken in this sense contain a manifest falsehood, and they are capable
          of another sense, agreeable to truth, without straining them; as that
          thrift: came to save all that are regenerated by himself, by his
          spirit and grace, we ought in a judgment of charity to believe that
          this latter sense is his, and not the former; and the rather, since
          his words in their proper and literal sense have this meaning; and
          since they are expressed with so much caution; lest it should be
          thought it was his meaning that Christ came to save all men, good and
          bad, he describes the patrons he came to save, not by their baptism,
          which is a precarious and uncertain evidence of salvation, but by
          their regeneration, which is a sure proof of it; and since this sense
          of his words is agreeable to his use of the phrase elsewhere, and to
          the context likewise, and is suited to all sorts of persons of every
          age here mentioned; and indeed to depart from this clear literal sense
          of his words, which establishes a well-known truth, and fix a
          figurative, improper one upon them, which makes him to say a notorious
          untruth, to serve an hypothesis, is cruel usage of the good old
          father, and is contrary to all the rules of honor, justice, truth, and
          charity. To put our Lord’s words in Mk 16:16 upon a level with the
          false sense of Irenaeus, is mean and stupid; they need no qualifying
          sense; the meaning is plain and easy; that every baptized believer
          shall be saved, and leave no room to suggest that unbaptized believers
          shall not; but that every unbeliever, be he who he will, baptized or
          unbaptized, shall be damned. And now what a wretched cause must the
          cause of infant-baptism be, that requires such managing as this to
          maintain it? what a wretched cause is it, that at its first setting
          out, according to the account of the advocates of it; for Dr Wall
          says,[20] "this is the first express mention that we have met with of
          infants "baptized?" I say again, what a wretched cause must this be,
          that is connected with lies and falsehood at its first appearance, as
          pleaded for; is established upon downright injustice to a good man’s
          character, and supported by real injury to it? and yet notwithstanding
          all this, our author has the front to say, "so much then for the
          testimony, the plain, unexceptionable testimony, of Irenaeus, for the
          practice of infant-baptism."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we are come to the close of the second century; but before we
          pass to the next, we must stop a little, and consider a passage our
          author, after Dr. Wall, has produced out of Clemens of Alexandria, who
          lived at the latter end of this century, about the year 190; and it is
          this: speaking of rings worn on the fingers, and the seals upon them,
          advises against every thing idolatrous and lascivious, and to what is
          innocent and useful; "let our seals," says he,[21] "be a dove, or a
          fish, or a ship running with the wind, or a musical harp—or a
          mariner’s anchor,—and if any one is a fisherman, Aposolou memnhsetai
          ki tan ex udatov anaspwmenwn paidiwn, let him remember the apostle,
          and the children drawn out of the water."
        </p>
        <p>
          This passage was sent by two Gentlemen from different places to Dr
          Wall, after he had published two editions of his history; and he seems
          to have been ashamed of himself for not having observed it, and
          fancies that this refers to the baptizing of a child, and the taking,
          drawing, and lifting it out of the water. Now, though I do not pretend
          to support my conjecture by any manuscript or printed copy, nor do I
          think it worth while to search and inquire after it, whether there is
          any various reading or no, but shall leave it to others who have more
          leisure and opportunity; yet I persuade myself my conjecture will not
          be condemned as a groundless one by any man of sense and learning,
          especially out of this controversy: my conjecture then is, that it
          should be read not paidiwn, "children," but icquwn, "fishes;" for who
          ever heard of a draught of children; when a draught of fishes is
          common? and why should a fisherman, more than any other, remember an
          apostle and a draught of children? surely a draught of fishes is more
          proper to him: the words I think therefore should be read, "let him
          remember the apostle, and the fishes drawn out of the water;" and the
          sense is, let him remember the apostle Peter, and the draught of
          fishes taken by him, recorded either in Lk 5:6; Lk 5:9 or in Jn 21:6;
          Jn 21:8; Jn 21:11; for the words manifestly refer to some particular
          and remarkable fact, which should be called to mind, and not to a
          thing that was done every day; which must be the case, if
          infant-baptism now obtained: besides, the word used cannot with any
          decency and propriety be applied to the baptizing of a child; a wide
          difference there is in the expression, between taking and lifting a
          child out of the font, and a drawing or dragging it out of the water;
          the word is expressive of strength and force necessary to an action
          (Lk 14:15; Acts 11:10), and well agrees with the drawing or dragging
          of a net full of fishes. However, if this instance is continued to be
          urged, I hope it will be allowed that baptism in those early times was
          performed by immersion; since these children are said to be drawn out
          of the water, and therefore must have been in it: moreover, let it be
          what it will that Clemens refers unto, it must be something that was
          not common to every man, but peculiar to a fisherman; as he afterwards
          says, a sword or a bow are not proper for those that pursue peace; nor
          cups for temperate persons; and I insist upon it, that it be said what
          that is which is peculiar to such a one, except it be that which I
          have suggested: and after all, he must have a warm brain, a heated
          imagination, and a mind prepossessed, that can believe that
          infant-baptism is here referred to. Upon the whole, it does not appear
          from any authentic writer of the second century, that there is any
          express mention of infant-baptism in it, nor any clear hint of it, or
          manifest reference to it; and therefore it must be an innovation in
          the church, whenever it afterwards took place. I proceed now to,
        </p>
        <p>
          The third century, at the beginning of which Tertullian lived; who is
          the first person that ever gave any hint of infant-baptism, or
          referred unto it, or made express mention of it, that is known; and he
          argued against it, and that very strongly, from the more usual delay
          of the administration of it, according to every one’s age, condition,
          and disposition; from the danger sureties might be brought into by
          engaging for infants; from the necessity of first knowing and
          understanding what they were about; from their innocent age, as it
          comparatively is, not being yet conscious of sin, standing in no need
          of the application of pardoning grace, which the ordinance of baptism
          leads adult believers to; from the propriety of their first asking for
          it; and from a different method being taken in worldly affairs: his
          words are these, and as they are translated by Dr. Wall himself;
          "therefore according to every one’s condition and disposition, and
          also their age, the delaying of baptism is more profitable, especially
          in the case of little children; for what need is there that the
          godfathers should be brought into danger? because they may either fail
          of their promises by death, or they may be mistaken by a child’s
          proving of a wicked disposition. Our Lord says indeed, Do not forbid
          them to come to me: therefore let them come when they are grown up:
          let them come when they understand: when they are instructed whither
          it is that they come: let them be made Christians when they can know
          Christ; what need their guiltless age make such haste to the
          forgiveness of sins? Men will proceed more warily in worldly things;
          and he that should not have earthly goods committed to him, yet shall
          have heavenly. Let them know how to desire this salvation, that you
          may appear to have given to one that asketh."[22]
        </p>
        <p>
          It is observed by our author, after Dr Wall, that in the clause about
          sponsors, in the older editions, there words come in, si non tam
          necesse, which are rendered, except in case of necessity. But these
          older editions are but one Gagnaeus, whose reading is rejected by
          Rigaltius as a foolish repetition; censured by Grotius, as affording
          no tolerable sense;[23] received by Pamelius for no other reason that
          he gives, but because it softens the opinion of the author about the
          delaying of baptism to infants;[24] and it is for this reason it is
          catched at by the Paedobaptists; and yet they do not seem to be quite
          easy with it, because of the nonsense and impertinence of it; "what
          need is there, except there is a need?" wherefore our author attempts
          an emendation, and proposes to read tamen for tam, which does not make
          it a whit the better, but rather increases the nonsense; "what need is
          there, except notwithstanding there is need?" but what is of more
          importance is, it is said, "these words of Tertullian seem fairly to
          imply that infant baptism was not only moved for, but actually
          practiced in his time:" to which I answer, that they neither do imply,
          nor seem to imply any such thing, at least not necessarily; for
          supposing the baptism of infants moved for, and sureties promised to
          be engaged for them, which seems likely to be the case as soon as
          mentioned, the better to get it received; Tertullian might say all
          that he does, though as yet not one infant had ever been baptized, or
          any sureties made use of: and indeed it would have been very strange,
          if nothing of this kind had been said previous to the observance of
          them; the bare motion of these things was sufficient to bring our the
          arguments against them: and what though Tertullian might have some odd
          notions and singular opinions, about which he talked wrong and weakly,
          does it follow that therefore he so did about these points? Nor is
          there any reason to interpret his words of the infants of infidels,
          since he makes no distinction in the passage, nor gives the least hint
          of any; and what he elsewhere says of the children of believers being
          holy, he explains of their being designed for holiness;[25]and says
          men are not born, but made Christians:[26] nor does he any where allow
          of the baptism of infants, in case of necessity, which is only
          established upon that impertinent reading before-mentioned: and with
          respect to his notion of the necessity of baptism to salvation, it is
          sufficient to observe what he says; "if any understand the importance
          of baptism, they will rather fear the having it, than the delaying it:
          true faith is secure of salvation."[27] And the reason why he does not
          produce infant-baptism among his unwritten customs, is very easy to
          observe, because as yet no such custom had obtained, and as yet the
          apostolical tradition of it had never been heard of: the first that
          speaks of that, if he does at all, is the following person;
        </p>
        <p>
          Origen, who flourished about the year 230, and comes next under
          consideration: and three passages are usually cited out of him in
          favor of infant-baptism; shewing not only that infants should be
          baptized; but that this was an ancient usage of the church, and a
          tradition of the apostles. Now there things are only to be met with in
          the Latin translations of this ancient writer; and though there is
          much of his still extant in Greek, yet in these his genuine works
          there is not the least hint of infant-baptism, nor any reference to
          it; and much less any express mention of it; and still less any thing
          did of it, being a custom of the church, and an apostolical tradition:
          This has justly raised a suspicion, that he has not been fairly used
          in the translations of him by Ruffinus and Jerome: and upon inquiry,
          this is found to be the truth of the matter; and it is not only
          Erasmus, whom Dr. Wall is pleased to represent as angrily saying, that
          a reader is uncertain whether he reads Origen or Ruffinus; for
          Scutetus[28] says the same thing; and it is the observation of many
          others, that it was the common custom of Ruffinus to interpolate
          whatever he translated. The learned Huctius, who has given us a good
          edition of all Origen’s commentaries of the scripture in Greek, and
          who was as conversant with his writings, and understood them as well
          as any man whatever, was very sensible of the foul play he has met
          with, and often complains of the perfidy and impudence of Ruffinus; he
          says of him, that whatever he undertook to translate, he interpolated;
          that he so distressed and corrupted the writings of Origen by
          additions and detractions, that one is at a loss to find Origen in
          Origen: that whereas he undertook to translate his commentary on the
          Romans, at the instance of Heraclius, yet he asks, with what
          faithfulness did he do it? namely, with his own, that is, which is the
          worst; and when Huetius produces any thing out of there translations,
          it is always with diffidence, as not to be depended upon and sometimes
          he adds when he has done, "but let us remember again the perfidy of
          Ruffinus;" and speaking particularly of his commentaries on the
          Romans, he says; "Let the learned reader remember that Origen is not
          so much to be thought the author of them, as Ruffinus, by whom they
          are not so much interpreted, as new coined and interpolated."[29]
        </p>
        <p>
          But what need I produce these testimonies? Ruffinus himself owns, not
          only that he used great freedom in translating the homilies on
          Leviticus, and added much of his own to them, as I have observed; but
          also in his translation of the commentary on the Romans, he grants the
          charge against him, "that he added some things, supplied what was
          wanting, and shortened what were too long;"[30] and it is from there
          two pieces that the two principal passages which assert infant-baptism
          to be the custom of the church, and an apostolical tradition, are
          taken: and now of what use is this Gentleman’s quotation from
          Marshall? it is good for nothing. The other passage, which stands in
          Jerome’s translation of Origen’s homilies on Luke, speaks indeed of
          the baptism of infants, and the necessity of it; but not a word of its
          being a custom of the church, and an apostolical tradition, as in the
          other; and betide, his translations being no more exact than
          Ruffinus’, and which appears by his other versions; in which he takes
          the same liberty as Ruffinus did, are no more to be depended upon than
          his. And now, where is his highest probability and moral certainty,
          that there are no additions and interpolations in Origen? I appeal to
          the whole world, whether such fort of writings as there, so manifestly
          corrupted, so confessedly interpolated, would be admitted an evidence
          in any civil affair in any court of judicature whatever; and if not,
          then surely these ought not to be admitted as an evidence in religious
          affairs, respecting an ordinance of our Lord Jesus Christ. But it is
          said, "supposing all this, what does it signify in the present case,
          unless it could be proved that the particular passages under
          consideration were additions or interpolations?"
        </p>
        <p>
          To which I answer; since the whole is so interpolated, and so
          deformed, that it can scarcely be known, as has been observed, what
          dependence can there be on any part of it? I have observed, that the
          passage in the homilies on Leviticus, is by Vossius thought to be of
          the greater authority against the Pelagians, because of the
          interpolations of Ruffinus. This Gentleman says, I have unluckily
          observed this; I do not see any unluckiness in it; it is lucky on my
          side, that Vossius, a Paedobaptist, should suggest that this passage
          is interpolated, however unlucky Ruffinus was in doing it; and it is
          no. unusual thing for a writer to infect that in his works, which
          makes or may be improved against himself: beside, what makes these
          very passages suspected of interpolation, is, not only that no
          contemporary of Origen’s, nor any writer before him, nor any after
          him, till the times of Ruffius and Jerome, ever speak of
          infant-baptism as a custom of the church, or an apostolic tradition;
          but neither Cyprian who came after him, and pleaded for
          infant-baptism, ever refers to Origen as saying these things, or uses
          such language as he is said to do; nor does Austin, who made such a
          bluster about infant-baptism being an apostolical tradition, ever
          appeal to Origen’s testimony of it; which one would think he would
          have done, had there been any such testimony: our author, because I
          have said that many things may be observed from the Greek of Origen in
          favor of adult-baptism, hectors most manfully; "the assertion, he
          says, is either false, or very impertinent;" but surely he must be a
          little too premature to pass such a censure before the things are
          produced. I greatly question whether he has ever read the writings of
          Origen, either the Latin translations of him, or his works in Greek;
          and indeed there are scarce any of his quotations of the fathers
          throughout his whole work, but what seem to be taken at second hand
          from Dr Wall, or others: I say more than I should have chose to have
          said, through his insulting language. I am quite content he should
          have all the credit his performance will admit of; only such a writer,
          who knows his own weakness, ought not to be so pert and insolent:
          however, to stop the mouth of this swaggering blade, whoever he is, I
          will give him an instance or two out of the Greek of Origen, in favor
          of adult-baptism, to the exclusion of infant-baptism, and as
          manifestly against it. Now, not to take notice of Origen’s[31]
          interpretation of Mat 19:14 as not of infants literally, but
          metaphorically; which, according to his sense, destroys the argument
          of the Paedobaptists from thence, in favor of infant-baptism: "It is
          to be observed, says Origen, that the four evangelists saying that
          John confessed he came to baptize in water, only Matthew adds unto
          repentance; teaching, that he has the profit of baptism who "is
          baptized of his own will and choice:"
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if the profit of baptism is tied to "a person baptized of his own
          will and choice,’ according to Origen, then baptism mutt: be
          unprofitable and insignificant to infants, because they are not
          baptized of their own will and choice: and a little after he says;
          "The laver by the water is a symbol of the purification of the soul
          washed from all the filth of wickedness; nevertheless also of itself
          it is the beginning and fountain of divine gifts, because of the power
          of the invocation of the adorable Trinity, "to him that gives up
          himself to God;"[32] which last clause excludes infants, since they do
          not and cannot give up themselves to God in that ordinance. Let this
          Gentleman, if he can, produce any thing out of those writings of
          Origen, in favor of infant-baptism; the passage Dr. Wall[33] refers to
          has not a syllable of it, nor any reference to it; and though he
          supposes Jerome must some where or other have read it in his writings,
          what Jerome says[34] supposes no such thing; since the passage only
          speaks of Origen’s opinion of sins in a pre-existent state, being
          forgiven in baptism, but not a word of the baptism of infants, or of
          their sins being forgiven them in their baptism: and now where is the
          clear testimony of the great Origen, not only for the practice of
          infant-baptism in his own days, but for the continual use of it all
          along from the time of the apostles? and where is our author’s vaunt
          of the superior antiquity of infant-baptism to infant-communion?
          which, as we shall see presently, began together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cyprian is the next, and the only remaining writer of this century,
          quoted in favor of infant-baptism; who lived about the middle of it,
          and is the first pleader for it that we know of. We allow it was
          practiced in his time in the African churches, where it was first
          moved; and at the same time infant-communion was practiced also, of
          which we have undoubted and incontestable evidence; and it is but
          reasonable that if infants have a right to one ordinance, they should
          be admitted to the other; and if antiquity is of any weight in the
          matter, it is as early for the one as for the other: but though
          infant-baptism now began to be practiced, it appears to be a novel
          business; not only the time of its administration, being undetermined;
          which made Fidus, a country bishop, who had a doubt about
          administering it before the eighth day, apply to the council under
          Cyprian for the resolution of it; but the exceeding weakness of the
          arguments then made use of for baptizing new-born infants, of which
          the present Paedobaptists must be ashamed, shew that Paedobaptism was
          then in its infant-state: the arguments used by Cyprian, and his
          brethren for it, were taken from the grace of God being given to all
          men; and from the equality of the gift to all; and this proved from
          the spiritual equality of the bodies of infants and adult persons; and
          both from the prophet Elisha’s stretching himself on the Shunamite’s
          child; they argue the admission of all to baptism from the words of
          Peter, who says he was shewn, that nothing is to be called common or
          unclean; and reason, that infants ought to be more easily admitted
          than grown persons, because they have less guilt; and their weeping
          and crying are to be interpreted praying; yea, they suggest that
          baptism gives grace, and that a person is lost without it: but that it
          may appear I do not wrong them, I will transcribe their own words; and
          that as they are translated by Dr. Wall, so far as they relate to this
          matter: "All of us judged that the grace and mercy of God is to be
          denied to no person that is born; for whereas our Lord in his gospel
          says, the Son of Man came not to destroy men’s souls, (or lives) but
          to save them; as far as lies in us, no soul, if possible, is to be
          lost. The scripture gives us to understand the equality of the divine
          gift on all, whether infants or grown persons: Elisha, in his prayer
          to God, stretched himself on the infant-son of the Shunamite woman,
          that lay dead, in such manner, that his head, and face, and limbs, and
          feet, were applied to the head, face, limbs, and feet of the child;
          which, if it he understood according to the quality of our body and
          nature, the infant would not hold measure with that grown man, nor his
          limbs fit to reach to his great ones; but in that place a spiritual
          equality, and such as is in the esteem of God, is intimated to us by
          which persons that are once made by God are alike and equal; and our
          growth of body by age, makes a difference in the sense of the world,
          but not of God; unless you will think that the grace itself which is
          given to baptized persons, is greater or less according to the age of
          those that receive it; whereas the holy Spirit is given, not by
          different measures, but with a fatherly affection and kindness, equal
          to all; for God, as he accepts no one person, so not his age; but with
          a just equality shews himself a Father to all, for their obtaining the
          heavenly grace—so that we judge that no person is to be hindered from
          the obtaining the grace by the law that is now appointed; and that the
          spiritual circumcision ought not to be restrained by the circumcision
          that was according to the flesh; but that all are to be admitted to
          the grace of Christ; since Peter, speaking in the Acts of the
          Apostles, says, the Lord has shewn me, that no person is to be called
          common or unclean. If any thing could be an obstacle to persons
          against their obtaining the grace, the adult, and grown, and elder
          men, would be rather hindered by their more grievous sins. If then the
          graceless offender, and those that have grievously sinned against God
          before, have, when they afterwards come to believe, forgiveness of
          their sins; and no person is kept off from baptism and the grace; how
          much less reason is there to refuse an infant, who, being newly born,
          has no sin, save the being descended from Adam according to the flesh:
          he has from his very birth contracted the contagion of the death
          anciently threatened; who comes, for this reason, more easily to
          receive forgiveness of sins, because they are not his own, but others
          sins that are forgiven him. This therefore, dear brother, was our
          opinion in the assembly, that it is not for us to hinder any man from
          baptism and the grace of God, who is merciful and kind and
          affectionate to all; which rule, as it holds for all, so we think it
          more especially to be observed in reference to infants, and persons
          newly born; to whom our help, and the divine mercy, is rather to be
          granted; because by their weeping and wailing, at their first entrance
          into the world, they do intimate nothing so much as that they implore
          compassion."[35]
        </p>
        <p>
          Every one that compares what Cyprian and his colleagues say for
          infant-baptism, and what Tertullian says against it, as before
          related, will easily see a difference between them, between Tertullian
          the Antipaedobaptist, and Cyprian the Paedobaptist; how manly and
          nervous the one! how mean and weak the other! no doubt, as is known,
          being railed about infant-baptism at this time, or any objection made
          to it, does not prove it then to be an ancient custom; since the same
          observation, which may be made, would prove infant-communion to he
          equally the same. Now as we allow that henceforward infant-baptism was
          practiced in the African churches, and prevailed in,
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourth century, here the controversy might stop: and indeed all
          that we contend for in this century, is only that there were some
          persons that did call it in question and oppose it; and if this will
          not be allowed, we are not very anxious about it, and shall not think
          it worth while to contest it. This writer would have it observed, that
          I have given up the greatest lights of the church in this century as
          vouchers for infant-baptism, and particularly St Jerom, Ruffinus, and
          Augustin; they are welcome to them; they have need of them to
          enlighten them in this dark affair: we do not envy their having them,
          especially that persidious interpolater Ruffinus; nor that
          arch-heretic Pelagius, whom this Gentleman takes much pains to retain,
          as ignorant as he either was, or would be, or is thought to be; as
          that he never heard that any one whatever denied baptism to infants,
          and promised the kingdom of heaven without the redemption of Christ,
          or refused that unto them. This ignorance of his was either affected
          or pretended, in order to clear himself from the charge of those
          things against him; as men generally do run into high strains and
          extravagant expressions, when they are at such work; or it was real
          ignorance, and who can help that? It does not follow that therefore
          none had, because he had never heard of it; one would think his
          meaning rather was, that he had never heard of any that denied the
          kingdom of heaven and the common redemption to infants, who think they
          ought to be baptized, dum putat, while he is of opinion, that in
          baptism they are regenerated in Christ; but about this I shall not
          contend; truth does not depend upon his hearing and knowledge,
          judgment and observation. I think it is not insisted upon that Austin
          should say, he never heard or read of any catholic, heretic, or
          schismatic, that denied infant-baptism; however, it seems he could say
          it if he did not, and that notwithstanding the reasons I alledged; as,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Austin must know that Tertullian had opposed it. Here our author
          quibbles about the terms opposing and denying, and distinguishes
          between them; and observes, that whatever Tertullian said against it,
          he did not properly deny it. He may say the same of me, or any other
          writer against infant-baptism, that though we speak against it,
          contradict and oppose it, and use arguments against it, yet we do not
          deny it. Dr Wall indeed thinks neither Austin nor Pelagius had seen
          Tertullian’s book of baptism, or they could not have said what he
          thinks they did.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Austin presided at the council of Carthage, when a canon was made
          that anathematized those who denied baptism to new-born infants; and
          therefore mull know there were some that denied it. This Gentleman
          says, it is demonstrably certain, that this canon was not made against
          persons that denied infant-baptism, because it was made against
          Pelagius and Celesius. It is true, the latter part of the canon was
          made against them; but the former part respected a notion or tenet of
          some other persons, who denied baptism to new-born infants. Dr Wall
          saw this, and says, this canon mentions the baptism of infants,
          condemning two errors about it; the one respecting the baptism of
          new-born infants; the other the doctrine of original sin, and the
          baptism of infants for forgiveness of sins, denied by the Pelagians;
          but the former he supposes was the opinion of Fidus, embraced by some
          persons now, which he had vented a hundred and fifty years before,
          that infants should not be baptized till they were eight days old;
          whereas Fidus is represented as having been alone in his opinion; and
          if he retained it, which is doubtful, it does not appear he had any
          followers; nor is there any evidence of there being any of his
          sentiment in this age;[36] and were there, it is unreasonable to
          imagine, that a council of all the bishops in Africa should agree to
          anathematize them, because they thought proper to defer the baptizing
          of infants a few days longer than they did; and besides, infants only
          eight days old may be properly called newly-born infants; and
          therefore such could not be said to deny baptism to them; and it would
          have been a marvelous thing, had they been anathematized for it:
          though this writer says, wonder who will; a council, consisting of all
          the bishops of Africa, did in fact agree to anathematize their own
          brethren, who were in the same opinion and practice of. infant-baptism
          with themselves." It is true, they did anathematize the Pelagians, who
          were in the same opinion and practice of infant-baptism with
          themselves in general; though I question whether they reckoned them
          their own brethren; but then not on account of any difference about
          the time of baptism, a few days odds between them, the thing to be
          wondered at; but their denial of original sin, and the baptism of
          infants to be on account of that: and now since the Pelagians are
          distinct from those in the canon that denied baptism to new-born
          infants; and it is unreasonable to suppose any who were of the
          sentiments of Fidus are intended; it remains, that there must be some
          persons different both from the one and the other, who denied baptism
          to babes, and are by this canon anathematized for it, which Austin
          must know.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is observed by me, that Austin himself makes mention of some
          that argued against it, from the unprofitableness of it to infants;
          since for the most part they die before they have any knowledge of it.
          These men our author does not know what to make of; sometimes it is
          questionable whether they were Christians, and suggests that they were
          men of atheistical principles; and then again they are supposed to be
          Christians, and even might be Paedobaptists, notwithstanding this
          their manner of arguing. I am content he should reckon them what he
          pleases; but one would think they could not be any good friends to
          infant-baptism, that questioned the profitableness of baptism to
          infants, and brought so strong an objection to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is further observed by me, that according to Austin the
          Pelagians denied baptism to the infants of believers, because they
          were holy. This is represented by this Gentleman as a mistake of mine,
          understanding what was spoken hypothetically, to be absolutely spoken.
          I have looked over the passage again, and am not convinced upon a
          second reading of it, nor by what this writer has advanced, of a
          mistake: the words are absolutely expressed and reasoned upon; "but,
          says the apostle, your children would be unclean, but now they are
          holy; therefore, say they (the Pelagians) the children of believers
          ought not now to be baptized." The observation our author makes,
          though he does not insist upon it, is very impertinent; that not
          infants but children are mentioned, and so may include the adult
          children of believers, and consequently make as much against
          adult-baptism as infant-baptism; since children in the text, on which
          the argument is grounded, are always by themselves understood of
          infants. Austin wonders that the Pelagians should talk after this
          manner, that holiness is derived from parents, and reasons upon it,
          when they deny that sin is originally derived from Adam: it is true,
          indeed, he presses them with an argument this Gentleman calls ad
          hominem, taken from their shutting up the kingdom of God to unbaptized
          infants; for though they believed that unbaptized infants would not
          perish, but have everlasting life, yet not enter the kingdom of God;
          absurdly distinguishing between the kingdom of God, and eternal life.
          What they were able to answer, or did answer to this, it is not easy
          to say; "it is a disadvantage, as our author says, that we have none
          of their writings entire, only scraps and quotations from them:"
          Perhaps as they had a singular notion, that the infants of believers
          ought not to be baptized, though the infants of others should; they
          would, in answer to the above argument, say, that the infants of
          believers unbaptized enter the kingdom, though the unbaptized infants
          of others do not. I only guess this might be their answer, consistent
          with their principles: however, if I am mistaken in this matter, as I
          think I am not, it is in company with men of learning I am not ashamed
          to be among. The learned Daneus says[37] "the Pelagians deny that
          baptism is to be administered to the children of believers," having
          plainly in view this passage of Austin’s; and the very learned
          Forbesius[38] brings in this as an objection to his sense of 1Cor
          7:14, "the Pelagians abused this saying of the apostle, that they
          might say, that the infants of believers ought not to be baptized, as
          we read in Augustin."[39]

          5. The words quoted by me out of Jerome, I own, are spoken by way of
          supposition; but then they suppose a case that had been, was, and
          might be again; and it should be observed, that the supposition Jerome
          makes, is not a neglect of the baptism of infants, as this Gentleman
          suggests, but a denial of it to them, a refusing to give it to them;
          which is expressive of a rejection of it, and of an opposition to it.
          So that from all there instances put together, we cannot but conclude
          that there were some persons that did oppose and reject infant-baptism
          in those times, and think it may be allowed, which is all we contend
          for; however, as I have said before, we are not very anxious about it.
          Mr. Marshall[40] a favorite writer of our author’s, says, some in
          those times questioned it (infant-baptism) as Augustin grants in his
          sermons de verbis Apostol, but does not refer us to the particular
          place; it seems to be his fourteenth sermon on that subject, entitled,
          Concerning the baptism of infants, against the Pelagians; where Austin
          tells us how he was led to the subject; and though he had no doubt
          about it, "yet some men raised disputes, which were now become
          frequent, and endeavored to subvert the minds of many;"[41] by whom he
          seems to mean persons distinct from the Pelagians, since he represents
          them as having no doubt about it: and this is further confirmed by a
          passage out of the same discourse; "that infants are to be baptized,
          let no one doubt (which is an address to others, and implies, that
          either they did doubt of infant-baptism, or were in danger of it)
          since they doubt not, who in some respect contradict it;" which our
          author has placed as a motto in his title-page.
        </p>
        <p>
          A pamphlet being published some time ago by a nameless author,
          entitled, The baptism of Infants a reasonable Service, etc. I wrote an
          answer to it, chiefly relating to the antiquity of infant-baptism,
          called, The argument from Apostolic tradition, in favor of
          Infant-baptism, etc. considered; and of late another anonymous writer
          has started up in defense of the antiquity of it, from the exceptions
          made by me to it; for it seems it is not the same author, but another
          who has engaged in this controversy; but be he who he will, it does
          not greatly concern me to know; though methinks, if they judge they
          are embarked in a good cause, they should not be ashamed of it, or of
          their names, and of letting the world know who they are, and what
          share they have in the defense of it: but just as they please, it
          gives me no uneasiness; they are welcome to take what method they
          judge most agreeable, provided truth and righteousness are attended
          to.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my answer, I observe that apostolic tradition at most and best is a
          very uncertain and precarious thing, not to be depended upon; of which
          I give an instance so early as the second century, which yet even then
          could not be settled; and that it is doubtful whether there is any
          such thing as apostolic tradition, not delivered in the sacred
          writings; and demand of the Gentleman, whole performance was before
          me, to give me one single instance of it; and if infant-baptism is of
          this kind, to name the apostle or apostles by whom it was delivered,
          and to whom, when, and where; to all which no answer is returned; only
          I observe a deep silence as to undoubted apostolic tradition, so much
          boasted of before.
        </p>
        <p>
          The state of the controversy between us and the Paedobaptists, with
          respect to the antiquity of infant-baptism, lies here; and the
          question is, whether there is any evidence of its being practiced
          before the third century; or before the times of Tertullian. We allow
          it began in the third century, and was then practiced in the African
          churches, where we apprehend it was first moved; but deny there was
          any mention or practice of it before that age; and affirm that
          Tertullian is the first person known that spoke of it, and who speaks
          against it: I have therefore required of any of our learned
          Paedobaptists to produce a single passage out of any authentic writer
          before Tertullian, in which infant-baptism is expressly mentioned, or
          clearly hinted at, or plainly supposed, or manifestly referred to: if
          this is not done, the controversy must remain just in the same state
          where it was, and infant-baptism carried not a moment higher that it
          was before; and whatever else is done below this date, is all to no
          purpose. How far this Gentleman, who has engaged in this controversy,
          has succeeded, is our next business to inquire.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only Christian writers of the first century, any of whose writings
          are extant, are Barnabas, Clemens Romanus, Hermas, Polycarp, and
          Ignatius; nothing out of Barnabas, Polycarp, and Ignatius, in favor of
          infant-baptism, is pretended to. "The most ancient writer that we have
          (says this Gentleman, in the words of Mr. Bingham) is Clemens Romanus,
          who lived in the time of the apostles; and he, though he doth not
          directly mention infant-baptism, yet says a thing that by consequence
          proves it; for he makes infants liable to original sin, which is in
          effect to say that they have need of baptism to purge it away, etc."
          The passage or passages in Clemens, in which he lays this thing, are
          not produced; I suppose they are the same that are quoted by Dr Wall,
          in neither of which does he say any such thing; it is true, in the
          first of them he makes mention of a passage in Job 14:4 according to
          the Greek version, no man is free from pollution, no not though his
          life is but of one day; which might be brought indeed to prove
          original sin, but is not brought by Clemens for any such purpose, but
          as a self-accusation of Job; shewing, that though he had the character
          of a good man, yet he was not free from sin: and the other only speaks
          of men coming into the world as out of a grave and darkness, meaning
          out of their mother’s womb; and seem, not to refer to any moral death
          and darkness men are under, or to the sinful state of men as they come
          into the world: but be it so, that in these passages Clemens does
          speak of original sin, what is this to infant-baptism, or the
          necessity of it? is there no other way to purge away original sin, but
          baptism? nay, is there any such virtue in baptism as to purge it away?
          there is not; it is the blood of Christ, and that only, that purges
          away sin, whether original or actual. Should it be said that this was
          the sense of the ancients in some after-ages, who did ascribe such a
          virtue to baptism, and did affirm it was necessary to be administered,
          and did administer it to infants for that purpose, what is this to
          Clemens? what, because some persons in some after-ages gave into this
          stupid notion, that baptism took away original sin, and was necessary
          to infants, and ought to be given them for that reason, does it follow
          that Clemens was of that mind? or is there the least hint of it in his
          letter? What though he held the doctrine of original sin, does it
          follow therefore that he was for infant-baptism? how many
          Antipaedobaptists are there who profess the same doctrine? will any
          man from hence conclude that they are for and in the practice of
          infant-baptism? It follows in the words of the same writer; "Hermes
          pastor (Hermas I suppose it should be) lived about the same time with
          Clemens; and hath several passages to shew the general necessity of
          water, that is, baptism, to save men:" the passages referred to are
          those Dr Wall has produced. Hermas had a vision of a tower built on
          water; inquiring the reason of it, he is told, it was "because your
          life is, and will be saved by water:" and in another place, "before
          any one receives the name of the Son of God, he is liable to death;
          but when he receives that seal, he is delivered from death, and is
          assigned to life; and that seal is water."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now by water Hermas is supposed to mean baptism; but surely he could
          not mean real material water, or the proper ordinance of
          water-baptism, since he speaks of the patriarchs coming up through
          this water, and being sealed with this seal after they were dead, and
          so entering into the kingdom of God: but how disembodied spirits could
          be baptized in real water, is not easy to conceive; it must surely
          design something mystical; and what it is, I must leave to those who
          better understand these visionary things: but be it so, that baptism
          in water is meant, salvation by it may be understood in the same sense
          as the apostle Peter ascribes salvation to it, when he says, that
          baptism saves by the resurrection of Christ from the dead; that is, by
          directing the baptized person to Christ for salvation, who was
          delivered for his offenses, and rose again for his justification; of
          which resurrection baptism by immersion is a lively emblem; and Hermas
          is only speaking of adult persons, and not of infants, or of their
          baptism, or of the necessity of it to their salvation: in another
          place indeed he speaks of some that were as infants without malice,
          and so more honorable than others; and, adds he, all infants, are
          honored with the Lord, and accounted of first of all; that is, all
          such infants as before described: but be it that infants in age are
          meant, they may be valued and loved by the Lord; he may shew mercy to
          them, choose, redeem, regenerate, and save them, and yet not order
          them to be baptized; nor has he ordered it: however Hermas has not a
          word about the baptism of them, and therefore these passages are
          impertinently referred to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now these are all the passages of the writers of the first century
          brought into this controversy; in which there is so far from being any
          express mention of infant-baptism, that it is not in the least hinted
          at, nor referred unto; nor is any thing of this kind pretended to,
          till we come to the middle of the next age; and yet our author upon
          the above passages concludes after this manner: "thus—we have traced
          up the practice of infant baptism to the time of the apostles;" when
          those writers give not the least hint of infant-baptism, or have any
          reference to it, or the practice of it. It is amazing what a face some
          men have!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now proceed to the second century. The book of Recognitions,
          this writer seems to be at a loss where to place it, whether after or
          before Justin; however, Mr. Bingham tells him, "it is an ancient
          writing of the same age with Justin Martyr, mentioned by Origen in his
          Philocalia, and by some ascribed to Bardesanes Syrus, who lived about
          the middle of the second century." It is indeed mentioned by Origen,
          though not under that name, and is by him ascribed to Clemens, as it
          has been commonly done; and if so, might have been placed among the
          testimonies of the first century; but this Gentleman’s author says it
          is ascribed by some to Bardesanes Syrus: it is true, there is inserted
          in it a fragment out of a dialogue of his concerning fate, against
          Abydas an astrologer; but then it should rather be concluded from
          hence, as Fabricius observes,[1] that the author of the Recognitions,
          is a later writer than Bardesanes: but be it so that it is him, who is
          this Bardesanes? an arch-heretic, one that first fell into the
          Valentinian heresy; and though he seemed afterwards to change his
          mind, he was not wholly free, as Eusebius says,[2] from his old
          heresy; and he became the author of a new sect, called after his name
          Bardesanists; who held that the devil was not a creature of God; that
          Christ did not assume human flesh; and that the body rises not.[3] The
          book of Recognitions, ascribed to him, is urged by the Papists, as Mr.
          James observes[4] to prove the power of exorcists, free-will, faith
          alone insufficient, the chrysm in baptism, and Peter’s succession;
          though the better sort of writers among them are ashamed of it. Sixtus
          Senensis says[5] that "most things in it are uncertain, many fabulous,
          and some contrary to doctrines generally received." And Baronius[6]
          has these words concerning it: "Away with such monstrous lies and mad
          dotages, which are brought out of the said filthy ditch of the
          Recognitions, which go under the name of Clemens:" but all this is no
          matter, if infant-baptism can be proved out it; but how? "This author
          speaks of the necessity of baptism in the same stile as Justin Martyr
          did—was undeniably an assertor of the general necessity of baptism to
          salvation:" wherever this wretched tenet, this false notion of the
          absolute necessity of baptism to salvation is met with, the
          Paedobaptists presently smell out infant-baptism, one falsehood
          following upon another; and true it is, that one error leads on to
          another; and this false doctrine paved the way for infant-baptism; but
          then the mystery of iniquity worked by degrees; as soon as it was
          broached infant-baptism did not immediately commence: it does not
          follow, because that heretic asserted this notion, that therefore he
          was for or in the practice of infant-baptism; besides this book, be
          the author of it who will, is not made mention of before the third
          century, if so soon; for the work referred to by Origen has another
          title, and was in another form; he calls it the circuits of Peter, an
          apocryphal, fabulous and romantic writing; and though the passage he
          quotes is in the Recognitions, which makes some learned men conclude
          it to be the same with that; yet so it might be, and not be the same
          with it. But I pass on to a more authentic and approved writer of the
          second century: Justin Martyr, who lived about the year 150; and the
          first passage produced from him is this:[7] "We bring them (namely,
          the new converts) to some place where there is water, and they are
          regenerated by the same way of regeneration by which we were
          regenerated; for they are washed with water in the name of God the
          Father and Lord of all things, and of our Savior Jesus Christ, and of
          the holy Spirit." In this passage, it is owned, "Justin is describing
          the manner of adult baptism only; having no occasion to descend to any
          farther particulars; nor is it alleged, it is said, as a proof of
          infant-baptism directly; but only to shew, that this ancient writer
          used the word regeneration so as to connote baptism—yet his words
          cannot be thought to exclude the baptism of infants in these days:"
          but if infant-baptism had been practiced in those days, it is not
          consistent with that sincerity and impartiality which Justin sets out
          with, when he proposed to give the Roman Emperor an account of
          Christian baptism, not to make any mention of that; for he introduces
          it thus: "We will declare after what manner, when we were renewed by
          Christ, we devoted ourselves unto God, lest omitting this we should
          seem to act a bad part (prevaricate or deal unfairly) in this
          declaration;" whereas it was not dealing fairly with the Emperor, and
          not giving him a full and fair account of the administration of the
          ordinance of baptism to all its proper subjects, if infants had used
          to be baptized; which he could easily have introduced the mention of,
          and one would think could not have omitted it: betides, as Dr. Gale[8]
          observes, he had an occasion to speak of it, and to descend to this
          particular, had it been used; since the Christians were charged with
          using their infants barbarously; which he might have removed, had this
          been the case, by observing the great regard they had to them in
          devoting them to God in baptism, and thereby initiating them into
          their religion, and providing for the salvation of their souls: but
          Justin is so far from saying any thing of this kind, that he leaves
          the Emperor and every body else to conclude that infants were not the
          subjects of baptism in this early age; for as the above writer
          observes, immediately follow such words as directly oppose
          infant-baptism; they are these: "And we have been taught by the
          apostles this reason for this thing; because we being ignorant of our
          first birth, were generated by necessity, etc. that we should not
          continue children of that necessity and ignorance, but of will (or
          choice) and knowledge; and should obtain forgiveness of the sins in
          which we have lived, by water:" so that in order to obtain these
          things by water or baptism, which Justin speaks of, there must be free
          choice and knowledge, which infants are not capable of: but it seems
          the main thing this passage is brought to prove, is, that the words
          regenerated and regeneration are used for baptized and baptism; and
          this agreeing with the words of Christ in Jn 3:5 shews that this
          construction of them then obtained, that baptism is necessary to
          salvation. Now, it should be observed, that the persons Justin speaks
          of are not represented by him as regenerated by baptism, because they
          are spoken of before as converted persons and believers; and it is as
          clear and plain that their baptism is distinguished from their
          regeneration, and is not the same thing; for Justin uses the former as
          an argument of the latter; which if the same, his sense must be, they
          were baptized because they were baptized; whereas his sense,
          consistent with himself, and the practice of the primitive churches,
          is; that there persons, when brought to the water, having made a
          profession of their regeneration, were owned and declared regenerated
          persons; as was manifest from their being admitted to the ordinance of
          water-baptism; and from hence it appears, that, then no such
          construction of Jn 3:5 obtained, that baptism is necessary to
          salvation: and this now seems to be the passage referred to, in which
          Justin is said to speak of the necessity of baptism, in a stile the
          author of the Recognitions agreed with him in; but without any reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next passage out of Justin is in his dialogue with Trypho the Jew;
          where he says that "concerning the influence and effect of Adam’s sin
          upon mankind, which the ancient writers represent as the ground and
          reason of infant-baptism—" The words, as cited by Dr Wall, to whom our
          author refers us, are there: Justin, speaking of the birth, baptism,
          and crucifixion of Christ, says[9] "he did this for mankind, which by
          Adam was fallen under death, and under the guile of the serpent;
          beside the particular cause which each man had of sinning."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, allowing that this is spoken of original sin, as it seems to be,
          what is this to infant-baptism? I have already exposed the folly of
          arguing from persons holding the one, to the practice of the other. It
          is added by our author, "in the same book, he (Justin) speaks of
          baptism being to Christians in the room of circumcision, and so points
          out the analogy between those two initiatory rites." The passage
          referred to is this:[10] "We also who by him have had access to God,
          have not received this carnal circumcision, but the spiritual
          circumcision, which Enoch, and those like him, have observed; and we
          have received it by baptism by the mercy of God, because we were
          sinners; and it is enjoined to all persons to receive it the same
          way." Now let be observed, that this spiritual circumcision, whatever
          Justin means by it, can never design baptism; since the patriarch
          Enoch, and others like him, observed it: and since Christians are said
          to receive it by baptism, and therefore must be different from baptism
          itself: nor does Justin say any thing of the analogy between baptism
          and circumcision, or of the one being in the room of the other; but
          opposes the spiritual circumcision to carnal circumcision; and speaks
          not one word of infants, only of the duty of adult persons, as he
          supposes it to be. The last passage, and on which this Gentleman
          intends to dwell awhile, is this:[11] "Several persons (says Justin)
          among us of both sexes, of sixty and seventy years of age, oi ek
          paidwn emaqhteuqh san tw Crisw, "who were discipled to Christ in their
          childhood, etc." which I have observed should be rendered, "who from
          their childhood were instructed in Christ;" and which I have confirmed
          by several passages in Justin, in which he uses the word in the sense
          of instruction; and from whom can we better learn his meaning than
          from himself? all which this author takes no notice of; but puts me
          off with a passage out of Plutarch, where Antiphon the son of
          Sophilus, according to his version, is said to be discipled or
          proselyted to his father: I leave him to enjoy his own sense; for I do
          not understand it; and should have thought that maqhteusav de tw
          patri, might have been rendered more intelligibly, as well as more
          truly, "instructed by his father;" since, as it follows, his father
          was an orator. He thinks he has catched me off of my guard, and that I
          suppose the word disciple includes baptism; because in my commentary
          on Acts 19:3 I say, "the apostle takes it for granted that they were
          baptized, since they were not only believers, but disciples;" but had
          he read on, or transcribed what follows, my sense would clearly
          appear; "such as not only believed with the heart, but had made a
          profession of their faith, and were followers of Christ:" nor is the
          sense of the word disciple, as including the idea of baptism,
          confirmed by Acts 14:21 where it is said, when they had preached the
          gospel to that city, ki maqhteusanteV , "and taught many, or made them
          disciples;" which may be interpreted without tautology, and yet not
          include the idea of baptism; since the first word, preached, expresses
          the bare external ministry of the word; and the latter, taught, or
          made disciples, the influence and effect of it upon the minds of men;
          the former may be where the latter is not; and both, where baptism is
          not as yet administered. The reason why ekpaidwn must be rendered in,
          and not from their childhood, because the baptism of any persons being
          not a continued, but one single transient act, to speak of their being
          baptized from their childhood would be improper, is merry indeed; when
          Justin is not speaking of the baptism of any person at all; but of
          their being trained up in the knowledge of Christ, and the Christian
          religion from their childhood, in which they had persevered to the
          years mentioned. Upon the whole, in all there passages of Justin
          quoted, there is no express mention of infant-baptism, nor any hint
          given of it, nor any reference unto it. Proceed we now to the next
          writer in this century, brought into this controversy:
        </p>
        <p>
          Irenaeus; who lived towards the close of it, and wrote about the year
          180; the only passage in him, and which has been the subject of debate
          a hundred years past, is this; speaking of Christ, he says,[12] "he
          came to save all, all I say, qui per eum renascuntur in Deum, "who by
          him are born again unto God;" infants, and little ones, and children,
          and young men, and old men." Now not to insist upon the works of
          Irenaeus we have being mostly a translation, and a very poor one,
          complained of by learned men; nor upon this chapter wherein this
          passage is, being reckoned spurious by others; which weaken the force
          of this testimony, and will have their weight with considering
          persons; I shall only take notice of the sense of the phrase, born
          again unto God; and the injury done to the character of Irenaeus, to
          make it signify baptism, or any thing else but the grace of
          regeneration. Our author begins his defense of this passage in favor
          of infant-baptism, with a remark of the learned Feuardentius, as he
          calls him; "that by the name of regeneration, according to the phrase
          of Christ: and his apostles, he (Irenaeus) understands baptism,
          clearly confirming the apostolical tradition concerning the baptism of
          infants." As for the learning of this monk, I cannot discern it,
          unless his lies and impudence against the reformers, which run through
          his notes, are to be so called. Whether our author is a junior or
          senior man, I know not; by his writing he seems to be the former, but
          the advice of Rivet, who was without doubt a man of learning, is good;
          only, says he,[13] "I would have the younger, that shall light on the
          works of Irenaeus advised, to beware of those editions, which that
          most impudent monk Feuardentius, a man of large assurance, and
          uncommon boldness, and of no faith nor faithfulness, has in many
          things foully corrupted and defiled with impious and lying
          annotations:" and a false gloss this of his is, which is quoted; for
          Christ and his apostles no where call baptism by the name of the new
          birth. I have observed, that as yet, that is, in Irenaeus’ time, it
          had not obtained among the ancients, to use the words regenerated or
          regeneration for baptized or baptism; nor is this author able to prove
          it. The passage in Justin before-mentioned falls short of it, as has
          been shewn; and the passages in Tertullian and Clemens of Alexandria,
          concerning being born in water, and begotten of the womb of water, are
          too late; and beside, the one is to be interpreted of the grace of God
          compared to water; this is clearly Tertullian’s sense; for he adds[14]
          "nor are we otherwise safe or saved, than by remaining in water;"
          which surely can never be understood literally of the water of baptism
          and as for Clemens,[15] he is speaking not of regeneration, but of the
          natural generation of man, as he comes out of his mother’s womb,
          naked, and free from sin, as he supposes; and as such, converted
          persons ought to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          To have recourse to heathens to ascertain the name of Christian
          baptism, is monstrous; though this, it is said, there is no need of,
          "since several Christian writers, who lived with or before Irenaeus,
          speak the same language, as will be seen hereafter:" and yet none are
          produced but Barnabas and Justin; the latter of which has been
          considered already, and found not to the purpose; and his reasoning
          upon the former is beyond my comprehension; for whatever may be said
          for the giving of milk and honey to persons just baptized, being a
          symbol of their being born again, it can be no proof of the words
          regeneration and regenerated being used for baptism and baptized; when
          there words neither the one nor the other are mentioned by Barnabas;
          so that I have no reason to retract what I have said on that point.
          And now we are returned to Irenaeus himself; and two passages from him
          are produced in proof of the sense of the word contended for; and one
          is where he thus speaks[16] "and again giving the power of
          regeneration unto God to his disciples, he said unto them, Go and
          teach all nations, baptizing them, etc." By which power or commission
          is meant, not the commission of baptizing, but more plainly the
          commission of teaching the doctrine of regeneration by the Spirit of
          God, and the necessity of that to salvation, and in order to baptism;
          and which was the first and principal part of the apostles commission,
          as the order of the words shew; and it is molt reasonable to think,
          that he should so call the commission, not from its more remote and
          less principal part, but from the first and more principal one. The
          other passage is where Irenaeus mentions[17] by name "the baptism of
          regeneration to God:" but this rather proves the contrary, that
          baptism and regeneration are two different things, and not the same;
          just as the scriptural phrase, the baptism of repentance, and which
          seems to have led the ancients to such a way of speaking, means
          something different from repentance, and not the same: baptism is so
          called, because repentance is a prerequisite to it, in the subjects of
          it; and for the same reason it is called the baptism of regeneration,
          because regeneration is absolutely necessary in order to it: to all
          which I only add, that Irenaeus not only uses the word regeneration in
          a different sense from baptism elsewhere,[18] but most clearly uses it
          in another sense in this very passage; since he says, Christ came to
          save all who by him are born again unto God; who are regenerated by
          Christ, and not by baptism; and which is explained both before and
          after by his sanctifying all sorts of persons, infants, little ones,
          young men, and old men; which cannot be understood of his baptizing
          them, for he baptized none; and therefore they cannot be said to be
          regenerated by him in that sense: and I say again, to understand
          Irenaeus as speaking of baptism, is to make him speak what is
          absolutely false; that Christ came to save all and only such who are
          baptized unto God. It seems LeClerc is of the same sentiment with me,
          an author I am a stranger to; whom this writer lets pass without any
          reasoning against him, only with this chastisement; "he should have
          understood (being an ecclesiastical historian) the sentiments and
          language of the primitive fathers better;" but what their language and
          sentiments were, we have seen already; and let them be what they will,
          Irenaeus must express a downright falsehood, if he is to be understood
          in the sense contended for: on the one hand, it cannot be true that
          Christ came to save all that are baptized; no doubt but Judas was
          baptized, as well as the other apostles, and yet it will not be said
          Christ came to save him; Simon Magus was certainly baptized, and yet
          was in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity, and by all the
          accounts of him continued so till death; there were many members of
          the church at Corinth, who doubtless were baptized, and yet were
          unworthy receivers of the Lord’s supper, and eat and drank damnation
          to themselves, for which reason there were many weak, sickly, and
          asleep;[19] and it is to be feared, without any breach of charity,
          that this has been the case of thousands besides: and on the other
          hand, it cannot be with truth suggested, that Christ came to save only
          such as are baptized; he came to die for the transgressions that were
          under the First Testament, or to save persons under that dispensation,
          who never received Christian baptism; he said to one and to another,
          unbaptized persons, thy sins are forgiven thee; (Mat 9:5; Lk 7:48) and
          no doubt there are many saved, and whom Christ came to save, who never
          were baptized in water; and the Paedobaptists themselves will stand a
          bad chance for salvation, if this was true; for they will find it a
          hard task to prove that any one of them, only sprinkled in infancy,
          was ever truly baptized; and yet as uncharitable as we are said to be,
          we have so much charity to believe that every good man among them,
          though unbaptized, shall be saved. And now since the words of Irenaeus
          taken in this sense contain a manifest falsehood, and they are capable
          of another sense, agreeable to truth, without straining them; as that
          thrift: came to save all that are regenerated by himself, by his
          spirit and grace, we ought in a judgment of charity to believe that
          this latter sense is his, and not the former; and the rather, since
          his words in their proper and literal sense have this meaning; and
          since they are expressed with so much caution; lest it should be
          thought it was his meaning that Christ came to save all men, good and
          bad, he describes the patrons he came to save, not by their baptism,
          which is a precarious and uncertain evidence of salvation, but by
          their regeneration, which is a sure proof of it; and since this sense
          of his words is agreeable to his use of the phrase elsewhere, and to
          the context likewise, and is suited to all sorts of persons of every
          age here mentioned; and indeed to depart from this clear literal sense
          of his words, which establishes a well-known truth, and fix a
          figurative, improper one upon them, which makes him to say a notorious
          untruth, to serve an hypothesis, is cruel usage of the good old
          father, and is contrary to all the rules of honor, justice, truth, and
          charity. To put our Lord’s words in Mk 16:16 upon a level with the
          false sense of Irenaeus, is mean and stupid; they need no qualifying
          sense; the meaning is plain and easy; that every baptized believer
          shall be saved, and leave no room to suggest that unbaptized believers
          shall not; but that every unbeliever, be he who he will, baptized or
          unbaptized, shall be damned. And now what a wretched cause must the
          cause of infant-baptism be, that requires such managing as this to
          maintain it? what a wretched cause is it, that at its first setting
          out, according to the account of the advocates of it; for Dr Wall
          says,[20] "this is the first express mention that we have met with of
          infants "baptized?" I say again, what a wretched cause must this be,
          that is connected with lies and falsehood at its first appearance, as
          pleaded for; is established upon downright injustice to a good man’s
          character, and supported by real injury to it? and yet notwithstanding
          all this, our author has the front to say, "so much then for the
          testimony, the plain, unexceptionable testimony, of Irenaeus, for the
          practice of infant-baptism."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we are come to the close of the second century; but before we
          pass to the next, we must stop a little, and consider a passage our
          author, after Dr. Wall, has produced out of Clemens of Alexandria, who
          lived at the latter end of this century, about the year 190; and it is
          this: speaking of rings worn on the fingers, and the seals upon them,
          advises against every thing idolatrous and lascivious, and to what is
          innocent and useful; "let our seals," says he,[21] "be a dove, or a
          fish, or a ship running with the wind, or a musical harp—or a
          mariner’s anchor,—and if any one is a fisherman, Aposolou memnhsetai
          ki tan ex udatov anaspwmenwn paidiwn, let him remember the apostle,
          and the children drawn out of the water."
        </p>
        <p>
          This passage was sent by two Gentlemen from different places to Dr
          Wall, after he had published two editions of his history; and he seems
          to have been ashamed of himself for not having observed it, and
          fancies that this refers to the baptizing of a child, and the taking,
          drawing, and lifting it out of the water. Now, though I do not pretend
          to support my conjecture by any manuscript or printed copy, nor do I
          think it worth while to search and inquire after it, whether there is
          any various reading or no, but shall leave it to others who have more
          leisure and opportunity; yet I persuade myself my conjecture will not
          be condemned as a groundless one by any man of sense and learning,
          especially out of this controversy: my conjecture then is, that it
          should be read not paidiwn, "children," but icquwn, "fishes;" for who
          ever heard of a draught of children; when a draught of fishes is
          common? and why should a fisherman, more than any other, remember an
          apostle and a draught of children? surely a draught of fishes is more
          proper to him: the words I think therefore should be read, "let him
          remember the apostle, and the fishes drawn out of the water;" and the
          sense is, let him remember the apostle Peter, and the draught of
          fishes taken by him, recorded either in Lk 5:6; Lk 5:9 or in Jn 21:6;
          Jn 21:8; Jn 21:11; for the words manifestly refer to some particular
          and remarkable fact, which should be called to mind, and not to a
          thing that was done every day; which must be the case, if
          infant-baptism now obtained: besides, the word used cannot with any
          decency and propriety be applied to the baptizing of a child; a wide
          difference there is in the expression, between taking and lifting a
          child out of the font, and a drawing or dragging it out of the water;
          the word is expressive of strength and force necessary to an action
          (Lk 14:15; Acts 11:10), and well agrees with the drawing or dragging
          of a net full of fishes. However, if this instance is continued to be
          urged, I hope it will be allowed that baptism in those early times was
          performed by immersion; since these children are said to be drawn out
          of the water, and therefore must have been in it: moreover, let it be
          what it will that Clemens refers unto, it must be something that was
          not common to every man, but peculiar to a fisherman; as he afterwards
          says, a sword or a bow are not proper for those that pursue peace; nor
          cups for temperate persons; and I insist upon it, that it be said what
          that is which is peculiar to such a one, except it be that which I
          have suggested: and after all, he must have a warm brain, a heated
          imagination, and a mind prepossessed, that can believe that
          infant-baptism is here referred to. Upon the whole, it does not appear
          from any authentic writer of the second century, that there is any
          express mention of infant-baptism in it, nor any clear hint of it, or
          manifest reference to it; and therefore it must be an innovation in
          the church, whenever it afterwards took place. I proceed now to,
        </p>
        <p>
          The third century, at the beginning of which Tertullian lived; who is
          the first person that ever gave any hint of infant-baptism, or
          referred unto it, or made express mention of it, that is known; and he
          argued against it, and that very strongly, from the more usual delay
          of the administration of it, according to every one’s age, condition,
          and disposition; from the danger sureties might be brought into by
          engaging for infants; from the necessity of first knowing and
          understanding what they were about; from their innocent age, as it
          comparatively is, not being yet conscious of sin, standing in no need
          of the application of pardoning grace, which the ordinance of baptism
          leads adult believers to; from the propriety of their first asking for
          it; and from a different method being taken in worldly affairs: his
          words are these, and as they are translated by Dr. Wall himself;
          "therefore according to every one’s condition and disposition, and
          also their age, the delaying of baptism is more profitable, especially
          in the case of little children; for what need is there that the
          godfathers should be brought into danger? because they may either fail
          of their promises by death, or they may be mistaken by a child’s
          proving of a wicked disposition. Our Lord says indeed, Do not forbid
          them to come to me: therefore let them come when they are grown up:
          let them come when they understand: when they are instructed whither
          it is that they come: let them be made Christians when they can know
          Christ; what need their guiltless age make such haste to the
          forgiveness of sins? Men will proceed more warily in worldly things;
          and he that should not have earthly goods committed to him, yet shall
          have heavenly. Let them know how to desire this salvation, that you
          may appear to have given to one that asketh."[22]
        </p>
        <p>
          It is observed by our author, after Dr Wall, that in the clause about
          sponsors, in the older editions, there words come in, si non tam
          necesse, which are rendered, except in case of necessity. But these
          older editions are but one Gagnaeus, whose reading is rejected by
          Rigaltius as a foolish repetition; censured by Grotius, as affording
          no tolerable sense;[23] received by Pamelius for no other reason that
          he gives, but because it softens the opinion of the author about the
          delaying of baptism to infants;[24] and it is for this reason it is
          catched at by the Paedobaptists; and yet they do not seem to be quite
          easy with it, because of the nonsense and impertinence of it; "what
          need is there, except there is a need?" wherefore our author attempts
          an emendation, and proposes to read tamen for tam, which does not make
          it a whit the better, but rather increases the nonsense; "what need is
          there, except notwithstanding there is need?" but what is of more
          importance is, it is said, "these words of Tertullian seem fairly to
          imply that infant baptism was not only moved for, but actually
          practiced in his time:" to which I answer, that they neither do imply,
          nor seem to imply any such thing, at least not necessarily; for
          supposing the baptism of infants moved for, and sureties promised to
          be engaged for them, which seems likely to be the case as soon as
          mentioned, the better to get it received; Tertullian might say all
          that he does, though as yet not one infant had ever been baptized, or
          any sureties made use of: and indeed it would have been very strange,
          if nothing of this kind had been said previous to the observance of
          them; the bare motion of these things was sufficient to bring our the
          arguments against them: and what though Tertullian might have some odd
          notions and singular opinions, about which he talked wrong and weakly,
          does it follow that therefore he so did about these points? Nor is
          there any reason to interpret his words of the infants of infidels,
          since he makes no distinction in the passage, nor gives the least hint
          of any; and what he elsewhere says of the children of believers being
          holy, he explains of their being designed for holiness;[25]and says
          men are not born, but made Christians:[26] nor does he any where allow
          of the baptism of infants, in case of necessity, which is only
          established upon that impertinent reading before-mentioned: and with
          respect to his notion of the necessity of baptism to salvation, it is
          sufficient to observe what he says; "if any understand the importance
          of baptism, they will rather fear the having it, than the delaying it:
          true faith is secure of salvation."[27] And the reason why he does not
          produce infant-baptism among his unwritten customs, is very easy to
          observe, because as yet no such custom had obtained, and as yet the
          apostolical tradition of it had never been heard of: the first that
          speaks of that, if he does at all, is the following person;
        </p>
        <p>
          Origen, who flourished about the year 230, and comes next under
          consideration: and three passages are usually cited out of him in
          favor of infant-baptism; shewing not only that infants should be
          baptized; but that this was an ancient usage of the church, and a
          tradition of the apostles. Now there things are only to be met with in
          the Latin translations of this ancient writer; and though there is
          much of his still extant in Greek, yet in these his genuine works
          there is not the least hint of infant-baptism, nor any reference to
          it; and much less any express mention of it; and still less any thing
          did of it, being a custom of the church, and an apostolical tradition:
          This has justly raised a suspicion, that he has not been fairly used
          in the translations of him by Ruffinus and Jerome: and upon inquiry,
          this is found to be the truth of the matter; and it is not only
          Erasmus, whom Dr. Wall is pleased to represent as angrily saying, that
          a reader is uncertain whether he reads Origen or Ruffinus; for
          Scutetus[28] says the same thing; and it is the observation of many
          others, that it was the common custom of Ruffinus to interpolate
          whatever he translated. The learned Huctius, who has given us a good
          edition of all Origen’s commentaries of the scripture in Greek, and
          who was as conversant with his writings, and understood them as well
          as any man whatever, was very sensible of the foul play he has met
          with, and often complains of the perfidy and impudence of Ruffinus; he
          says of him, that whatever he undertook to translate, he interpolated;
          that he so distressed and corrupted the writings of Origen by
          additions and detractions, that one is at a loss to find Origen in
          Origen: that whereas he undertook to translate his commentary on the
          Romans, at the instance of Heraclius, yet he asks, with what
          faithfulness did he do it? namely, with his own, that is, which is the
          worst; and when Huetius produces any thing out of there translations,
          it is always with diffidence, as not to be depended upon and sometimes
          he adds when he has done, "but let us remember again the perfidy of
          Ruffinus;" and speaking particularly of his commentaries on the
          Romans, he says; "Let the learned reader remember that Origen is not
          so much to be thought the author of them, as Ruffinus, by whom they
          are not so much interpreted, as new coined and interpolated."[29]
        </p>
        <p>
          But what need I produce these testimonies? Ruffinus himself owns, not
          only that he used great freedom in translating the homilies on
          Leviticus, and added much of his own to them, as I have observed; but
          also in his translation of the commentary on the Romans, he grants the
          charge against him, "that he added some things, supplied what was
          wanting, and shortened what were too long;"[30] and it is from there
          two pieces that the two principal passages which assert infant-baptism
          to be the custom of the church, and an apostolical tradition, are
          taken: and now of what use is this Gentleman’s quotation from
          Marshall? it is good for nothing. The other passage, which stands in
          Jerome’s translation of Origen’s homilies on Luke, speaks indeed of
          the baptism of infants, and the necessity of it; but not a word of its
          being a custom of the church, and an apostolical tradition, as in the
          other; and betide, his translations being no more exact than
          Ruffinus’, and which appears by his other versions; in which he takes
          the same liberty as Ruffinus did, are no more to be depended upon than
          his. And now, where is his highest probability and moral certainty,
          that there are no additions and interpolations in Origen? I appeal to
          the whole world, whether such fort of writings as there, so manifestly
          corrupted, so confessedly interpolated, would be admitted an evidence
          in any civil affair in any court of judicature whatever; and if not,
          then surely these ought not to be admitted as an evidence in religious
          affairs, respecting an ordinance of our Lord Jesus Christ. But it is
          said, "supposing all this, what does it signify in the present case,
          unless it could be proved that the particular passages under
          consideration were additions or interpolations?"
        </p>
        <p>
          To which I answer; since the whole is so interpolated, and so
          deformed, that it can scarcely be known, as has been observed, what
          dependence can there be on any part of it? I have observed, that the
          passage in the homilies on Leviticus, is by Vossius thought to be of
          the greater authority against the Pelagians, because of the
          interpolations of Ruffinus. This Gentleman says, I have unluckily
          observed this; I do not see any unluckiness in it; it is lucky on my
          side, that Vossius, a Paedobaptist, should suggest that this passage
          is interpolated, however unlucky Ruffinus was in doing it; and it is
          no. unusual thing for a writer to infect that in his works, which
          makes or may be improved against himself: beside, what makes these
          very passages suspected of interpolation, is, not only that no
          contemporary of Origen’s, nor any writer before him, nor any after
          him, till the times of Ruffius and Jerome, ever speak of
          infant-baptism as a custom of the church, or an apostolic tradition;
          but neither Cyprian who came after him, and pleaded for
          infant-baptism, ever refers to Origen as saying these things, or uses
          such language as he is said to do; nor does Austin, who made such a
          bluster about infant-baptism being an apostolical tradition, ever
          appeal to Origen’s testimony of it; which one would think he would
          have done, had there been any such testimony: our author, because I
          have said that many things may be observed from the Greek of Origen in
          favor of adult-baptism, hectors most manfully; "the assertion, he
          says, is either false, or very impertinent;" but surely he must be a
          little too premature to pass such a censure before the things are
          produced. I greatly question whether he has ever read the writings of
          Origen, either the Latin translations of him, or his works in Greek;
          and indeed there are scarce any of his quotations of the fathers
          throughout his whole work, but what seem to be taken at second hand
          from Dr Wall, or others: I say more than I should have chose to have
          said, through his insulting language. I am quite content he should
          have all the credit his performance will admit of; only such a writer,
          who knows his own weakness, ought not to be so pert and insolent:
          however, to stop the mouth of this swaggering blade, whoever he is, I
          will give him an instance or two out of the Greek of Origen, in favor
          of adult-baptism, to the exclusion of infant-baptism, and as
          manifestly against it. Now, not to take notice of Origen’s[31]
          interpretation of Mat 19:14 as not of infants literally, but
          metaphorically; which, according to his sense, destroys the argument
          of the Paedobaptists from thence, in favor of infant-baptism: "It is
          to be observed, says Origen, that the four evangelists saying that
          John confessed he came to baptize in water, only Matthew adds unto
          repentance; teaching, that he has the profit of baptism who "is
          baptized of his own will and choice:"
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if the profit of baptism is tied to "a person baptized of his own
          will and choice,’ according to Origen, then baptism mutt: be
          unprofitable and insignificant to infants, because they are not
          baptized of their own will and choice: and a little after he says;
          "The laver by the water is a symbol of the purification of the soul
          washed from all the filth of wickedness; nevertheless also of itself
          it is the beginning and fountain of divine gifts, because of the power
          of the invocation of the adorable Trinity, "to him that gives up
          himself to God;"[32] which last clause excludes infants, since they do
          not and cannot give up themselves to God in that ordinance. Let this
          Gentleman, if he can, produce any thing out of those writings of
          Origen, in favor of infant-baptism; the passage Dr. Wall[33] refers to
          has not a syllable of it, nor any reference to it; and though he
          supposes Jerome must some where or other have read it in his writings,
          what Jerome says[34] supposes no such thing; since the passage only
          speaks of Origen’s opinion of sins in a pre-existent state, being
          forgiven in baptism, but not a word of the baptism of infants, or of
          their sins being forgiven them in their baptism: and now where is the
          clear testimony of the great Origen, not only for the practice of
          infant-baptism in his own days, but for the continual use of it all
          along from the time of the apostles? and where is our author’s vaunt
          of the superior antiquity of infant-baptism to infant-communion?
          which, as we shall see presently, began together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cyprian is the next, and the only remaining writer of this century,
          quoted in favor of infant-baptism; who lived about the middle of it,
          and is the first pleader for it that we know of. We allow it was
          practiced in his time in the African churches, where it was first
          moved; and at the same time infant-communion was practiced also, of
          which we have undoubted and incontestable evidence; and it is but
          reasonable that if infants have a right to one ordinance, they should
          be admitted to the other; and if antiquity is of any weight in the
          matter, it is as early for the one as for the other: but though
          infant-baptism now began to be practiced, it appears to be a novel
          business; not only the time of its administration, being undetermined;
          which made Fidus, a country bishop, who had a doubt about
          administering it before the eighth day, apply to the council under
          Cyprian for the resolution of it; but the exceeding weakness of the
          arguments then made use of for baptizing new-born infants, of which
          the present Paedobaptists must be ashamed, shew that Paedobaptism was
          then in its infant-state: the arguments used by Cyprian, and his
          brethren for it, were taken from the grace of God being given to all
          men; and from the equality of the gift to all; and this proved from
          the spiritual equality of the bodies of infants and adult persons; and
          both from the prophet Elisha’s stretching himself on the Shunamite’s
          child; they argue the admission of all to baptism from the words of
          Peter, who says he was shewn, that nothing is to be called common or
          unclean; and reason, that infants ought to be more easily admitted
          than grown persons, because they have less guilt; and their weeping
          and crying are to be interpreted praying; yea, they suggest that
          baptism gives grace, and that a person is lost without it: but that it
          may appear I do not wrong them, I will transcribe their own words; and
          that as they are translated by Dr. Wall, so far as they relate to this
          matter: "All of us judged that the grace and mercy of God is to be
          denied to no person that is born; for whereas our Lord in his gospel
          says, the Son of Man came not to destroy men’s souls, (or lives) but
          to save them; as far as lies in us, no soul, if possible, is to be
          lost. The scripture gives us to understand the equality of the divine
          gift on all, whether infants or grown persons: Elisha, in his prayer
          to God, stretched himself on the infant-son of the Shunamite woman,
          that lay dead, in such manner, that his head, and face, and limbs, and
          feet, were applied to the head, face, limbs, and feet of the child;
          which, if it he understood according to the quality of our body and
          nature, the infant would not hold measure with that grown man, nor his
          limbs fit to reach to his great ones; but in that place a spiritual
          equality, and such as is in the esteem of God, is intimated to us by
          which persons that are once made by God are alike and equal; and our
          growth of body by age, makes a difference in the sense of the world,
          but not of God; unless you will think that the grace itself which is
          given to baptized persons, is greater or less according to the age of
          those that receive it; whereas the holy Spirit is given, not by
          different measures, but with a fatherly affection and kindness, equal
          to all; for God, as he accepts no one person, so not his age; but with
          a just equality shews himself a Father to all, for their obtaining the
          heavenly grace—so that we judge that no person is to be hindered from
          the obtaining the grace by the law that is now appointed; and that the
          spiritual circumcision ought not to be restrained by the circumcision
          that was according to the flesh; but that all are to be admitted to
          the grace of Christ; since Peter, speaking in the Acts of the
          Apostles, says, the Lord has shewn me, that no person is to be called
          common or unclean. If any thing could be an obstacle to persons
          against their obtaining the grace, the adult, and grown, and elder
          men, would be rather hindered by their more grievous sins. If then the
          graceless offender, and those that have grievously sinned against God
          before, have, when they afterwards come to believe, forgiveness of
          their sins; and no person is kept off from baptism and the grace; how
          much less reason is there to refuse an infant, who, being newly born,
          has no sin, save the being descended from Adam according to the flesh:
          he has from his very birth contracted the contagion of the death
          anciently threatened; who comes, for this reason, more easily to
          receive forgiveness of sins, because they are not his own, but others
          sins that are forgiven him. This therefore, dear brother, was our
          opinion in the assembly, that it is not for us to hinder any man from
          baptism and the grace of God, who is merciful and kind and
          affectionate to all; which rule, as it holds for all, so we think it
          more especially to be observed in reference to infants, and persons
          newly born; to whom our help, and the divine mercy, is rather to be
          granted; because by their weeping and wailing, at their first entrance
          into the world, they do intimate nothing so much as that they implore
          compassion."[35]
        </p>
        <p>
          Every one that compares what Cyprian and his colleagues say for
          infant-baptism, and what Tertullian says against it, as before
          related, will easily see a difference between them, between Tertullian
          the Antipaedobaptist, and Cyprian the Paedobaptist; how manly and
          nervous the one! how mean and weak the other! no doubt, as is known,
          being railed about infant-baptism at this time, or any objection made
          to it, does not prove it then to be an ancient custom; since the same
          observation, which may be made, would prove infant-communion to he
          equally the same. Now as we allow that henceforward infant-baptism was
          practiced in the African churches, and prevailed in,
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourth century, here the controversy might stop: and indeed all
          that we contend for in this century, is only that there were some
          persons that did call it in question and oppose it; and if this will
          not be allowed, we are not very anxious about it, and shall not think
          it worth while to contest it. This writer would have it observed, that
          I have given up the greatest lights of the church in this century as
          vouchers for infant-baptism, and particularly St Jerom, Ruffinus, and
          Augustin; they are welcome to them; they have need of them to
          enlighten them in this dark affair: we do not envy their having them,
          especially that persidious interpolater Ruffinus; nor that
          arch-heretic Pelagius, whom this Gentleman takes much pains to retain,
          as ignorant as he either was, or would be, or is thought to be; as
          that he never heard that any one whatever denied baptism to infants,
          and promised the kingdom of heaven without the redemption of Christ,
          or refused that unto them. This ignorance of his was either affected
          or pretended, in order to clear himself from the charge of those
          things against him; as men generally do run into high strains and
          extravagant expressions, when they are at such work; or it was real
          ignorance, and who can help that? It does not follow that therefore
          none had, because he had never heard of it; one would think his
          meaning rather was, that he had never heard of any that denied the
          kingdom of heaven and the common redemption to infants, who think they
          ought to be baptized, dum putat, while he is of opinion, that in
          baptism they are regenerated in Christ; but about this I shall not
          contend; truth does not depend upon his hearing and knowledge,
          judgment and observation. I think it is not insisted upon that Austin
          should say, he never heard or read of any catholic, heretic, or
          schismatic, that denied infant-baptism; however, it seems he could say
          it if he did not, and that notwithstanding the reasons I alledged; as,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Austin must know that Tertullian had opposed it. Here our author
          quibbles about the terms opposing and denying, and distinguishes
          between them; and observes, that whatever Tertullian said against it,
          he did not properly deny it. He may say the same of me, or any other
          writer against infant-baptism, that though we speak against it,
          contradict and oppose it, and use arguments against it, yet we do not
          deny it. Dr Wall indeed thinks neither Austin nor Pelagius had seen
          Tertullian’s book of baptism, or they could not have said what he
          thinks they did.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Austin presided at the council of Carthage, when a canon was made
          that anathematized those who denied baptism to new-born infants; and
          therefore mull know there were some that denied it. This Gentleman
          says, it is demonstrably certain, that this canon was not made against
          persons that denied infant-baptism, because it was made against
          Pelagius and Celesius. It is true, the latter part of the canon was
          made against them; but the former part respected a notion or tenet of
          some other persons, who denied baptism to new-born infants. Dr Wall
          saw this, and says, this canon mentions the baptism of infants,
          condemning two errors about it; the one respecting the baptism of
          new-born infants; the other the doctrine of original sin, and the
          baptism of infants for forgiveness of sins, denied by the Pelagians;
          but the former he supposes was the opinion of Fidus, embraced by some
          persons now, which he had vented a hundred and fifty years before,
          that infants should not be baptized till they were eight days old;
          whereas Fidus is represented as having been alone in his opinion; and
          if he retained it, which is doubtful, it does not appear he had any
          followers; nor is there any evidence of there being any of his
          sentiment in this age;[36] and were there, it is unreasonable to
          imagine, that a council of all the bishops in Africa should agree to
          anathematize them, because they thought proper to defer the baptizing
          of infants a few days longer than they did; and besides, infants only
          eight days old may be properly called newly-born infants; and
          therefore such could not be said to deny baptism to them; and it would
          have been a marvelous thing, had they been anathematized for it:
          though this writer says, wonder who will; a council, consisting of all
          the bishops of Africa, did in fact agree to anathematize their own
          brethren, who were in the same opinion and practice of. infant-baptism
          with themselves." It is true, they did anathematize the Pelagians, who
          were in the same opinion and practice of infant-baptism with
          themselves in general; though I question whether they reckoned them
          their own brethren; but then not on account of any difference about
          the time of baptism, a few days odds between them, the thing to be
          wondered at; but their denial of original sin, and the baptism of
          infants to be on account of that: and now since the Pelagians are
          distinct from those in the canon that denied baptism to new-born
          infants; and it is unreasonable to suppose any who were of the
          sentiments of Fidus are intended; it remains, that there must be some
          persons different both from the one and the other, who denied baptism
          to babes, and are by this canon anathematized for it, which Austin
          must know.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is observed by me, that Austin himself makes mention of some
          that argued against it, from the unprofitableness of it to infants;
          since for the most part they die before they have any knowledge of it.
          These men our author does not know what to make of; sometimes it is
          questionable whether they were Christians, and suggests that they were
          men of atheistical principles; and then again they are supposed to be
          Christians, and even might be Paedobaptists, notwithstanding this
          their manner of arguing. I am content he should reckon them what he
          pleases; but one would think they could not be any good friends to
          infant-baptism, that questioned the profitableness of baptism to
          infants, and brought so strong an objection to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is further observed by me, that according to Austin the
          Pelagians denied baptism to the infants of believers, because they
          were holy. This is represented by this Gentleman as a mistake of mine,
          understanding what was spoken hypothetically, to be absolutely spoken.
          I have looked over the passage again, and am not convinced upon a
          second reading of it, nor by what this writer has advanced, of a
          mistake: the words are absolutely expressed and reasoned upon; "but,
          says the apostle, your children would be unclean, but now they are
          holy; therefore, say they (the Pelagians) the children of believers
          ought not now to be baptized." The observation our author makes,
          though he does not insist upon it, is very impertinent; that not
          infants but children are mentioned, and so may include the adult
          children of believers, and consequently make as much against
          adult-baptism as infant-baptism; since children in the text, on which
          the argument is grounded, are always by themselves understood of
          infants. Austin wonders that the Pelagians should talk after this
          manner, that holiness is derived from parents, and reasons upon it,
          when they deny that sin is originally derived from Adam: it is true,
          indeed, he presses them with an argument this Gentleman calls ad
          hominem, taken from their shutting up the kingdom of God to unbaptized
          infants; for though they believed that unbaptized infants would not
          perish, but have everlasting life, yet not enter the kingdom of God;
          absurdly distinguishing between the kingdom of God, and eternal life.
          What they were able to answer, or did answer to this, it is not easy
          to say; "it is a disadvantage, as our author says, that we have none
          of their writings entire, only scraps and quotations from them:"
          Perhaps as they had a singular notion, that the infants of believers
          ought not to be baptized, though the infants of others should; they
          would, in answer to the above argument, say, that the infants of
          believers unbaptized enter the kingdom, though the unbaptized infants
          of others do not. I only guess this might be their answer, consistent
          with their principles: however, if I am mistaken in this matter, as I
          think I am not, it is in company with men of learning I am not ashamed
          to be among. The learned Daneus says[37] "the Pelagians deny that
          baptism is to be administered to the children of believers," having
          plainly in view this passage of Austin’s; and the very learned
          Forbesius[38] brings in this as an objection to his sense of 1Cor
          7:14, "the Pelagians abused this saying of the apostle, that they
          might say, that the infants of believers ought not to be baptized, as
          we read in Augustin."[39]
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The words quoted by me out of Jerome, I own, are spoken by way of
          supposition; but then they suppose a case that had been, was, and
          might be again; and it should be observed, that the supposition Jerome
          makes, is not a neglect of the baptism of infants, as this Gentleman
          suggests, but a denial of it to them, a refusing to give it to them;
          which is expressive of a rejection of it, and of an opposition to it.
          So that from all there instances put together, we cannot but conclude
          that there were some persons that did oppose and reject infant-baptism
          in those times, and think it may be allowed, which is all we contend
          for; however, as I have said before, we are not very anxious about it.
          Mr. Marshall[40] a favorite writer of our author’s, says, some in
          those times questioned it (infant-baptism) as Augustin grants in his
          sermons de verbis Apostol, but does not refer us to the particular
          place; it seems to be his fourteenth sermon on that subject, entitled,
          Concerning the baptism of infants, against the Pelagians; where Austin
          tells us how he was led to the subject; and though he had no doubt
          about it, "yet some men raised disputes, which were now become
          frequent, and endeavored to subvert the minds of many;"[41] by whom he
          seems to mean persons distinct from the Pelagians, since he represents
          them as having no doubt about it: and this is further confirmed by a
          passage out of the same discourse; "that infants are to be baptized,
          let no one doubt (which is an address to others, and implies, that
          either they did doubt of infant-baptism, or were in danger of it)
          since they doubt not, who in some respect contradict it;" which our
          author has placed as a motto in his title-page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Austin, we allow, in this age, frequently speaks of infant-baptism as
          an ancient usage of the church, and as an apostolical tradition; but
          what proof does he give of it? what testimonies does he produce? does
          he produce any higher testimony than Cyprian? not one; who, it is
          owned, speaks of infant-baptism, but not as an apostolical tradition;
          Cyprian uses no such language: those phrases, which were understood
          and believed from the beginning, and what the church always thought,
          or anciently, held, are Austin’s words, and not Cyrian’s; and only
          express what Austin inferred and concluded from him: and betides, his
          testimony is appealed to, not so much for infant-baptism, the thing
          itself, as for the reason of it, original sin, which gave rise unto it
          in Cyprian’s time: and it is for the proof of this, and not
          infant-baptism, that Austin himself refers to the manifest faith of an
          apostle; namely, to shew that not the flesh only, but the soul would
          be lost, and be brought into condemnation through the offense of Adam,
          if not quickened by the grace of Christ, for which he refers to
          Rom5:18 and yet our author insinuates, that by this he did not
          consider the baptism of infants for original sin as a novel thing in
          Cyprian’s time, but refers it to the authority of an apostle: and by
          the way, since Cyprian, the only witness produced by Austin, speaks
          not of infant-baptism as an ancient usage of the church, or an
          apostolic tradition, there is no agreement between his language and
          that of Origen, he is made to speak in his Latin translations, as this
          author elsewhere suggests; and it confirms the proof of his having
          been dealt unfairly with, since Cyprian, coming after him, uses no
          such language, nor does Austin himself ever refer unto him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have observed that there are many other things, which by Austin; and
          other ancient writers, are called apostolic traditions; such as
          infant-communion, the sign of the cross in baptism, the form of
          renouncing the devil and all his works, exorcism, trine immersion, the
          consecration of the water, anointing with oil in baptism, and giving a
          mixture of milk and honey to the baptized persons: and therefore if
          infant-baptism is received on this foot, these ought likewise; since
          there is as early and clear proof of them from antiquity, as of that:
          and my further view in mentioning these, was to observe, not only how
          early, but how easily these corruptions got into the church, as
          infant-baptism did.
        </p>
        <p>
          This writer has thought fit to take notice only of one of these
          particulars, namely, infant-communion; and the evidence of this, he
          says, is not so full and so early as that of infant-baptism. Now, let
          it. be observed, that there is no proof of infant-baptism being
          practiced before Cyprian’s time; nor does Austin refer to any higher
          testimony than his for the practice of it for original sin; and in his
          time infant-communion was in use beyond all contradiction: there is an
          instance of it given by himself, which I have referred to; and that is
          more than is or can be given of infant-baptism, which can only be
          deduced by consequences from that instance, and from Cyprian and his
          colleagues reasoning about the necessity of the administration of it
          to new-born children, he suggests that Austin expresses himself
          differently, when he is speaking of the one and of the other as an
          apostolic tradition; but if he does, it is in higher strains of
          infant-communion; for thus begin the passages, "if they pay any regard
          to the apostolic authority, or rather to the Lord and Master of the
          apostles, etc. and no man that remembers that he is a Christian, and
          of the catholic faith, denies or doubts that infants, without eating
          his flesh, and drinking his blood, have no life in them, etc:"
        </p>
        <p>
          The Punici Christiani, which Austin speaks of, are not to be
          restrained, as they are by our author, to the Christians of Carthage,
          but take in other African Christians, particularly at Hippo, where
          Austin was bishop, and where they spoke the Punic language, and in
          many other places: and surely if Austin is a good witness for an
          apostolical tradition, who lived at the latter end of the fourth
          century; he must know what was the sense of the African Christians in
          his time, among whom he lived, and upon what they grounded their
          practice of infant-communion; which he says was upon an ancient and
          apostolic tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other rites and usages, he says, I make mention of, are spoken of
          by Basil as unwritten traditions; and infant-baptism is not mentioned
          among them, and so was considered as standing upon a better evidence
          and testimony: now, not to observe that I produce earlier authorities
          than Basil, for there apostolical traditions so called, even as early
          as Tertullian, the first man that spoke of infant-baptism; neither are
          infant-communion, sponsors at baptism, exorcism in it, and giving milk
          and honey at that time, mentioned by Basil among them; does it
          therefore follow that they stand upon a better foot than the rest?
          besides, since Apostolic tradition is distinguished from Scripture, by
          the author of The baptism of infants a reasonable Service, with whom I
          had to do; it can be considered in the controversy between us, no
          other than as an unwritten tradition. This writer further observes,
          that it does not appear that there unwritten traditions were ever put
          to the test, and stood the trial, particularly in the Pelagian
          controversy, as infant-baptism: it is manifest that the exorcisms and
          exsufflations used in baptism, and the argument from them, as much
          pinched, puzzled, and confounded the Pelagians, as ever infant-baptism
          did: and it is notorious, that signing with the sign of the cross has
          stood the test in all ages, from the beginning of it, and is continued
          to this day; and prevails not only among the Papists, but among
          Protestant churches. Upon the whole then, it is clear there is no
          express mention of infant-baptism in the two first centuries, no nor
          any plain hint of it, nor any manifest reference to it; and that there
          is no evidence of its being practiced till the third century; and that
          it is owned, it prevailed in the fourth: and so rests the state of the
          controversy.
