            doubt who are at all conversant with their writings. The Council of
            Trent asserts, that "traditions respecting both faith and manners,
            orally delivered, and successively preserved in the Catholic Church,

            ministry of the church, gives us the true sense, which is not had
            distinctly in the Scripture. In tradition, therefore, consists the
            Word of God rather than in the written letter alone. It is

            the churches. That we may not mistake them, Andradius tells us, that

            appeal. Origen, who lived in the former part of the third century,
            and who was the first ancient writer that distinctly approved of
            infant baptism, represents it as a tradition from the Apostles. The
            words ascribed to him are these: "For this"—that is, for original
            sin—" the church has received a tradition from the Apostles, even to
            give baptism to infants."(Origen, Comment in </span

            A large portion of the works of Origen has perished; and those that
            still exist, have, for the most part, come down to us, not in the
            original Greek, but in a Latin translation by Rufinus, a writer of
            the fourth century, by whom they are known to have been extensively
            interpolated. So clearly has this been ascertained; that no
            judicious critic will place confidence in any writing of Origen,
            which is to be found only in the translation of Rufinus.

            defends it as a custom of the church not to be despised, and as an
            apostolical tradition generally received.' But as he was
            contemporary with Rufinus, he probably took the hint of infant
            baptism being an apostolical tradition from the Latin translation of
            Origen made by the latter since no other ecclesiastical writer
            previously speaks of it in this manner. The uncertainty of any
            apostolical tradition in favor of infant baptism seems to be

            and after His crucifixion, which are not written in the Scriptures;
            and who can say, but that among those many unwritten sayings of His,

            suggests, that "although infant baptism is not to be found in the
            writings of the Apostle Paul extant in the Scriptures, yet it might
            be in some writings of his which are lost, and not now extant."

            considerable figure in Popish pageantry. Romanists administer the
            rite with circumstances of great pomp and show; such as the
            consecration of the water; the presence of sponsors, who answer the
            interrogatories, and make the renunciation, in the name of the
            child, exorcisms, exsuffiations, crossings, the use of salt,
            spittle, and oil. Before the baptism, the water is consecrated with
            much solemn parade.

            water in the figure of a cross, and saying, "I adjure thee, O
            creature of water!" Then he divides the water after the manner of a
            cross, and makes three or four crossings. Next, he takes a horn of
            oil, and pours it three times upon the water in the form of a cross,
            and makes a prayer, that the font may be sanctified, and the Eternal
            Trinity be present, saying, "Descend from heaven, and sanctify this
            water, and give grace and virtue, that he who is baptized according
            to the command of Thy Christ, may be crucified, and die, and be

            creed and the Lord's Prayer, renounce the devil and all his works,
            and answer the questions put in the name of the child. The form of
            interrogation and reply according to the Roman ritual, is this, "The
            name of the infant being called, the presbyter must say, Dost thou
            renounce Satan? Answer, I do renounce. And all his works? Answer, I
            do renounce. And all his pomps? Answer, I do renounce." Three times
            these questions are put, and three times the sureties answer. The
            interrogations are sometimes made by a priest, sometimes by a
            presbyter, and sometimes by an exorcist. The following question is
            also added, "Dost thou believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator
            of heaven and earth?" To which the sponsors reply, "I do
            believe."</span

            >Previous to being baptized, the infant is breathed upon, and
            exorcised, that the wicked spirit may be driven from it, and that it
            may be delivered from the power of darkness, and be translated into
            the kingdom of Christ. The following is the formula for this part of
            the service prescribed by the Papal code. "Let him—the minister,
            priest, deacon, or exorcist—blow into the face of the person to be
            baptized, three times, saying, Go out, thou unclean spirit, and give
            place to the Holy Ghost, the Comforter." That of Gregory is slightly
            different. "I exorcise thee, O unclean spirit, in the name of the
            Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, that thou go out and
            depart from this servant of God."

            its mouth, as a token of its being seasoned with the salt of wisdom,
            and as an intimation that "by the doctrines of faith, and by the
            gift of grace, he shall be preserved from the corruption of sin,
            experience a relish for good works, and be nurtured with the food of
            divine knowledge." The priest first blesses the salt after this
            manner, "I exorcise thee, O creature of salt." And then, having
            blessed it, he puts it into the mouth of the infant, saying,
            "Receive the salt of wisdom unto life everlasting."</span

            to receive the savor of the knowledge of God, and to hear his
            commands ; and that "as sight was given to the blind man mentioned
            in the Gospel, whom the Lord, having spread clay on his eyes,
            commanded to wash them in the waters of Siloam, so by the efficacy

            established institution of the church, in the early part of the

            espoused and asserted it, and the practice had gradually spread,
            especially in North Africa. But it was not until the provincial
            Council of Mileve, more correctly called the Council of Carthage,
            held about A.D., 418 that any canon was passed in its favor. This

            generally observed in the Latin Church, and is still universally

            the Papists. This was not a mere change in the form of baptism. It
            was the abrogation of baptism itself. For it is not, as some
            consider, a matter of indifference whether much or little water is
            used in baptism. Immersion belongs to the very essence of baptism,
            and without it, there can be no baptism. As Sir John Floyer

            sprinkling, was brought into the church by the Popish Schoolmen, and
            that the English Dissenters adopted it from them. The Schoolmen
            employed their wits to find out reasons for the alteration to
            sprinkling, and brought it into use in the twelfth century."

            it has not established sprinkling in baptism to this day; sprinkling
            being permitted only when it is certified, that the child is weak,
            and not able to bear dipping. In all other cases, the Rubric orders
            the priest to dip the child warily. The legal sanction of sprinkling
            in Great Britain came from the Presbyterians during the civil war.
            The Westminster Assembly of Divines decided for sprinkling against
            dipping by a majority of only one; twenty-five voting for it, and
            twenty-four in opposition to it. On their recommendation, it was
            established by Act of Parliament in 1664. They borrowed it from
            Geneva; and Geneva borrowed it from Rome.

            Romish priest. This he did, in the presence of the king and of many
            others, dressed in the habit of an Episcopal clergyman. Mr. Ives
            pressed the priest closely, showing that to whatever antiquity

            On this, the priest broke up the conference, saying that he had been
            cheated, and would proceed no farther, for he came to dispute with a
            clergyman of the established Church, and it was now evident that
            this was an Anabaptist preacher. The behavior of the priest afforded

            and union of the church be as prevailing with them, to perform the
            one, as is their mercy to the infant's body, to neglect the other?"

            It is, therefore, the chief prop of these Antichristian
            Hierarchies—the final appeal to which they resort for countenance in
            their unscriptural practices. And so triumphant is this appeal, that
            no Pedobaptist Protestant or Dissenter has ever been able to stand
            before it.</span

            >Further, it is by means of infant baptism that "the Man of Sin" has
            spread his baneful influence over many nations. This is abundantly
            evident from the fact, that through the christening of children,
            introduced by him, he has made whole nations nominally Christian,
            and has applied to them the designation of Christendom, thus
            extending the limits of his universal church, over which, as the
            pretended Vicar of Christ on earth, he claims absolute power and
            authority. By the same means, he retains his influence over these
            nations, keeps them in awe of his spiritual prerogatives, and holds
            them in servile subjection to his will.

            >With this view, he sedulously inculcates the pernicious dogma that
            by their baptism, received in infancy, they are brought into the
            fold of the church, within which there is salvation, and out of
            which there is none, and that therefore, if they renounce their
            baptism, or apostatize from the church, they consign themselves to
            inevitable damnation. Thus, by his menaces and anathemas, he
            maintains his usurped dominion over the submissive and trembling
            nations. And if, at any time, one of these nations has courage to
            oppose him, and to act in disobedience to his mandates, he
            immediately lays under an interdict, suspending the sacraments, all
            public prayers, burials, and christenings, closing the churches, and
            forbidding the clergy to administer their functions to any but those
            who at a great price purchase the privilege from Rome. (</span

            with the demands of the Papal power, however oppressive and
            tyrannical they may be. For it appears most dreadful to parents,
            that their children should be deprived of baptism, by which, as they
            are taught to believe, they are made Christians, and without which
            there is no salvation. Hence whole kingdoms have been known to yield
            to the most arbitrary exactions of Rome, rather than lose what is
            deemed so very important. What a tremendous influence, therefore,
            must infant baptism give to Popery; and how cunningly is it adapted

            has taught that baptism takes away sin, regenerates men, and saves
            their souls. This is charged upon him by the ancient Waldenses in
            the treatise on Antichrist to which I have already referred.
            Speaking of the corruptions of the Papal Hierarchy, they say, "The
            third work of Antichrist consists in this, that he attributes the
            regenerating grace of the Holy Spirit to the dead, outward act of
            baptism. In this faith, he baptizes children, teaching that
            salvation is thus to be obtained. On this ground, he confers orders
            and other sacraments; and thereon builds all his Christianity. All
            which is against the Holy Spirit." (Morland's </span

            statement of the latter, that "infants are damned if they die
            without being baptized," he asked this question, "I pray you, my

            child, when baptized, is declared to be regenerate, and thanks are
            returned to God, that it is regenerate. And when it is capable of
            being catechised, it is taught to say that in its baptism, it was
            made a child of God, a member of Christ, and an inheritor of the
