          Some Strictures on Mr. Bostwick’s<br />
          Fair and Rational Vindication of the right of infants to the ordinance
          of baptism
        </h2>
        <p>
          Along with Mr. Clark's Defense of the divine Right of Infant-baptism,
          to which what is written above is a Reply, there has been imported
          from America a treatise called, A fair and rational Vindication of the
          Right of Infants to the Ordinance of Baptism; being the substance of
          several discourses from Acts 2:39, by David Bostwick, A.M. late
          minister of the Presbyterian church in the city of New York, which has
          been reprinted and published here; and as it comes in company with the
          former, it is but a piece of civility to take some notice of it, and
          make some few strictures (severe criticisms, ed.) upon it, though
          there is nothing in it but what is answered in the above Reply; to
          which I shall greatly refer the reader. There is scarce a single
          thought through the whole of it, that I can discern, is new; nothing
          but crambe repetita, old stale reasonings and arguments, which have
          been answered over and over; and yet this, I understand, has been
          cried up as an unanswerable performance; which I do not wonder at,
          that any thing that has but an appearance of reasoning, candor, and
          ingenuity, as this will be allowed to have, should be so reckoned by
          those of that party; when the most miserable pamphlet that comes out
          on that side of the question, has the same epithet bellowed upon it.
          And,
        </p>
        <p>
          First, This Gentleman has mistook the sense of his text, on which he
          grounds his discourse concerning the Right of infants to baptism (Acts
          2:39), for the promise is unto you, and to your children; and to all
          that are afar off; even as many as the Lord our God shall call; by
          which promise, he says, p. 14, 15, must be understood," the
          covenant-promise made to Abraham, which gave his "infant-children a
          right to the ordinance of circumcision;" when there is not the least
          mention made of Abraham, nor of any covenant-promise made to him in
          it; nor was ever any covenant-promise made to him, giving his
          infant-children a right to the ordinance of circumcision, but the
          covenant of circumcision; and that can never be meant here by the
          promise; since this is said to be to all that are afar off; by whom,
          according to this Gentleman, Gentiles are meant; to whom the covenant
          of circumcision belonged not; nor did it give to them any right to the
          ordinance of circumcision, except they became proselytes to the Jewish
          religion: besides, be the promise here what it may, it is observed,
          not as giving any right or claim to any ordinance whatever; but as an
          encouraging motive to persons in distress under a sense of sin, to
          repent of their sin, and declare their repentance, and yield a
          voluntary subjection to the ordinance of baptism; when they might hope
          that remission of sin would be applied to them, and they should
          receive a larger measure of the grace of the Spirit; and therefore can
          only be understood of adult persons; and the promise is no other than
          the promise of life and salvation by Christ, and of remission of sins
          by his blood, and of an increase of grace from his Spirit: and whereas
          the persons addressed had imprecated the blood of Christ, they had
          shed, upon their posterity, as well as on themselves, which greatly
          distressed them; they are told, for their relief, that the same
          promise would be made good to their posterity also, provided they did
          as they were directed to do; and to all their brethren the Jews, in
          distant parts; and even to the Gentiles, sometimes described as afar
          off, of the same character with themselves, repenting and submitting
          to baptism; yea, to all, in all ages and places, whom God should now,
          or hereafter call by his grace; see my Reply to Mr. Clark, p. 50,
          51.[1] This text is so far from being an unanswerable argument for the
          right of infants to baptism, as it is said to be, that there is not
          the least mention of Infant-baptism in it; nor any hint of it; nor any
          thing from whence it can be concluded. The baptism encouraged to by it
          is only of adult persons convinced of sin, and who repented of it. The
          passage in Acts 3:25, brought for the support of the author's sense of
          his text, is foreign to his purpose; since it refers not to the
          covenant of circumcision made with Abraham (Gen 17:1-27), but to the
          promise of the Messiah of Abraham's seed, and of the blessing of all
          nations in him (Gen 22:18), and which was fulfilled in the mission and
          incarnation of Christ, and in the ministration f his gospel to Jews
          and Gentiles; which same promise of Christ, of life and salvation by
          him, is meant in Acts 13:26; Acts 13:32-33, and which is also a proof,
          that the children to whom it belongs, are to be understood, not of
          infant-children, but of the adult posterity of the Jews; since the
          apostle says, God hath fulfilled the same to us their children; for
          surely the apostle Paul must not be reckoned an infant-child.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, The ground on which the right of infants to baptism is
          founded by this author is a false one; which is the covenant made with
          Abraham, that which gave his infant-children a right to circumcision,
          and is said to be the covenant of grace, the same under which
          believers now are. This he looks upon to be the grand turning point,
          on which the issue of the controversy very much depends; that it is
          the main ground on which the right of infants to baptism is asserted;
          and he freely confesses, that if this covenant is not the covenant of
          grace, the main ground of infants right to baptism is taken away, and
          consequently, that the principal arguments in support of the doctrine
          are overturned (pp. 18, 19). Now that this ground and foundation is a
          false and sandy one, and will not bear the weight of this
          superstructure laid upon it, will appear by observing,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the covenant of grace gives no right to any positive
          institution; either circumcision or baptism: not to circumcision; the
          covenant of grace was in being, was made, manifested, and applied to
          many, from Adam to Abraham, both before and after the flood, who had
          no right to circumcision, nor knowledge of it; the covenant of grace
          did not give to Abraham himself a right to circumcision; he was openly
          interested in it, it was made, manifested, and applied unto him, many
          years before circumcision was enjoined him; and when it was, it was
          not the covenant of grace, but the express command of God, that gave
          him and his male seed a right to circumcision; I say his male seed,
          for his female seed, though no doubt many of them were interested in
          the covenant of grace, yet their covenant-interest gave them no right
          unto it: as there were also many, at the same time that circumcision
          was enjoined Abraham and his natural seed, who were interested in the
          covenant of grace, and yet had no right to circumcision; as Shem,
          Arphaxad, Lot, and others: and on the other hand, it may easily be
          observed, that there were many who had a right to circumcision, and on
          whom it was practiced, who, without any breach of charity, it may be
          concluded, had no interest in the covenant of grace; not to mention
          particular persons, as Ishmael, Esau, etc. many of the idolaters and
          rebels among the Israelites in the wilderness, of those that bowed the
          knee to Baal in the times of Ahab, and of the worshippers of
          Jeroboam's calves; those that are called the rulers of Sodom and
          Gomorrah in the times of Isaiah, and that worshipped the queen and
          host of heaven in the times of Jeremiah; and those whose characters
          are given in the prophecy of Malachi, as then living; with the Scribes
          and Pharisees, who committed the unpardonable sin in the times of
          Christ; these cannot be thought to be in the covenant of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, all were not Israel that were of Israel, and circumcised: it
          is therefore clear to a demonstration, that interest in the covenant
          of grace did not give right to circumcision, but the special,
          particular, and express command of God: nor does it give right to
          baptism; it gave the Old Testament-saints no right unto it, who were
          four thousand years without it, and yet in the covenant of grace; and
          since baptism is enjoined as an ordinance of the New Testament, a
          person may be in the covenant of grace, and yet not known to be so by
          himself or others; and while he is in such a state, and in such
          circumstances, he cannot be thought to have any right to baptism. It
          is a command of God, that those that repent and believe, be baptized;
          the covenant of grace provides faith and repentance for those
          interested in it, and bestows them on them; whereby they are qualified
          for baptism according to the divine command. But it is not the
          covenant of grace, nor these qualifications, that give the right to
          baptism; but the command of God to persons so qualified, to profess
          the same, and be baptized: for men may have faith and repentance, yet
          if they do not make a profession of them, they have no right to
          baptism, nor a minister any authority to administer it to them. No
          doubt but the apostle Peter was satisfied that the three thousand
          pricked in their hearts were truly penitents; yet insisted on the
          profession of their repentance, as antecedent to baptism; and Philip,
          I make no question, was satisfied of the Eunuch's being a believer in
          Christ by the conversation he had with him; yet required a confession
          of his faith in him, in order to his baptism; for with the mouth
          confession is to be made unto salvation. Nor even according to our
          author's sentiment does the covenant of grace give a right to baptism;
          since, according to him, persons are not in covenant before they are
          baptized; for he expressly says, pp. 12, 30. that by baptism they
          enter into the covenant, and are taken into the covenant by baptism;
          and therefore baptism rather gives them a right to the covenant, than
          the covenant a right to baptism, according to this Gentleman: so far
          is it from being true what he elsewhere says (p. 32), that the
          covenant of grace gave Abraham and his children a right to
          circumcision under the law; and that this it is that gives parents and
          children a right to baptism under the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The covenant of circumcision, or the covenant which gave Abraham's
          infant-children a right to circumcision, is not the covenant of grace;
          for the covenant of circumcision must be most certainly, in the nature
          of it, a covenant of works, and not of grace. It will be freely
          allowed, that the covenant of grace was at certain times made, and
          made manifest, and applied to Abraham, and he interested in it; and
          that God was the God of him, and of his spiritual seed; and that the
          spiritual seed of Abraham, both among Jews and Gentiles, are
          interested in the same covenant; but not his carnal seed, nor theirs
          as such: and that Abraham was justified by faith, as believers now
          are; and that the same gospel was preached to him as now; and that at
          the same time the covenant of circumcision was given unto him, there
          was an exhibition of the covenant of grace unto him: the account of
          both is mixed together; but then the covenant of circumcision, which
          was a covenant of peculiarity, and belonged only to him and his
          natural male seed, was quite a distinct thing from the covenant of
          grace, since it included some that were not in the covenant of grace,
          and excluded others that were in it: nor is that the covenant that was
          confirmed of God in Christ 430 years before the law was; since the
          covenant of circumcision falls 24 years short of that date, and
          therefore it refers not to that, but to an exhibition of the covenant
          of grace to Abraham, about the time of his call out of Chaldea;
          besides the covenant of circumcision is abolished, but the covenant of
          grace continues, and ever will; see my reply (pp. 35, 36). Now as this
          covenant, which gave Abraham's infant-children a right to
          circumcision, is not the covenant of grace, the main ground on which
          the right of infants to baptism is asserted, is taken away, and so no
          foundation left for it; and consequently the principal arguments in
          support of the doctrine are overturned, as this Gentleman freely
          confesses; and as everyone should, who is in the same way of thinking
          and reasoning. If the covenant of circumcision is not the covenant of
          grace, here of right the controversy should be closed, since this is
          the turning point on which the issue of it very much depends; for if
          this be false, all that follows as argued from it, must be so too;
          for,
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, If the covenant of circumcision is not the covenant of grace,
          then circumcision is not the seal of the covenant of grace it is said
          to be (p. 22). If it was, the covenant of grace must be without such a
          seal near two thousand years, before the covenant of circumcision was
          given; and why not then always without one? besides, it must be with a
          seal and without a seal at one and same time, which is absurd; for
          there were some interested in the covenant of grace as before
          observed, on whom circumcision was not enjoined, and so without this
          seal, when it was enjoined on Abraham and his natural seed, and there
          were such afterwards; and circumcision also must have been the seal of
          itself, which is another absurdity. Circumcision was a token and sign,
          or mark in the flesh, which Abraham's natural posterity were to bear
          until the coming of the Messiah; but is never called a seal throughout
          the whole Old Testament; and much less is it any where said to be a
          seal of the covenant of grace: and indeed what blessing of grace could
          it seal, assure of, and confirm, to any of Abraham's natural seed as
          such, or any other man's natural seed? It is indeed in the New
          Testament called a seal of the righteousness of the faith which
          Abraham had, being yet uncircumcised (Rom4:11.) but then it was no
          seal of that, nor of any thing else to others, but to Abraham only;
          namely, that that righteousness which he had by faith before he was
          circumcised, would come upon, or be imputed to the uncircumcised
          Gentiles; and accordingly this mark continued in the flesh of his
          posterity, until the gospel, publishing justification by the
          righteousness of faith, was ordered to be preached to the Gentiles.[2]
          Wherefore,
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly., Seeing circumcision was no seal of the covenant of grace,
          baptism, which it is pretended was instituted in the room of it, can
          be no seal of it neither, and so not to be administered as such to the
          children of professed believers, as is said (p. 25). The text in Col
          2:11, falls short of proving that baptism is instituted in the room of
          circumcision; since the apostle is speaking, not of circumcision in
          the flesh, but in the Spirit; and by which he means not the outward
          ordinance of baptism, that is distinguished from it,[3] but an inward
          work of grace upon the heart; spiritual circumcision, called the
          circumcision of Christ; which to understand as the same, is not to
          make an unreasonable tautology; it makes none at all, and much less
          nonsense, as this writer suggests; but beautifully completes the
          description the apostle gives of spiritual circumcision; first, by the
          manner of its performance, without hands; then by the matter and
          substance of it, the putting off the body of the sins of the flesh;
          and lastly, by the author of it, Christ, who by his spirit produces
          it. The argument from analogy is weak and insufficient; though some
          little agreement between circumcision and baptism may be imagined, and
          seem to be in the signification of them, yet the difference between
          them is notorious; they differ in their subjects, uses, manner of
          administration, and the administrators of them; nor is it true, what
          is suggested, that they are both sacraments of admission into the
          church; nor are they badges of relation to God or Christ, nor signs
          and seals of the covenant of grace. Nor need we be under any concern
          about any ordinance coming in the room of circumcision, and answering
          to that Jewish rite. Nor is there any necessity of any, no more than
          of a pope in the room of an high priest, or of any festivals to answer
          to those of the Passover, Pentecost, and Feast of Tabernacles; nor
          does the Lord's supper answer to the passover, and come in the room of
          it; it is Christ that answers to it, and is the passover sacrificed
          for us: but what makes it quite clear and plain, that baptism does not
          succeed circumcision, or come in the room of it, is, that it was in
          force and use before circumcision was abolished, which was not until
          the death of Christ, whereas John administered baptism, and Christ
          himself was baptized, and many others, some years before that time;
          and therefore baptism cannot be said, with any propriety, to succeed
          circumcision, when it was in force before the other was out of date:
          besides, if it did, it is no seal of the covenant of grace, nor to be
          administered to infants for such an use; for what spiritual blessing,
          what blessing of grace in the covenant, does baptism seal, or can
          seal, assure of, and secure unto the carnal seed of believers? Let it
          be named if it can.[4]
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifthly, It is not indisputably evident, as this Gentleman says (p.
          29), but indisputably false, that the apostles acknowledged and
          allowed the covenant-relation and interest of children, under the
          gospel, as well as under the law; by which I take it for granted he
          means, their relation and interest in the covenant of grace: that
          relation and interest, the natural seed of Abraham, as such, had not
          under the law; nor have the natural seed of believers, as such, the
          same under the gospel. This is not to be proved from his text, as has
          been shown already: nor from Rom11:16-17, where by the root and
          branches, are not meant Abraham and his posterity, or natural seed;
          nor by the olive-tree the Jewish church; but the gospel church-state
          in its first foundation, out of which were left the Jews that believed
          not in Christ, meant by the branches broken off; and which church was
          constituted of those that believed in him; and these were the root and
          first-fruits, which being holy, are the pledge and earnest of the
          future conversion and holiness of that people the apostle is speaking
          of in the context; and into which church state the Gentiles that
          believed were received, and are the branches grafted in, which partook
          of the root and fatness of the olive-tree; that is, of the goodness
          and fatness of the house of God, the ordinances and privileges of it:
          and in this passage not a word is said of the covenant-relation, and
          interest of children under the gospel; not a syllable about baptism,
          much less of Infant-baptism; nor can anything in favor of it be
          inferred from it;[5] nor can anything of this kind be proved from 1Cor
          7:14, real internal holiness is rejected by our author, as the sense
          of this and the preceding passage; but he pleads for a federal
          holiness; but what that is, as distinct from real holiness, let it be
          said if it can: the only holiness which the covenant of grace promises
          and provides for, and which only is proper federal holiness, is real
          holiness of heart and life:[6] no other than matrimonial holiness, or
          lawful marriage, can be meant in the Corinthian text; it is such a
          holiness with which the unbelieving parent is sanctified, husband or
          wife; and if it is a federal holiness, the unbeliever ought to be
          allowed to be in covenant; and if this gives a right to baptism, ought
          to be baptized, as well as their carnal issue; and have as good a
          right to it, surely, as they who have their holiness from them, and
          which even depends upon the sanctification of the unbelieving parent.
          I am able to prove, from innumerable instances in Jewish writings,
          that the words sanctify and sanctified, are used for espouse and
          espoused, and the apostle, being a Jew, adopts the same language; and
          let men wriggle and wrangle as long as they can, no other sense can be
          put upon the words, than of a legitimate marriage and offspring;
          nothing else will suit with the case proposed to the apostle, and with
          his answer and reasoning about it; and which sense has been allowed by
          many learned Paedobaptists; and I cannot forbear transcribing, what I
          have elsewhere done, the honest confession of Musculus: "Formerly,
          says he, I have abused this place against the Anabaptists, thinking
          the meaning was, that the children were holy for the parents faith,
          which, though true, the present place makes nothing for the
          purpose."[7]
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixthly, From what has been observed, it is not proved, as our author
          asserts (p. 32), that the apostles looked on the children of believing
          parents as having an interest in the covenant of grace; and false is
          it, to the last degree of falsehood, what he infers from thence, that
          "then we have undeniable evidence that "they did in fact baptize the
          children of all professing believers; and that they "understood their
          commission as authorizing them so to do" (Mat 28:19). Let one single
          fact be produced, one undeniable instance of the apostles baptizing an
          infant of any, professor or profane, and we will give up the cause at
          once, and say no more. Nor did the apostles, nor could the apostles
          understand the commission as authorizing them to baptize infants. What
          this Gentleman observes, that the word teach is in the original to
          make disciples, or learn: Be it so, it is not applicable to newborn
          babes, who are not capable of learning anything, and much less of
          divine and spiritual things, of Christ and his gospel, and the
          doctrines of it; of which kind of learning only can the commission be
          understood: nor are the children of believing parents called disciples
          (Acts 15:10), adult persons are meant; and by the yoke attempted to be
          put on their necks, not circumcision, which was not intolerable, but
          the doctrine of the necessity of that, and other Mosaic rites, and
          even of keeping the whole law in order to salvation; this was
          intolerable.
        </p>
        <p>
          This author further observes, that children must be included in the
          words all nations, mentioned in the commission. If they are included
          so as to be baptized, and if this phrase is to be understood without
          any limitation or restriction, then not only the children of Christian
          parents, but the children of Pagans, Jews, and Turks; yea, all adult
          persons, be they who they may, ever so vile and profligate, since
          these are included in all nations; but the limitation is to those that
          are taught, and learn to become the disciples of Christ, and believe
          in him, as appears from Mk 16:15-16.[8] Nor does it appear from the
          scripture-accounts, that there is any probability, and much less the
          highest probability, as this writer says (p. 33), that it was the
          general practice of the apostles to baptize infants, and which he
          concludes from Lydia, the Jailor, and Stephanas; which instances do
          not afford the least probability of it.[9] To make it probable that
          there might be infant-children in those families, he observes, we
          read, when God smote the first-born in Egypt, there was not an house
          in which there was not one dead, consequently not an house in Egypt in
          which there was not a child: but he did not consider, that all the
          first-born of Egypt slain, were not infant-children; but many of them
          might be men grown, of twenty, or thirty years of age, or more; and of
          these, with those under such an age, and in infancy, it is not strange
          that there should be found one in every house.[10] Our author adds,
          "suppose it had been said of one proselyted to the Jewish religion,
          that "he and his household, or that he and all his were circumcised,
          would any doubt "whether his infant-children were circumcised? I
          believe not:" and so do I too; but not for the reason given, which is
          a false one; for it never was a practice, either before or since
          Abraham's covenant, to receive children with their parents into a
          covenant-relation, if by that relation is meant relation to, and
          interest in the covenant of grace; but for this very good reason,
          because the Jews and their proselytes were commanded to circumcise
          their Infant-children; but God has no where commanded any to baptize
          their Infant-children; and therefore when households are said to be
          baptized, this cannot be understood of infants, and especially when
          those in these households are represented as hearers of the word,
          believers in it, and persons possessed of spiritual joy and comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventhly, The evidence this author gives of the practice of
          Infant-baptism, from those that lived in the first, second, and third
          centuries (pp. 34-40), comes next. He produces no evidence from any
          writer of the first century, though there are several whose writings
          are extant, as Barnabas, Clemens Remanus, Hermas, Polycarp, and
          Ignatius. He begins with Irenæus, as he is twice called; Irenaeus is
          meant, of whom he says, that he only mentions Infant-baptism
          transiently; but he does not mention it at all: it is not once
          mentioned in all his writings, as corrupted as they be; being some
          spurious, and for the most part translations, and these barbarous, and
          but few original pieces: the passage produced for his use, of the word
          regeneration for baptism, is not to the purpose; since by the command
          of regenerating, Christ gave to his disciples, is not meant the
          command of baptizing, but of teaching the doctrine of regeneration,
          and the necessity of it to salvation, and in order to baptism, the
          first and principal part of the commission of the apostles, as the
          order of the words shows. The other testimony which, he says, is plain
          for the baptism of infants, there is not a syllable of it in it:
          Irenaeus only says, "Christ came to save all; all I say, that "are
          born again unto God; infants, and little ones, and children, and young
          "men, and old men." Which is most true; for Christ came to save all of
          every age that are regenerated, and of which persons of every age are
          capable; but to interpret this of Christ's coming to save all that are
          baptized, is false; and is to make this ancient writer to speak an
          untruth: to prove that regeneration is used by him for baptism, a
          passage is produced out of Justin Martyr, said to be his contemporary,
          though Justin lived before him, in the middle of the second century,
          and should have been first mentioned; but will not serve his purpose:
          for Justin is speaking of the manner of adult-baptism, and not a word
          of infants; and of adult persons, not as regenerated by or in baptism;
          for he speaks of them before as converted and believers, and
          consequently regenerated; and their baptism is plainly distinguished
          from regeneration. Of the sense of the passages of these two writers,
          see more in the Reply, p. 16-18. The argument from apostolic Tradition
          (pp. 13, 14). Antipaedobaptism (pp. 9-20).
        </p>
        <p>
          The next testimony produced is Origen, placed in the beginning of the
          third century, though it was rather towards the middle of it that he
          wrote and flourished in, and should have been mentioned after
          Tertullian. The passages quoted from him are, the first out of his
          eighth homily on Leviticus, though the last clause in it does not
          belong to that, but is in the fourteenth homily on Luke, and the other
          is out of his epistle to the Romans: Now these are all taken out of
          Latin translations, full of interpolations, additions, and
          detractions; so that, as many learned men observe, "one knows not when
          he "reads Origen, and is at a loss to find Origen in Origen." Now
          whereas there are genuine works of his still extant in Greek in them
          there is not the least hint of Infant-baptism, nor any reference to
          it, much less any express mention of it, not even as an apostolical
          tradition, as in the last passage produced; for so it should be
          rendered, not order, but tradition; on which I shall just observe what
          Bishop Taylor says: "A tradition apostolical, if it be not consigned
          with a fuller testimony than of one person (Origen) whom all
          after-ages have condemned of many errors, will obtain so little
          reputation among those, who know that things have, upon greater
          authority, pretended to derive from the apostles, and yet falsely;
          that it will be a great argument, that he is credulous and weak, that
          shall be determined by so weak a probation in a matter of so great
          concernment."[11] Tertullian is the next writer quoted as giving plain
          proof that Infant-baptism was the constant practice of the church in
          his day: he is the first person known to have made any mention of it;
          who, as soon as he did, argued against it, and dissuaded from it; and
          though it will be owned, that it was moved in his day, and debated;
          yet that it was practiced, and much less constantly practiced, has not
          yet been proved.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next evidence produced is Cyprian, who lived in the middle of the
          third century; and it will be allowed that it was practiced in the
          African churches in his time, where it was first moved, and at the
          same time Infant-communion was practiced also; of the practice of
          which we have as early proof as of Infant-baptism; and this furnishes
          with an answer to this author's questions (p. 42). When Infant-baptism
          was introduced, and by whom? It was introduced at the time
          Infant-communion was, and by the same persons. As for the testimonies
          of Ambrose, Austin, and Pelagius, they might have been spared, since
          they wrote in the fourth century, when it is not denied that
          Infant-baptism very much prevailed; of Austin, and particularly of
          what Pelagius says, see Argument from apostolic tradition (pp. 19-26).
          Antipaedobaptism (pp. 33-37). And from hence it appears, that it is
          not true what this author suggests (pp. 42, 52), that infant-baptism
          was the universal practice of the primitive churches in the three
          first centuries, called the purest times; when it does not appear to
          have been practiced at all until the third century, when sad
          corruptions were made in doctrine and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eighthly, This author proposes to answer some of the most material
          objections against Infant-baptism (p. 43), etc. as,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. "That there is no express "command for it in scripture, and
          therefore unwarrantable." To which the answer is; that if there is no
          express command, there are virtual and implicit ones, which are of
          equal force with an express one, and no less than four are observed;
          one command is enough, this is over-doing it, and what is overdone is
          not well done: but let us hear them; the first is God's command to
          Abraham to circumcise his infant-children, which is a virtual and
          implicit command to believers to baptize theirs! The reason is,
          because they are Abraham's spiritual seed, and heirs according to the
          promise; but the command to Abraham only concerned his natural, not
          his spiritual seed; and if there is any force in the reason given, or
          the command lays any obligation on the latter, their duty is not to
          baptize, but circumcise their children; since the sacramental rite
          commanded, it seems, has never been repealed, and still remains in
          full force. The next virtual and implicit command is in Mat 19:14, but
          Christ's permission of children to come, or to be brought unto him,
          there spoken of, was not for baptism, or to be baptized by him, but
          for him to pray for them, and touch them, in order to cure them of
          diseases.[12] Another implicit, if not express command, to baptize
          infants, is in Mat 28:19. This has been considered, and disproved
          already; (see p. 99). The fourth and last implicit command, the author
          mentions, is the exhortation in his text, Acts 2:38-39, in which, as
          has been shown, there is not the least hint of Infant-baptism, nor
          anything from whence it can be concluded.
        </p>
        <p>
          This author observes, that since virtual and implicit commands are
          looked on as sufficient to determine our conduct in other things, then
          why not in this? such as keeping the first-day-sabbath, attendance on
          public worship, and the admission of women to the Lord's-Supper. To
          which I reply, he has not proved any virtual and implicit command to
          baptize infants; and as to the cases mentioned, besides implications,
          there are plain instances in scripture of the practice of them; and
          let like instances of Infant-baptism be produced, and we shall think
          ourselves obliged to practice it. As to what this author says of an
          express, irrepealable command to children, to receive the seal of the
          covenant, and the constant practice of the church to administer the
          seal of it to them; if by the covenant is meant the covenant of grace,
          it never had any such seal as is suggested, which has been proved; nor
          has it any but the blood of Christ, called the blood of the
          everlasting covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Another objection to Infant-baptism is; there is no express
          instance in all the history of the New-Testament of an Infant-child
          being baptized, and therefore is without any scripture-example. To
          which is replied, by observing that whole households were baptized; as
          there were, and which have been already considered; and these were
          baptized, not upon the conversion of the parent, or head of the
          family, but upon their own faith; and so were not infants, but adult
          persons; though this author thinks that such accounts would easily be
          understood to include children, had the same been said of
          circumcision. They might so, when circumcision was in force and use;
          for this very good reason, because there was a previous express
          command extant to circumcise children, when there is none to baptize
          infants. He further observes, that from there being no express mention
          of Infant-baptism in the New Testament, it should not be concluded
          there was none, anymore than that the churches of Antioch, Iconium, of
          the Romans, Galatians, Thessalonians and Colossians, were not
          baptized, because there is no express account of it in the history of
          the New Testament: but of several of those churches there is mention
          made of the baptism of the members of them, of the Romans, Galatians
          and Colossians (Rom6:3-4; Gal 3:27; Col 2:12), but what this author
          might imagine would press us hard, is to give a scripture-example of
          our own present practice. Our present practice, agreeable to
          scripture-examples, is not at all concerned with the parents of those
          baptized by us, whether believers or unbelievers, Christians or not
          Christians, Jews or Heathens, this comes not into consideration; it is
          only concerned with the persons themselves to be baptized, what they
          are. It seems, if we give a scripture-example of our practice, it must
          be of a person born and brought up of Christian or baptized parents,
          that was baptized in adult years; but our present practice is not
          limited to such persons. We baptize many whose parents we have no
          reason to believe are Christians, or are baptized persons; and be it
          that we baptize adult persons, who are born and brought up of
          Christian or baptized parents, a scripture-example of such a person
          might indeed be required of us with some plausible pretext, if the
          history of the Acts of the Apostles, which this writer says continued
          above thirty years, had given an account of the yearly or of frequent
          additions of members to the churches mentioned in it, during that
          space of time; whereas that history only gives an account of the first
          planting of those churches, and of the baptism of those of which they
          first consisted; wherefore to give instances of those that were born
          of them, and brought up by them as baptized in adult years, cannot be
          reasonably required of us: But, on the other hand, if Infant-children
          were admitted to baptism in those times, upon the faith and baptism of
          their parents, and their becoming Christians; it is strange! exceeding
          strange! that among the many thousands that were baptized in
          Jerusalem, Samaria, Corinth, and other places, that there should be no
          one instance of any of them bringing their children with them to be
          baptized, and claiming the privilege of baptism for them upon their
          own faith, or of their doing this in any short time after; this is a
          case that required no length of time; and yet not a single instance
          can be produced.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. A third objection is, that "infants can receive no benefit from
          baptism, "because of their incapacity; and therefore are not to be
          baptized." To which our author answers; that they are capable of being
          entered into covenant with God, of the seal of the covenant, of being
          cleansed by the blood of Christ, and of being regenerated by his
          Spirit: And be it so; what of all this! as I have observed in the
          Reply (p. 4). Are they capable of understanding the nature, design,
          and use of the ordinance of baptism? Are they capable of professing
          faith in Christ, which is a prerequisite to it, and of exercising it
          in it? Are they capable of answering a good conscience to God in it?
          Are they capable of submitting to it in obedience to the will of
          Christ, from love to him, and with a view to his glory? They are not:
          what benefit then can they receive by baptism? and to what purpose is
          it to be administered to them? If infants receive any advantage,
          benefit, or blessing by baptism, which our infants have not without
          it, let it be named, if it can; if none, why administered? why all
          this zeal and contention about it? A mere noise about nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A fourth and most common objection, it is said, is, that "faith and
          repentance, or a profession of them at least, are mentioned in the New
          Testament as the necessary prerequisites of baptism, of which children
          are incapable, and therefore of the ordinance itself." To this it is
          answered; that children are capable of the habit and principle of
          faith: which is not denied, nor is it in the objection; and it is
          granted by our author, that a profession of faith is a prerequisite to
          baptism in adult persons, who embrace Christianity; but when they have
          embraced it, and professed their faith, in the apostles times, not
          only themselves, but their households, and all that were theirs, were
          baptized. It is very true, those professing their faith also, as did
          the household of the Jailor, of whom it is said, that he was believing
          in God with all his house: His family believed as well as he, which
          could not have been known, had they not professed it. The instance of
          a professing stranger embracing the Jewish religion, in order to his
          circumcision, which, when done, it was always administered to his
          family and children, makes nothing to the purpose; since it is no rule
          of procedure to us, with respect to a gospel-ordinance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ninthly, The performance under consideration is concluded with
          observing many absurdities, and much confusion, with which the denial
          of Infant-baptism, as a divine institution, is attended. As,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is saying the covenant made with Abraham is not an everlasting
          one; that believers under the gospel are not Abraham's seed, and heirs
          of his promise; that the engrafted Gentiles do not partake of the same
          privileges in the church, from which the Jews were broken off; and
          that the privileges of the gospel-dispensation are less than those of
          the law: all which are said to be flat contradictions to scripture. To
          all which I reply, that the covenant of grace made with, and made
          known to Abraham, is an everlasting covenant, and is sure to all the
          seed; that is, the spiritual seed; and is not at all affected by
          Infant-baptism, that having no concern in it. The covenant of
          circumcision, though called an everlasting covenant (Gen 17:7), was
          only to continue unto the time of the Messiah; and is so called, just
          in the same sense, and for the same reason, the covenant of priesthood
          with Phineas has the same epithet (Num 25:13). Believers under the
          gospel are Abraham's spiritual seed, and heirs of the same promise of
          spiritual things; but these spiritual things, and the promise of them,
          do not belong to their natural seed as such; the believing Gentiles,
          engrafted into the gospel church-state, partake of all the privileges
          of it, from which the unbelieving Jews are excluded, being for their
          unbelief left out of that state. The privileges of the
          gospel-dispensation are not less, yea far greater than those of the
          law; to believers, who are freed from the burdensome rites and
          ceremonies of the law, have larger measures of grace, a clearer
          ministration of the gospel, and more spiritual ordinances; nor are
          they less to their infants, who are eased from the painful rite of
          circumcision, have the advantage of a Christian education, and of
          hearing the gospel as they grow up, in a clearer manner than under the
          law; which are greater privileges than the Jewish children had under
          the former dispensation; nor are all, nor any of these affected, or to
          be contradicted, by the denial of Infant-baptism.

          2. It is observed, that to deny the validity of Infant-baptism, is
          saying that "there was no true baptism in the church for eleven or
          twelve hundred years after Christ; and that the generality of the
          present professors of Christianity "are now a company of unbaptized
          heathens" (p. 52, so p. 10). To which I reply, that the true baptism
          continued in the church in the first two centuries; and though
          Infant-baptism was introduced in the third, and prevailed in the
          fourth, yet in both these centuries there were those that opposed it,
          and abode by the true baptism. Besides, in the valleys of Piedmont, as
          many learned men have observed, there were witnesses from the times of
          the apostles, who bore their testimony against corruptions in doctrine
          and practice, and among whom Infant-baptism did not obtain until the
          sixteenth century; so that the true baptism continued in the church
          till that time, and it has ever since; (see the Reply, pp. 31, 32). As
          for the generality of the present professors of Christianity, it lies
          upon them to take care of their character, and remove from it what may
          be thought disagreeable; and clear themselves of it, by submitting to
          the true baptism according to the order of the gospel. As to the
          salvation of persons in or out of the visible church, which is the
          greater number, this author speaks of, I know nothing of; salvation is
          not by baptism in any way, but by Christ alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is said, if Infant-baptism is a divine institution, warranted by
          the word of God, then they that are baptized in their adult age
          necessarily renounce a divine institution, and an ordinance of Jesus
          Christ, and vacate the former covenant between God and them. If it be;
          but it is not a divine institution, nor an ordinance of Jesus Christ,
          as appears from all that has been said about it in the foregoing
          pages; wherefore it is right to renounce and reject it, as an human
          invention: and as for any covenant between God and them vacated
          thereby, it will not, it need not give the renouncers of it any
          concern; being what they know nothing of, and the whole a chimerical
          business. Nay, it is farther observed, that renouncing Infant-baptism,
          and making it a nullity, is practically saying there are no baptized
          persons, no regular ministers, nor ordinances, in all professing
          churches but their own, and as elsewhere (p. 41), no gospel-church in
          the world; and that the administrations of the ministers of other
          churches are a nullity, and the promise of Christ to be with his
          ministers in the administration of this ordinance to the end of the
          world, must have failed for hundreds of years, in which Infant-baptism
          was practiced. But be it so: to whom is all this owing? to whose
          account must it be put? to those who are the corrupters of the word
          and ordinances. Is it suggested by all this, that "God "in his
          providence would never suffer things to go such lengths?" Let it be
          observed, that he has given us in his word reason to expect great
          corruptions in doctrine and worship; and that though he will always
          have a seed to serve him, more or fewer, in all ages, yet he has no
          where promised that these shall be always in a regular
          gospel-church-state; and though he has promised his presence in his
          ordinances to the end of the world, it is only with those ministers
          and people among whom the ordinances are administered according to his
          word; and there was for some hundreds of years, in the darkness of
          popery, such a corruption in the ordinances of baptism, and the Lord's
          supper, in the administration of which the presence of God cannot be
          thought to be; nor were there any regular ministers, nor regular
          ordinances, nor a regular gospel-church, but what were to be found in
          the valleys of Piedmont; and with whom the presence of God may be
          supposed to be; who bore a testimony against all corruptions, and
          among the rest, against Infant-baptism.[13]
        </p>
        <p>
          This writer further urges, that "if Infant-baptism is a nullity, there
          can be now no regular baptism in the world, nor ever will be to the
          end of it; and so the ordinance must be lost, since adult baptism
          cannot be traced to the apostles times, and as now administered, is
          derived from those that were baptized in infancy; wherefore if
          Infant-baptism is invalid, that must be so too" (so in p. 42)." To
          which it may be answered, that the first English Antipaedobaptists,
          when determined upon a reformation in this ordinance, in a
          consultation of theirs about it, had this difficulty started about a
          proper administrator to begin the work, when it was proposed to send
          some to foreign churches, the successors of the ancient Waldenses in
          France and Germany; and accordingly did send some, who being baptized,
          returned and baptized others: though others were of opinion this too
          much favored of the popish notion of an uninterrupted succession, and
          a right through that to administer ordinances; and therefore judged,
          that in an extraordinary case, as this was, to begin a reformation
          from a general corruption, where a baptized administrator could not be
          had, it might be begun by one unbaptized, otherwise qualified to
          preach the word and ordinances; which practice they were able to
          justify upon the same principles the other reformers justified theirs;
          who without any regard to an uninterrupted succession, let up new
          churches, ordained pastors, and administered ordinances. Nor is it
          essential to the ordinance of baptism, that it be performed by one
          regularly baptized, though in ordinary cases it should; or otherwise
          it could never have been introduced into the world; the first
          administrator of it must be an unbaptized person, as John the Baptist
          was. All which is a sufficient answer to what this writer has advanced
          on this subject.[14]
