        <h2>A Public Ordinance of Divine Worship</h2>
        <p>
          As the first covenant, or testament, had ordinances of divine service,
          which are shaken, removed, and abolished; so the New Testament, or
          gospel dispensation, has ordinances of divine worship, which cannot be
          shaken, but will remain until the second coming of Christ: these, as
          Austin says,[1] are few; and easy to be observed, and of a very
          expressive signification. Among which, baptism must be reckoned one,
          and is proper to be treated of in the first place; for though it is
          not a church ordinance, it is an ordinance of God, and a part and
          branch of public worship. When I say it is not a church ordinance, I
          mean it is not an ordinance administered in the church, but out of it,
          and in order to admission into it, and communion with it; it is
          preparatory to it, and a qualification for it; it does not make a
          person a member of a church, or admit him into a visible church;
          persons must first be baptized, and then added to the church, as the
          three thousand converts were; a church has nothing to do with the
          baptism of any, but to be satisfied they are baptized before they are
          admitted into communion with it. Admission to baptism lies solely in
          the breast of the administrator, who is the only judge of
          qualifications for it, and has the sole power of receiving to it, and
          of rejecting from it; if nor satisfied, he may reject a person thought
          fit by a church, and admit a person to baptism not thought fit by a
          church; but a disagreement is not desirable nor advisable: the
          orderly, regular, scriptural rule of proceeding seems to be this: a
          person inclined to submit to baptism, and to join in communion with a
          church, should first apply to an administrator; and upon giving him
          satisfaction, be baptized by him; and then should propose to the
          church for communion; when he would be able to answer all proper
          questions: if asked, to give a reason of the hope that is in him, he
          is ready to do it; if a testimony of his life and conversation is
          required, if none present can give it, he can direct where it is to be
          had; and if the question is put to him, whether he is a baptized
          person or not, he can answer in the affirmative, and give proof of it,
          and so the way is clear for his admission into church fellowship. So
          Saul, when converted, was immediately baptized by Ananias, without any
          previous knowledge and consent of the church; and, it was many days
          after this that he proposed to join himself to the disciples, and was
          received (Acts 9:18-19; Acts 9:23; Acts 9:26-28), and as it is water
          baptism which is meant, I shall,
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, prove that this is peculiar to the gospel dispensation, is a
          standing ordinance in it, and will be continued to the second coming
          of Christ. This is opposed to the sentiments of such who say baptism
          was in use before the times of John, of Christ and his apostles; and
          of such who restrain water baptism to the interval between the
          beginning of John’s ministry and the death of Christ, when they
          supposed this, with other external rites, ceased; and of such, as the
          Socinians,[2] who think that only the first converts to Christianity
          in a nation are to be baptized, and their children, but not their
          after posterity. There were indeed various washings, bathings, or
          baptisms, under the legal dispensation, for the purification of
          persons and things unclean, by the ceremonial law; which had a
          doctrine in them, called the doctrine of baptists, which taught the
          cleansing of sin by the blood of Christ; but there was nothing similar
          in them to the ordinance of water baptism, but immersion only. The
          Jews pretend, their ancestors were received into covenant by baptism,
          or dipping, as well as by circumcision and sacrifice; and that
          proselytes from heathenism were received the same way; and this is
          greedily grasped at by the advocates for infant baptism; who fancy
          that John, Christ, and his apostles, took up this custom as they found
          it, and continued it; and which they imagine accounts for the silence
          about it in the New Testament, and why there is neither precept for
          it, nor example of it; but surely if it was in such common use as
          pretended, though no new precept had been given, there would have been
          precedents enough of it; but no proof is to be given of any such
          practice obtaining in those times, neither from the Old nor New
          Testament; nor from the apocryphal books written by Jews between them;
          nor from Josephus and Philo the Jew, who wrote a little after the
          times of John and Christ; nor from the Jewish Misnah, or book of
          traditions: only from later writings of theirs, too late for the proof
          of it before those times.[3] John was the first administrator of the
          ordinance of baptism, and therefore is called "the Baptist" (Mat 3:1),
          by way of emphasis; whereas, had it been in common use, there must
          have been many baptizers before him, who had a like claim to this
          title; and why should the people be so alarmed with it, as to come
          from all parts to see it administered, and to hear it preached, when,
          had it been in frequent use, they must have often seen it? and why
          should the Jewish Sanhedrim send priests and Levites from Jerusalem to
          John, to know who he was, whether the Messiah, or his forerunner
          Elias, or that prophet spoken of and expected? and when he confessed,
          and denied that he was neither of them, they say to him, "Why
          baptizest thou then?" by which thing and which they expected it
          appears it was a new thing, and which they expected when the Messiah
          came, but not before; and that then it would be performed by some
          great personage, one or other of the before mentioned; whereas, had it
          been performed by an ordinary teacher, common Rabbi or doctor, priest
          or Levite, in ages immemorial, there could have been no room for such
          a question; and had this been the case, there would have been no
          difficulty with the Jews to answer the question of our Lord; "The
          baptism of John, whence was it, from heaven or of men?" they could
          have answered, It was a tradition of theirs, a custom in use among
          them time out of mind, had this been the known case; nor would they
          have been subject to any dilemma: but John’s baptism was not a device
          of men; but the "counsel of God", according to his will and wise
          determination (Lk 7:30). John had a mission and commission from God,
          he was a man sent of God, and sent to baptize (Jn 1:6; Jn 1:33), and
          his baptism was water baptism, this he affirms, and the places he made
          use of for that purpose show it, and none will deny it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now his baptism, and that of Christ and his apostles, were the same.
          Christ was baptized by John, and his baptism was surely Christian
          baptism; of this no one can doubt (Mat 3:13-17), and his disciples
          also were baptized by him; for by whom else could they be baptized?
          not by Christ himself, for he baptized none (Jn 4:2). And it is
          observable, that the baptism of John, and the baptism of Christ and
          his apostles, were at the same time; they were contemporary, and did
          not the one succeed the other: now it is not reasonable to suppose
          there should be two sorts of baptism administered at the same time;
          but one and the same by both (Jn 3:22-23; Jn 3:26; Jn 4:1-2). The
          baptism of John, and that which was practiced by the apostles of
          Christ, even after his death and resurrection from the dead, agreed,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the subjects thereof. Those whom John baptized were sensible
          penitent sinners, who were convinced of their sins, and made an
          ingenuous confession of them; and of whom he required "fruits meet for
          repentance", and which showed it to be genuine; and hence his baptism
          is called, "the baptism of repentance", because he required it
          previous to it (Mat 3:6-8; Mk 1:4). So the apostles of Christ exhorted
          men to repent, to profess their repentance, and give evidence of it,
          previous to their baptism (Acts 2:38). John said to the people that
          came to his baptism, "That they should believe on him which should
          come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus", upon which they were
          baptized in his name (Acts 19:4-5), faith in Christ was made a
          prerequisite to baptism by Christ and his apostles (Mk 16:16; Acts
          8:36-37).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the way and manner of the administration of both. John’s baptism
          was by immersion, as the places chosen by him for it show; and the
          baptism of Christ by him is a proof of it (Mat 3:6; Mat 3:16; Jn
          3:23), and in like manner was baptism performed by the apostles, as of
          the eunuch by Philip (Acts 8:38-39).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In the form of their administration. John was sent of God to
          baptize; and in whose name should he baptize, but in the name of the
          one true God, who sent him, even in the name of God, Father, Son, and
          Spirit? The doctrine of the Trinity was known to John, as it was to
          the Jews in common; it is said of John’s hearers and disciples, that
          they were "baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus" (Acts 19:5). The
          same form is used of the baptism of those baptized by the apostles of
          Christ (Acts 8:16; Acts 10:48), which is only a part of the form put
          for the whole, and is sufficiently expressive of Christian baptism,
          which is to be performed "in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
          and of the Holy Ghost" (Mat 28:19).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. In the end and use of baptism, John’s baptism, and so the apostles
          was, upon repentance for the remission of sins (Mk 1:4; Acts 8:38),
          not that either repentance or baptism procure the pardon of sin; that
          is only obtained by the blood of Christ; but baptism is a means of
          leading to the blood of Christ; and repentance gives encouragement to
          hope for it, through it. Now since there is such an agreement between
          the baptism of John, as administered before the death of Christ; and
          between the baptism of the apostles, after the death, resurrection,
          and ascension of Christ; it is a plain case, it was not limited to the
          interval of time from the beginning of John’s ministry to the death of
          Christ; but was afterwards continued; which further appears from the
          commission of Christ (Mat 28:19), "Go ye therefore, and teach all
          nations, baptizing them"; and though water is not expressed, it is
          always implied, when the act of baptizing is ascribed to men; for it
          is peculiar to Christ to baptize with the Holy Spirit (Mat 3:11; Acts
          1:5), nor did he give to his apostles, nor to any man, or set of men,
          a commission and power to baptize with the Spirit: besides, an
          increase of the graces of the Spirit, and a large donation of his
          gifts, are promised to persons after baptism, and as distinct from it
          (Acts 2:38). The apostles, doubtless, understood the commission of
          their Lord and Master to baptize in water, since they practiced it
          upon it; such was the baptism administered by Philip, who, having
          taught the eunuch the doctrine of it, when they came to a "certain
          water", he said to him, "See, here is water, what doth hinder me to be
          baptized?" that is, in water; and when Philip had observed unto him
          the grand requisite of it, even faith in Christ, which he at once
          professed; and the chariot in which they rode being ordered to stand,
          theft went down both into the water, and he baptized him; this was
          most certainly water baptism; and so was that which Peter ordered to
          be administered to Cornelius and his friends, upon their receiving of
          the Holy Ghost, and so a baptism different from that; "Can any man
          forbid water, that these should not be baptized?" (Acts 8:36; Acts
          8:38-39; Acts 10:47-48). And this was designed to be continued unto
          the end of the world, to the second coming of Christ; as the ordinance
          of the supper is to be kept to that time, the ordinance of water
          baptism is to be continued as long; hence says Christ, to encourage
          his ministers to preach his gospel, and to baptize in his name; "Lo, I
          am with you always", in the ministry of the word, and in the
          administration of baptism, "even unto the end of the world" (Mat
          28:19-20).
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Secondly, I shall next consider the author of it; and show, that
          it is not a device of men, but an ordinance of God; it is a solemn
          part of divine worship, being performed in the name of the Three
          divine Persons in Deity, Father, Son, and Spirit, and by their
          authority; in which the name of God is invoked, faith in him
          expressed, and a man gives up himself to God, obliges himself to yield
          obedience to him, expecting all good things from him. Now for an act
          of religious worship there must be a command of God. God is a jealous
          God, and will not suffer anything to be admitted into the worship of
          him, but what is according to his word and will; if not commanded by
          him, he may justly say, "Who hath required this at your hands?" and
          will resent it: a command from men is not sufficient; no man on earth
          is to be called master; one is our Master in heaven, and him only we
          are to obey: if the commandments of men are taught for doctrines, in
          vain is the Lord worshipped; what is done according to them is
          superstition and will worship. Indeed, as it is now commonly
          practiced, it is a mere invention of men, the whole of it corrupted
          and changed; instead of rational spiritual men the subjects of it,
          infants, who have neither the use of reason, nor the exercise of
          grace, are admitted to it; and instead of immersion in water, and
          immersion out of it, a very expressive emblem of the sufferings of
          Christ, his death, burial, and resurrection from the dead; sprinkling
          a few drops of water on the face is introduced; with a number of
          foolish rites and ceremonies used by the papists, and some of their
          usages are retained by some Protestants; as sponsors, or sureties for
          infants, and the signing them with the sign of the cross. In short,
          the face of the ordinance is so altered, that if the apostles were to
          rise from the dead, and see it as now performed, they would neither
          know nor own it to be the ordinance commanded them by Christ, and
          practiced by them. But as it is administered according to the pattern,
          and as first delivered, it appears to be of an heavenly original; the
          "counsel of God", a wise appointment of his, and in which all the
          Three Persons have a concern; they all appeared at the baptism of
          Christ, and gave a sanction to the ordinance by their presence; the
          Father by a voice from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in
          whom I am well pleased!" as in his person, so in this act of his, in
          submitting to the ordinance of baptism; the Son in human nature,
          yielding obedience to it; and the Spirit descending on him as a dove;
          and it is ordered to be administered in the name of all three, Father,
          Son, and Spirit. Which, among other things, is expressive of divine
          authority, under which it is performed. Christ received from God the
          Father honor and glory, as at his transfiguration, so at his baptism,
          by the voice from heaven, owning his relation to him, as his Son, and
          expressing his well pleasedness in him, as obedient to his will; the
          Son of God, in human nature, not only left an example of it, that we
          should tread in his steps; though he himself baptized none, yet he
          countenanced it in his disciples, and gave them orders to do it; which
          orders were repeated, and a fresh commission given for the same after
          his resurrection from the dead: and the Spirit of God showed his
          approbation of it, by his descent on Christ at his baptism; and his
          authority for it is to be seen in the administration of it in his
          name, as in the name of the other Two Persons; so that it is to be
          regarded, not as an institution of men, but as an ordinance of God; as
          a part of righteousness to be fulfilled, a branch of the righteous
          will of God, to be observed in obedience to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, the subjects of baptism are next to be inquired into; or
          who they are to whom it is to be administered, and according to the
          scripture instances and examples, they are such who,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Are enlightened by the Spirit of God to see their lost state by
          nature, the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and Christ as the only
          Saviour of sinners; who look to him and are saved; and such only can
          see to the end of the ordinance, which is to represent the sufferings
          and death, burial and resurrection of Christ; hence baptism was by the
          ancients; called fwtismov, "illumination"; and baptized persons
          fwtizomenoi, "enlightened" ones; and the Syriac and. Ethiopic,
          versions of Heb 6:4 translate the word "enlightened" by baptized; an
          emblem of this was the falling off from the eyes of Saul, as it had
          been scales; signifying his former blindness, and ignorance, and
          unbelief, now removed; upon which he arose and was baptized (Acts
          9:18).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Penitent persons; such who having seen the evil nature of sin,
          repent of it, and acknowledge it; such were the first who were
          baptized by John that we read of; they were "baptized of him in
          Jordan, confessing their sins" (Mat 3:6), being made sensible of them,
          they ingenuously confessed them; and such were the first who were
          baptized after Christ had renewed the commission to his disciples,
          upon his resurrection, to teach and: baptize; such as were pricked to
          the heart, were exhorted to profess repentance and give evidence of
          it, and then be baptized, as they were (Acts 2:37-38; Acts 2:41), and
          it is pity that these first examples of baptism were not strictly
          followed.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Faith in Christ is a prerequisite to baptism (Mk 16:16), this is
          clear from the case of the eunuch, desiring baptism, to whom Philip
          said, "If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest"; by which
          it seems, that if he did not believe, he had no right to the
          ordinance; but if he did, he had; upon which he professed his faith in
          Christ; and upon that profession was baptized (Acts 8:36), and the
          various instances of baptism recorded in scripture, confirm the same;
          as of the inhabitants of Samaria, who, upon believing in Christ, "were
          baptized, both men and women"; so the Corinthians, "hearing" the word
          preached by the apostle Paul, "believed" in Christ, whom he preached,
          "and were baptized", upon their faith in him (Acts 8:12; Acts 18:8),
          and without faith it is impossible to please God in any ordinance or
          part of worship; and what is not of faith is sin; and without it no
          one can see to the end of the ordinance of baptism, as before
          observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Such who are taught and made disciples by teaching, are the proper
          subjects of baptism, agreeable both to the practice of Christ and his
          commission; it is said, "that Jesus made and baptized more disciples
          than John" (Jn 4:1), he first made them disciples, and then baptized
          them, that is, ordered his apostles to baptize them; and so runs his
          commission to them, "Go teach all nations, baptizing them", that is,
          those that are taught, and so made disciples; and they are the
          disciples of Christ, who have learnt to know him, and are taught to
          deny sinful, righteous, and civil self, for his sake, and to take up
          the cross and follow him.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Such who have received the Spirit of God, as a Spirit of
          illumination and conviction, of sanctification and faith, as the
          persons before described may well be thought to have, should be
          admitted to baptism (Acts 10:47; see Gal 3:2), from all which it
          appears, that such who are ignorant of divine things, impenitent,
          unbelievers, not disciples and followers of Christ, and who are
          destitute of the Spirit, are not proper subjects of baptism, let their
          pretences to birthright be what they may; and so not the infants of
          any, be they born of whom they may; and to whom the above characters,
          descriptive of the subjects of baptism, do by no means belong: with
          respect to their first birth, though born of believing parents, they
          are carnal and corrupt, and children of wrath, as others; "That which
          is born of the flesh is flesh"; and they must be born again, or they
          cannot see, possess, and enjoy the kingdom of God, or have a right to
          be admitted into the church of God now, nor will they enter into the
          kingdom of God, into heaven hereafter, unless born again; their first
          and carnal birth neither entitles them to the kingdom of God on earth,
          nor to the kingdom of God in heaven, be it taken in either sense; for
          the baptism of such there is neither precept nor precedent in the word
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) First, there is no precept for it; not the words of Christ in Mat
          19:14, "But Jesus said, Suffer little children", etc. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Let the words be said to or of whom they may, they are not in the
          form of a precept, but of a permission or grant, and signify not what
          was enjoined as necessary, but what was allowed of, or which might be;
          "Suffer little children", etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. These children do not appear to be newborn babes. The words used by
          the evangelists, neither paidia nor brefh, do not always signify such;
          but are sometimes used or such who are capable of going alone, and of
          being instructed, and of understanding the scriptures, and even of one
          of twelve years of age (Mat 18:2; 2 Tim 3:15; Mk 5:39; Mk 5:42). Nor
          is it probable that children just born should be had abroad; besides,
          these were such as Christ called unto him (Lk 18:16), and were capable
          of coming to him of themselves, as is supposed in the words
          themselves; nor is their being brought unto him, nor his taking them
          in his arms, any objection to this, since the same are said of such
          who could walk of themselves (Mat 12:22; Mat 17:16; Mk 9:36).
        </p>
        <p>
          c. It cannot be said whose children these were; whether they belonged
          to those who brought them, or to others; and whether the children of
          believers, and of baptized persons, or not; and if of unbelievers, and
          of unbaptized persons, the Paedobaptists themselves will not allow
          such children to be baptized.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. It is certain they were not brought to Christ to be baptized by
          him, but for other purposes; the evangelist Matthew (Mat 19:13; Mat
          19:15), says, they were brought to him that he "should put his hands
          upon them, and pray", as he did, that is, for a blessing on them; as
          it was usual with the Jews to do (Gen 48:14-15). The evangelists Mark
          and Luke say, they were brought to him, "that he would touch them", as
          he did when he healed persons of diseases; and probably these children
          were diseased, and were brought to him to be cured; however, they were
          not brought to be baptized by Christ; for Christ baptized none at all,
          adult or infants; had they that brought them this in view, they would
          have brought them to the disciples of Christ, and not to Christ, whom
          they might have seen administering the ordinance of baptism, but not
          Christ: however, it is certain they were not baptized by Christ, since
          he never baptized any.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. This passage rather concludes against Paedobaptism than for it, and
          shows that this practice had not obtained among the Jews, and had not
          been used by John, by Christ, and his disciples; for then the apostles
          would scarcely have forbid the bringing of these children, since they
          might readily suppose they were brought to be baptized; but knowing of
          no such usage in the nation, whether of them that did or did not
          believe in Christ, they forbade them; and Christ’s silence about this
          matter, when he had such an opportunity of speaking of it to his
          disciples, and enjoining it, had it been his will, does not look very
          favorably upon this practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          f. The reason given for suffering little children to come to Christ,
          "for of such is the kingdom of heaven", is to be understood in a
          figurative and metaphorical sense; of such who are comparable to
          children for modesty, meekness, and humility, and for freedom from
          rancor, malice, ambition, and pride (see Mat 18:2); and which sense is
          given into by Origen,[4] among the ancients, and by Calvin and
          Brugensis, among the moderns. Nor does the commission in Mat 28:19
          contain in it any precept for infant baptism; "Go, teach all nations,
          baptizing them", etc. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          (a.) The baptism of all nations is not here commanded; but the baptism
          only of such who are taught; for the antecedent to the relative
          "them", cannot be "all nations"; since the words panta ta eynh, "all
          nations", are of the neuter gender; whereas autouv, "them", is of the
          masculine; but mayeutav, disciples, is supposed and understood in the
          word mayhteusate, "teach", or "make disciples"; now the command is,
          that such who are first taught or made disciples by teaching under the
          ministry of the word, by the Spirit of God succeeding it, should be
          baptized.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b.) If infants, as a part of all nations, and because they are such,
          are to be baptized, then the infants of Heathens, Turks, and Jews,
          ought to be baptized, since they are a part, and a large part, of all
          nations; as well as the children of Christians, or believers, which
          are but a small part; yea, every individual person in the world ought
          to be baptized, all adult persons, heathens as well as Christians;
          even the most profligate and abandoned of mankind, since they are a
          part of all nations.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c.) Disciples of Christ, and such who have learned to know Christ,
          and the way of salvation by him, and to know themselves, and their
          need of him, are characters that cannot agree with infants; and if
          disciples and learners are the same, as is said, they must be learners
          or they cannot be disciples; and they cannot be learners of Christ
          unless they have learnt something of him; and according to this notion
          of disciples and learners, they ought to learn something of him before
          they are baptized in his name; but what can an infant be taught to
          learn of Christ? to prove infants disciples that text is usually
          brought (Acts 15:10), which falls greatly short of proving it; for
          infants are not designed in that place, nor included in the character;
          for though the Judaizing teachers would have had the Gentiles, and
          their infants too, circumcised; yet it was not circumcision, the thing
          itself, which is meant by the intolerable yoke; for that was what the
          Jewish fathers, and their children, were able to bear, and had bore in
          ages past; but it was the doctrine of the necessity of that, and other
          rites of Moses, to salvation; and obliged to the keeping of the whole
          law, and was in tolerable; and which doctrine could not be imposed
          upon infants, but upon adult persons only.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d.) These two acts, teaching, or making disciples, and baptizing, are
          not to be confounded, but are two distinct acts, and the one is
          previous and absolutely necessary to the other: Men must first be made
          disciples, and then baptized; so Jerom[5] long ago understood the
          commission; on which he observes, "First they teach all nations, then
          dip those that are taught in water; for it cannot be that the body
          should receive the sacrament of baptism, unless the soul has before
          received the truth of faith." And so says Athanasius,[6] "Wherefore
          the Saviour does not simply command to baptize; but first says, teach,
          and then baptize thus, "In the name of the Father, nd of the Son, and
          of the Holy Ghost"; that faith might come of teaching, and baptism be
          perfected."
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Secondly, there is no precedent for the baptism of infants in the
          word of God. Among the vast numbers who flocked to John’s baptism from
          all parts, we read of no infants that were brought with them for that
          purpose, or that were baptized by him. And though more were baptized
          by Christ than by John, that is, the apostles of Christ, at his order,
          yet no mention of any infant baptized by them; and though three
          thousand persons were baptized at once, yet not an infant among them:
          and in all the accounts of baptism in the Acts of the Apostles in
          different parts of the world, not a single instance of infant baptism
          is given. There is, indeed, mention made of households, or families,
          baptized; and which the "paedobaptists" endeavor to avail themselves
          of; but they ought to be sure there were infants in these families,
          and that they were baptized, or else they must baptize them on a very
          precarious foundation; since there are families who have no infants in
          them, and how can they be sure there were any in these the scriptures
          speak of? and it lies upon them to prove there were infants in them,
          and that these infants were baptized; or the allegation of these
          instances is to no purpose. We are able to prove there are many things
          in the account of these families, which are inconsistent with infants,
          and which make it at least probable there were none in them, and which
          also make it certain that those who were baptized were adult persons
          and believers in Christ. There are but three families, if so many, who
          are usually instanced in: the first is that of Lydia and her household
          (Acts 16:14-15), but in what state of life she was is not certain,
          whether single or married, whether maid widow or wife; and if married,
          whether she then had any children, or ever had any; and if she had,
          and they living, whether they were infants or adult; and if infants,
          it does not seem probable that she should bring them along with her
          from her native place, Thyatira to Philippi, where she seems to have
          been upon business, and so had hired a house during her stay there;
          wherefore her household seems to have consisted of menial servants she
          brought along with her, to assist her in her business: and certain it
          is, that those the apostles found in her house, when they entered into
          it, after they came out of prison, were such as are called "brethren",
          and were capable of being "comforted" by them; which supposes them to
          have been in some distress and trouble, and needed comfort. The second
          instance is of the jailor and his household, which consisted of adult
          persons, and of such only; for the apostles spoke the word of the Lord
          to "all" that were in his house, which they were capable of hearing,
          and it seems of understanding; for not only he "rejoiced" at the good
          news of salvation by Christ, but "all" in his house hearing it,
          rejoiced likewise; which joy of theirs was the joy of faith; for he
          and they were believers in God, Father, Son, and Spirit; for it is
          expressly said, that he "rejoiced, believing in God with all his
          house"; so that they were not only hearers of the word, but rejoiced
          at it, and believed in it, and in God the Saviour, revealed in it to
          them (Acts 16:32-34), all which shows them to be adult persons, and
          not infants. The third instance, if distinct from the household of the
          jailor, which some take to be the same, is that of Stephanus; but be
          it a different one, it is certain it consisted of adult persons,
          believers in Christ, and very useful in the service of religion; they
          were the first fruits of Achaia, the first converts in those parts,
          and who "addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints" (1Cor
          16:15), which, whether understood of the ministry of the word to the
          saints, which they gave themselves up unto; or of the ministration of
          their substance to the poor, which they cheerfully communicated, they
          must be adult persons, and not infants. There being then neither
          precept nor precedent in the word of God for infant baptism, it may be
          justly condemned as unscriptural and unwarrantable.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Thirdly, nor is infant baptism to be concluded from any things or
          passages recorded either in the Old or in the New Testament. Baptism
          being an ordinance peculiar to the New Testament, it cannot be
          expected there should be any directions about the observance of it in
          the Old Testament; and whatever may be gathered relative to it, from
          typical and figurative baptisms, under the former dispensation, there
          is nothing from thence in favor of infant baptism, and to countenance
          that; and yet we are often referred thereunto for the original and
          foundation of it, but to no purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. It is not fact, as has been asserted,[7] that the "infants of
          believers" have, with their parents, been taken into covenant with God
          in the former ages of the church, if by it is meant the covenant of
          grace; the first covenant made with man, was that of works, made with
          Adam, and which indeed included all his posterity, to whom he stood as
          a federal head, as no one ever since did to his natural offspring; in
          whom they all sinned, were condemned, and died; which surely cannot be
          pleaded in favor of the infants of believers! after the fall, the
          covenant of grace, and the way of life and salvation by Christ, were
          revealed to Adam and Eve, personally, as interested therein; but not
          to their natural seed and posterity, and as interested therein; for
          then all mankind must be taken into the covenant of grace, and so
          nothing peculiar to the infants of believers; of which not the least
          syllable is mentioned throughout the whole age of the church, reaching
          from Adam to Noah. The next covenant we read of, is that made with
          Noah, which was not made with him and his immediate offspring only;
          nor were any taken into it as infants of believers, nor had they any
          sacrament or rite as a token of it, and of God being their God in a
          peculiar relation. Surely this will not be said of Ham, one of the
          immediate sons of Noah. That covenant was made with Noah, and with all
          mankind to the end of the world, and even with every living creature,
          the beasts of the field, promising security from an universal deluge,
          as long as the world should stand; and so had nothing in it peculiar
          to the infants of believers. The next covenant is that made with
          Abraham and his seed, on which great stress is laid (Gen 17:10-14),
          and this is said[8] to be "the grand turning point on which the issue
          of the controversy very much depends; and that if Abraham’s covenant,
          which included his infant children, and gave them a right to
          circumcision, was not the covenant of grace; then it is confessed,
          that the "main ground" is taken away, on which "the right of infants
          to baptism" is asserted; and consequently the principal arguments in
          support of the doctrine are overturned." Now that this covenant was
          not the pure covenant of grace, in distinction from the covenant of
          works, but rather a covenant of works, will soon be proved; and if so,
          then the main ground of infant’s baptism is taken away, and its
          principal arguments in support of it overturned: and that it is not
          the covenant of grace is clear,
        </p>
        <p>
          (a.) From its being never so called, nor by any name which shows it to
          be such; but "the covenant of circumcision" (Acts 7:8). Now nothing is
          more opposite to one another than circumcision and grace; circumcision
          is a work of the law, which they that sought to be justified by fell
          from grace (Gal 5:2-4). Nor can this covenant be the same we are now
          under, which is a new covenant, or a new administration of the
          covenant of grace, since it is abolished, and no more in being and
          force.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b.) It appears to be a covenant of works, and not of grace; since it
          was to be kept by men, under a severe penalty. Abraham was to keep it,
          and his seed after him; something was to be done by them, their flesh
          to be circumcised, and a penalty was annexed, in case of disobedience
          or neglect; such a soul was to be cut off from his people: all which
          shows it to be, not a covenant of grace, but of works.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c.) It is plain, it was a covenant that might be broken; of the
          uncircumcised it is said, "He hath broken my covenant" (Gen 17:14),
          whereas the covenant of grace cannot be broken; God will not break it,
          and men cannot; it is ordered in all things, and sure, and is more
          immovable than hills and mountains (Ps 89:34).
        </p>
        <p>
          (d.) It is certain it had things in it of a civil and temporal nature;
          as a multiplication of Abraham’s natural seed, and a race of kings
          from him; a promise of his being the Father of many nations, and a
          possession of the land of Canaan by his seed: things that can have no
          place in the pure covenant of grace and have nothing to do with that,
          any more than the change of his name from Abram to Abraham.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e.) There were some persons included in it, who cannot be thought to
          belong to the covenant of grace; as Ishmael, not in the same covenant
          with Isaac, and a profane Esau: and on the other hand, there were some
          who were living when this covenant of circumcision was made, and yet
          were left out of it; who nevertheless, undoubtedly, were in the
          covenant of grace; as Shem, Arphaxad, Melchizedek, Lot, and others;
          wherefore this can never be the pure covenant of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          (f.) Nor is this covenant the same with what is referred to in Gal
          3:17 said to be "confirmed of God in Christ", which could not be
          disannulled by the law four hundred and thirty years after; the
          distance of time between them does not agree, but falls short of the
          apostle’s date twenty four years; and therefore must not refer to the
          covenant of circumcision, but to some other covenant and time of
          making it; even to an exhibition and manifestation of the covenant of
          grace to Abraham, about the time of his call out of Chaldea (Gen
          12:3).
        </p>
        <p>
          (g.) The covenant of grace was made with Christ, as the federal head
          of the elect in him, and that from everlasting, and who is the only
          head of that covenant, and of the covenant ones: if the covenant of
          grace was made with Abraham, as the head of his natural and spiritual
          seed, Jews and Gentiles; there must be two heads of the covenant of
          grace, contrary to the nature of such a covenant, and the whole
          current of scripture; yea, the covenant of grace, as it concerns the
          spiritual seed of Abraham, and spiritual blessings for them; it, and
          the promises of it, were made to Christ (Gal 3:16). No mere man is
          capable of covenanting with God; the covenant of grace is not made
          with any single man; and much less with him on the behalf of others:
          whenever we read of it as made with a particular person or persons, it
          is always to be understood of the manifestation and application of it,
          and of its blessings and promises to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          (h.) Allowing Abraham’s covenant to be a peculiar one, and of a mixed
          kind, containing promises of temporal things to him, and his natural
          seed, and of spiritual things to his spiritual seed; or rather, that
          there was at the same time when the covenant of circumcision was given
          to Abraham and his natural seed, a fresh manifestation of the covenant
          of grace made with him and his spiritual seed in Christ. That the
          temporal blessings of it belonged to his natural seed, is no question;
          but that the spiritual blessings belong to all Abraham’s seed, after
          the flesh, and to all the natural seed of believing Gentiles, must be
          denied: if the covenant of grace was made with all Abraham’s seed
          according to the flesh, then it was made with his more immediate
          offspring, with a mocking, persecuting Ishmael, and with a profane
          Esau, and with all his remote posterity; with them who believed not,
          and whose carcasses fell in the wilderness; with the ten tribes who
          revolted from the pure worship of God; with the Jews in Isaiah’s time,
          a seed of evildoers, whose rulers are called the rulers of Sodom, and
          the people the people of Gomorrah; with the scribes and Pharisees,
          that wicked and adulterous generation in the times of Christ: but what
          serious, thoughtful man, who knows anything of the covenant of grace,
          can admit of this? (see Rom9:6-7). It is only a remnant, according to
          the election of grace, who are in this covenant; and if all the
          natural seed of Abraham are not in this covenant, it can scarcely be
          thought that all the natural seed of believing Gentiles are; it is
          only some of the one and some of the other, who are in the covenant of
          grace; and this cannot be known until they believe, when they appear
          to be Abraham’s spiritual seed; and it must be right to put off their
          claim to any supposed privilege arising from covenant interest, until
          it is plain they have one; if all the natural seed of Abraham, as
          such, and all the natural seed of believing Gentiles, as such, are in
          the covenant of grace; since all they that are in it, and none but
          they are in it, who are the chosen of God, the redeemed of the Lamb,
          and will be called by grace, and sanctified, and persevere in faith
          and holiness, and be eternally glorified; then the natural seed of
          Abraham, and of believing Gentiles, must be all chosen to grace and
          glory, and be redeemed by the blood of Christ from sin, law, hell, and
          death; they must all have new hearts and spirits given them, and the
          fear of God put into their hearts; must be effectually called, their
          sins forgiven them, their persons justified by the righteousness of
          Christ, and they persevere in grace to the end, and be for ever
          glorified; (see Jer 31:33-34; Jer 32:40; Ezek 36:25-27; Rom8:30). But
          who will venture to assert all this of the one, or of the other? And
          after all,
        </p>
        <p>
          (i.) If their covenant interest could be ascertained, that gives no
          right to an ordinance, without a positive order and direction from
          God. It gave no right to circumcision formerly; for on the one hand
          there were persons living when that ordinance was appointed, who had
          an undoubted interest in the covenant of grace; as Shem, Arphaxad,
          Lot, and others, on whom circumcision was not enjoined, and they had
          no right to use it: on the other hand, there have been many of whom it
          cannot be said they were in the covenant of grace, and yet were
          obliged to it. And so covenant interest gives no right to baptism;
          could it be proved, as it cannot, that all the infant seed of
          believers, as such, are in the covenant of grace, it would give them
          no right to baptism, without a command for it; the reason is, because
          a person may be in covenant, and as yet not have the prerequisite to
          an ordinance, even faith in Christ, and a profession of it, which are
          necessary both to baptism and the Lord’s Supper; and if covenant
          interest gives a right to the one, it would to the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          (j.) Notwithstanding all this attention made about Abraham’s covenant
          (Gen 17:1-14), it was not made with him and his infant seed; but with
          him and his adult offspring; it was they in all after ages to the
          coming of Christ, whether believers or unbelievers, who were enjoined
          to circumcise their infant seed, and not all of them, only their
          males: it was not made with Abraham’s infant seed, who could not
          circumcise themselves, but their parents were by this covenant obliged
          to circumcise them; yea, others, who were not Abraham’s natural seed,
          were obliged to it; "He that is eight days old shalt be circumcised
          among you, which is NOT OF THY SEED" (Gen 17:12). Which leads on to
          observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          b. That nothing can be concluded from the circumcision of Jewish
          infants, to the baptism of the infants of believing Gentiles: had
          there been a like command for the baptism of the infants of believing
          Gentiles, under the New Testament, as there was for the circumcision
          of Jewish infants under the Old, the thing would not have admitted of
          any dispute; but nothing of this kind appears. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          (a.) It is not clear that even Jewish infants were admitted into
          covenant by the rite of circumcision; from whence it is pleaded, that
          the infants of believers are admitted into it by baptism; for
          Abraham’s female seed were taken into the covenant made with him, as
          well as his male seed, but not by any "visible rite" or ceremony; nor
          were his male seed admitted by any such rite; not by circumcision, for
          they were not to be circumcised until the eighth day; to have
          circumcised them sooner would have been criminal; and that they were
          in covenant from their birth, I presume, will not be denied; as it was
          a national covenant, so early they were in it; the Israelites, with
          their infants at Horeb, had not been circumcised; nor were they when
          they entered into covenant with the Lord their God (Deut 29:10-15).
        </p>
        <p>
          (b.) Circumcision was no seal of the covenant of grace under the
          former dispensation; nor is baptism a seal of it under the present:
          had circumcision been a seal of it, the covenant of grace must have
          been without one from Adam to Abraham: it is called a sign or token,
          but not a seal; it was a sign or mark in the flesh of Abraham’s
          natural seed, a typical sign of the pollution of human nature, and of
          the inward circumcision of the heart; but no seal, confirming any
          spiritual blessing of the covenant of grace to those who had this mark
          or sign; it is indeed called, "a seal of the righteousness of faith"
          (Rom4:11), but not a seal to Abraham’s natural seed of their interest
          in that righteousness, but only to Abraham himself; it was a seal to
          him, a confirming sign, assuring him, that the righteousness of faith,
          which he had before he was circumcised, should come upon the
          uncircumcised believing Gentiles; and therefore it was continued on
          his natural offspring, until that righteousness was preached unto,
          received by, and imputed to believing Gentiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c.) Nor did baptism succeed circumcision; there is no agreement
          between the one and the other; not in the subjects, to whom they were
          administered; the use of the one and the other is not the same; and
          the manner of administering them different; baptism being administered
          to Jews and Gentiles, to male and female, and to adult persons only:
          not so circumcision; the use of circumcision was to distinguish the
          natural seed of Abraham from others; baptism is the badge of the
          spiritual seed of Christ, and the answer of a good conscience towards
          God; and represents the sufferings, burial, and resurrection of
          Christ; the one is by blood, the other by water; and ordinances so
          much differing in their subjects, use, and administration; the one can
          never be thought to come in the room and place of the other. Besides,
          baptism was in use and force before circumcision was abolished, which
          was not until the death of Christ; whereas, the doctrine of baptism
          was preached, and the ordinance itself administered, some years before
          that; now that which was in force before another is out of date, can
          never with any propriety be said to succeed, or come in the room of
          that other. Besides, if this was the case, as circumcision gave a
          right to the Passover, so would baptism to the Lord’s Supper; which
          yet is not admitted. Now as there is nothing to be gathered out of the
          Old Testament to countenance infant baptism, so neither are there any
          passages in the New, which can be supported in favor of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          i. Not the text in Acts 2:39. "The promise is unto you and to your
          children", etc. It is pretended, that this refers to the covenant made
          with Abraham, and to a covenant promise made to him, giving his infant
          children a right to the ordinance of circumcision; and is urged as a
          reason with the Jews, why they and their children ought to be
          baptized; and with the Gentiles, why they and theirs should be also,
          when called into a church state. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          (i.) There is not the least mention made in the text of Abraham’s
          covenant, or of any promise made to him, giving his infant seed a
          right to circumcision, and still less to baptism; nor is there the
          least syllable of infant baptism, nor any hint of it, from whence it
          can be concluded; nor by "children" are infants designed, but the
          posterity of the Jews, who are frequently so called in scripture,
          though grown up; and unless it be so understood in many places,
          strange interpretations must be given of them; wherefore the argument
          from hence for "paedobaptism" is given up by some learned men, as Dr.
          Hammond and others, as inconclusive.
        </p>
        <p>
          (ii.) The promise here, be it what it may, is not observed as giving a
          right or claim to any ordinance; but as an encouraging motive to
          persons in distress, under a sense of sin, to repent of it, and
          declare their repentance, and yield a voluntary subjection to the
          ordinance of baptism; when they might hope that remission of sins
          would be applied to them, and they should receive a larger measure of
          the grace of the Spirit; wherefore repentance and baptism are urged in
          order to the enjoyment of the promise; and consequently must be
          understood of adult persons, who only are capable of repentance, and
          of a voluntary subjection to baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          (iii.) The promise is no other than the promise of life and salvation
          by Christ, and of remission of sins by his blood, and of an increase
          of grace from his Spirit; and whereas the persons addressed had
          imprecated the guilt of the blood of Christ, they had shed upon their
          posterity, as well as on themselves, which distressed them; they are
          told, for their relief, that the same promise would be made good to
          their posterity also, provided they did as they were directed to do;
          and even to all the Jews afar off, in distant countries and future
          ages, who should look on Christ and mourn, repent and believe, and be
          baptized: and seeing the Gentiles are sometimes described as those
          "afar of", the promise may be thought to reach to them who should be
          called by grace, repent, believe, and be baptized also; but no mention
          is made of their children; and had they been mentioned, the limiting
          clause, "Even as many as the Lord our God shall call", plainly points
          at and describes the persons intended, whether Jews or Gentiles,
          effectually called by grace, who are encouraged by the motive in the
          promise to profess repentance, and submit to baptism; which can only
          be understood of adult persons, and not of infants.
        </p>
        <p>
          ii. Nor Rom11:16, etc. "If the first fruits be holy", etc. For, (i.)
          By the first fruits, and lump, and by the root and branches, are not
          meant Abraham and his posterity, or natural seed, as such; but the
          first among the Jews who believed in Christ, and laid the first
          foundation of a gospel church state, and were first incorporated into
          it; Who being holy, were a pledge of the future conversion and
          holiness of that people in the latter day.
        </p>
        <p>
          (ii.) Nor by the good olive tree, after mentioned, is meant the Jewish
          church state; which was abolished by Christ, with all the peculiar
          ordinances of it; and the believing Gentiles were never engrafted into
          it; the axe has been laid to the root of that old Jewish stock, and it
          is entirely cut down, and no engrafture is made upon it. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          (iii.) By it is meant the gospel church state, in its first
          foundation, consisting of Jews that believed, out of which were left
          the Jews who believed not in Christ, and who are the branches broken
          off; into which church state the Gentiles were received and engrafted;
          which engrafture, or coalition, was first made at Antioch, when and
          hereafter the Gentiles partook of the root and fatness of the olive
          tree, enjoyed the same privileges, communicated in the same
          ordinances, and were satisfied with the goodness and fatness of the
          house of God; and this gospel church may be truly called, by the
          converted Jews in the latter day, their "own olive tree", into which
          they will be engrafted; since the first gospel church was set up at
          Jerusalem, and gathered out of the Jews; and so in other places, the
          first gospel churches consisted of Jews, the first fruits of those
          converted ones. From the whole it appears, that there is not the least
          syllable about baptism, much less of infant baptism, in the passage;
          nor can anything be concluded from hence in favor of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          iii. Nor from 1Cor 7:14 "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by
          the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; else
          were your children unclean, but now are they holy"; which is by some
          understood of a federal holiness, giving a claim to covenant
          privileges, and so to baptism. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          (i.) It should be told what these covenant privileges are; since, as
          we have seen, covenant interest gives no right to any ordinance,
          without divine direction; nor is baptism a seal of the covenant: it
          should be told what this covenant holiness is, whether imaginary or
          real; by some it is called "reputed", and is distinguished from
          internal holiness, which is rejected from being the sense of the text;
          but such holiness can never qualify persons for a New Testament
          ordinance; nor as the covenant of grace any such holiness belonging to
          it; that provides, by way of promise, real holiness, signified by
          putting the laws of God in the heart, by giving new hearts and new
          spirits, and by cleansing from all impurity, and designs real,
          internal holiness, shown in an holy conversation; and such who appear
          to have that, have an undoubted right to the ordinance of baptism,
          since they have received the Spirit as a Spirit of sanctification
          (Acts 10:47). But this cannot be meant in the text, seeing,
        </p>
        <p>
          (ii.) It is such a holiness as heathens may have; unbelieving husbands
          and wives are said to have it, in virtue of their relation to
          believing wives and husbands, and which is prior to the holiness of
          their children, and on which theirs depends; but surely such will not
          be allowed to have federal holiness, and yet it must be of the same
          kind with their children; if the holiness of the children is a federal
          holiness, that of the unbelieving parent must be so too, from whence
          is the holiness of the children.
        </p>
        <p>
          (iii.) If children, by virtue of this holiness, have claim to baptism,
          then much more their unbelieving parents, since they are sanctified
          before them, by their believing yoke fellows, and are as near to them
          as their children; and if the holiness of the one gives a right to
          baptism, why not the holiness of the other? and yet the one are
          baptized, and the other not, though sanctified, and whose holiness is
          the more near; for the holiness spoken of, be it what it may, is
          derived from both parents, believing and unbelieving; yea, the
          holiness of the children depends upon the sanctification of the
          unbelieving parent; for if the unbeliever is not sanctified, the
          children are unclean, and not holy. But,
        </p>
        <p>
          (iv.) These words are to be understood of matrimonial holiness, even
          of the very act of marriage, which, in the language of the Jews, is
          frequently expressed by being sanctified; the word שרק to "sanctify",
          is used in innumerable places in the Jewish writings,[9] , to
          "espouse"; and in the same sense the apostle uses the word agiazw
          here, and the words may be rendered, "the unbelieving husband is
          espoused", or married, "to the wife"; or rather, "has been espoused",
          for it relates to the act of marriage past, as valid; "and the
          unbelieving wife has been espoused to the husband"; the preposition
          en, translated "by", should be rendered "to", as it is in the very
          next verse; "God hath called us en eirhnh, to peace"; the apostle’s
          inference from it is, "else were your children unclean", illegitimate,
          if their parents were not lawfully espoused and married to each other;
          "but now are they holy", a holy and legitimate seed, as in Ezra 9:2
          (see Mal 2:15), and no other sense can be put upon the words, than of
          a legitimate marriage and offspring; nothing else will suit with the
          case proposed to the apostle, and with his answer to it, and reasoning
          about it; and which sense has been allowed by many learned
          interpreters, ancient and modern; as Jerome, Ambrose, Erasmus,
          Camerarius, Musculus, and others. There are some objections made to
          the practice of adult baptism, which are of little force, and to which
          an answer may easily be returned.
        </p>
        <p>
          i. That though it may be allowed that adult persons, such as repent
          and believe, are the subjects of baptism, yet it is nowhere said, that
          they are the only ones: but if no others can be named as baptized, and
          the descriptive characters given in scripture of baptized persons are
          such as can "only" agree with adult, and not with infants; then it may
          be reasonably concluded, that the former "only" are the proper
          subjects of baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          ii. It is objected to our practice of baptizing the adult offspring of
          Christians, that no scriptural instance of such a practice can be
          given; and it is demanded of us to give an instance agreeable to our
          practice; since the first persons baptized were such as were converted
          either from Judaism or from heathenism, and about the baptism of such
          adult, they say, there is no controversy. But our practice is not at
          all concerned with the parents of the persons baptized by us, whether
          they be Christians, Jews, Turks, or Pagans; but with the persons
          themselves, whether they are believers in Christ or not; if they are
          the adult offspring of Christians, yet unbaptized, it is no objection
          to us: and if they are not, it is no bar in the way of admitting them
          to baptism, if they themselves are believers; many, and it may be the
          greater part of such baptized by us are the adult offspring of those
          who, without breach of charity, cannot be considered as Christians. As
          for the first persons that were baptized, they were neither proselytes
          from Judaism nor from Heathenism; but the offspring of Christians, of
          such that believed in the Messiah; the saints before the coming of
          Christ, and at his coming, were as good Christians as any that have
          lived since; so that those good men who lived before Abraham, as far
          back as to the first man, and those that lived after him, even to the
          coming of Christ, Eusebius[10] observes, that if any should affirm
          them to be Christians, though not in name, yet in reality, he would
          not say amiss. Judaism, at the time of Christ’s coming, was the same
          with Christianity, and not in opposition to it; so that there was no
          such thing as conversion from Judaism to Christianity. Zachariah and
          Elizabeth, whose offspring John the first baptizer was, and Mary, the
          mother of our Lord, who was baptized by John, when adult, were as good
          Christians, and as strong believers in Jesus, as the Messiah, as soon
          as born, and even when in the womb of the Virgin, as have been since;
          and these surely must be allowed to be the adult offspring of
          Christians; such were the apostles of Christ, and the first followers
          of him, who were the adult offspring of such who believed in the
          Messiah, and embraced him upon the first notice of him, and cannot be
          said to be converted from Judaism to Christianity; Judaism not
          existing until the opposition to Jesus being the Messiah became
          general and national; after that, indeed, those of the Jewish nation
          who believed in Christ, may be said to be proselytes from Judaism to
          Christianity, as the apostle Paul and others: and so converts made by
          the preaching of the gospel among the Gentiles, were proselytes from
          heathenism to Christianity; but then it is unreasonable to demand of
          us instances of the adult offspring of such being baptized, and added
          to the churches; since the scripture history of the first churches
          contained in the Acts of the Apostles, only gives an account of the
          first planting of these churches, and of the baptism of those of which
          they first consisted; but not of the additions of members to them in
          later times; wherefore to give instances of those who were born of
          them, and brought up by them, as baptized in adult years, cannot
          reasonably be required of us: but on the other hand, if infant
          children were admitted to baptism in these times, upon the faith and
          baptism of their parents, and their becoming Christians; it is
          strange, exceeding strange, that among the many thousands baptized in
          Jerusalem, Samaria, Corinth, and other places, that there should be no
          one instance of any of them bringing their children with them to be
          baptized, and claiming the privilege of baptism for them upon their
          own faith; nor of their doing this in any short time after. This is a
          case that required no length of time, and yet not a single instance
          can be produced.
        </p>
        <p>
          iii. It is objected, that no time can be assigned when infants were
          cast out of covenant, or cut off from the seal of it. If by the
          covenant is meant the covenant of grace, it should be first proved
          that they are in it, as the natural seed of believers, which cannot be
          done; and when that is, it is time enough to talk of their being cast
          out, when and how. If by it is meant Abraham’s covenant, the covenant
          of circumcision, the answer is the cutting off was when circumcision
          ceased to be an ordinance of God, which was at the death of Christ: if
          by it is meant the national covenant of the Jews, the ejection of
          Jewish parents, with their children, was when God wrote a "Loammi"
          upon that people, as a body politic and ecclesiastic; when he broke
          his covenant with them, signified by breaking his two staffs, beauty
          and bands.
        </p>
        <p>
          iv. A clamorous outcry is made against us, as abridging the privileges
          of infants, by denying baptism to them; making them to be lesser under
          the gospel dispensation than under the law, and the gospel
          dispensation less glorious. But as to the gospel dispensation, it is
          the more glorious for infants being left out of its church state; that
          is, for its being not national and carnal, as before; but
          congregational and spiritual; consisting not of infants, without
          understanding, but of rational and spiritual men, believers in Christ;
          and these not of a single country, as Judea, but in all parts of the
          world: and as for infants, their privileges now are many and better,
          who are eased from the painful rite of circumcision; it is a rich
          mercy, and a glorious privilege of the gospel, that the believing Jews
          and their children are delivered from it; and that the Gentiles and
          theirs are not obliged to it; which would have bound them over to
          fulfil the whole law: to which may be added, that being born of
          Christian parents, and having a Christian education, and of having
          opportunities of hearing the gospel, as they grow up; and that not in
          one country only, but in many; are greater privileges than the Jewish
          children had under the former dispensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          v. It is objected, that there are no more express commands in
          scripture for keeping the first day of the week as a sabbath; nor for
          women partaking of the Lord’s Supper, and other things, than for the
          baptism of infants. As for the first, though there is no express
          precept for the observance of it, yet there are precedents of its
          being observed for religious services (Acts 20:7; 1Cor 16:1-2), and
          though we have no example of infant baptism, yet if there were
          scriptural precedents of it, we should think ourselves obliged to
          follow them. As for women’s right to partake of the Lord’s Supper, we
          have sufficient proof of it; since these were baptized as well as men;
          and having a right to one ordinance, had to another, and were members
          of the first church, communicated with it, and women, as well as men,
          were added to it (Acts 8:12; Acts 1:14; Acts 5:1; Acts 5:14) we have a
          precept for it: "Let a man", anyrwpov, a word of the common gender,
          and signifies both man and woman, "examine him or herself, and so let
          him or her eat" (1Cor 11:29; see Gal 3:28); and we have also examples
          of it in Mary the mother of our Lord, and other women, who, with the
          disciples, constituted the gospel church at Jerusalem; and as they
          continued with one accord in the apostles’ doctrine and in prayer, so
          in fellowship and in breaking of bread; let the same proof be given of
          the baptism of infants, and it will be admitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          vi. Antiquity is urged in favor of infant baptism; it is pretended
          that this is a tradition of the church received from the apostles;
          though of this no other proof is given, but the testimony of Origen,
          none before that; and this is taken, not from any of his genuine Greek
          writings, only from some Latin translations, confessedly interpolated,
          and so corrupted, that it is owned, one is at a loss to find Origen in
          Origen. No mention is made of this practice in the first two
          centuries, no instance given of it until the third, when Tertullian is
          the first who spoke of it, and at the same time spoke against it.[11]
          And could it be carried up higher, it would be of no force, unless it
          could be proved from the sacred scriptures, to which only we appeal,
          and by which the thing in debate is to be judged and determined. We
          know that innovations and corruptions very early obtained, and even in
          the times of the apostles; and what is pretended to be near those
          times, is the more to be suspected as the traditions of the false
          apostles;[12] the antiquity of a custom is no proof of the truth and
          genuineness of it;[13] "The customs the people are vain" (Jer 10:3). I
          proceed to consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Fourthly, the way and manner of baptizing; and to prove, that it
          is by immersion, plunging the body in water, and covering it with it.
          Custom, and the common use of writing in this controversy, have so far
          prevailed, that for the most part immersion is usually called the
          "mode" of baptism; whereas it is properly baptism itself; to say that
          immersion or dipping is the mode of baptism, is the same thing as to
          say, that dipping is the mode of dipping; for as Sir John Floyer[14]
          observes "Immersion is no circumstance, but "the very act of baptism",
          used by our Saviour and his disciples, in the institution of baptism."
          And Calvin expressly says,[15] "The word "baptizing" signifies to
          plunge; and it is certain, that the rite of plunging was used by the
          ancient churches." And as for sprinkling, that cannot, with any
          propriety, be called a mode of baptism; it would be just such, good
          sense as to say, sprinkling is the mode of dipping, since baptism and
          dipping are the same; hence the learned Selden,[16] who in the former
          part of his life, might have seen infants dipped in fonts, but lived
          to see immersion much disused, had reason to say, "In England, of late
          years, I ever thought the parson "baptized his own fingers" rather
          than the child," because he dipped the one, and sprinkled the other.
          That baptism is immersion, or the dipping of a person in water, and
          covering him with it is to be proved,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. From the proper and primary signification of the word baptizw,
          "baptize", which in its first and primary sense, signifies to "dip or
          plunge into"; and so it is rendered by our best lexicographers,
          "mergo", "immergo", "dip or plunge into." And in a secondary and
          consequential sense, "abluo, lavo", "wash", because what is dipped is
          washed, there being no proper washing but by dipping; but never
          "perfundo or aspergo", "pour or sprinkle"; so the lexicon published by
          Constantine, Budaeus, etc. and those of Hadrian Junius, Plantinus,
          Scapula, Stephens, Schrevelius, Stockius, and others; besides a great
          number of critics; as Beza, Casanbon, Witsius, etc. which might be
          produced. By whose united testimonies the thing is out of question.
          Had our translators, instead of adopting the Greek word baptize in all
          places where the ordinance of baptism is made mention of, truly
          translated it, and not have left it untranslated, as they have, the
          controversy about the manner of baptizing would have been at an end,
          or rather have been prevented; had they used the word dip, instead of
          baptize, as they should have done, there would have been no room for a
          question about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That baptism was performed by immersion, appears by the places
          chosen for the administration of it; as the river Jordan by John,
          where he baptized many, and where our Lord himself was baptized by him
          (Mat 3:6; Mat 3:13; Mat 3:16), but why should he choose the river to
          baptize in, and baptize in it, if he did not administer the ordinance
          by immersion? had it been done any other way, there was no occasion
          for any confluence of water, much less a river;[17] a basin of water
          would have sufficed. John also, it is said, "was baptizing in Aenon,
          near Salim, because there was much water" (Jn 3:23), which was
          convenient for baptism, for which this reason is given; and not for
          convenience for drink for men and their cattle, which is not expressed
          nor implied; from whence we may gather, as Calvin on the text does,
          "That baptism was performed by John and Christ, by plunging the whole
          body under water;" and so Piscator, Aretius, Grotius, and others on
          the same passage.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. That this was the way in which it was anciently administered, is
          clear from various instances of baptism recorded in scripture, and the
          circumstances attending them; as that of our Lord, of whom it is said,
          "That when he was baptized he went up straightway out of the water",
          which supposes he had been in it; and so Piscator infers from his
          going up out of it, that therefore he went down into it, and was
          baptized in the river itself; of which going down there would have
          been no need, had the ordinance been administered to him in another
          way, as by sprinkling or pouring a little water on his head, he and
          John standing in the midst of the river, as the painter and engraver
          ridiculously describe it: and certain it is, he was then baptized in
          Jordan; the evangelist Mark says "into Jordan" (Mk 1:9), not at the
          banks of Jordan, but into the waters of it; for which reason he went
          into it, and when baptized, "came up out" of it, not "from" it, but
          "out" of it; apo and ex, signifying the same, as in Lk 4:35; Lk 4:41.
          So the preposition is used in the Septuagint version of Ps 40:2 ex and
          apo are "aequipollent", as several lexicographers from Xenophon
          observe. The baptism of the eunuch is another instance of baptism by
          immersion; when he and Philip were "come unto a certain water", to the
          water side, which destroys a little piece of criticism, as if their
          going into the water, after expressed, was no other than going to the
          brink of the water, to the water side, whereas they were come to that
          before; and baptism being agreed upon, "they went down both into the
          water", both Philip and the eunuch, "and he baptized him; and when
          they were come up out of the water", etc. Now we do not reason merely
          from the circumstances of "going down into, and coming up out of the
          water"; we know that persons may go down into water, and come up out
          of it, and never be immersed in it; but when it is expressly said,
          upon these persons going down into the water, that Philip baptized, or
          dipped, the eunuch; and when this was done, that both came up out of
          it, these circumstances strongly corroborate, without the explanation
          of the word "baptized", that it was performed by immersion; for these
          circumstances cannot agree with any other way of administering it but
          that; for a man can hardly be thought to be in his senses who can
          imagine that Philip went down with the eunuch into the water to
          sprinkle or pour a little water on him, and then gravely come out of
          it; hence, as the above learned commentator, Calvin, on the text says,
          "Here we plainly see what was the manner of baptizing with the
          ancients, for they plunged the whole body into the water; now custom
          obtaining, that the minister only sprinkles the body or the head." So
          Barnabas,[18] an apostolic writer of the first century, and who is
          mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, as a companion of the apostle
          Paul, describes baptism by going down into and by coming up out of the
          water; "We descend," says he, "into the water full of sin and filth;
          and we ascend, bringing forth fruit in the heart, having fear and hope
          in Jesus, through the Spirit."
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The end of baptism, which is to represent the burial of Christ,
          cannot be answered in any other way than by immersion, or covering the
          body in water; that baptism is an emblem of the burial of Christ, is
          clear from Rom6:4 and Col 2:12. It would be endless to quote the great
          number, even of "paedobaptist" writers, who ingenuously acknowledge
          that the allusion in these passages, is to the ancient rite of by
          immersion: as none but such who are dead are buried, so none but such
          who are dead to sin, and to the law by the body of Christ, or who
          profess to be so, are to be buried in and by baptism, or to be
          baptized; and as none can be properly said to be buried, unless under
          ground, and covered with earth; so none can be said to be baptized,
          but such who are put under water, and covered with it; and nothing
          short of this can be a representation of the burial of Christ, and of
          ours with him; not sprinkling, or pouring a little water on the face;
          for a corpse cannot be said to be buried when only a little earth or
          dust is sprinkled or poured on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. This may be concluded from the various figurative and typical
          baptisms spoken of in scripture. As,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) From the waters of the flood, which Tertullian calls[19] the
          baptism of the world, and of which the apostle Peter makes baptism the
          antitype (1 Pet 3:20-21). The ark in which Noah and his family were
          saved by water, was God’s ordinance; it was made according to the
          pattern he gave to Noah, as baptism is; and as that was the object of
          the scorn of men, so is the ordinance of baptism, rightly
          administered; and as it represented a burial, when Noah and his family
          were shut up in it, so baptism; and when the fountains of the great
          deep were broken up below, and the windows of heaven were opened
          above, the ark, with those in it, were as it were covered with and
          immersed in water; and so was a figure of baptism by immersion: and as
          there were none but adult persons in the ark, who were saved by water
          in it, so none but adult persons are the proper subjects of water
          baptism; and though there were few who were in the ark, it was
          attended with a salutary effect to them, they were saved by water; so
          such who truly believe in Christ, and are baptized, shall be saved,
          and that "by the resurrection of Jesus Christ", which was typified by
          the coming of Noah and his family out of the ark; to which baptism, as
          the antitype, corresponds, being an emblem of the same (Rom6:4-5; Col
          2:12).
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) From the passage of the Israelites under the cloud and through
          the sea, when "they were said to be baptized unto Moses, in the cloud
          and in the sea" (1Cor 10:1-2). There are various things in this
          account which agree with baptism; this was following Moses, who
          directed them into the sea, and went before them; so baptism is a
          following Christ, who has set an example to tread in his steps; and as
          the Israelites were baptized into Moses, so believers are baptized
          into Christ, and put him on; and this passage of theirs was after
          their coming out of Egypt, and at the beginning of their journey
          through the wilderness to Canaan; so baptism is administered to
          believers, at their first coming out of darkness and bondage worse
          than Egyptian, and when they first enter on their Christian
          pilgrimage; and as joy followed upon the former, "Then sang Moses and
          the children of Israel", etc. so it often follows upon the latter; the
          eunuch, after baptism, went on his way rejoicing: but chiefly this
          passage was a figure of baptism by immersion; as the Israelites were
          "under the cloud", and so under water, and covered with it, as persons
          baptized by immersion are; "and passed through the sea", that standing
          up as a wall on both sides them, with the cloud over them; thus
          surrounded they were as persons immersed in water, and so said to be
          baptized; and thus Grotius remarks upon the passage.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) From the various washings, bathings, or baptisms of the Jews;
          called "various", because of the different persons and things washed
          or dipped, as the same Grotius observes; and not because of different
          sorts of washing, for there is but one way of washing, and that is by
          dipping; what has a little water only sprinkled or poured on it,
          cannot be said to be washed; the Jews had their sprinklings, which
          were distinct from washings or bathings, which were always performed
          by immersion; it is a rule, with them, that "wherever in the law
          washing of the flesh, or of the clothes, is mentioned, it means
          nothing else than כוגּה לכ תליכח "the dipping of the whole body" in a
          laver--for if any man dips himself all over except the tip of his
          little finger, he is still in his uncleanness."[20] according to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) From the sufferings of Christ being called a baptism; "I have a
          baptism to be baptized with", etc. (Lk 12:50), not water baptism, nor
          the baptism of the Spirit, with both which he had been baptized; but
          the baptism of his sufferings, yet to come, he was desirous of; these
          are called so in allusion to baptism, as it is an immersion; and is
          expressive of the abundance of them, sometimes signified by deep
          waters, and floods of waters; and Christ is represented as plunged
          into them, covered and overwhelmed with them (Ps 62:7; Ps 69:1-2).
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) From the extraordinary donation of the Holy Spirit, and his gifts
          unto, and his descent upon the apostles on the day of Pentecost, which
          is called "baptizing" (Acts 1:5; Acts 2:1-2), expressive of the very
          great abundance of them, in allusion to baptism or dipping, in a
          proper sense, as the learned Casaubon[21] observes; *"Regard is had in
          this place to the proper signification of the word baptizein, to
          immerse or dip; and in this sense the apostles are truly said to be
          baptized, for the house in which this was done, was filled with the
          Holy Ghost; so that the apostles seemed to be plunged into it, as into
          some pool." All which typical and figurative baptisms, serve to
          strengthen the proper sense of the word, as it signifies an immersion
          and dipping the body into, and covering it in water, which only can
          support the figure used. Nor is this sense of the word to be set aside
          or weakened by the use of it in Mk 7:4 and Lk 11:38 in the former, it
          is said, "Except they wash, baptizwntai, baptize, or dip themselves,
          they eat not"; and in it mention is made of baptismwn, "washings or
          dippings" of cups and pots, brazen vessels, and of tables or beds; and
          in the latter, the Pharisee is said to marvel at Christ, that he had
          not first ebaptisyh, "washed, or dipped, before dinner"; all which
          agrees with the superstitious traditions of the elders, here referred
          to, which enjoined dipping in all the cases and instances spoken of,
          and so serve but the more to confirm the sense of the word contended
          for; for the Pharisees, upon touching the common people or their
          clothes, as they returned from market, or from any court of
          judicature, were obliged to immerse themselves in water before they
          eat; and so the Samaritan Jews:[22] "If the Pharisees, says
          Maimonides,[23] touched but the garments of the common people, they
          were defiled all one as if they had touched a profluvious person, and
          needed immersion," or were obliged to it: and Scaliger,[24] from the
          Jews observes, "That the more superstitious part of them, everyday,
          before they sat down to meat, dipped the whole body; hence the
          Pharisees admiration at Christ" (Lk 11:38). And not only cups and
          pots, and brazen vessels were washed by dipping, or putting them into
          water, in which way unclean vessels were washed according to the law
          (Lev 11:32), but even beds, pillows, and bolsters, unclean in a
          ceremonial sense, were washed in this way, according to the traditions
          of the elders referred to; for they say,[25] "A bed that is wholly
          defiled, if a man "dips" it part by part, it is pure." Again,[26] "If
          he "dips the bed" in it (a pool of water) though its feet are plunged
          into the thick clay (at the bottom of the pool) it is clean." And as
          for pillows and bolsters, thus they say,[27] "A pillow or a bolster of
          skin, when a man lifts up the mouth of them out of the water, the
          water which is in them will be drawn; what must be done? He must "dip"
          them, and lift them up by their fringes." Thus, according to these
          traditions, the various things mentioned were washed by immersion; and
          instead of weakening, strengthen the sense of the word pleaded for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objections against baptism, as immersion, taken from some
          instances of baptism recorded in scripture, are of no force; as that
          of the three thousand, in Acts 2:1-47, not with respect to their
          number; it may be observed, that though these were added to the church
          in one and the same day, it does not follow, that they were baptized
          in one day; but be it that they were, there were twelve apostles to
          administer the ordinance, and it was but two hundred and fifty persons
          apiece; and besides, there were seventy disciples, administrators of
          it; and supposing them employed, it will reduce the number to six or
          seven and thirty persons each: and the difference between dipping and
          sprinkling is very inconsiderable, since the same form of words is
          used in the one way as in the other; and therefore it might be done in
          one day, and in a small part of it too.[28] Nor with respect to
          convenience for the administration of it; as water and places of it
          sufficient to baptize in: here can be no objection, when it is
          observed, what number of private baths were in Jerusalem for
          ceremonial uncleanness; the many pools in the city, and the various
          apartments and things in the temple fit for such a use; as the dipping
          room for the high priest, the molten sea for the common priests, and
          the ten brazen lavers, each of which held forty baths of water
          sufficient for the immersion of the whole body; all which they might
          be allowed the use of, as they were of the temple; they "having favor
          with all the people": not with respect to clothes, and change of
          garments; it was only everyone’s providing and bringing change of
          raiment for himself. Another instance objected to is, that of the
          baptism of Saul (Acts 9:18), supposed to be done in the house where he
          was: but that does not necessarily follow, but rather the contrary;
          since he "arose" from the place where he was, in order to be baptized;
          and admitting it was done in the house, it is highly probable there
          was a bath in the house, in which it might be performed; since it was
          the house of a Jew, with whom it was usual to have baths to wash their
          whole bodies in on certain occasions; and had it been performed by
          sprinkling or pouring a little water on him, he needed not to have
          rose for that purpose. Besides, he was not only bid to arise and be
          baptized, which would sound very oddly if rendered, "be sprinkled" or
          "poured" (Acts 22:16), but he himself says, that he, with others, were
          "buried by" or "in baptism" (Rom6:4). Another instance is that of the
          jailer and his household (Acts 16:33), in which account there is
          nothing that makes it improbable that it was done by immersion; for it
          seems to be a clear case, that the jailer, upon his conversion, took
          the apostles out of prison into his own house, where they preached to
          him and his family (Acts 16:32), and after this they went out of his
          house, and he and his were baptized, very probably in the river
          without the city, where the oratory was (Acts 16:13), for it is
          certain, that after the baptism of him and his family, he brought the
          apostles into his house again, and set meat before them (Acts
          16:33-34). Upon the whole, these instances produced, fail of showing
          the improbability of baptism by immersion; which must appear clear and
          manifest to every attentive reader of his Bible, notwithstanding all
          that has been opposed unto it. The next thing to be considered is,
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Fifthly, the form in which this ordinance is to be administered;
          which is "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
          Ghost" (Mat 28:19), which contains in it a proof of a Trinity of
          Persons in the unity of the divine essence, of the Deity of each
          Person, and of their equality to, and distinction from each other; and
          shows, that this ordinance is performed under the authority of all
          Three; in which a person submitting to it, expresses his faith in
          them, and invocation of them, and gives up himself to them; obliging
          himself to yield obedience to what they require of him, as well as
          putting himself under their care and protection. This form is
          sometimes a little varied and otherwise expressed; as sometimes only
          "in the name of the Lord Jesus" (Acts 8:16), which is a part of the
          form for the whole; and includes in it the substance of it, and of
          Christian baptism; and everything relating to the person and offices
          of Christ, and his relation to and connection with the other Two
          persons. Cornelius and his family were ordered to be baptized, "in the
          name of the Lord" (Acts 10:48), that is, in the name of Jehovah,
          Father, Son, and Spirit; for kuriov, Lord, in the New Testament,
          answers to Jehovah in the Old. The form of baptism in Mat 28:19 is in
          the name of "the Father", etc. which single name denotes the one
          Deity, power, and substance of Father, Son, and Spirit; the equal
          dignity, co-eternal kingdom, and government in the Three perfect
          Persons; as it is expressed in the synodical epistle of the general
          council at Constantinople.[29]
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Sixthly, the ends and uses for which baptism is appointed, and
          which are answered by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. One end of it, and a principal one, as has been frequently hinted,
          is, to represent the sufferings, burial, and resurrection of Christ;
          which is plainly and fully suggested in Rom6:4-5 and Col 2:12 his
          sufferings are represented by going into the water, and being
          overwhelmed in it, his burial by a short continuance under it, and
          being covered with it, and his resurrection by an immersion out of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It was practiced both by John and by the apostles of Christ, for
          the remission of sins (Mk 1:4; Acts 2:38), not that that is the
          procuring and meritorious cause of it, which only is the blood of
          Christ; but they who submit unto it, may, by means of it, be led,
          directed, and encouraged to expect it from Christ. And so,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In like manner it is for the washing away of sin, and cleansing
          from it; "Arise, and be baptized, and wash thy sins" (Acts 22:16),
          this only is really done the blood of Christ, which cleanses from all
          sin; baptism neither washes away original nor actual sin, it has no
          such virtue in it;[30] but it is a means of directing to Christ the
          Lamb of God, who, by his atoning blood and sacrifice, has purged and
          continues to take away the sins of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A salutary or saving use and effect is ascribed unto it; "The like
          figure whereunto, baptism, doth also now save us"; should it be asked
          how, and by what means? the answer follows, "By the resurrection of
          Jesus Christ" (1 Pet 3:21), that is, by leading the faith of the
          person baptized to Christ, as delivered for his offences, and as risen
          again for his justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. In the same passage it is said to be of this use, and to serve this
          purpose, "The answer of a good conscience towards God"; a man who
          believes baptism to be an ordinance of God, and submits to it as such,
          discharges a good conscience, the consequence of which is joy and
          peace; for though "for" keeping the commands of God there is no
          reward, yet there is "in" keeping them; and this is their reward, the
          testimony of a good conscience: for great peace have they which love
          God and keep his commandments.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Yielding obedience to this ordinance of Christ, is an evidence of
          love to God and Christ (1 Jn 5:3), and such who from a principle of
          love to Christ keep his commandments, may expect, according to his
          promise, to have fresh manifestations of his and his Father’s love,
          and to have communion with Father, Son, and Spirit (Jn 14:15; Jn
          14:21; Jn 14:23). This is an end to be had in view, in obedience to
          it, and a very encouraging one.

          [17] Some represent the river Jordan, from Sandys’s account of it, as
          if it was a shallow river, and insufficient for immersion; but what
          Sandys says of it, is only that it was not navigably deep, not above
          eight fathoms broad, nor, except, by accident, heady. Travels, b. 3:p.
          110. ed. 5. But Mr. Maundrel says, for its breadth, it might be about
          twenty yards over, and in depth it far exceeded his height. Journey
