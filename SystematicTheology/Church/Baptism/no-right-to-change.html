            admits of no human encroachment. Twice have we the order in this
            chapter (Ex. 25). “According to all that I shew thee, after the
            pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments
            thereof, even so shall ye make it.” Human inventions are not
            admitted into holy things."—</span

            >1. The Scriptures have, instituted the immersion of believers as a
            rite of the gospel, without the least intimation that sprinkling
            should ever be substituted for immersion, or infants for believers.
            The divine sanction cannot therefore be produced in favour of such a
            change.</span

            authority is required to change an institution as to establish one.
            If we change a divine law we put ourselves in the place of God, or
            rather in direct opposition to him.</span

            >3. To change a divine institution, is virtually to deny the wisdom
            of its appointment. If we make a change we pretend it is for the
            better. Is not this, in effect, to say we are wiser than God?</span

            >4. To change an ordinance is to betray a trust and to handle the
            word of God deceitfully. As stewards we are required faithfully to
            keep and stedfastly to maintain the scriptural laws and regulations
            of Zion.</span

            >5. To change the ordinance from the immersion of believers to the
            sprinkling of infants is to subvert it. No instance can be produced,
            in which, by either precept or example, the Scriptures authorize the
            sprinkling of infants. The immersion of believers and the sprinkling
            of infants are quite distinct and different things. As the immersion
            of believers is baptism, and as there is but "ONE BAPTISM," infant
            sprinkling, so far as it prevails, makes void the scriptural
            ordinance of believers' immersion.</span

            >6. We have no more right to change baptism than we have to change
            any other part of the revealed counsel of God. If therefore we
            change this ordinance, may we not with as little impropriety change
            the Lord's Supper and every other part of revealed worship? If we
            admit a departure from the Scriptures on this subject, why should we
            not admit a departure from them on every other subject? If we may,
            without scriptural authority, sprinkle an infant, why may we not
            worship an image and invoke a saint?</span

            >7. A faithful adherence to divine ordinances is commended in the
            Scriptures. "Now I praise you brethren, that ye remember me in all
            things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them unto you." (I
            Cor. 11:2)</span

            >8. It was one of the great sins of the scribes and Pharisees, that
            they rejected the commands of God to keep the traditions of men,
            "For laying aside the commandments of God, ye hold the tradition of
            men.—Making the word of God of none effect through your
            tradition.—Howbeit, in vain do they worship me, teaching for
            doctrines the commandments of men." (Mark 7:7-13) Thus they were
            turned from the truth by giving heed to Jewish fables and
            commandments of men. And will not our worship be worse than vain, if
            we set aside the divine ordinance of believer's immersion for the
            human tradition of infant sprinkling?</span

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">

            >9. The Scriptures represent it as a crime of great enormity to
            change a divine ordinance. Awful threatenings are denounced by the
            prophet Isaiah. “The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants
            thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the
            ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.” (Isaiah 24:5) One of
            the sins for which these threatenings are denounced is, "they have
            changed the ordinance." Whatever ordinance is intended, it is plain
            that to change an ordinance is a great sin. When two of the sons of
            Aaron made a change in the offering of incense, "there went a fire
            from the Lord and devoured them." (Lev. 10:1-3)

        <p class="Normal-P-P0">
          <span class="Normal-C-C3"
            >The most severe judgments are denounced against those who "add to"
            or "take away from" the book of God. “For I testify unto every man
            that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man
            shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that
            are written in this book: and if any man shall take away from the
            words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out
            of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things
            which are written in this book.” (Rev. 22: 18, 19) These passages
            should make us tremble at the thought of changing a divine
            institution.</span
