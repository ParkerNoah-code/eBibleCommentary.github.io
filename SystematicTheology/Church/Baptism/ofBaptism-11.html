        <h2>Reply to Divine Right of Infant Baptism 2</h2>

          4. That the covenant of grace was made with Abraham, or a revelation
          and application of it to him; that the gospel was revealed to him, and
          he was justified in the same way believers are now; and that he had
          spiritual promises made to him, and spiritual blessings bestowed upon
          him; and that gospel-believers, be they Jews or Gentiles, who are the
          spiritual seed of Abraham, are heirs of the same covenant-blessings
          and promises, are never denied; —this man is fighting with his own
          shadow. What is denied and should be proved, is, that the covenant of
          grace is made with Abraham’s carnal seed, the Jews, and with the
          carnal seed of gospel-believers among the Gentiles; and that spiritual
          promises are made to them; and that they are heirs of spiritual
          blessings, as such: and let it be further observed, that the covenant
          in Gen 17:1-27 is not the covenant referred to in Gal 3:17 said to be
          confirmed of God in Christ, and which could not be disannulled by the
          law 430 years after; since the date does not agree, it falls short
          twenty-four years; and therefore must refer, not to the covenant of
          circumcision, but to some other covenant, and time of making it.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It is false, that children have been always taken with their
          parents into the covenant of grace, under every dispensation. The
          children of Adam were not taken into the covenant of grace with him,
          which was made known to him immediately after the fall; for then all
          the world must be in the covenant of grace. The covenant made with
          Noah and his sons, was not the covenant of grace; since it was made
          with the beasts of the field as well as with them; unless it will be
          said, that they also are in the covenant of grace. Nor were all
          Abraham’s natural seed taken into the covenant of grace with him.
          Ishmael was by name excluded, and the covenant established with Isaac;
          and yet Ishmael was in the covenant of circumcision; which by the way
          proves, that, that and the covenant of grace are two different things:
          nor were all Abraham’s natural seed in the line of Isaac taken into
          the covenant of grace, not Esau; nor all in the line of Jacob and
          Israel; for as the apostle says, they are not all Israel which are of
          Israel; neither because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all
          children; but in Isaac shall thy seed be called; that is, they which
          are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God, but
          the children of the promise are counted for the seed (Rom9:6-8). The
          covenant at Horeb was indeed a national covenant, and took in all,
          children and grown persons; and which was no other than a civil
          contract, and not a covenant of grace, between God and the people of
          Israel; he asking, and they as subjects; he promising to be their
          protector and defender, and they to be his faithful subjects, and obey
          his laws; which covenant has been long ago abolished, when God wrote a
          Loammi upon them: nor is there any proof of infants under the New
          Testament being taken into covenant with their parents. Not Mat 19:14,
          1Cor 7:14 which make no mention of any covenant at all, as will be
          considered hereafter; nor Heb 8:8 since the house of Israel, that new
          covenant is said to be made with, are the spiritual Israel, whether
          Jews or Gentiles, even the whole household of faith, and none but them
          nor are their infants spoken of, nor can they be included; for have
          they all of them the laws of God written on their hearts? Do they all
          know the Lord? or have they all their sins forgiven them? which is the
          care with all those with whom this covenant is made, or to whom it is
          applied. Nor are there any predictions of this kind in the Old
          Testament. Deut 30:6, Ps 22:30, Isa 9:21 speak only of a succession of
          converted persons, either in the gospel-church among the Gentiles, or
          in the same among the Jews, when that people shall be converted in the
          latter day.

          6. The distinction of an inward and outward covenant, is an Utopian
          business, mere jargon and nonsense; it has no foundation in scripture,
          reason, nor common sense. And here I cannot but observe what Mr.
          Baxter, a zealous Paedobaptist, says on this subject.[26] "Mr. Blake’s
          common phrase is, that they are in the outward covenant, and what that
          is, I cannot tell; in what sense is that (God’s covenant-act) called
          outward? It cannot be, as if God did as the dissembling creature,
          Oretenus, with the mouth only, covenant with them, and not with the
          heart, as they deal with him. I know therefore no possible sense but
          this, that it is called outward from the blessings promised, which are
          outward; here therefore, I should have thought it reasonable for Mr.
          Blake to have told us what these outward blessings are, that this
          covenant promiseth; and that he would have proved out of the
          scriptures that God hath such a covenant distinct from the covenant of
          grace. I desire therefore that those words of scripture may be
          produced, where any such covenant is contained. And let Mr. Clark tell
          us what he means by the outward covenant, or the outward part of it,
          in which infants are; if any thing can be collected from him, as his
          meaning, it is, that it designs the outward administration of the
          covenant by the word and ordinances: but if it means the outward
          ministry of the word, newborn infants are not capable of that to any
          profit; if it designs the administration of baptism and the Lord’s
          supper, then they should be admitted to one as well as the other; and
          if baptism only is intended by this outward covenant, or the outward
          part, here is the greatest confusion imaginable; then the sense is,
          they are under the outward administration of the covenant, that is
          baptism; and this gives them a right to be baptized, that is to be
          baptized again, or in other words to be made Anabaptists of; and after
          all it is a poor covenant, or a poor part of it assigned for infants,
          in the bond of which, as this author says, are many real hypocrites.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. That covenant-interest, and an evidence of it, give right to the
          real of the covenant, which was circumcision formerly, and baptism
          now, is false; and this writer has not proved it, nor infants
          covenant-interest, as we have seen already. He should have first
          proved that circumcision was a seal of the covenant of grace formerly,
          and baptism the real of it now, before he talked of covenant-interest
          giving a right to either. Admitting that circumcision was a real of
          the covenant of grace formerly, (though it was not) yet interest in
          that covenant and evidence of interest in it, did not give right to
          all in it to the seal of it, as it is called; since there were many
          who had evidently an interest in the covenant of grace, when
          circumcision was first appointed, and yet had no right to it; as Shem,
          Arphaxad, Lot, and others; and even many who were in the covenant made
          with Abraham, as this writer himself will allow, who had no right to
          this seal, even all his female offspring: to say, they were virtually
          circumcised in the males, is false and foolish; to have a thing
          virtually by another, is to have it by proxy, who represents another;
          but were the males the proxies and representatives of the females? had
          they been so, then indeed when they were circumcised, the females were
          virtually circumcised with them; and so it was all one as if they had
          been circumcised in their own persons; which to have been, would have
          been unlawful and sinful, not being by the appointment of God: as for
          its being unlawful for uncircumcised persons to eat of the passover,
          this must be understood of such who ought to be circumcised, and does
          not affect the females, who ought not, and so might eat, though they
          were really uncircumcised; nor had the males themselves any right to
          it till the eighth day; and so it was not covenant-interest, but a
          command from God, that gave them a right; and such an order is
          necessary to any person’s right to baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, admitting for argument-sake, that baptism is a seal of the
          covenant, does not this Gentleman also believe, that the Lord’s-supper
          is a seal of it likewise? and if covenant-interest gives a right to
          the seals, why not to one seal as well as the other? and why are not
          infants admitted to the Lord’s table, as well as to baptism? Moreover,
          it is evidence of interest, this writer says, that gives a right to
          the seal; and what is that evidence? Surely if faith and repentance
          are the conditions of the covenant, as before asserted, they must be
          the evidence? and therefore, according to his own argument, it should
          first appear, that infants have faith and repentance as the evidence
          of their covenant interest, before they are admitted to the seal of
          it; and such only according to the injunction of Christ, and the
          practice of his apostles, were admitted to baptism; as the passages
          below shew (Mat 28:19; Mk 16:16; Acts 2:38-39; Acts 10:47), which our
          author refers us to. And now, Sir, after a long ramble, we are come to
          Abraham’s covenant itself, and to the questions concerning it; as, of
          what kind it is; with whom made; and whether circumcision was the real
          of the covenant of grace; and whether baptism is come in its room, and
          is the seal of it. Now as to the
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First of these, of what kind was the covenant with Abraham, Gen
          17:1-27? I have asserted, that it was not the pure covenant of grace,
          but of a mixed kind; consisting partly of promises of temporal things,
          and partly of spiritual ones; and you will easily observe, Sir, that
          the exceptions of this writer to the arguments I make use of in proof
          of it, are for the most part founded on his mistaken notions of the
          conditionality of the covenant of grace, and on that stupid and
          senseless distinction of the inward and outward covenant, before
          exploded; wherefore since these are groundless conceits and sandy
          foundations, what is built upon them must necessarily fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The same may be observed with respect to that part of the
          question, which relates to the covenant being made with all Abraham’s
          seed according to the flesh, as a covenant of grace; by the help of
          which unscriptural and irrational distinction, he can find a place in
          the covenant of grace for a persecuting Ishmael, a profane Esau, and
          all the wicked Jews in all ages, in all times of defection and
          apostasy; but if he can find no better covenant to put the infants of
          believers into, nor better company to place them with, who
          notwithstanding their covenant-interest, may be lost and damned, it
          will be a very insignificant thing with considerate persons, whether
          they are in this Utopian covenant or no.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. As to that part of the question which relates to the natural seed
          of believing Gentiles being in Abraham’s covenant, or to that being
          made with them as a covenant of grace, it is by me denied. This writer
          says, I add a stroke, as he calls it, that at once cuts off all
          Abraham’s natural seed, and all the natural seed of believing
          Gentiles, from having any share in the covenant; since I say, "That to
          none can spiritual blessings belong, but to a spiritual seed, not a
          natural one." But he might have observed, that this is explained in
          the same page thus, "not to the natural seed of either of them as
          such." He says, it is not requisite to a person’s visible title and
          claim to the external privileges of the covenant, that he should be
          truly regenerate, or a sincere believer;" and yet he elsewhere says,
          "that to repent and believe must be the sinner’s own voluntary chosen
          acts, before he can have any actual saving interest in the privileges
          of the covenant:" let him reconcile these together. He has not proved,
          nor is he able to prove, that the natural seed of believing Gentiles,
          as such, are the spiritual seed of Abraham; since only they that are
          Christ’s, or believers in him, or who walk in the steps of the faith
          of Abraham, are his spiritual seed; which cannot be said of all the
          natural seed of believing Gentiles, or of any of them as such. That
          clause in Abraham’s covenant, A father of many nations have I made
          thee (Gen 17:4-5) is to be understood only of the faithful, or of
          believers in all nations; and not of all nations that bear the
          Christian name, as comprehending all in them, grown persons and
          infants, good and bad men; and only to such who are of the faith of
          Abraham does the apostle apply it (Rom4:16); the stranger, and his
          male seed, that submitted to circumcision, may indeed be said to be in
          the covenant of circumcision; but it does not follow, that these were
          in the covenant of grace; there were many of Abraham’s own natural
          seed that were in the covenant of circumcision, who were not in the
          covenant of grace; and it would be very much, that the natural seed of
          strangers, and even of believing Gentiles, should have a superior
          privilege to the natural seed of Abraham. Those, and those only, in a
          judgment of charity, are to be reckoned the spiritual seed, who openly
          believe in Christ, as I have expressed it; about which phrase this man
          makes a great pother, when the sense is plain and easy; and that it
          designs such who make a visible profession of their faith, and are
          judged to be partakers of the grace of the covenant; which certainly
          is the best evidence of their interest in it; and therefore it must be
          best to wait till this appears, before any claim of privilege can be
          made; and is no other than what this writer himself says in the words
          before referred to. Though, after all, I stand by my former assertion,
          that covenant-interest, even when made out clear and plain, gives not
          right to any ordinance without a positive order or direction from God;
          and he may call it a conceit of mine if he pleases; he is right in it,
          that according to it, no person living is capable of (that is, has a
          right unto) the ordinances and visible privileges of the church upon
          any grounds of covenant-interest, without a positive direction from
          God for it; as there was for circumcision, so there should be for
          baptism; as, with respect to the former, many who were in the covenant
          of grace had no concern with it, having no direction from the Lord
          about it; so though persons may be in the covenant of grace, yet if
          they are not pointed out by the Lord, as those whom he wills to be the
          subjects of it, they have no right unto it. To say, that Lot and
          others were under a former administration of the covenant, on whom
          circumcision was not enjoined, is saying nothing; unless he can tell
          us what that former administration of it was, and wherein it differed
          from the administration of it to Abraham and his seed; to instance in
          circumcision, would be begging the question, since that is the thing
          instanced in; by which it appears that covenant-interest gives no
          right to an ordinance, without a special direction; and the same holds
          good of baptism. His sense of Mk 16:16 is, that infants are included
          in the profession of their believing parents, and why not in their
          baptism too? and so there is no necessity of their baptism; the text
          countenances one as much as it does the other, and both are equally
          stupid and senseless.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The next inquiry is, whether circumcision was the seal of the
          covenant of grace to Abraham’s natural seed. It is called a token or
          sign, but not a seal; this writer says, though a token, simply
          considered, does not necessarily imply a seal, yet the token of a
          covenant, or promise, can be nothing else: if it can be nothing else,
          it does necessarily imply it; unless there is any real difference
          between a token simply considered, and the token of a covenant, which
          he would do well to shew circumcision was nothing else but a sign or
          mark in the flesh, appointed by the covenant; and therefore that is
          called the covenant in their flesh; and not because circumcision was
          any confirming token or seal of the covenant to any of Abraham’s
          natural seed: it was a sign and seal of the righteousness of faith to
          Abraham; that that righteousness which he had by faith before his
          circumcision, should come upon the uncircumcised Gentiles; but was no
          seal of that, nor any thing else, to any others: and according to our
          author’s notion of it, it was neither a seal of Abraham’s faith, nor
          of his righteousness; then surely not of any others; and yet in
          contradiction to this, he says, it is "a seal of the covenant of
          grace, wherein this privilege of justification by faith is confirmed
          and conveyed to believers;" and if to believers, then surely not to
          all Abraham’s natural seed, unless he can think they were all
          believers; though his real notion, if I understand him right, is, that
          it is no confirming sign, or seal of any spiritual blessings to any;
          since the subjects of it, as he owns, may have neither faith nor
          righteousness; but of the truth of the covenant itself; that God has
          made one; but this needs no such sign or seal; the word of God is
          sufficient, which declares it and assures of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The next thing that comes under consideration, is, whether baptism
          succeeds circumcision; and is the seal of the covenant of grace to
          believers, and their natural seed.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This author endeavors to prove that baptism succeeds circumcision
          from Col 2:11, but in vain; for the apostle is speaking not of
          corporal, but of spiritual circumcision, of which the former was a
          typical resemblance; and so shewing, that believing Gentiles have that
          through Christ which was signified by it; and which the apostle
          describes, by the manner of its being effected, without hands, without
          the power of man, by the efficacy of divine grace; and by the
          substance and matter of it, which lay in the putting off the body of
          the sins of the flesh; and without a tautology, as this writer
          suggests, by the author of it, Christ, who by his Spirit effects it,
          and therefore is called the circumcision of Christ; and is
          distinguished from baptism, described in the next verse: and as weak
          and insignificant is his proof from the analogy between baptism and
          circumcision; some things said of baptism and circumcision are not
          true; as that they are sacraments of admission into the church: Not so
          was circumcision; not of the Gentiles, who had it not, nor were
          admitted by it, and yet were in the church; nor even of the males, for
          they were not circumcised till eight days old, yet were of the Jewish
          church, which was national, as loon as born; and persons may be
          baptized, and yet not be entered into any visible church: Nor are they
          badges of relation to the God of Israel; since on the one hand,
          persons might have one or the other, yet have no spiritual relation to
          God; and on the other hand, be without either, and yet be related to
          him: nor are either of them seals and signs of the covenant of grace,
          as before shewn: nor is baptism absolutely requisite to a person’s
          approach to God with confidence and acceptance in any religious duty,
          private or public. Baptism serves not to the same use and purpose in
          many things that circumcision did; it is not the middle wall of
          partition; nor does it bind men to keep the whole law, as
          circumcision; and though there may be some seeming agreement,
          arguments from analogy are weak and dangerous: so from the priest’s
          offering a propitiatory sacrifice, wearing the linen ephod, and one
          high priest being above all other priests, the Papists argue for a
          minister’s offering a real propitiatory sacrifice, for wearing the
          surplice, and for a Pope, or universal Bishop; and others from the
          same topic argue for tithes being due to ministers, and for the
          inequality of bishops and presbyters, there being an high priest and
          inferior ores: and to this tends our author’s third argument, that
          either baptism succeeds circumcision, or there is nothing at all
          instituted in its room; nor is there any necessity that there should,
          any more than that there should be a Pope in the room of an high
          priest, or any thing to answer to Easter, Pentecost, etc. all which,
          as circumcision, had their end in Christ nor does the Lord’s-supper
          come in the room of the passover; what answers to that is, Christ the
          passover sacrificed for us; and did it, by this argument from analogy,
          infants ought to be admitted to the Lord’s-supper, as they were to the
          passover: by this way of arguing, and at this door, may be brought in
          all the Jewish rites and ceremonies, under other names: and after all,
          what little agreement may be imagined is between them, the difference
          is notorious in many things; some of which this author is obliged to
          own; as in the subjects of them, the one being only males, the other
          males and females; the one being by blood, the other by water; and
          besides they differ as to the persons by whom, and the places where,
          and the uses for which, they are performed; wherefore from analogy and
          resemblance is no proof of succession, but the contrary. My argument
          from baptism being in force before circumcision, to prove that the one
          did not succeed the other, is so far from being allowed by our author
          a proof of it, that he will not allow it to be a bare probability,
          unless I could prove they had been all along contemporary: but if I
          cannot do it, he and his brethren can, who give credit to the Jewish
          custom of baptizing their proselytes and children; and which they make
          to be a practice, for which the Jews fetch proof as early as the times
          of Jacob; and I hope, if he will abide by this, he will allow that
          baptism could not come in the room of circumcision.

          2. He next attempts to prove that baptism is a real of the covenant of
          grace to believers and their seed, by a wretched perversion of several
          passages of scripture (Jn 3:33; Mk 16:16; Mat 28:19; 1 Pet 3:21; 1Cor
          12:13), in which no mention is made of the covenant of grace, and much
          less of baptism as a real of it; and which only speak of believers,
          and not a syllable of their infants; and all of them clear proofs,
          that believers, and they only, are the proper subjects of baptism; as
          may easily be observed by the bare reading of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. My sentiment of the ordinances of baptism and the Lord’s supper not
          being seals of the covenant of grace, he thinks, is borrowed from the
          Socinians. These have no better notion or’ the covenant of grace than
          himself, nor of the efficacy of the blood of Christ for the
          ratification of it, nor of the sealing work of the spirit of God upon
          the hearts of his people. My sentiment is borrowed from the
          scriptures, and is established by them; the blood of Christ confirms
          and ratifies the covenant, the blessings and promises of it, and is
          therefore called the blood of the everlasting covenant; the blessed
          spirit is the sealer of believers interest in it, or assures them of
          it (Heb 13:20; Eph 1:13) So that there are not two seals of the
          covenant of grace, as he wrongly observes. The blood of Christ makes
          the covenant itself lure, and is in this sense the seal of that; the
          spirit of God is the seal of interest in it to particular persons; and
          in neither sense do or can ordinances seal.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Upon the whole, what has this author been doing throughout this
          chapter? has he proved that the natural seed of believers, as such,
          are in the covenant of grace? he has not. The covenant he attempts to
          prove they are in, according to his own account of it, is no covenant
          of grace. Does it secure any one spiritual blessing to the carnal seed
          of believers? it does not. Does it secure regenerating, renewing,
          sanctifying grace, or pardoning grace, or justifying grace, or
          adopting grace, or eternal life? it does not. And if so, I leave it to
          be judged of by such that have any knowledge of the covenant, if such
          a covenant can be called the covenant of grace; or what spiritual
          Caving advantage is to be had from an interest in such a covenant,
          could it be proved. He would have his readers believe, that the
          covenant, he pleads infants have an interest in, is the same under all
          dispensations, and in all ages: the covenant of grace is indeed the
          same, but the covenant he puts the infant-seed of believers into, is
          only an external administration; and this, he himself being judge,
          cannot have been always the same. This external administration,
          according to himself, was first by sacrifices, and then by
          circumcision, and now by baptism; for what else he means by an
          external administration, than an administration of ordinances, cannot
          be conceived; and then by infants being in the covenant, is no other
          than having ordinances administered to them; and so their being in the
          covenant now, is no other than their being baptized; and yet he says,
          "the main foundation of the right of infants to baptism, is their
          interest in the covenant;" that is, the external administration they
          are under, or the administration of baptism to them, is the main
          foundation of their right to baptism. They are baptized, therefore
          they are and ought to be baptized; such an account of
          covenant-interest, and of right to baptism from it, is a mere begging
          the question, and proving idem per idem, yea is downright nonsense and
          contradiction: and so, when baptism is said to be the seal of the
          covenant, that is, of the external administration, which
          administration is that of baptism, the sense is, baptism is the seal
          of baptism. This senseless jargon is the amount of all the reasonings
          throughout this chapter: Such mysterious stuff, such glaring
          contradictions, and stupid nonsense, I leave him and his admirers to
          please themselves with.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. From hence it appears, that the clamorous out-cry of cutting off
          infants from their covenant-right, and so abridging and lessening
          their privileges, is all a noise about nothing; since it is in vain to
          talk about cutting off from the covenant of grace, when they were
          never in it; as the natural seed of believers, as such, never were,
          under any dispensation whatever; and even what is pleaded for, is only
          an external administration, which neither conveys grace, nor secures
          any spiritual blessings; wherefore what privileges are infants
          deprived of by not being baptized? Let it be shewn if it can, what
          spiritual blessings infants said to be baptized have, which our
          infants unbaptized have not; to instance in baptism itself, would be
          begging the question; it would still be asked, what spiritual
          privilege or profit comes to an infant by its baptism? If our infants
          have as many, or the same privileges under the gospel-dispensation,
          without baptism, as others have with it; then their privileges are not
          abridged or lessened, and the clamor must be a groundless one. To say,
          that baptism admits into the Christian church, as circumcision into
          the Jewish church, are both false, as has been proved already; our
          author, it seems, did not know, that a national church was a carnal
          one; whereas a national church can be no other, since all born in a
          nation are members of it, and become so by their birth, which is
          carnal; for, whatsoever is born of the flesh is flesh. Whereas a
          gospel-church, gathered out of the world, does, or should consist,
          only of such who are born again, and have an understanding of
          spiritual things. This writer seems to suggest, that if infants are
          not admitted to this external administration, and real of the covenant
          he pleads for, their condition is deplorable, and there is no ground
          of hope of their eternal salvation; and does their being admitted into
          this external administration make their condition better with respect
          to everlasting salvation? not at all; since, according to our author,
          persons may be in this, and yet not in the covenant of grace, as
          hypocrites may be; and he distinguishes this visible and external
          administration from the spiritual dispensation and efficacy of the
          covenant of grace; so that persons may be in the one, and yet be
          everlastingly lost; and therefore what ground of hope of eternal
          salvation does this give? or what ground of hope does non-admission
          into it deprive them of? Is salvation inseparably connected with
          baptism? or does it ensure it to any? How unreasonable then, and
          without foundation, is this clamorous outcry? And now, Sir, we are
          come to
        </p>
        <p>
          The fifth chapter of my treatise, which considers the several texts of
          scripture produced in favor of Infant-baptism; and the first is Acts
          2:38-39. Now, not to take notice of this author’s foolish
          impertinencies, and with which his book abounds, and would be endless
          to observe; for which reason I mention them not, that I might not
          swell this letter too large, and impose upon your patience in reading
          it; you will easily observe, Sir, the puzzle and confusion he is
          thrown into to make the exhortation to repent, urged in order to the
          enjoyment of the promise, to agree with infants; and which is
          mentioned as previous to baptism, and in order to it. That this
          passage can furnish out no argument in favor of Infant-baptism, will
          appear by the plain, clear, and easy sense of it; Peter had charged
          the Jews with the sin of crucifying Christ; their consciences were
          awakened, and loaded with the guilt of it; in their distress, being
          pricked to the heart, they inquire what they should do, as almost
          despairing of mercy to be shewn to such great sinners; they are told,
          that notwithstanding their sin was so heinous, yet if they truly
          repented of it, and submitted to Christ and his ordinances,
          particularly to baptism, the promise of life and salvation belonged to
          them, nor need they doubt of an interest in it: and whereas they had
          imprecated his blood, not only upon themselves, but upon their
          posterity, more immediate and more remote, for which they were under
          great concern; they are told this promise of salvation by Christ
          reached to them also, provided they repented and were baptized; and
          which is the reason that mention is made of their children; yea, even
          to them that were afar off, their brethren the Jews in distant
          countries, that should hear the gospel, repent and believe, and be
          baptized; or should live in ages to come in the latter day, and should
          look on him whom they have pierced, and mourn; and so has nothing to
          do with the covenant with Abraham and his natural seed, and much less
          with the Gentiles and theirs: and be it so, that the Gentiles are
          meant by those afar off, which may be admitted, since it is sometimes
          a descriptive character of them; yet no mention is made of their
          children; and had they been mentioned, the limiting clause, even as
          many as the Lord our God shall call, plainly points at, and describes
          the persons intended; not among the Gentiles only, but the Jews also,
          as agreeable to common sense and the rules of grammar; and is to be
          understood only of the Jews that are called by grace, and of their
          children, that are effectually, called, and of the Gentiles called
          with an holy calling, as the persons to whom the promise belongs; and
          which appears evident by their repentance and baptism, which this is
          an encouraging motive to; and therefore can be understood only of
          adult persons, and not of infants; and of whole baptism not a syllable
          is mentioned, nor can it be inferred from this passage, or established
          by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The next passage of scripture produced in favor of Infant-baptism,
          and to as little purpose, is Mat 19:14 it is owned by our author, that
          these children were not brought to Christ to be baptized by him; and
          that they were not baptized by him; these things, he says, they do not
          affirm. For what then is the passage produced? why, to shew, that
          infants become proselytes to Christ by baptism; and is not this to be
          baptized? what a contradiction is this? And afterwards another
          self-contradiction follows: he imagines these infants had been
          baptized already, and yet were commanded to become proselytes by
          baptism, and so Anabaptists; but how does it appear that it was the
          will of Christ they should become proselytes to him this way? from the
          etymology of the Greek word, which signifies to come to; so, wherever
          the word is used of persons as coming to Christ, it is to be
          understood of their becoming proselytes to him by baptism: it is used
          in Mat 16:1 the Pharisees also with the Sadducees—pro selqonteV ,
          "came tempting him." Did they become proselytes to him by baptism?
          what stupid stuff is this? nay the Devil himself is said to come to
          him, and when the Tempter— proselqwn, came to him, he said, etc. Mat
          4:3. our author surely does not think he became a proselyte to him.
          That it was the custom of the Jews, before the times of Christ, to
          baptize the children of proselytes, is not a fact so well attested, as
          is said; the writings from whence the proof is taken, were written
          some hundreds of years after Christ’s time; and the very first persons
          that mention it, dispute it; one alarming there was such a custom, and
          the other denying it; and were it far, since it was only a tradition
          of the elders at best, and not a command of God, it is not credible
          that our Lord should follow it, or enforce such a practice on his
          followers: the coming of these children was merely corporal, whatever
          it was for, and temporary; there is no other way of coming to Christ,
          or becoming proselytes to him, but by believing in him, embracing his
          doctrines, and obeying his commands; and when children are capable of
          these things, and do them, we are ready to acknowledge them the
          proselytes of Christ, and admit them to baptism: nor does the reason
          given in the text, for of such is the kingdom of heaven, prove their
          right to baptism; for not to insist on the metaphorical sense of these
          words, which yet Calvin gives into; but supposing infants literally
          are meant, the kingdom of heaven cannot be understood of the
          gospel-church-state; which is not national but congregational,
          consisting of men gathered out of the world by the grace of God, and
          who make a public profession of Christ, which infants are not capable
          of, and so not taken into it; and were they, they must have an equal
          right to the Lord’s supper as to baptism, and of which they are
          equally capable; for does the Lord’s supper require in the receivers
          of it a competent measure of Christian knowledge, the exercise of
          reason and understanding, and their active powers, as this writer
          says, so does baptism. But by the kingdom of heaven, is meant the
          heavenly glory; and we deny not, that there are infants that belong to
          it, though who they are, we know not; nor is this any argument for
          their admission to baptism; it is one thing what Christ does himself,
          he may admit them into heaven; it is another thing what we are to do,
          the rule of which is his revealed will: we cannot admit them into a
          church-state, or to any ordinance, unless he has given us an order so
          to do; and besides, it: is time enough to talk of their admission to
          baptism, when it appears they have a right unto, and a meetness for
          the kingdom of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Another passage brought into this controversy is Mat 18:16; this
          is owned to be less convictive, because interpreters are divided about
          the sense of it; some understanding it of children in knowledge and
          grace, others of children in age, to which our author inclines, for
          the sake of his hypothesis; though he knows not how to reject the
          former: my objections to the latter sense, he says, have no great
          weight in them; it seems they have some. I will add a little more to
          them, shewing that not little ones in a literal, but figurative sense,
          are meant, even the disciples of Christ, that actually believed in
          him: the word here used is different from that which is used of little
          children, verse 3. and is manifestly used of the disciples of Christ
          (Mat 10:42), and the parallel text in Mk 9:41-42 most clearly shews,
          that the little ones that believed in Christ, which were not to be
          offended, were his apostles, that belonged to him; quite contrary to
          what this writer produces it for; who has most miserably mangled and
          tortured this passage: Moreover there was but one little child, Christ
          took and set in the midst of his disciples, whereas he has regard to
          several little ones then present, and whom, as it were, he points
          unto; one of which to offend, would be resented; and plainly designs
          the apostles then present, who not only had the principle of faith,
          but exercised it, as the word used signifies; and who were capable of
          being scandalized, and of having stumbling-blocks thrown in their way,
          and taking offense at them; which infants in age are not capable of:
          that senseless rant of cutting off infants from their right in the
          covenant of salvation, and from the privileges of the gospel, (I
          suppose he means by denying baptism to them) being an offense and
          injury to them, and the whining cant upon this, are mean and
          despicable: his reasons, why the apostles of Christ cannot be meant,
          because contending for pre-eminence, they discovered a temper of mind
          opposite to little children, has no force in it; for Christ calls them
          little ones, partly because they ought to be as little children, verse
          3, and in some sense were so; and partly to mortify their pride and
          vanity, as well as to express his tender affection and regard for
          them, see verse 10, and since infants are not meant, it is in vain to
          dispute about their faith, either as to principle or act, and what
          right that gives to baptism; and especially since profession of faith,
          and consent to be baptized, are necessary to the administration of
          that ordinance, and to the subjects of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Next we have his remarks on the exceptions to the sense of 1Cor
          7:14 contended for: the sense of internal holiness derived from
          parents to children is rejected by him; but there is another, which he
          seems to have a good will unto: he says there are some reasons to
          support it, and he does not object to it; yet chooses not to adhere to
          it, though if established, would put an end to the controversy; and
          that is, that the word sanctified signifies baptized, and the word
          holy, Christians baptized; and then the sense is, "the unbelieving
          husband is baptized by the believing wife, and the unbelieving wife is
          baptized by the believing husband; else were your children unbaptized,
          but now they are baptized Christians;" the bare mention of which is
          confutation sufficient. The sense our author prefers is a visible
          federal holiness: but what that holiness is, for any thing he has said
          to clear it, remains in the dark: covenant-holiness, or what the
          covenant of grace promises, and secures to all interested in it, is
          clear and plain, internal holiness of heart, and outward holiness of
          life and conversation flowing from that (Ezek 36:25-27); But are the
          infants of believers, as such, partakers of this holiness? or is such
          holiness as this communicated unto, or does it appear upon all the
          natural seed of believers? This will not be said; experience and facts
          are against it; they are born in sin, and are by nature children of
          wrath, as others; and many of them are never partakers of real
          holiness, and are as profligate as others; and on the other hand, some
          of the children of unbelievers are partakers of true holiness: if it
          be said, and which seems to be our author’s meaning, that it is such a
          holiness the people of the Jews had in distinction from the Heathens,
          and therefore are called an holy seed; this cannot be, since the
          holiness of the Jewish seed lay in the lawful issue of a Jewish man
          and a Jewish woman: if a Jewish man married an Heathen woman, their
          issue was not holy, as appears from Ezra and Nehemiah; whereas,
          according to the apostle, if a Christian man married an Heathen woman,
          or a Christian woman an Heathen man, their issue were holy: should it
          be said, as it is suggested by our author, that so indeed it was in
          Ezra’s times, according to the Jewish law; but now, since the coming
          of Christ, the national difference is abolished; which he makes to be
          the sense of the apostle, and therein betrays his ignorance of the
          apostle’s argument and method of reasoning; for the particle now, as
          Beza observes, is not in this place an adverb of time, but a
          conjunction, which is commonly used in assumptions of argument, which
          destroys our author’s argument, and lets aside his method of
          reasoning, which he seems fond of, and afterwards repeats: it remains
          therefore, that only a matrimonial holiness is here intended; and
          surely marriage may be said to be holy, as it is by the apostle
          honorable, and for that reason (Heb 13:4), without savoring strong of
          popery, or savoring the notion of marriage being a sacrament, as this
          writer insinuates; who has got a strange nose, and a stranger
          judgment: whether he is a single or a married man, I know not; he
          appears to have a bad opinion of marriage. That infants born in lawful
          wedlock cannot be called holy, being legitimate, without favoring of
          popery. As he is not able to set aside the sense of the word
          sanctified given by me, as signifying espoused; he requires of me to
          prove that the word holy means legitimate; for which I refer him to
          Ezra 9:2 where those born of parents, both Jewish, are called an holy
          seed; that is, a lawful one; in opposition to, and in distinction from
          a spurious and illegitimate issue, born of parents, the one Jewish and
          the other Heathen: and this is the same with the godly seed, in Mal
          2:15. which Calvin interprets legitimate, in distinction from those
          that are born in polygamy: nor will any other sense suit with the care
          proposed to the apostle; nor with his answer and manner of reasoning
          about it; who says not one word era covenant whereby an unbelieving
          yoke-fellow is sanctified to a believing one, or of the federal
          holiness of the children of both; but argues, that if their marriage,
          being unequal, was not valid, which was their scruple, their children
          must be unclean, as bastards were accounted (Deut 23:2); whereas it
          being good, their children were legitimate, and so might be easy, and
          continue together as they ought.

        <p>
          The passage out of the Talmud, which he has at second-hand from Dr.
          Lightfoot, designs by Holiness, Judaism, and not Christianity, and is
          quite impertinent to the purpose; nor can it be thought to be alluded
          to, since the holiness the Jews speak of, respects the parents, as
          both proselytes to Judaism; whereas the apostle’s case supposes one an
          Heathen, and the other a Christian: and he might have observed by a
          tradition quoted by the Doctor, in the same place, that such a
          marriage the apostle was considering, is condemned by the Jews as no
          marriage, and the issue of it as illegitimate; which asserts, that a
          son begotten of a Heathen woman is not a son, his lawful son; just the
          reverse of what the apostle suggested: and after all, our author
          himself seems to make this holiness no other than a civil holiness,
          and which secures a civil relation, by which "the unbelieving
          yoke-fellow is sanctified, so far as concerns the believing party;
          that is, for lawful cohabitation, conjugal society, and the
          propagation of a holy covenant-seed;" for all which purposes, lawful
          marriages may be allowed to sanctify, if only instead of a holy
          covenant-seed, a legitimate feed is put. So that upon the whole, this
          passage does not furnish out the least shew of argument for
          Infant-baptism. Come we to
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The next passage produced in favor of Infant-baptism, which are the
          words of the commission in Mat 28:19-20, one would think there should
          be no difficulty in understanding these words; and that the plain and
          easy sense of them is, that such as are taught by the ministry of the
          word, should be baptized, and they only; and if there was any doubt
          about this, yet it might be removed by comparing the same commission
          with this, as differently expressed in Mk 16:15-16 from whence it
          clearly appears, that to teach all nations, is to preach the gospel to
          every creature; and that the persons among all nations, that may be
          said to be taught, or made disciples by teaching, are believers, and
          being so, are to be baptized; he that believeth and is baptized, shall
          be saved. It is observed by this writer, that the acts of discipling
          and baptizing are of equal extent: it is agreed to, provided it be
          allowed, as it ought, that the word, teach, or make disciples,
          describes and limits the persons to be baptized; for such only of all
          nations are to be baptized, who are made disciples by teaching; not
          all the individuals of all nations; no, not even where the gospel
          comes, and is preached; for many hear it, and more might, who are not
          taught by it; and even when the seventh trumpet shall sound, and all
          nations shall serve the Lord, this will not be true of every
          individual of all nations, only of such, who are qualified for, and
          capable of serving the Lord; and so of adult persons only, and not of
          infants at all: and was this the care, that all nations in the
          commission are under no limitation and restriction, then not only the
          children of Pagans, Turks, and Jews, but even all adult persons, the
          most vile and profligate, should be baptized; wherefore the phrase,
          all nations to be baptized, must be restrained and limited to those
          who are made disciples out of all nations; who are the antecedent to
          the relative, them that are to be baptized, and not all nations; and
          though there is a frequent change of gender in the Greek language,
          which is owned; yet as Piscator, a learned Paedobaptist, on the text
          observes, "the syntax (of them) is referred to "the sense, and not to
          the word, since nations went before;" and the same observation he
          makes on the passage our author has produced as parallel (Rom2:14),
          but in order to bring infants to this restrictive and qualifying
          character for baptism, it is said, they are made disciples with their
          parents, when they become so, as parts of themselves: and why may they
          not be said to be baptized with them, when they are baptized, as parts
          of themselves, and so have no need of baptism? No doubt, if Christ had
          continued the use of circumcision under the New-Testament, and had bid
          his apostles to go and disciple the nations, circumcising them, they
          would have needed no direction as to infants, as is suggested; and
          that for this plain reason, because there had been a previous express
          command for the circumcision of them; but there is no such command to
          baptize infants previous to the commission, and therefore could not be
          understood in like manner. But it seems the known custom of the Jews
          to baptize the children of proselytes with them, was a plain and
          sufficient direction as to the subjects of baptism, and is the reason
          why no express mention is made of them in the commission: But it does
          not appear there was any such custom among the Jews, when the
          commission was given; had it been so early, as is pretended, even in
          the times of Jacob, it is strange there should be no hint of it in the
          Old Testament: nor in the apocryphal writings; nor in the writings of
          the New Testament; nor in Josephus; nor in Philo the Jew; nor in the
          Jewish Misnah; only in the Talmud; which was not composed till five
          hundred years after Christ; and this custom is at first reported by a
          single Rabbi, and at the same time denied by another of equal credit
          and authority: and admitting that this was a custom that then
          obtained, since it was not of divine institution, but of human
          invention, had our Lord thought fit (which is not reasonable to
          suppose) to take it into his New Testament ordinance of baptism; yet
          it would have been necessary to have made express mention of it, as
          his will that it should be observed, in order to remove the scruple
          that might arise from its being a mere Jewish custom and tradition.
          But to proceed: though this writer may be able to find in the schools
          within his knowledge, such ignorant disciples and learners, that have
          learned nothing at all; CHRIST has none such in his school: Christ
          says, none can be a disciple of his, but who has learned to deny
          himself, take up his cross, and follow him (Lk 14:26-27; Lk 14:33),
          and forsake all for him; and this man says, they may be called
          disciples, that have learned nothing, and be enrolled among the
          disciples of Christ, who are incapable of outward teaching: but who
          are we to believe, Christ, or this man? He suggests, that it would be
          impracticable to put the commission in execution, if none but true
          disciples and believers are to be baptized, since the heart cannot be
          inspected, and man may be deceived; and observes, that the apostles
          baptized immediately upon profession, and waited not for the fruits of
          it, and some of which are not true disciples, but hypocrites: this is
          what he often harps upon; and to which I answer, the apostles had no
          doubt a greater spirit of discerning, and so could observe the signs
          of true faith and discipleship in men, without long waiting; but they
          never baptized any whom they did not judge to be true disciples and
          believers, and who professed themselves to be such: and though they
          were in some few instances mistaken; this might be suffered, that
          ministers and churches might not be discouraged, when such instances
          should appear in following times; and this is satisfaction enough in
          this point, when men keep as close as they can to the divine rule, and
          make the best judgment of persons they are able; and when, in a
          judgment of charity, they are thought to be true disciples of Christ,
          baptize them; in which they do their duty, though it may fall out
          otherwise; and in which they are to be justified by the word of God;
          which they could not, were they to administer the ordinance to such
          who have no appearance of the grace of God, and the truth of it in
          them. The text in Acts 15:10 is far from proving infants disciples;
          they are not designed in that place, nor included in the character;
          for though no doubt the Judaizing preachers were for having the
          Gentiles, and their infants too, circumcised; yet it was not
          circumcision, the thing itself, that is meant by the intolerable yoke,
          attempted to be put upon the necks of the disciples; for that was what
          the Jewish fathers and their children were able to bear, and had borne
          in ages past; but it was the doctrine of the necessity of that, and
          other rites of Moses to salvation; and which could not be imposed upon
          infants, but upon adult persons only. Next we proceed to
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The passages concerning the baptism of whole households, as an
          explanation of the commission, and of the apostles understanding it:
          Now since Infant-baptism, as we have seen, cannot be established by
          Abraham’s covenant, nor by circumcision, nor by any command of Christ,
          nor by his commission, nor by any instances of infants baptized in the
          times of John the Baptist, or of Christ; if any instances of infants
          baptized by the apostles are proposed, they should be clear and plain:
          Since there is no express precept, which might justly be demanded; if
          any precedent is produced, it ought to be quite unexceptionable; if it
          is expected, such a practice should be given into by thinking people.
          Three families or households we read of, that were baptized, and these
          are the precedents proposed; yet no proof is made of any one infant in
          these families, or of the baptism of any in them; which should be
          done, if the former could be proved: but instead of this, the
          advocates for this practice are drove to this poor and miserable
          shift, to put us on proving the negative, that there were no infants
          in them. Our author thinks it utterly incredible, that in three such
          families there should be no infants, when, in so large a country as
          Egypt, there was not a family without a child (Ex 12:30); and is so
          weak as to believe, or however hopes to find readers weak enough to
          believe, that all the first-born of the Egyptians that were slain were
          infants; whereas there might be many of them twenty, thirty, or forty
          years of age; so that there might be hundreds and thousands of
          families in Egypt that had not an infant in them, and yet not an house
          in which there was not a dead person.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us attend to these particular families: as for Lydia and her
          household, so far as a negative in such a care as this is capable of
          being proved; this is certain, that no mention is made of any infants
          in her family; it is certain, that there were brethren in her house,
          who were capable of being comforted by the apostles, and were; for it
          is expressly said, that they entered into the house of Lydia, and
          comforted the brethren; which is a proof of what, he says, cannot be
          proved, that they law the brethren at her house; and nothing appears
          to the contrary, but that they were of her household; and if there
          were any other besides them, that were baptized by the apostles, it
          lies upon those that will affirm it, to prove it; without which, this
          instance cannot be in favor of Infant-baptism. As for the Jailor’s
          family, it is owned by our author, that there were some adult persons
          in it, who believed, and were baptized at the same time with the
          Jailor; but he asks, how does this argue that there were no others
          baptized in it, who were in the infantile state? It lies upon him to
          prove it, if there were: The word of God was spoken to all that were
          in his house, and all his house believed in God, and rejoiced in the
          conversation of the apostles, who must be all of them adult persons;
          and if he can find persons in his house, besides those all that were
          in it, I will see him down for a cunning man. Who those expositors
          are, that reader the words, believing in God, he rejoiced all his
          house aver, I know not, any more than I understand the nonsense of it.
          Erasmus and Vatablus join the phrase with all his house, with
          believing, as we do, and Pricaeus makes it parallel with Acts 18:8 but
          however, this writer has found a text to prove, that the children of
          believers are in their infancy accounted believers, and numbered with
          them, it is in Acts 2:44 if he can find any wise-acres that will give
          credit to him. As to the household of Stephanas, he says, that it
          seems probable that it was large and numerous, which renders it more
          likely that there were some infants in it: how large and numerous it
          was, does not appear; but be those of it more or fewer, it is a clear
          case they were adult persons, that we have any account of; since they
          addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints: and now upon what a
          tottering foundation does Infant-baptism stand, having no precept from
          God for it, nor any one single precedent for it in the word of God?
          Come we now,
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. To the last text in the controversy, Rom11:17; Rom11:24 and which
          is the decisive one, and yet purely allegorical; when it is an axiom
          with divines, that symbolical or allegorical divinity is not
          argumentative: there is nothing, says Dr. Owen,[27] "so sottish, or
          foolish, or contradictious in and to itself, as may not be
          countenanced from teaching parables to be instructive, and proving in
          every parcel, or expression, that attends them;" of this we have an
          instance in our author, about engrafting buds with the cyon, and of
          breaking off and grafting in branches with their buds, which he
          applies to parents and their children; though the apostle has not a
          word about it: and indeed he is speaking of an engrafture, not
          according, but contrary to nature; not only of an engrafture of an
          olive-tree, which is never done, but of engrafting a wild cyon into a
          good stock; whereas the usual way is to engraft a good cyon into a
          wild stock. The general scope and design of the allegory is to be
          attended to which is to shew the rejection of the unbelieving Jews
          from, and the reception of the believing Gentiles into the
          gospel-church; for though God did not call away the people among the
          Jews whom he foreknew; or the remnant according to the election of
          grace, of which the apostle was one; yet there was a calling-away of
          that people as a body politic and ecclesiastic, which now continues,
          and will till the fullness of the Gentiles are brought in; and then
          there will be a general conversion of the Jews, of which the
          conversion of some of them in the times of Christ and his apostles
          were the root, first-fruits, pledge, and earnest; and which led on the
          apostle to this allegorical discourse about the olive-tree; which I
          understand of the gospel church-state, in distinction from the Jewish
          church-state, now dissolved. This writer will not allow, that the
          Jewish church, as to its essential constitution, is abolished, only as
          to its outward form of administration: but God has wrote a Loammi upon
          that people, both as a body politic and ecclesastic (Hos 1:9); he has
          unchurched them; he has broke his covenant with them, and their union
          with each other in their church state, signified by his breaking his
          two staffs, beauty and bands (Zec 11:10; Zec 11:14); and if this is
          not the care, the people of the Jews are now the true church of God,
          notwithstanding their rejection of the Messiah; and if the Gentiles
          are incorporated into that church, the gospel-church is, and must be
          national, as that was, and the same with it; whereas it differs from
          it, both as to matter and them, consisting of persons gathered out of
          the world, and enjoying different ordinances, the former being utterly
          abolished. Our author objects to my interpretation of the good
          olive-tree being the gospel church state, from the unbelieving Jews
          being said to be broken-off, and the olive-tree called their own
          olive-tree, and they the natural branches: to which I answer, that the
          breaking of them off, verse 17 is the same with the carting away of
          them, verse 15 and the allegory is not to be stretched beyond its
          scope. The Jewish church being dissolved, the unbelieving Jews lay
          like broken, withered, scattered branches, and so continued, and were
          not admitted into the gospel church state, which is all the apostle
          means: if I have used too soft a term, to say they were left out of
          the gospel-church, since severity is expressed, I may be allowed to
          use one more harsh, and severe; as that they were cast away and
          rejected, they were cut off from all right, and excluded from
          admission into the gospel church, and not suffered to partake of the
          ordinances of it: and as to the gospel church being called their own
          olive-tree, that is, the converted Jews in the latter day, of whom the
          apostle speaks; with great propriety may it be called their own, not
          only because of their right of admission to it, being converted, but
          because the first gospel-church was set up in Jerusalem, was gathered
          out from among the Jews, and consisted of some of their nation, which
          were the first-fruits of those converted ones; and so in other places,
          the first gospel churches consisted of Jews, into which, and not into
          the national church of the Jews, were the Gentiles engrafted, and
          became fellow-heirs with them, and of the same body, partaking of
          gospel-ordinances and privileges: and the natural branches are not the
          natural branches of the olive-tree, but the natural branches or
          natural seed of Abraham, or of the Jewish people, who in the latter
          day will be converted, and brought into the gospel-church, as some of
          them were in the beginning of it. This sense being established, it is
          a clear and plain case, that nothing from hence can be concluded in
          favor of Infant-baptism; of which there is not the least hint, nor any
          manner of reference to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This chapter, you will remember, Sir, is concluded with proofs of
          women’s right to the ordinance of the Lord’s supper: and which are
          such, as cannot be produced, and supported, to prove the right of
          infants to baptism. It is granted by our author, that my arguments are
          in the main conclusive, and he "must be a wrangler that will dispute
          them;" and yet he disputes them himself, and so proves himself a
          wrangler, as indeed he is nothing else throughout the whole of his
          performance. However, he is confident, there are as good proofs of the
          baptism of infants; as, from their being accounted believers and
          disciples (Mat 8:6; Acts 2:44; Acts 15:10); from their being
          church-members (Lk 18:16; 1Cor 7:14; Eph 5:15; Eph 5:26); from the
          probability of some infants baptized in the whole households
          mentioned; all which we have seen are weak, foolish, impertinent, and
          inconclusive. This author does wonderful feats in his own conceit, in
          his knight errantry way; he proves this, and confutes that, and
          baffles the other; and though he brings the same arguments, that have
          been used already; as he owns, and I may add, baffled too already, to
          use his own language; yet he has added fume new illustration and
          enforcement to them, and such as have not occurred to him in any
          author he has seen; so that he would have his reader believe, he is
          some extraordinary man, and has performed wonderful well; and in this
          vainglorious shew, I leave him to the ridicule and contempt of men of
          modesty and good sense, as he justly deserves, and proceed to The
          sixth and last chapter of my treatise, which is concerning the mode of
          administering the ordinance of baptism, whether by immersion, or
          sprinkling; and here, Sir, I observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That our author represents the controversy about this as one of the
          most trifling controversies that ever was managed: but if it is so
          trifling a matter, whether baptism is administered by immersion or
          sprinkling, why do he and his party write with so much heat and
          vehemence, as well as with so much scorn and contempt against the
          former, and so heavily load with calumnies those that defend it, and
          charge them with the breach of the sixth and seventh commands, as it
          has been often done? But if it is so indifferent and trifling a matter
          with this writer, it is not so with us, who think it to be an affair
          of great importance, in what manner an ordinance is to be
          administered; and who judge it essential to baptism, that it be
          performed by immersion, without which it cannot be baptism; nor the
          end of the ordinance answered, which is to represent the burial of
          Christ; and which cannot be done unless the person baptized is covered
          in water.

          2. It is allowed that the word baptizw, with the lexicons and critics,
          signifies to dip; but it is also observed, that they render it to
          wash: which is not denied, since dipping necessarily includes washing;
          whatever is dipped, is washed, and therefore in a consequential sense
          it signifies washing, when its primary sense is dipping. Our author
          does not attempt to prove, that the lexicons and critics ever say it
          signifies to pour or sprinkle; which ought to be done, if any thing is
          done to purpose: indeed he says, with classical writers, it has the
          signification of persuasion, or sprinkling; but does not produce one
          instance of it. He charges me with partiality in concealing part of
          what Mr. Leigh says in his Critica Sacra; which I am not conscious of,
          since my edition, which indeed is one of the former, has not a
          syllable of what is quoted from him; and even that is more for us than
          against us. Hence with great impertinence are those passages of
          scripture produced (Mk 7:3-4; Lk 11:30; Heb 9:10), which are supposed
          to have the signification of washing; since these do not at all
          militate against the sense of dipping, seeing dipping is washing; and
          to as vain a purpose are those scriptures referred to (Eph 5:26; Titus
          3:5; 1Cor 6:11; 2 Pet 1:9; Acts 22:16), which call baptism a washing
          of water, and the washing of regeneration, etc. even supposing they
          are to be understood of baptism; which, at least in several of them,
          is doubtful; since nobody denies, that a person baptized, may be said
          to be washed, he being dipped in water.

          3. It is affirmed that we do not read of one instance of any person
          who repaired to a river, or conflux of water, purely on the design of
          being baptized therein. But certain it is, that John repaired to such
          places for the convenient administration of that ordinance; and many
          repaired to him at those places, purely on a design of being baptized
          by him in them; and particularly it is said of Christ, then cometh
          Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him (Mat
          3:13); and I hope it will be allowed, that he repaired to Jordan, on a
          pure design of being baptized in it; and though it was in a wilderness
          where John was, yet such an one in which were many villages, full of
          inhabitants, as our author might have learned from Dr. Lightfoot;[28]
          where John might have had the convenience of vessels for bringing
          water, had the ordinance been performed by him in any other way, than
          by immersion.
