        <h2>Reply to Divine Right of Infant Baptism 3</h2>
        <p>
          4. The use of the words, baptize and baptism, in scripture, comes next
          under consideration; and,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) the word is used in Acts 1:5 of the extraordinary Gifts of the
          Spirit to the apostles on the day of Pentecost, which is called a
          being baptized with the holy Ghost; and the house in which the
          apostles were, being filled with it, had in it a resemblance to
          baptism by immersion; and hence the use of the phrase. The main
          objection our author makes to this, is, that the disciples were in the
          house before it was filled with the holy Ghost; whereas it should have
          been first filled, and then they enter into it, to carry any
          resemblance in it to immersion: but it matters not, whether the house
          was filled before or after they entered, inasmuch as it was filled
          when they were in, whereby they were encompassed and covered with it;
          which is sufficient to support the allusion to baptism, performed by
          immersion; or covering the person in water: it is represented as
          dissonant from common sense, to say, Ye shall be poured with the holy
          Ghost? and is it not as dissonant from common sense to say, Ye shall
          be poured with the Holy Ghost?
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) The sufferings of Christ are called a baptism (Mk 10:38; Lk
          12:50); and a very apt word is used to express the abundance of them,
          as that signifies an immersion into water; and though the lesser
          sufferings of men, and God’s judgments on them, may be expressed by
          the pouring out of his wrath, and the vials of it on them; yet since
          the holy Ghost has thought fit not to make use of such a phrase, but a
          very peculiar word to express the greater sufferings of Christ, this
          the more confirms the sense of the word contended for. The phrase in
          Ps 22:14. I am poured out like water, doth not express the sufferings
          of Christ, but the effect of them, the faintness of his spirits under
          them. The passages in Ps 69:1-2 which represent him as overwhelmed
          with his sufferings, as in water, do most clearly illustrate the use
          of the word baptism in reference to them, and strongly support the
          allusion to it, as performed by immersion, which this writer has not
          been able to let aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Mention is made in Mk 7:4 of the Jews washing, or baptizing
          themselves, when they come from market, before they eat; and of the
          washing, or baptizing of their cups, pots, brazen vessels, tables or
          beds; all which was done by immersion. This writer says, I am
          contradicted by the best masters of the Jewish learning, when I say,
          that the Jews upon touching common people, or their clothes, at
          market, or in any court of judicature, were obliged by the tradition
          of the elders to immerse themselves in water, and did. To which I
          reply, that Vatablus and Drusius, who were great masters of Jewish
          learning, affirm, that according to the tradition of the elders, the
          Jews washed or immersed the whole body before they ate, when they came
          from market; to whom may be added the learned Grotius, who interprets
          the words the same way; and which seems most reasonable, since washing
          before eating, Mk 7:4 is distinguished from the washing of hands, Mk
          7:3. But not to rest it here; Maimonides,[29] that great matter of
          Jewish learning, assures us, that "if the Pharisees touched but the
          garments of the common people, they were defiled, all one as if they
          had touched a profluvious person, and needed immersion," and were
          obliged to it: and though Dr. Lightfoot, who was a great man in this
          kind of learning, yet not always to be depended upon, is of opinion,
          that the plunging of the whole body is not here understood; yet he
          thinks, that plunging or immersion of the hands in water, is meant,
          done by the Jews being ignorant and uncertain what uncleanness they
          came near unto in the market; and observes, the Jews used the washing
          of the hands, and the plunging of the hands; and that the word wash in
          the Evangelist, seems to answer to the former, and baptize to the
          latter; and Pococke[30] himself, whom this writer refers to, confesses
          the same, and says, that the Hebrew word לכמ to which baptizeqai
          answers in Greek, signifies a further degree of purification, than לטג
          or cerniptein (the words used for washing of hands) though not so as
          necessarily to imply an immersion of the whole body; since the
          greatest and most notorious uncleanness of the hands reached but to
          the wrist, and was cleansed by immersing or dipping up to it; and
          though he thinks the Greek word used in the text does not only and
          necessarily signify immersion, which yet he grants, specially agrees
          to it, as he thinks appears from Lk 11:38. To this may be opposed what
          the great Scaliger[31] says; "the more superstitious part of the Jews,
          not only dipped the feet but the whole body, hence they were called
          Hemerobaptists, who every day before they sat down to food, dipped the
          body; wherefore the Pharisee, who had invited Jesus to dine with him,
          wondered he sat down to meat before he had washed his whole body, Lk
          11:1-54," and after all, be it which it will, whether the immersion of
          the whole body, or only of the hands and feet, that is meant in these
          passages; since the washing of either was by immersion, as owned, it
          is sufficient to support the primary sense of the word contended for:
          and so all other things, after mentioned, according to the tradition
          of the elders, of which only the text speaks, and not of the law of
          God, were washed by immersion; particularly brazen vessels; concerning
          which the tradition is,[32] "such as they use for hot things, as
          cauldrons and kettles, they heat them with hot water, and scour them,
          and dip them, and they are fit to be used." This writer says, I am
          strangely besides my Text, when I add, that "even beds, pillows, and
          bolsters, when they were unclean in a ceremonial sense, were to be
          washed by immersion, or dipping them into water;" but I am able to
          produce chapter and verse for what I affirm, from the traditions of
          the Jews, which are the only things spoken of in the text, and upon
          which the proof depends: for beds, their canons run thus; "a bed that
          is wholly defiled, if a man dips it part by part, it is pure."[33]
          Again, if he dips the bed in it, (a pool of water) though its feet are
          plunged into the thick clay, (at the bottom of the pool) it is
          clean."[34] As for pillows and bolsters, thus they say; "a pillow or a
          bolster of skin, when a man lifts up the mouth of them out of the
          water, the water which is in them will be drawn; what shall we do? he
          must dip them, and lift them up by their fringes."[35] Thus, according
          to the traditions of the elders, our Lord is speaking of, these
          several things mentioned were waffled by immersion; which abundantly
          confirms the primary sense of the word used.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) The passage of the Israelites through the Red-sea, and under a
          cloud, is represented as a baptism, 1Cor 10:1-2 and very aptly, as
          performed by immersion; since the waters stood up on both sides of
          them, and a cloud covered them; which very fitly represented persons
          immersed and covered with water in baptism: but what our author thinks
          will spoil this fine fancy, and some others, as he calls them, is,
          that one observation of Moses often repeated; that the children of
          Israel went on dry ground through the midst of the sea. To which I
          reply, that we are not under any necessity of owning that the cloud
          under which the Israelites were, let down any rain: it is indeed the
          sentiment of a Paedobaptist, I have referred to, and therefore am not
          affected with this observation; besides, it should be considered, that
          this equally, at least, spoils the fine fancy of the rain from the
          cloud bearing a much greater resemblance to sprinkling or affusion, as
          is asserted by the writer of the dialogue; and out author says, there
          was a true and proper ablution with water from the cloud, in which the
          Israelites were baptized, and concludes that they received baptism by
          sprinkling or affusion; how then could they walk on dry ground?
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) The last text mentioned is Heb 9:10 which speaks of diverse
          washings or baptisms of the Jews, or different dippings, as it may be
          rendered without any impropriety, as our author asserts; though not to
          be understood of different sorts of dipping, as he foolishly objects
          to us; nor of different sorts of washing, some by sprinkling, some by
          affusion, others by bathing or dipping, as he would have it; but the
          Jewish washings or baptisms are so called, because of the different
          persons, or things washed or dipped, as Grotius on the place says;
          there was one washing of the Priests, another of the Levites, and
          another of the Israelites, when they had contracted any impurity; and
          which was done by immersion; nor do any of the instances this writer
          has produced disprove it. Not Ex 29:4 thou shalt wash them with water;
          but whether by immersion or affusion he knows not. The Jews interpret
          it of immersion; the Targum of Jonathan is, "thou shalt dip them in
          forty measures of living water:" nor Ex 30:19 which mentions the
          washing of the priest’s hands and feet at the brazen laver of the
          tabernacle; the manner of which our author describes from Dr.
          Lightfoot, out of the Rabbins; but had he transcribed the whole, it
          would have appeared, that not only washing the hands and feet, but
          bathing of their whole body, were necessary to the performance of
          their service; for it follows, "and none might enter into the court to
          do the service there, till he hath bathed; yea, though he were clean,
          he must bathe his body in cold water before he enter." And to this
          agrees a canon of theirs;[36] "no man enters into the court for
          service, though clean, till he has dipped himself; the high-priest
          dips himself five times on the day of atonement." And the Priests and
          Levites, before they performed any part of the daily service, dipped
          themselves: nor 2 Chron4:6 which says, the molten sea in Solomon’s
          temple was for the priests to wash in; where they washed not only
          their hands and their feet, but their whole bodies, as Dr. Lightfoot
          says;[37] "and for the bathing of which; they went down into the
          vessel itself; and to which agrees the Jerusalem Talmud,[38] which
          says, "the molten sea was a dipping-place for the priests:" Nor Num
          8:6-7 which, had the passage been wholly transcribed, it would appear,
          that not only the water of purifying was sprinkled on the Levites, but
          their bodies were bathed; for it: allows: "and let them shave all
          their flesh, and wash their clothes, and so "make themselves clean;"
          that is, by bathing their whole bodies, which, as the Targum on the
          place says, was done in forty measures of water. Sprinkling the water
          of purification was a ceremony preparatory to the bathing, but was
          itself no part of it; and the same is to be observed of the
          purification by the ashes of an heifer, on the third and seventh days,
          Num 19:19 which was only preparatory to the great purification by
          bathing the body, and washing the clothes on the seventh day, which
          was the closing and finishing part of the service; for that it was the
          unclean person, and not the priest, that was to wash his clothes, and
          bathe himself in water, Num 19:19 is clear; since it is a distinct
          law, or statute, from that in Num 19:21 which enjoins the priest to
          wash his clothes, but not to bathe himself in water; and indeed, the
          contrary sense is not only absurd, and interrupts and confounds the
          sense of the words; but, as Dr. Gale also observes, it cannot be
          reasonably imagined that the priest, by barely purifying the unclean,
          should need so much greater a washing and purification than the
          unclean himself; this sprinkling of the ashes of the heifer,
          therefore, was not part of the Jewish washings, or baptisms, or any
          exemplification of them; so that from the whole, I see no reason to
          depart from my conclusion, that "the words baptize and baptism, in all
          the places mentioned, do from their signification make dipping or
          plunging the necessary mode of administering the ordinance of
          baptism." I proceed now,
        </p>
        <p>
          6. To vindicate those passages of scripture, which necessarily prove
          the mode of baptism by immersion. And, The first passage, is in Mat
          3:6 and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. We
          argue from hence, not merely from these persons being baptized, to
          their being dipped; though this is an argument that cannot be
          answered, seeing those that are baptized, are necessarily dipped; for
          the word baptize signifies always to dip, or to wash by dipping, and
          never to pour or sprinkle; but the argument is frill more forcible
          from these persons being baptized in the river Jordan: for either the
          persons said to be baptized were in the river, or they were not; if
          they were not in the river, they could not be baptized in it; if they
          were in it, they went in it in order to be baptized by immersion;
          since no other end could be proposed, agreeable to the common sense of
          mankind: to say they went into it to have a little water sprinkled or
          poured on them, which could have been done without it, is ridiculous,
          and an imposition on common sense; wherefore this necessarily proves
          the mode of baptizing by immersion; since no other mode is compatible
          with this circumstance. The instances of the blind man’s washing in
          Siloam, and the layers of the temple being to wash in, as disproving
          the necessity of immersion, I say, are impertinent; since the word
          baptize is used in neither of them; and besides, there is nothing
          appears to the contrary, that the blind man dipped himself in Siloam,
          as Naaman the Syrian did in Jordan; and the things that were washed in
          the layers, were dipped there, since they held a quantity of water
          sufficient for that purpose. The author of the dialogue asks, "Do not
          we commonly wash our face and hands in a basin of water without
          dipping in it?" But common practice proves the contrary; men commonly
          dip their hands into a basin, when they wash either hands or face; the
          instance of Elisha pouring water on the hands of Elijah, doth not
          prove it was common to wash hands by pouring water on them; since this
          is not said to be done to wash his hands with; and some interpreters
          have thought that washing of hands is not intended, but some miracle
          which followed the action of pouring water, which gave Elisha a
          character, and by which he is described.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second passage, is Jn 3:23. John was baptizing in Enon near Salim,
          because there was much water there. Here is not the least hint of
          John’s choosing of this place, and being here, for any other reason,
          but for baptizing; not for drink for men and cattle, as suggested;
          besides, why did he not fix upon a place where the people could be
          provided with food for themselves, and provender for their cattle? Why
          for drink only? This is a wild fancy, a vain conjecture. The reason of
          the choice is plain, it was for the convenience of baptizing, and that
          because there was much water, suitable to the manner of baptizing used
          by John; and if this reason given agrees with no other mode of
          baptizing, but by immersion, as it does not, since sprinkling or
          pouring requires not much water; it follows, that this necessarily
          proves the mode of baptism by immersion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third text is Mat 3:16. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up
          straightway out of the water. The author of the dialogue suggested,
          that the Greek preposition apo, always signifies from, never out of:
          our author is obliged to own, that it may sometimes admit to be
          rendered out of: a great condescension to the learned translators of
          our Bible! Well, if Jesus came up out of the water, he must have been
          in it, where it is certain he was baptized; and the evangelist Mark
          says, he was baptized into Jordan; not into the banks of Jordan; but
          into the waters of Jordan; now seeing such an expression as this will
          not suit with any other mode of baptism but immersion, and it cannot
          be said with any propriety, that Christ was sprinkled into Jordan, or
          poured into Jordan, but with great propriety may be said to be dipped
          or plunged into Jordan; it follows, that this necessarily proves the
          mode of baptism as administered to our Lord, to be by immersion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourth passage, is concerning Philip’s baptizing the Eunuch in
          Acts 8:38-39. they went down both into the water, and he baptized him;
          and when they were come up out of the water, etc. The dialogue writer
          would have it, that this proves no more than that they went down to
          the water, and came from it: but that this was not the case, I have
          observed, that previous to this, they are said to came to a certain
          water, to the water-side; and therefore after this, it cannot be
          understood of any thing else, but of their going into it; and so,
          consequently, the other phrase, of their coming out of it. Here our
          author has got a new fancy in his head; that turning to a certain
          water is not coming to the water-side, or to the water itself, but to
          the sight of it; which sense he does not pretend to confirm by any
          parallel place, either in sacred or profane writings, and is very
          absurd, improper and impertinent; since a person may come to the sight
          of a water, when he is at a great distance from it, and cannot be said
          with any propriety to be come so it: what he thinks will add strength
          to this fancy, and destroy the observation I made, is, that after
          this, the chariot is still going on, and several questions and answers
          passed before it was bid to stand still: all which is easily accounted
          for, supposing them to be come to the water itself; since the road
          they were now in, might be by the water-side, and so they traveled
          along by it, while the questions and answers passed, till they came to
          a proper and convenient place for baptism, at which they alighted;
          besides, why should the sight of a certain water, or confluence of
          water, put the Eunuch in mind of baptism, if it was not performed by
          immersion, of the mode of which he was doubtless acquainted? It is
          highly probable, that this treasurer was provided both with wine and
          water for his journey, which, mixed, was the usual drink of those
          countries; and a bottle of his own water would have done for
          sprinkling, or pouring, had either of them been the mode of baptism
          used; nor would there have been any occasion for going out of the
          chariot and to the water, and much less into it, which the text is
          express for; and seeing these circumstances of going down into the
          water, and coming up out of it, at the administration of baptism,
          agree with no other mode than that of immersion, not with sprinkling,
          nor pouring water, it necessarily proves immersion to be the mode of
          baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last text is Rom6:4 we are buried with him by baptism into death;
          where baptism is called a burial, a burial with Christ, and a
          resemblance of his; which only can be made by immersion: but our
          author says, if it is designed to represent it, there is no necessity
          it should be a resemblance of it; but how it can represent it without
          a resemblance of it, is not easy to say: he suggests, that though the
          Lord’s supper represents the death of Christ, it is no resemblance of
          it. Strange! that the breaking of the bread should not be a
          resemblance of the body of Christ broken, and the pouring out of the
          wine not a resemblance of his blood shed. Baptism by immersion,
          according to our author, is no resemblance of the burial of Christ;
          since his body was laid in a sepulcher cut out of a rock on high, and
          not put under ground, or covered with earth: this arises from a
          mistaken notion of the Jewish way of burial, even in their sepulchres,
          hewed out of rocks; for in every sepulcher of this kind, according to
          the nature of the rock, there were eight graves dug, some say
          thirteen, and which were dug seven cubits deep:[39] in one of these
          graves, within the sepulcher, lay the body of our Lord. So that it had
          a double burial, as it were, one in the sepulcher, and another in one
          of the graves in it: besides, how otherwise could our Lord be said to
          be three days and nights in the heart of the earth? (Mat 12:40).
          Again, our author says, "there is no more resemblance of a common
          burial in baptism by immersion, than by sprinkling, or pouring on
          water; since a corpse above ground may be properly said to be buried
          by having a sufficient quantity of earth cast upon it."
        </p>
        <p>
          True; but then a corpse can never be said to be buried, that has a
          little dust or earth sprinkled or poured on its face; from whence it
          is evident, that sprinkling or pouring cannot bear any resemblance of
          a common burial. In short, seeing no other mode but immersion, not
          sprinkling, nor pouring, has any resemblance of a burial, this passage
          necessarily proves the mode of baptism by immersion: and yet, after
          all, this writer inclines to that opinion, that both modes were used
          in scripture-times; though it appears by all accounts that the manner
          was uniform, one and the same word being always used in the relation
          of it; and yet he wrangles at every instance of immersion, and will
          not allow of one; what must be said of such a man! that he must be let
          down for a mere wrangler; a wrangler against light and conscience; a
          wrangler against his own opinion and sentiment; and what a worthless
          writer must this be! I go on,
        </p>
        <p>
          7. To consider the instances, which, it is said, shew it improbable
          that the ordinance of baptism was performed by dipping. The first is
          the baptism of the three thousand, Acts 2:41 which, to be done by
          immersion, is represented as improbable; from the shortness of the
          time, and the want of convenience on a sudden, for the baptizing of
          such a multitude. As to the time, I shall not dispute it with our
          author, whether Peter’s sermon was at the beginning of the third hour,
          or nine o’clock, or at the close of it, and about noon: I am willing
          to allow it might be noon before the baptism of these persons came on;
          nay, I will grant him an hour longer if he pleases, and yet there was
          time enough between that and night for the twelve apostles, and
          seventy disciples, in all fourscore and two, to baptize by immersion
          three times three thousand persons. I pass over his foolish remarks on
          a person’s being ready for baptism, as I have done many others of the
          same stupid kind, as deserving no notice, nor answer: As to the want
          of convenience for the baptizing such a number, I have observed the
          great number of baths in private houses in Jerusalem, the several
          pools in it, and the many conveniences in the temple: this writer
          thinks, the mention of the last is a piece of weakness in me, to
          imagine that the Jewish priests, in whose hands they were, the mortal
          enemies of Christ, should be on a sudden so good-natured as to grant
          the use of their baths for such a purpose: but how came they to allow
          the Christians the use of their temple, where they met daily? And
          besides, it is expressly said, they had favor with all the peop1e
          (Acts 2:46-47).
        </p>
        <p>
          The second instance, is the baptism of Paul (Acts 9:18); here only the
          narrative is directed to, as representing his baptism to be in the
          house of Judas: but there is nothing in the account that necessarily
          concludes it was done in the house, but rather the contrary; since he
          arose from the place where he was, in order to be baptized: and
          supposing it was done in the house, it is not at all improbable that
          there was a bath in this house, where it might be performed; since it
          was the house of a Jew, with whom it was usual to have baths to wash
          their whole bodies in, on certain occasions: So that there is no
          improbability of Paul’s baptism being by immersion; besides, he was
          not only bid to arise and be baptized, which would found very oddly,
          be sprinkled or poured (Acts 22:16); but says himself, that he was
          buried by baptism (Rom6:4).
        </p>
        <p>
          The third instance, is the baptism of Cornelius and his household
          (Acts 10:47). The sense of the words given, "can any man forbid the
          use of his river, or bath, or what convenience he might have, for
          baptizing;" is objected to, as not being the apostle’s words, but a
          strained sense of them: the same objection may be made to this
          writer’s sense, that the phrase imports the forbidding water to be
          brought; since no such thing is expressed, or hinted at: the principal
          thing, no doubt, designed by the apostle, is, that no one could, or at
          least ought, to object to the baptism of those who had so manifestly
          received the holy Ghost: but what is there in all this account, that
          renders their baptism by immersion improbable, for which it is
          produced?
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourth instance is the baptism of the Jailor and his household;
          (Acts 16:33) in the relation of which, there is nothing that makes it
          probable, much less certain, that it was performed by sprinkling or
          pouring water on them; nor any thing that makes it improbable that it
          was done by immersion: according to the account given, it seems to be
          a clear case, that the Jailor, upon his conversion, took the apostles
          out of prison into his own house, where they preached to him and his
          family, Acts 16:32, and that after this, they went out of his house,
          and were baptized; very probably in the river without the city, where
          the oratory was, Acts 16:13, for it is certain, that after the baptism
          of him and his household, he brought the apostles into his house, and
          set meat before them (Acts 16:33-34), nor is it any unreasonable and
          incredible thing, that he with his whole family should leave the
          prison and prisoners, who no doubt had servants that he could trust,
          or otherwise he must have been always little better than a prisoner
          himself: and whether the earthquake reached any farther than the
          prison, to alarm others, is not certain, nor any great matter of
          moment in this controversy to be determined; and the circumstances of
          the whole relation shew it more likely, that the Jailor and his family
          were baptized without the prison, than in it, and rather in the river
          without the city, than with the water out of the vessel, with which
          the Jailor had washed the apostle’s stripes: upon the whole, these
          instances produced fail of shewing the improbability of the mode of
          baptism by immersion; which must appear clear and manifest to every
          attentive reader, notwithstanding all that has been opposed unto it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There remains nothing but what has been already attended to, or worthy
          of regard; but the untruth he charges me with, in saying that "the
          dialogue writer only attempts to mention allusive expressions in favor
          of sprinkling:" our author will be ashamed of himself, and his abusive
          language, when he looks into the dialogue again; since the writer of
          that never mentions the words of the institution, for any such
          purpose, and much less argues from them; nor does he ever shew that
          the word baptize is in the sacred pages applied to sprinkling, or that
          it so signifies; nor does he any where argue from the good appearance
          there is of evidence, that in the apostles times, the mode of
          sprinkling was used; he never attempts to prove that the word baptizw,
          signifies to sprinkle, or is so used; nor mentions any one instance of
          sprinkling in baptism; what he contends for is, that the signification
          of the word, and the scripture instances of baptism, do not make
          dipping the necessary mode of administering that ordinance; and what
          he mentions in favor of sprinkling, are only resemblances, and
          allusive expressions.

          yourself and friends, either in a private or in a public way, as you
          may judge necessary and proper.
