        <h2>Infant Baptism from Apostolic Tradition Considered</h2>
        <p>The Argument From Apostolic Tradition In Favor Of Infant Baptism</p>
        <p>
          With OTHERS, advanced in a late Pamphlet, called, The Baptism of
          Infants a reasonable Service, etc. considered;
        </p>
        <p>
          It is with reluctance I enter again into the controversy about
          baptism; not from any consciousness either of the badness or weakness
          of the cause I am engaged in; but partly on account of other work upon
          my hands, which I chose not to be interrupted in; and partly because I
          think there has been enough written already, to bring this controversy
          to an issue; and it is not our fault that it has not been closed long
          ago; for there has been scarce any thing wrote by us these fifty years
          past, but in our own defense; our Paedobaptist brethren being
          continually the aggressors, and first movers of the controversy; they
          seem as if they were not satisfied with what has been done on their
          fide, and therefore are always attempting either to put the
          controversy upon a new foot, or to throw the old arguments into a new
          form; and even say the same things over and over again, to make their
          minds, and the minds of their people easy, if possible. If persons are
          content to search the scriptures, and form their judgment of this
          matter by them, there has been enough published on both sides of the
          question to determine themselves by; and we are willing things should
          rest here: but this is our care; if we reply to what is written
          against us, then we are litigious persons, and lovers of controversy;
          though we only rise up in our own vindication, for which surely we are
          not to be blamed; and if we make no reply, then what is written is
          unanswerable by us, and we are triumphed over.
        </p>
        <p>
          No less than half a dozen pamphlets have been published upon this
          subject, within a very little time; without any provocation from us.,
          that I know of. Some of them indeed are like mushrooms, that rise up
          and die almost as soon as they live; it has been the luck of the
          pamphlet before me, to live a little longer; and which is cried up as
          an unanswerable one, for no other reason, that I can see, but because
          it has not yet been answered in form; otherwise the arguments advanced
          in it, have been answered before it was in being; for there is nothing
          new throughout the whole of it. Is there any one argument in it, but
          what has been brought into the controversy before? not one. Is the
          date of infant-baptism, as it appears from the writings of the
          ancients, from antiquity, for which this performance is mostly boasted
          of, carried one year, one month, one day, one hour, or moment higher,
          than it was before? not one. Is there any one passage of the ancients
          cited, which has not been produced and been under consideration
          before? not one. What then has this Gentleman been doing? just nothing
          at all. However an answer would have been made to him before this
          time, had not some things in providence prevented. My late worthy
          friend, the Reverend Mr.. Samuel Wilson, intended to have drawn up
          one, as he signified to me; for which reason, I did not give myself
          the trouble to read this pamphlet: His view was first to publish his
          Manual, and then to take this under consideration; but he dying before
          the publication of the former, prevented his design; nor did he, as I
          could ever find, leave any materials behind him relating to this
          affair. Some time after Mr. Killingworth published an answer to Dr.
          Foster on the subject of communion, and added some remarks upon this
          pamphlet; when I ordered my Bookseller to get me that, and the
          strictures on it; upon reading of which, I found that Mr. Killingworth
          expected a formal answer to it was preparing, and would be published
          by a Gentleman he represents as the occasion of its being written;
          which for some time I have been waiting for: but hearing nothing of
          it, and the boasts of the party increasing, because of no answer,
          determined me to take it under examination in the manner I have done;
          but whether after all I am not too forward, I cannot tell; but if any
          thing is preparing or prepared by another hand, I hope what I have
          written will not hinder the publication of it.

          Infant-baptism is sometimes put upon one footing, and sometimes on
          another; as on the covenant of grace; on circumcision; on the baptism
          of Jewish proselytes; on scripture consequences; and by our author it
          is rested on apostolic tradition. This he says is an argument of great
          weight;[1] and that it is principally for the sake of this, that his
          performance appears in the world;[2] for which reason, I shall chiefly
          attend unto it. Whatever weight this argument may be thought to have
          in the present controversy, it has none in others; not in the
          controversy with the Papists, nor with the church of England about
          rites and ceremonies, this Gentleman himself being judge; who I
          understand is the author of The dissenting Gentleman’s answer to Mr.
          White's Three Letters. In his controversy with him, Christ is the only
          lawgiver and head of the church, and no man upon earth, or body of
          men, have authority to make laws, or prescribe things in religion, or
          to set aside, alter or new-make any terms fixed by him; and
          apostolical authority, or what is directed to by the apostles, as
          fallible and unassisted men, is no authority at all, nor obligatory as
          a law on men, they having no dominion over their faith and practice;
          and the scriptures are the only, common, sufficient and perfect rule:
          but in the controversy about infant-baptism, apostolic tradition is of
          great weight; if the dispute is about sponsors and the cross in
          baptism, then fathers and councils stand for nothing; and the
          testimonies of the ancients for these things, though clear and
          indubitable, and about the sense of which there is no contest, and are
          of as early antiquity as any thing can be produced for infant-baptism,
          are not allowed sufficient; but if it is about infant-baptism itself,
          then fathers and councils are called in, and their testimonies
          produced, insisted upon, and retained, though they have not one
          syllable of baptism in them; and have senses affixed to them, strained
          and forced, contrived to serve an hypothesis, and what the good old
          fathers never dreamed of; is this fair dealing? can this be said to be
          sincerity, integrity and honesty? no surely.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Gentleman should know that we, who are called Anabaptists, are
          Protestants, and the Bible is our religion; and that we reject all
          pretended apostolic tradition, and every thing that goes under that
          name, not found in the Bible, as the rule of our faith and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The title of the pamphlet before me is, The baptism of Infants a
          reasonable service, founded upon Scripture, and undoubted Apostolic
          Tradition; but if it is founded upon scripture, then not upon
          tradition; and if upon tradition, then, not on scripture; if it is a
          scriptural business, then not a traditional one; and if a traditional
          one, then not a scriptural one: if it can be proved by scripture, that
          is enough, it has then no need of tradition; but if it cannot be
          proved by that, a cart-load of traditions will not support it.—This
          put me in mind of what I have heard, of a countryman offering to give
          the Judge a dozen reasons why his neighbor could not appear in court;
          in the first place, my Lord, says he, he is dead; that is enough,
          quote the Judge, I shall spare you the trouble of giving me the rest:
          so prove but infant-baptism by scripture, and there will be no need of
          the weighty arguments from tradition. However, by putting the care as
          it is, we learn that this author by apostolic tradition, means
          unwritten apostolic tradition, since he distinguishes it from the
          scripture; and not apostolic tradition, delivered in the scriptures,
          which is the sense in which sometimes tradition is used, both in the
          word of God (1Cor 15:3; 2 Thes 2:15), and in ancient writers.[3] So we
          are not at a loss about the sense of it; it is unwritten, uninspired
          apostolic tradition; tradition not in, but out of the scriptures; not
          delivered by the apostles in the sacred writings, but by word of mouth
          to their successors, or to the churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is pretty much that infant-baptism should be called an undoubted
          apostolic tradition, since it has been doubted of by some learned
          Paedobaptists themselves; nay, some have affirmed that it is not
          observed by them as an apostolic tradition, particularly
          Curcellaeus,[4] and who gives a very good reason for it: his words are
          these; "Paedobaptism was unknown in the two first ages after Christ;
          in the third and fourth it was approved by a few; at length, in the
          fifth and following ages it began to obtain in divers places; and
          therefore this rite is indeed observed by us as an ancient custom, but
          not as an apostolic tradition."
        </p>
        <p>
          Bishop Taylor[5] calls it a pretended apostolical tradition; and says,
          that the tradition cannot be proved to be apostolical, we have very
          good evidence from antiquity. Since then the Paedobaptists disagree
          about this point among themselves, as well as it is called in question
          and contested by others; one would think, this writer should not be so
          confident as to call it an undoubted apostolic tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, apostolic tradition, at most and best, is a very precarious
          and uncertain thing, and not to be depended on; we have a famous
          instance of this, in the controversy that arose in the second century,
          about the time of keeping Easter; whether it should be observed on the
          14th day of the first moon, let it fall on what day of the week it
          would, or on the Sunday following; the former was observed by the
          churches of Asia, and the latter by the church of some; both pleaded
          the custom and usage of their predecessors, and even ancient apostolic
          tradition;[6] the Asiatic churches said, they had it by tradition from
          Philip and John; the Roman church from Peter and Paul; but not being
          able to fettle this point, which was in the right, Victor, the then
          bishop of Rome, excommunicated the other churches that would not fall
          in with the practice of him and his church; this was in the year 196;
          and even before this, in the year 157, this same controversy was on
          foot; and Polycarp bishop of Smyrna, who had been a hearer and
          disciple of the apostle John, made a journey to some, and conversed
          with Anicetus bishop of that place, about this matter; they talked it
          over candidly, parted friendly, but without convincing each other,
          both retaining their former customs and tradition;[7] if now it was so
          difficult a thing to fix a tradition, or fettle what was an apostolic
          tradition, about the middle of the second century, fifty or sixty
          years after the death of the apostle John, and when some of the
          immediate successors of the apostles were living; what judgment can we
          form of apostolic traditions in the eighteenth century?
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it is doubtful whether there ever was any such thing as
          apostolic tradition; or that ever any thing was delivered by the
          apostles to their successors, or to the churches, to be observed by
          them, which was not delivered in the sacred writings; and I defy this
          Gentleman, and demand of him to give me one single instance of any
          apostolic tradition of this nature; and if no such instance can be
          given, it is in vain to talk of undoubted apostolic tradition; and
          upon what a miserable foundation must infant baptism stand, that
          relics upon this? unwritten apostolic tradition is a non-entity, as
          the learned Alting[8] calls it; it is a mere chimaera; a refuge of
          heretics formerly, and of papists now; a favorite argument of theirs,
          to prove by it what they please. But be it so, that there is such a
          thing as apostolic tradition; let it be proved that infant-baptism is
          such; let the apostles be pointed out that delivered it. Were they all
          the apostles or only some of them that delivered it? let them be named
          who they were, and to whom they delivered it, and when, and where. The
          apostles Peter and Paul, who were, the one the apostle of the
          circumcision, and the other the apostle of the uncircumcision, one
          would think, should be the most likely to hand down this tradition;
          the one to the Christian Jews, and the other to the Christian
          Gentiles; or however, to their successors or companions: but is there
          any proof or evidence that they did so? none at all; though there are
          writings of persons extant that lived in their times. If Clemens
          Romanus was a successor of Peter, as the papists say, it might have
          been expected, that it would have been delivered to him, and he would
          have published it; but there is not a word of it in his epistles still
          in being. Barnabas was a companion of the apostle Paul; and had it
          been a tradition of his, it might be justly thought, it would be met
          with in an epistle of his now extant; but there is not the least hint
          of it in it, but on the contrary, several passages in favor of
          believers-baptism. Perhaps, as John was the last of the apostles, and
          outlived them all, it was left with him to transmit it to others; and
          had this been the care, it might have been hoped it would have been
          found in the writings of Polycarp, a hearer and disciple of the
          apostle John; but not a syllable of it is to be found in him. Nay
          Papias, bishop of Hierapolis, one that was a hearer of John the elder
          of Ephesus, and a companion of Polycarp, and who had conversed with
          those who were familiar with the apostles, and made it his business to
          pick up sayings and facts, said or done by the apostles, not recorded
          in scripture, has not a word of this; which childish business would
          have been a very pretty thing for that weak-headed man, as Eusbius[9]
          represents him, to have gone prattling about with; here is an
          apostolic tradition then, which no body knows by whom it was
          delivered, nor to whom, nor when and where: the companions and
          successors of the apostles say nothing of it. The[10] Jews talk of a
          Mosaic tradition and oral law, delivered from one to another for
          several thousand years running; they tell you by whom it was first
          given and received; and can name the persons to whom it was
          transmitted in succeeding ages; this is something to the purpose; this
          is doing business roundly; but here is a tradition no body can tell
          from whence it comes, nor who received it, and handed it down; for
          there is not the least mention of it, nor any pretended to in the
          first century or apostolic age. But let us attend to what evidence is
          given of it, in the next or second century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two passages are produced out of the writers of this age, to prove
          this undoubted apostolic tradition; the one out of Justin Martyr; the
          other out of Irenaeus. That from Justin is as follows;[11] "several
          persons among us, men and women, of sixty and seventy years of age, oi
          ek paidwn emaqhteuqhsan tw Criso, who from their childhood were
          instructed in Christ, remain incorrupt:" for so the phrase on which
          the whole depends should be rendered, and not discipled or proselyted
          to Christ; which rendering of the words, as it is unjustifiable, so it
          would never have been thought of, had it not been to serve a turn; and
          is not agreeable to Justin’s use of the word, who frequently makes use
          of it in the sense of instruction and teaching; as when he speaks of
          persons being maqhteuqhnaV , instructed into divine doctrines;[12] and
          of others being maqhteuomenouV , instructed in the name (person or
          doctrine) of Christ, and leaving the way of error;[13] and of Christ's
          sending his disciples to the Gentiles, who by them emaaqhteusan,
          instructed them:[14] nor should ek paidwn, be rendered in infancy, but
          from childhood; and is a phrase of the same signification with that in
          1Tim 3:15 where Timothy is said apo brefouV , from a child to know the
          holy scriptures; and Justin’s sense is, that notwithstanding the
          strict and severe commands of Christ in Mat 5:28-30, Mat 5:44 as they
          might seem to be, and which he cites; yet there were several persons
          of the age he mentions, then living, who had been instructed in the
          person, offices, and doctrines of Christ, or had been trained up in
          the Christian religion from their childhood, who had persevered
          hitherto, and were incorrupt in their practices, and in their
          principles; and which is no other than a verification of what the wise
          man observes, Prov 22:6. Train up a child in the way he should go, and
          when he is old, he will not depart from it: and we are able in our
          day, to point out persons of an age that Justin mentions, who have
          been trained up in the Christian religion from their childhood; and
          who in riper years have made a public profession of it, and have held
          fast their profession without wavering, and lived unblemished lives
          and conversations; and yet never were baptized in their infancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behold, here the first proof and evidence of infant-baptism being an
          undoubted apostolic tradition; when there is not a word of baptism in
          it, much less of infant-baptism; nor any hint of it, or reference unto
          it. Can the most sanguine Paedobaptist sit down, and in cool
          reflection conclude, upon reading and considering this passage, that
          it proves infant-baptism to be an undoubted apostolic tradition?
          surely he cannot. The other passage is out of Irenaeus, and stands
          thus;[15] "He (Christ) came to save all; all I say, qui per eum
          renascuntur in Deum, who by him are born again unto God, infants, and
          little ones, and children, and young men, and old men."
        </p>
        <p>
          For so the words are to be rendered, and not baptized unto God; for
          the word renascor is never used by Irenaeus, or rather by his
          translator, in such a sense; nor had it as yet obtained among the
          ancients to use the words regenerated and regeneration, for baptized
          and baptism. Likewise, it is certain that Irenaeus speaks elsewhere of
          regeneration as distinct from baptism, as an inward spiritual work,
          agreeable to the scriptures; which never speak of it but as such, no
          not in Jn 3:5, Titus 3:5. And what reason can there be to depart from
          the literal and scriptural sense of the word, and even the sense which
          Irenaeus uses it in; and especially, since infants are capable of
          regeneration in such a sense of it? besides, to understand Irenaeus as
          speaking of baptism, is to make him at least to suggest a doctrine
          which is absolutely false; as if Christ came to save all and only
          such, who are baptized unto God; when it is certain, he came to save
          the Old-Testament-saints, who never were baptized, as well as
          New-Testament saints; and no doubt many now are fared by him, who
          never were baptized with water at all: and on the other hand, nothing
          is more true than that he came to save all and only those, who are
          regenerated by the Spirit and grace of God, of whatsoever age they he.
          And after all, when it is observed that the chapter out of which this
          passage is taken, is thought by some learned men to be none of
          Irenaeus’, but a spurious piece; and if it is his, it is only a
          translation, as almost all his works be, and a very foolish, uncouth
          and barbarous one, as learned men observe; so that it is not certain
          that there are his words, or are a true translation of them; what wise
          and considerate man will say, that this is a proof of infant-baptism
          being an undoubted apostolic tradition? seeing the passage is so much
          contested, and so much is to be said against it; seeing, at most and
          best, the sense of it is doubtful; and seeing it is certain that
          Irenaeus uses the word regeneration in a different sense from
          baptism;[16] who can be sure he uses it of baptism here? Upon the
          whole, what thoughtful man will affirm from hence, that infant-baptism
          is an undoubted apostolic tradition? And seeing these two testimonies
          are the only ones produced in favor of infant-baptism in the second
          century; and the latter Dr. Wall[17] confesses, "is the first express
          mention that we have met with of infants baptized;" though there is no
          mention at all made of it in it, any more than in the former; he must
          have a strong faith to believe, and a good assurance upon such
          evidence to assert,[18] "that the baptism of infants was the undoubted
          practice of the Christian church in its purest and first: ages; the
          ages immediately succeeding the apostles." Let us now proceed to the
          third century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tertullian is the first man that ever made mention of infant-baptism,
          that we know of; and as he was the first that spoke of it, he at the
          same time spoke against it, dissuaded from it, and advised to defer
          it; and though he was quire singular, as our author says, in this his
          advice; it should be observed, that he is also quite singular in his
          mention of the thing itself; there being no writings of any
          contemporary of his extant, from which we might learn their sense of
          this affair. We allow that infant-baptism was moved in the third
          century; that it then began to be talked of, and became matter of
          debate, and might be practiced in the African churches, where it was
          first moved. We do not deny the probability of the practice of it
          then, though the certainty of it does not appear; it is probable it
          might be practiced, but it is not certain it was; as yet it has not
          been proved. Now here we stick, by this we abide, that there is no
          mention made of it in any authentic writer before Tertullian’s time.
          And this writer himself elsewhere[19] observes, that "by his time, it
          is well known, a great variety of superstitious, and ridiculous, and
          foolish rites were brought into the church." The date of
          infant-baptism cannot, we apprehend, be carried higher than his time;
          and we require of any of our learned Paedobaptist brethren, to produce
          a single passage out of any authentic writer before Tertullian, in
          which infant-baptism is expressly mentioned, or clearly hinted at, or
          plainly supposed, or manifestly referred unto. This being the care, as
          we own it began in this century, and might be practiced by some, it
          might be needless in a good measure to consider after-testimonies;
          however, I shall not think fit wholly to neglect them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Origen is next quoted, and three passages out of him; shewing that the
          baptism of infants is a tradition of the apostles, and an usage of the
          church for the remission of sins; but it should be observed, that
          these quotations are not from the Greek of Origen; he wrote much in
          that language, and there is much still extant in it; and yet nothing
          is produced from thence, that can fairly be construed in favor of
          infant-baptism; though many things may be observed from thence, in
          favor of adult-baptism. The three passages are quoted out of some
          Latin translations, greatly interpolated, and not to be depended on.
          His Homilies on Leviticus, and exposition of the epistle to the
          Romans, out of which two of them are taken, are translated by
          Ruffinus; who with the former, he himself owns, he used much freedom,
          and added much, and took such a liberty in both of adding, taking
          away, and changing, that, as Erasmus says,[20] whoever reads there
          pieces, it is uncertain whether he reads Origen or Ruffinus; and
          Vossius observes,[21] that the former of these was interpolated by
          Ruffinus, and thinks therefore, that the passage cited was of the
          greater authority against the Pelagians, because Ruffinus was inclined
          to them. The Homilies on Luke, out of which is the other passage, were
          translated by Jerom, of whom Du Pin says,[22] that "his versions are
          not more exact than Ruffinus’s." Now both there lived at the latter
          end of the fourth century, and it looks very probable, that these very
          passages, are additions, or interpolations of these men, tinct (the
          color of) the language agrees with those times, and no other; for no
          contemporary of Origen’s, nor any writer before him or after him,
          until the times of Ruffinus, Jerom and Austin, speak of infant-baptism
          as an usage of the church, or an apostolical tradition; in short, as
          bishop Taylor observes,[23] "a tradition apostolical, if it be not
          consigned with a fuller testimony than of one person (Origen,) whom
          all after-ages have condemned of many errors, will obtain so little
          reputation amongst those, who know that things have upon greater
          authority pretended to derive from the apostles, and yet falsely; that
          it will be a great argument, that he is credulous, and weak, that
          shall be determined by so weak a probation, in a matter of so great
          concernment."
        </p>
        <p>
          Cyprian, with his council of sixty-six bishops, are brought as
          witnesses of infant-baptism, a little after the middle of the third
          century. We allow that as infant-baptism was moved for in Tertullian’s
          time, so it obtained in the African churches in Cyprian’s time; but
          then by Fidus the country bishop, applying to the council to have a
          doubt resolved, whether it was lawful to baptize infants until they
          were eight days old; it appears to be a novel practice; and that as
          yet it was undetermined, by council or custom, when they were to be
          baptized, whether as soon as born, or on the eighth day, or whether it
          was to be left to every one's liberty: and it should also be observed,
          that in this age, infant communion was practiced as well as infant,
          baptism; and very likely both began together, as it is but reasonable,
          that if the one be admitted, the other should. But of this more
          hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Clementine Constitutions, as they are called, are next produced,
          as enjoining infant-baptism; but why does this Gentleman call them the
          Clementine Constitutions, unless he is of opinion, and which he
          suggests by this title of them, that Clemens Romanus was the compiler
          of them from the mouths of the apostles? and if so, he might have
          placed the passage out of them with greater advantage, at the head of
          his testimonies; but he must know, that there writings are condemned
          as spurious, by almost all learned men, excepting Mr. Whiston; and
          were not heard of till the times of Epiphanius, in the latter end of
          the fourth century, if so soon: and it should be observed, that these
          same Constitutions, which direct to the baptizing of infants, injoin
          the use of godfathers in baptism; the form of renouncing the devil and
          all his works; the consecration of the water; trine immersion; the use
          of oil, and baptizing, fasting; crossing with the sign of the cross in
          the forehead; keeping the day of Christ's nativity, Epiphany, the
          Quadragesima or Lent; the feast of the passover, and the festivals of
          the apostles; falling on the fourth and sixth days of the week;
          praying for saints departed; singing for the dead, and honoring their
          relics; with many other things foreign enough from the simplicity of
          the apostolic doctrine and practice. A testimony from such a work, can
          be of very little credit to the cause of infant-baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we are come to a very remarkable and decisive testimony, as it
          is called, from the writings of Austin and Pelagius; the sum of which
          is, that there being a controversy between these two persons about
          original sin, the latter, who denied it, was pressed by the former,
          with an argument taken from the baptism of infants for the remission
          of sins; with which Pelagius seemed exceedingly embarrassed, when it
          greatly concerned him to deny it if he could; and had it been an
          innovation, so acute, learned, and sagacious a man as he was, would
          have discovered it; but on the contrary, when he was charged with a
          denial of it as the consequence of his opinion, he warmly disclaims
          it, and complains of a slander; and adds, that he never heard that
          even any impious heretic denied it, or refused it to infants; and the
          same says Austin, that it never was denied by any man, catholic or
          heretic, and was the constant usage of the church; for all which
          vouchers are produced. To which may be replied,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. However embarrassed Pelagius might be with the argument, it did not
          lead to a controversy about the subject, but the end of baptism, and
          about the latter, and not the former was the dispute; nor was he under
          so great a temptation, and much less necessity, nor did it so greatly
          concern him to deny the baptism of infants, on account of his tenet;
          since he was able upon his principles to point out other ends of their
          baptism, than that of remission of sin; and particularly, their
          receiving and enjoying the kingdom of heaven; and as a late writer[24]
          observes, this proposition "baptism ought to be administered to
          children, as well as to the adult; was not inconsistent with, nor
          repugnant to his doctrine; for though he denied original sin, he
          allowed baptism to be administered even to children, but only for
          their sanctification."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It should be known and observed, that we have no writings of
          Pelagius extant, at least under his name, only some passages quoted by
          his adversaries, by which we can judge what were his sentiments about
          infant-baptism; and it is well known that a man's words often are
          misquoted, or misunderstood, or misrepresented by an adversary; I will
          not say that this is the case of Pelagius; I would hope better things
          of his adversaries, particularly Austin, and that he has been used
          fairly; I am willing to allow his authorities, though it would have
          been a greater satisfaction to have had there things from himself, and
          not at second hand. Nor,
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Would I detract from the character of Pelagius, or call in question
          his acuteness, sagacity, and learning; yet two doctors of the age in
          which he lived, are divided about him in this respect, Austin and
          Jerom; the former speaks of him as a very considerable man, and of
          great penetration; but the latter, as if he had no genius, and but
          very little knowledge;[25] it must be owned, that Austin was the most
          candid man, and Jerom a sour one, who seldom spoke well of those he
          opposed, though he was a man of the greatest learning, and so the best
          judge of it: but however acute, learned, and sagacious Peliagius was,
          yet falling in with the stream of the times, and not seeing himself
          concerned about the subject, but the end of baptism, might give
          himself no trouble to inquire into the rise of it; but take it for
          granted, as Austin did; who perhaps was as acute, learned and
          sagacious as he, that it had been the constant usage of the church,
          and an apostolic tradition; as he had many other things, in which he
          was mistaken, as will soon appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Though Pelagius complained that he was defamed, and slandered by
          some who charged him with denying infant-baptism; yet this, Austin
          observes, was only a shift of his, in order to invert the state of the
          question, that he might more easily answer to what was objected to
          him, and preserve his own opinion. And certain it is, according to
          Austin;[26] that the Pelagians did deny baptism to some infants, even
          to the infants of believers, and that for this reason, because they
          were holy; what others made a reason for it, they make a reason
          against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Pelagius says no such thing, that he never heard, no not even any
          impious heretic, who denied baptism to infants. His words indeed
          are[27] nunquam se vel impium aliquem haereticum audisse, qui hoc,
          quod proposuit, de parvulis diceret; that "he never heard, no not any
          impious heretic, that would say concerning infants, what he had
          proposed or mentioned:" the sense depends upon the meaning of the
          phrase, quod proposuit, "what he had proposed or mentioned," of whom,
          and what that is to be understood; whether of Austin, and the state of
          the case as proposed and set down by him; so our author seems to
          understand it, since by way of explanation, he adds, viz. "that
          unbaptized infants are not liable to the condemnation of the first
          man; and that they are not to be cleansed by the regeneration of
          baptism:" but this gentleman has not put it as Austin has stated it,
          which is thus; "it is objected to them (the Pelagians) that they will
          not own that unbaptized infants are liable to the condemnation of the
          first man; & in eos tranfisse originale peccatum regeneratiane
          purgandum, and that original sin has passed upon them to be cleansed
          by regeneration:" and according to this sense the meaning cannot be,
          that he never heard that any heretic denied baptism to infants; but
          either that he never heard that any one should say, that unbaptized
          infants are not liable to the condemnation of the first man, and that
          original sin had not passed upon them to be cleansed by regeneration;
          but then this is to bring the wicked heretics as witnesses against
          himself, and to make himself worse than they: or the meaning is, that
          he never heard that any of them should say, that unbaptized infants
          are liable to the condemnation of the first man, and that original sin
          has passed upon them to be cleansed by regeneration, which is most
          likely: but then this makes rather against, than for the thing for
          which it is brought; since it makes the heretic as never saying that
          infants flood in need of being cleansed by baptism: or else, quod
          proposuit, "what he had proposed or mentioned," refers to Pelagius,
          and to the state of the question as he had put it; representing that
          he was charged with promising the kingdom of heaven to some, without
          the redemption of Christ; and of this he might say, he never heard the
          most impious heretic to say; and this seems to be the sense by what he
          subjoins; "for who is so ignorant of what is read in the gospel, not
          only as to attempt to affirm it, but even lightly mention it, or even
          imagine it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, who so impious that would exclude infants from the kingdom
          of heaven, dum eos baptizari & in Christo renasci putat? whilst he
          thinks, or is of opinion that they are baptized and regenerated in
          Christ?" for so it is in my edition[28] of Austin; putet, and not
          vetat, as Dr. Wall quotes it; and after him this Gentleman: and
          Pelagius further adds, "who so impious as to forbid to an infant, of
          whatsoever age, the common redemption of mankind?" but this, Austin
          says, like the rest is ambiguous; what redemption he means, whether
          from bad to good, or from good to better: now take the words which way
          you will, they cannot be made to say, that he had never heard that any
          heretic denied baptism to infants, but that they denied the kingdom of
          heaven to them; and indeed every one must: allow, whoever is of that
          opinion, that infants are by baptism really regenerated in Christ;
          which was the prevailing notion of those times, and the light in which
          it is put; that they must belong to the kingdom of heaven, and share
          in the common redemption by Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Austin himself does not say, that he had never heard or read of any
          catholic, heretic, or schismatic, that denied infant-baptism; he could
          never say any such thing; he must know, that Tertullian had opposed
          it; and he himself was at the council of Carthage, and there presided,
          and was at the making of that canon which runs thus; "also it is our
          pleasure, that whoever denies that new-born infants are to be
          baptized—let him be anathema:" but to what purpose was this canon
          made, if he and his brethren knew of none that denied infant-baptism?
          To say that this respects some people, who were still of the same
          opinion with Fidus, an African bishop, that lived 150 years before
          this time, that infants were not to be baptized until they were eight
          days old, is an idle notion of Dr. Wall:[29] can any man in his senses
          think, that a council, consisting of all the bishops in Africa, should
          agree to anathematize their own brethren, who were in the same opinion
          and practice of infant-baptism with themselves; only they thought it
          should not be administered to them as soon as born, but at eight days
          old? Credat Judaeus Apella, believe it who will; he is capable of
          believing any thing, that can believe this. Austin himself makes
          mention of some that argued against it, after this manner:[30] "men
          are used to ask this question, says he, of what profit is the
          sacrament of Christian baptism to infants, seeing when they have
          received it, for the most part they die before they know any thing of
          it?" and as before observed, he brings in the Pelagians[31] saying,
          that the infants of believers ought not to be baptized: and so
          Jerom,[32] who was a contemporary of his, speaks of some Christians,
          qui dare noluerint baptisma, "who refused to give baptism to their
          children;" so that though infant-baptism greatly obtained in those
          times, yet it was not so general as this author represents it. Austin
          therefore could not say what he is made to say: but what then does he
          say, that he never remembered to have read in any catholic, heretic,
          or schismatic writer? why, "that infants were not to be baptized, that
          they might receive the remission of sins, but that they might be
          sanctified in Christ:" it is of this the words are spoken, which our
          author has quoted, but are not to be found in the place he refers to;
          having through inadvertence mistaken Dr. Wall, from whom I perceive he
          has taken this, and other things. This, and not infant-baptism itself,
          was what was transiently talked of at Carthage, and cursorily heard by
          Austin some little time ago, when he was there: this was the novelty
          he was startled at, but did not think it seasonable to enter into a
          debate about it then, and so forgot it: for surely it will not be
          said, that it was the denial of infant-baptism that was defended with
          so much warmth against the church, as he lays this was; and was
          committed to memory in writing; and the brethren were obliged to ask
          their advice about it; and they were obliged to dispute and write
          against; for this would prove the very reverse of what this gentleman
          produces it for. Now, though Austin could not say that he never
          remembered to have heard or read of any catholic, schismatic, or
          heretic, that denied infant-baptism; yet he might say he never
          remembered to have heard or read of any that owned and practiced
          infant-baptism, but who allowed it to be for the remission of sin;
          which is widely different from the former: it is one thing what Austin
          says, and another, what may be thought to be the consequence of his so
          saying; and in the same sense are we to understand him, when he
          says,[33] "and this the church has always had, has always held." What?
          why, that infants are diseased through Adam; and stand in need of a
          physician; and are brought to the church to be healed. It was the
          doctrine of original sin, and the baptism of infants for the remission
          of it, he speaks of in there passages; it is true indeed, he took
          infant-baptism to be an ancient and constant usage of the church. and
          an apostolic tradition;[34] which perhaps he had taken up from the
          Latin translations of Origen by Jerom and Ruffinus before-mentioned;
          since no other ecclesiastical writer speaks of it as such, before
          those times: but in this he was deceived and mistaken, as he was in
          other things which he took for apostolic traditions; which ought to be
          equally received as this, by those who are influenced by his
          authority; and indeed every honest man that receives infant-baptism
          upon the foot of tradition, ought to receive every thing else upon the
          same foot, of which there is equally as full, and as early, evidence
          of apostolic tradition, as of this: let it then be observed,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That the same Austin that asserts infant-baptism to be an apostolic
          tradition, affirms infant-communion to be so likewise, as Bishop
          Taytlor[35] observes; and thus Austin says,[36] "if they pay any
          regard to the apostolic authority, or rather to the Lord and Matter of
          the apostles, who says, that they have no life in themselves, unless
          they eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, which they
          cannot do unless baptized; will sometimes own that unbaptized infants
          have not life;"—and a little after, "no man that remembers that he is
          a Christian, and of the catholic faith, denies or doubts that infants,
          not having the grace of regeneration in Christ, and without eating his
          flesh, and drinking his blood, have no life in them; but are hereby
          liable to everlasting punishment;" by which he means the two
          sacraments of baptism, and the Lord's supper; the necessity of both
          which to eternal life he founded upon a mistaken sense of Jn 3:5 and
          Jn 6:53 as appears from what he elsewhere says;[37] where having
          mentioned the first of those passages, he cites the latter, and adds;
          "let us hear the Lord, I say, not indeed speaking this of the
          sacrament of the holy laver, but of the sacrament of the holy table;
          whither none rightly come, unless baptized. Except ye eat my flesh,
          and drink my blood, ye shall have no life in you; what do we seek for
          further? what can be laid in answer to this, unless one would set
          himself obstinately against clear and invincible truth? will any one
          dare to say this, that this passage does not belong to infants; and
          that they can have life in themselves, without partaking of his body
          and blood?" And of the necessity of this, as well as of baptism to
          eternal life, he says[38] the African Christians took to be an ancient
          and apostolic tradition. Innocent the first, his contemporary, was
          also of the same mind; and the giving of the Eucharist to infants
          generally obtained; and it continued fix hundred years after, until
          transubstantiation took place; and is continued to this day in the
          Greek church: and if we look back to the times before Austin, we shall
          find that it was not only the opinion of Cyprian, but was practiced in
          his time; he tells[39] a story which he himself was a witness of; how
          that "a little child being left in a fright by its parents with a
          nurse, she carried the child to the magistrates, who had it to an
          idol's sacrifice; where because the child could not eat flesh, they
          gave it bread soaked in wine: some time after, the mother had her
          child again; which not being able to relate to her what had passed it
          was brought by its parent to the place where Cyprian and the church
          were celebrating the Lord's-supper; and where it shrieked, and was
          dreadfully distressed; and when the cup was offered it in its turn by
          the deacon, it shut its lips against it; who forced the wine down its
          throat; upon which it sobbed, and threw it up again." Now here is a
          plain instance of infant-communion in the third century; and we defy
          any one to give a more early instance, or an instance so early, of
          infant-baptism: it is highly probable that infant-baptism was now
          practiced; and that this very child was baptized, or otherwise it
          would not have been admitted to the Lord's-supper; and it is
          reasonable to suppose, they both began together; yet no instance can
          be given of infant-baptism, so early as of infant-communion; wherefore
          whoever thinks himself obliged to receive the one upon such evidence
          and authority, ought to receive the other; the one has as good a claim
          to apostolic authority and tradition, as the other has.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The sign of the cross in baptism was used by the ancients, and
          pleaded for as an apostolic tradition. Basil, who lived in the fourth
          century observes,[40] that some things they had from scripture; and
          others from apostolic tradition, of which he gives instances; and,
          says he, "because this is the first and most common, I will mention it
          in the first place; as that we sign with the sign of the cross those
          who place their hope in Christ; and then asks who taught this in
          scripture?" Chrysostom, who lived in the same age, manifestly refers
          to it, when he says,[41] "how can you think it fitting for the
          minister to make the sign on its (the child's) forehead, where you
          have besmeared it with the dirt?" which Cyril[42] calls the royal seal
          upon the forehead. Cyprian in the middle of the third century relates
          the custom of his times;[43] "what is now also in use among us is,
          that those who are baptized, are offered to the governors of the
          church; and through our prayers and imposition of hands, they obtain
          the holy Spirit, and are made compleat signaculo Dominico, with the
          seal of the Lord:" and in another place[44] he says, "they only can
          escape, who are regenerated and signed with the sign of Christ." And
          Tertullian, in the beginning of the same century, speaking of baptism
          says[45] "the flesh is washed, that the soul may be unspotted; the
          flesh is anointed, that the soul may be consecrated; caro signatur,
          "the flesh is signed," that the soul also may be fortified." Now this
          use of the cross in baptism, was as early as any instance of
          infant-baptism that can be produced; higher than Tertulian’s time it
          cannot be carried: what partiality then is it, I know to whom I speak,
          to admit the one upon the foot of tradition, and reject the other? The
          same Tertullian[46] also speaks of sponsores, sponsors, or godfathers,
          in baptism; which this writer himself has mentioned, and thus renders;
          "what occasion is there—except in cases of necessity, that the
          sponsors or godfathers be brought "into danger;" not to take notice of
          the Clementine Constitutions, as our author calls them, which enjoin
          the use of them; and which appear to be as early as infant-baptism
          itself; and indeed it is but reasonable that if infants are baptized,
          there should be sponsors or sureties for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The form of "renouncing the devil and all his works," used in
          baptism, is also by Basil[47] represented as an apostolic tradition;
          for having mentioned several rites in baptism, received upon the same
          foot, he adds; "and the rest of what is done in baptism, as to
          renounce the devil and his angels, from what scripture have we it? is
          it not from this private and secret tradition?" Origen before the
          middle of the third century relates the usage of his times;[48] "let
          every one of the faithful remember when he first came to the waters of
          baptism; when he received the first seals of faith, and came to the
          fountain of salvation; what words there he then used; and what he
          denounced to the devil, non se, usurum pompis ejus, "that he would not
          use his pomps, nor his works, nor any of his service, nor obey his
          pleasures:" and Tertullian[49] before him; "when we enter into the
          water, we profess the faith of Christ, in the words of his law; we
          protest with our mouth that we renounce the devil, and his pomp, and
          his angels;" and in another place[50] in proof of unwritten tradition,
          and that it ought to be allowed of in some cases, he says; "to begin
          with baptism; when we come to the water, we do there, and sometimes in
          the congregation under the hand of the pallor, protest that we
          renounce the devil, and his pomp, and angels; and then we are thrice
          immersed; answering something more than the Lord has enjoined in the
          gospel:" now this is as early as any thing can be produced in favor of
          infant-baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Exorcisms and exsusslations are represented by Austin[51] as rites
          in baptism, prisae traditionis, "of ancient tradition," as used by the
          church every where, throughout the whole world. He frequently presses
          the Pelagians with the argument taken from thence, and luggers, that
          they were pinched with it, and knew not how to answer it; he observes,
          that things the most impious and absurd, were the consequences of
          their principles, and among the rest there:[52] "that they (infants)
          are baptized into a Savior, but not saved; redeemed by a deliverer,
          but not delivered; washed in the laver of regeneration, but not washed
          from any thing; exorcised and exsusslated, but not freed from the
          power of darkness:" and elsewhere he says,[53] that "notwithstanding
          their craftiness, they know not what answer to make to this, that
          infants are exorcised and exsusslated; for this, without doubt, is
          done in mere show, if the devil has no power over them; but if he has
          power over them, and therefore are not exorcised and exsusstated in
          mere show, by what has the prince of sinners power over them, but by
          sin?" And Gregory Nazianzen before him, as he exhorts to confession of
          sin in baptism, so to exorcism; "do not refuse, says he,[54] the
          medicine of exorcism—for that is the trial of sincerity, with respect
          to that grace (baptism)." And says Optatus of Milevis,[55] "every man
          that is born, though born of Christian parents, cannot be without the
          spirit of the world, which must be excluded and separated from him,
          before the salutary laver; this exorcism effects, by which the unclean
          spirit is driven away, and is caused to flee to desert places."
          Cyprian, in the third century, speaking of the efficacy of baptism to
          destroy the power of Satan, relates what was done in his day;[56]
          "that by the exorcist the devil was buffeted, distressed, and
          tortured, with an human voice, and by a divine power." And Cornelius
          bishop of Rome, a contemporary of his, makes mention[57] of the same
          officers in the church; and this is also as early as the practice of
          infant-baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Trine immersion is affirmed to be an apostolic tradition, nothing
          is more frequently asserted by the ancients than this. Basil,[58]
          among his instances of apostolic tradition, mentions this; "now a man
          is thrice immersed, from whence is it derived?" his meaning is, is it
          from scripture or apostolic tradition? not the former, but the latter.
          And Jerom,[59] in a dialogue of his, makes one of the parties say
          after this manner, which clearly appears to be his own sense; "and
          many other things which by tradition are observed in the churches,
          have obtained the authority of a written law; as to dip the head
          thrice in the laver," etc. And so Tertullian in the third century as
          above, in support of tradition, mentions[60] this as a common
          practice; "we are thrice immersed;" and elsewhere speaking[61] of the
          commission of Christ, he says, "he commanded them to dip into the
          Father, and the Son, and the holy Ghost; not into one, for not once,
          but thrice are we dipped, at each name, into each person;" and he is
          the first man that makes mention of infant-baptism, who relates this
          as the then usage of the church: and Sozomen[62] the historian
          observes, that it was said, that: "Eunomius was the first that dared
          to assert, that the divine baptism should be performed by one
          immersion; and so corrupted the apostolic tradition, which till now
          had been every where observed."
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The consecration of the water of baptism is an ancient rite, and
          which[63] Basil derives from apostolic tradition; "we consecrate, says
          he, the water of baptism, and the anointing oil, as well as the person
          that receives baptism, from what scripture? is it not from private and
          secret tradition?" by which he means apostolic tradition, as he in the
          same place calls it; which was done, not only by the prayer of the
          administrator over the water, but by signing it with the sign of the
          cross; which rite was in use in the times of Austin,[64] who says,
          "baptism is signed with the sign of Christ, that is, the water where
          we are dipped;" and Ambrose, who lived in the same age, relates, that
          exorcism was also used in consecration: he describes the manner of it
          thus:[65] "why did Christ descend first, and afterwards the Spirit,
          seeing the form and use of baptism require, that first the font be
          consecrated, and then the person that is to be baptized, goes down?
          for where the priest first enters, he makes an exorcism, next an
          invocation on the creature of the water, and afterwards prays that the
          font may be sanctified, and the eternal Trinity be present." Cyprian,
          in the middle of the third century, makes mention of this ceremony of
          consecrating the baptismal water; he says,[66] "the water must first
          be cleansed and sanctified by the priest, that it may, by his
          baptizing in it, wash away the sins of the man that is baptized." And
          Tertullian[67] before him, though he makes no difference between the
          water of a pool, river or fountain, Tyber or Jordan, yet supposes
          there is a sanctification of it through prayer; "all waters," he says,
          from their ancient original prerogative, (referring to Gen 1:2)
          "obtain the sacrament of sanctification, Deo invocato, God being
          called upon;" for immediately the Spirit comes down from heaven, and
          rests upon the waters, sanctifying them of himself; and so being
          sanctified, they drink in together the sanctifying virtue." This also
          is as high as the date of infant-baptism can be carried.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Anointing with oil at baptism, is a rite that claims apostolic
          tradition. Basil[68] mentions it as an instance of it, and asks; "the
          anointing oil, what passage in scripture teaches this?" Ausin[69]
          speaks of it as the common custom of the church in his time; having
          quoted that passage in Acts 10:38, "how God anointed him (Jesus) with
          the holy Ghost; adds, not truly with visible oil, but with the gift of
          grace, which is signified by the visible ointment, quo baptizatos
          ungit ecclesia, "with which the church anoints those that are
          baptized:" several parts of the body were wont to be anointed.
          Ambrose[70] makes mention of the ointment on the head in baptism, and
          gives a reason for it. Cyril[71] says, the oil was exorcised, and the
          forehead, ear, nose and breast, were anointed with it, and observes
          the mystical signification of each of there; the necessity of this
          anointing is urged by Cyprian[72] in the third century; "he that is
          baptized must needs be anointed, that by receiving the chrysm, that
          is, the anointing, he may be the anointed of God, and have the grace
          of Christ." And Tertullian, in the beginning of the same century,
          says,[73] as before observed, "the flesh is anointed, that the soul
          may be consecrated;" and in another place,[74] "when we come out of
          the laver, we are anointed with the blessed ointment, according to the
          ancient discipline, in which they used to be anointed with oil out of
          the horn, for the priesthood;" this was the custom used in the times
          of the man that first spoke of infant-baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. The giving a mixture of milk and honey to a person just baptized,
          is a rite that was used in the churches anciently through tradition;
          Jerom[75] makes mention of it, as observed upon this footing, and as
          an instance, among other things which obtained authority in that way:
          "as to dip the head thrice in the laver, and when they came out from
          thence, to taste of a mixture of milk and honey, to signify the new
          birth;" and elsewhere he says,[76] it was a custom observed in the
          western churches to that day, to give wine and milk to them that were
          regenerated in Christ. This was in use in Tertullian’s time; for,
          speaking of the administration of baptism, he says,[77] we come to the
          water—then we are thrice dipped—then being taken out from thence we
          taste a mixture of milk and honey; and this, as well as anointing with
          oil, he observes, was used by heretics themselves, for so he says of
          Marcion;[78] "he does not reject the water of the creator, with which
          he washes his disciples; nor the oil with which he anoints his own;
          nor the mixture of milk and honey, by which he points them out as
          newborn babes;" yea, even Barnabas, a companion of the apostle Paul,
          is thought to refer to this practice, in an epistle of his still
          extant;[79] not to take notice of the white garment, and the use of
          the ring and kiss in baptism, in Cyprian and Tertullian’s time.[80]
        </p>
        <p>
          Now these several rites and usages in baptism, claim their rise from
          apostolic tradition, and have equal evidence of it as infant-baptism
          has; they are of as early date, have the same vouchers, and more; the
          testimonies of them are clear and full; they universally obtained, and
          were practiced by the churches, throughout the whole world; and even
          by heretics and schismatics; and this is to be said of them, that they
          never were opposed by any within the time referred to, which cannot be
          laid of infant-baptism; for the very first man that mentions it,
          dissuades from it: and are there facts which could not but be publicly
          and perfectly known, and for which the ancient writers and fathers may
          be appealed to, not as reasoners and interpreters, but as historians
          and witnesses to public standing facts; and all the reasoning this
          gentleman makes use of, concerning the apostles forming the churches
          on one uniform plan of baptism, the nearness of infant-baptism to
          their times, from the testimony of the ancients, the difficulty of an
          innovation, and the easiness of its detection, may be applied to all
          and each of these rites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherefore whoever receives infant-baptism upon the foot of apostolic
          tradition, and upon such proof and evidence as is given of it, as
          above, if he is an honest man; I say again, if he is an honest man, he
          ought to give into the practice of all those rites and usages. We do
          not think ourselves indeed obliged to regard these things; we know
          that a variety of superstitious, ridiculous, and foolish rites, were
          brought into the church in there times; we are not of opinion, as is
          suggested, that even the authority of the apostles a hundred years
          after their death, was sufficient to keep an innovation from entering
          the church, nor even whilst they were living; we are well assured,
          there never was such a set of impure wretches under the Christian
          name, so unfound in principle, and so bad in practice, as were in the
          apostles days, and in the ages succeeding, called the purest ages of
          Christianity. We take the Bible to be the only authentic, perfect and
          sufficient rule of faith and practice: we allow of no other head and
          lawgiver but one, that is, Christ; we deny that any men, or let of
          men, have any power to make laws in his house, or to decree rites and
          ceremonies to be observed by his people, no not apostles themselves,
          uninspired: and this gentleman, out of this controversy, is of the
          same mind with us, who asserts the above things we do; and affirms,
          without the least hesitation, that what is "ordained by the apostles,
          without any precept from the Lord, or any particular direction of the
          holy Spirit, is not at all obligatory as a law upon the consciences of
          Christians;—even the apostles had no dominion over the faith and
          practice of Christians, but what was given them by the special
          presence, and Spirit of Christ, the only Lawgiver, Lord, and Sovereign
          of the church: they were to teach only the things which he should
          command them; and whatever they enjoined under the influence of that
          Spirit, was to be considered and obeyed as the injunctions of Christ;
          but if they enjoined any thing in the church, without the peculiar
          influence and direction of this Spirit, that is, as merely fallible
          and unassisted men, in that case, their injunctions had no authority
          over conscience; and every man's own reason had authority to examine
          and discuss their injunctions, as they approved themselves to his
          private judgment, to observe them or not: should we grant thee what
          you ask.—lays he to his antagonist—that the church in the present age,
          has the same authority and power, as the church in the apostolic age,
          considered, as not being under any immediate and extraordinary
          guidance of the holy Ghost what will you gain by it? This same
          authority and power is you see, Sir, really no power nor authority at
          all."[81]
        </p>
        <p>
          The controversy between us and our brethren on this head, is the same
          as between Papists and Protestants about tradition, and between the
          church of England and Dissenters, about the church's power to decree
          rites and ceremonies namely, whether Christ is the sole head and
          lawgiver in his church; or whether any let of men have a power to set
          aside, alter, and change any laws of his, or prescribe new ones? if
          the latter, then we own it is all over with us, and we ought to
          submit, and not carry on the dispute any further: but since we both
          profess to make the Bible our religion, and that only the rule of our
          faith and practice; let us unite upon this common principle, and
          reject every tradition of men, and all rites and ceremonies which
          Christ hath not enjoined, us; let us join in pulling down this prop of
          Popery, and remove this scandal of the Protestant churches, I mean
          infant-baptism; for lure I am, so long as it is attempted to support
          it upon the foot of apostolic tradition, no man can write with success
          against the Papists, or such, who hold that the church has a power to
          decree rites and ceremonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          However; if infant baptism is a tradition of the apostles, then this
          point must be gained, that it is not a scriptural business; for if it
          is of tradition, then not of scripture; who ever appeals to tradition,
          when a doctrine or practice can be proved by scripture? appealing to
          tradition, and putting it upon that foot, is giving it up as a point
          of scripture: I might therefore be excused from considering what this
          writer has advanced from scripture in favor of infant-baptism, and the
          rather, since there is nothing produced but what has been brought into
          the controversy again and again, and has been answered over and over:
          but perhaps this gentleman and his friends will be displeased, if I
          take no notice of his arguments from thence; I shall therefore just
          make some few remarks on them. But before I proceed, I must
          congratulate my readers upon the blessed times we are fallen into!
          what an enlightened age! what an age of good sense do we live in! what
          prodigious improvement in knowledge is made! behold! tradition proved
          by Scripture! apostolic tradition proved by Abraham’s covenant!
          undoubted apostolic tradition proved from writings in being hundreds
          of years before any of the apostles were born! all extraordinary and
          of the marvelous kind! but let us attend to the proof of there things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first argument is taken from its being an incontestable fact, that
          the infants of believers were received with their parents into
          covenant with God, in the former dispensations or ages of the church;
          which is a great privilege, a privilege still subsisting, and never
          revoked; wherefore the infants of believers, having still a right to
          the same privilege, in consequence have a right to baptism, which is
          now the only appointed token of God's covenant, and the only rite of
          admission into it.[82]
        </p>
        <p>
          To which I reply, that it is not an incontestable loci:, but a fact
          contested, that the infants of believers were with their parents taken
          into covenant with God, in the former dispensations and ages of the
          church; by which must be meant, the ages preceding the Abrahamic
          covenant; since that is made, to furnish out a second and distinct
          argument from this; and so the scriptures produced are quite
          impertinent (Gen 17:7; Gen 17:10-12; Deut 29:10-12; Ezek 16:20-21),
          seeing they refer to the Abrahamic and Mosaic dispensations, of which
          hereafter. The first covenant made with man, was the covenant of
          works, with Adam before the fall, which indeed included all his
          posterity, but had no peculiar regard to the infants of believers; he
          standing as a federal head to all his feed, which no man since has
          ever done: and in him they all finned, were condemned, and died. This
          covenant, I presume this Gentleman can have no view unto: after the
          fall of Adam, the covenant of grace was revealed, and the way of life
          and salvation by the Messiah; but then this revelation was only made
          to Adam and Eve personally, as interested in there things, and not to
          their natural feed and posterity as such, as being interested in the
          same covenant of grace with them; for then all mankind must be taken
          into the covenant of grace; and if that gives a right to baptism, they
          have all an equal right to unto it; and so there is nothing peculiar
          to the infants of believers; and of whom, there is not the least
          syllable mentioned throughout the whole age or dispensation of the
          church, reaching from Adam to Noah; a length of time almost equal to
          what has run out from the birth of Christ, to the present age. The
          next covenant we read of, is the covenant made with Noah after the
          flood, which was not made with him, and his immediate offspring only;
          nor were they taken into covenant with him as the infants of a
          believer; nor had they any sacrament or rite given them as a token of
          Jehovah being their God, and they his children, and as standing in a
          peculiar relation to him; will any one dare to say this of Ham, one of
          the immediate sons of Noah? The covenant was made with Noah and all
          mankind, to the end of the world, and even with every living creature,
          and all the beasts of the earth, promising them security from an
          universal deluge, as long as the world stands; and had nothing in it
          peculiar to the infants of believers: and these are all the covenants
          the scripture makes mention of, till that made with Abraham, of which
          in the next argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          This being the case, there is no room nor reason to talk of the
          greatness of this privilege, and of the continuance of it, and of
          asking when it was repealed, since it does not appear to have been a
          fact; nor during there ages and dispensations of the church, was there
          ever any sacrament, rite, or ceremony, appointed for the admission of
          persons adult, or infants, into covenant with God; nor was there ever
          any such rite in any age of the world, nor is there now: the covenant
          with Adam, either of works or grace, had no ceremony of this kind;
          there was a token, and still is, of Noah’s covenant, the rainbow, but
          not a token or rite of admission of persons into it, but a token of
          the continuance and perpetuity of it in all generations: nor was
          circumcision a rite of admission of Abraham’s feed into his covenant,
          as will quickly appear; nor is baptism now an initiatory rite, by
          which persons are admitted into the covenant. Let this Gentleman, if
          he can, point out to us where it is so described; persons ought to
          appear to be in the covenant of grace, and partakers of the blessings
          of it, the Spirit of God, faith in Christ, and repentance towards God,
          before they are admitted to baptism. This Gentleman will find more
          work to support his first argument, than perhaps he was aware of; the
          premises being bad, the conclusion must be wrong. I proceed to,
        </p>
        <p>
          The second argument, taken from the Abrabamic covenant, which stands
          thus: The covenant God made with Abraham and his seed, Gen 17:1-27 :
          into which his infants were taken together with himself, by the rite
          of circumcision, is the very same we are now under, the same with that
          in Gal 3:16-17 still in force, and not to be disannulled, in which we
          believing Gentiles are included (Rom4:9-17), and so being Abraham's
          seed, have a right to all the grants and privileges of it, and so to
          the admission of our infants to it, by the sign and token of it, which
          is changed from circumcision to baptism.[83] But,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. though Abraham’s seed were taken into covenant with him, which
          designs his adult posterity in all generations, on whom it was
          enjoined to circumcise their infants, it does not follow that his
          infants were; but so it is, that wherever the words seed, children,
          etc. are used, it immediately runs in the heads of some men, that
          infants must be meant, though they are not necessarily included; but
          be it so, that Abraham’s infants were admitted with him, (though at
          the time of making this covenant, he had no infant with him, Ishmael
          was then thirteen years of age) yet not as the infants of a believer;
          there were believers and their infants then living, who were left out
          of the covenant; and those that were taken in successive generations,
          were not the infants of believers only, but of unbelievers also; even
          all the natural feed of the Jews, whether believers or unbelievers.—
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Those that were admitted into this covenant, were not admitted by
          the rite of circumcision; Abraham’s female feed were taken into
          covenant with him, as well as his male feed, but not by any viable
          rite or ceremony; nor were his male feed admitted by any such rite, no
          not by circumcision; for they were not to be circumcised until the
          eighth day; to have circumcised them sooner would have been criminal;
          and that they were in covenant from their birth, this gentleman, I
          presume, will not deny.—
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The covenant of circumcision, as it is called (Acts 7:8), cannot be
          the same covenant we are now under, since that is abolished (Gal
          5:1-3), and it is a new covenant, or a new administration of the
          covenant of grace, that we are now under; the old covenant under the
          Mosaic dispensation is waxen old, and vanished away (Heb 8:8; Heb
          8:13), nor is the covenant with Abraham (Gen 17:1-27), the same with
          that mentioned in Gal 3:17 which is still in force, and not to be
          disannulled; the distance of time between them does not agree, but
          falls short of the apostle's date, four and twenty years; for from the
          making of this covenant to the birth of Isaac, was one year (Gen 17:1;
          Gen 21:5), from thence to the birth of Jacob, sixty years (Gen 25:26),
          from thence to his going down to Egypt, one hundred and thirty years
          (Gen 47:9), where the Israelites continued two hundred and
          fifteen;[84] and quickly after they came out of Egypt, was the law
          given, which was but four hundred and fix years after this covenant.
          The reason this gentleman gives, why they must be the same, will not
          hold good, namely, "this is the only covenant in which "God ever made
          and confirmed promises to Abraham, and to his seed;" since God made a
          covenant with Abraham before this, and confirmed it to his seed, and
          that by various rites, and usages, and wonderful appearances (Gen
          15:8-18), which covenant, and the confirmation of it, the apostle
          manifestly refers to in Gal 3:17 and with which his date exactly
          agrees, as the years are computed by Paraeus[85] thus; from the
          confirmation of the covenant, and taking Hagar to wife, to the birth
          of Isaac, fifteen years; from thence to the birth of Jacob, sixty (Gen
          25:26), from thence to his going down to Egypt, one hundred and thirty
          (Gen 47:9), from thence to his death, seventeen (Gen 47:28), from
          thence to the death of Joseph, fifty three (Gen 1:26), from thence to
          the birth of Moses, seventy-five; from thence to the going out of
          Israel from Egypt, and the giving of the law, eighty years; in all
          four hundred and thirty years.—
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is allowed, that the covenant made with Abraham (Gen 17:1-27),
          is of a mixed kind, consisting partly of temporal, and partly of
          spiritual blessings; and that there is a twofold seed of Abraham, to
          which they severally belong; the temporal blessings, to his natural
          seed the Jews, and the spiritual blessings, to his spiritual seed,
          even all true believers that walk in the steps of his faith, Jews or
          Gentiles (Rom4:11-12; Rom4:16), believing Gentiles are Abraham's
          spiritual seed, but then they have a right only to the spiritual
          blessings of the covenant, not to all the grants and privileges of it;
          for instance, not to the land of Canaan; and as for their natural
          feed, there have no right, as such, to any of the blessings of this
          covenant, temporal or spiritual: for either they are the natural, or
          the spiritual seed of Abraham; not his natural seed, no one will say
          that; not his spiritual seed, for only believers are such; they which
          are of faith (believers) the same are the children of Abraham; and if
          ye be Christ’s, (that is, believers) then are ye Abraham’s seed, and
          heirs according to the premise; and it is time enough to claim the
          promise, and the grants and privileges of it, be they what they will,
          when they appear to be believers; and as for the natural seed of
          believing Gentiles, there is not the least mention made of them in
          Abraham’s covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Since Abraham’s seed were not admitted into covenant with him, by
          any visible rite or token, no not by circumcision, which was not a
          rite of admission into the covenant, but a token of the continuance of
          it to his natural seed, and of their distinction from other nations,
          until the Messiah came; and since therefore baptism cannot succeed it
          as such, nor are the one or the other seals of the covenant of grace,
          as I have elsewhere[86] proved, and shall not now repeat it; upon the
          whole, this second argument can be of no force in favor of
          infant-baptism: and here, if any where, is the proper time and place
          for this gentleman to ark for the repeal of this ancient privilege, as
          he calls it,[87] of infants being taken into covenant with their
          parents, or to shew when it was repealed; to which I answer, that the
          covenant made with Abraham, into which his natural feed were taken
          with him, so far as it concerned them as such, or was a national
          covenant, it was abolished and disannulled when the people of the Jews
          were cut off as a nation, and as a church; when the Mosaic
          dispensation was put an end unto, by the coming, sufferings, and death
          of Christ:, and by the destruction of that people on their rejection
          of him; when God wrote a Loammi upon them, and said, Ye are not my
          people, and I will not be your God (Hos 1:9) when he took his staff,
          beauty, and cut it asunder, that he might break his covenant he had
          made with this people (Zec 11:10), when the old covenant and old
          ordinances were removed, and the old church-state utterly destroyed,
          and a new church-state was set up, and new ordinances appointed; and
          for which new rules were given; and to which none are to be admitted,
          without the observance of them; which leads me to The third argument,
          taken from the commission of Christ for baptism (Mat 28:19), and from
          the natural and necessary sense in which the apostles would understand
          it;[88] though this gentleman owns that it is delivered in such
          general terms, as not certainly to determine whether adult believers
          only, or the infants also of such are to be baptized; and if so, then
          surely no argument can be drawn from it for admitting infants to
          baptism. And,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The rendering of the words, disciple or proselyte all nations,
          baptizing them, will not help the cause of infant-baptism; for one
          cannot be a proselyte to any religion, unless he is taught it, and
          embraces and professes it; though had our Lord used a word which
          conveyed such an idea, the evangelist Matthew was not at a loss for a
          proper word or phrase to express it by; and doubtless would have made
          use of another clear and express, as he does in Mat 23:15.—
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The suppositions this writer makes, that if, instead of baptizing
          them, it had been said circumcising them, the apostles without any
          farther warrant would have naturally and justly thought, that upon
          proselytizing the Gentile parent, and circumcising him, his infants
          also were to be circumcised: or if the twelve patriarchs of old had
          had a divine command given them, to go into Egypt, Arabia, etc. and
          teach them the God of Abraham, circumcising them, they would have
          understood it as authorizing them to perform this ceremony, not upon
          the parent only, but also upon the infants of such as believed on the
          God of Abraham. As these suppositions are without foundation, so I
          greatly question whether they would have been so understood, without
          some instructions and explanations; and betides the cases put are not
          parallel to this before us, since the circumcision of infants was
          enjoined and practiced before such a supposed commission and command;
          whereas the baptism of infants was neither commanded nor practiced
          before this commission of Christ; and therefore could not lead them to
          any such thought as this, whatever the other might do.—
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The characters and circumstances of the apostles, to whom the
          commission was given, will not at all conclude that they apprehended
          infants to be actually included; some in which they are represented
          being entirely false, and others nothing to the purpose: Jews they
          were indeed, but men that knew that the covenant of circumcision was
          not still in force, but abolished: men, who could never have observed
          that the infants of believers with their parents had always been
          admitted into covenant, and passed under the same initiating rite:
          men, who could not know, that the Gentiles were to be taken into a
          joint participation of all the privileges of the Jewish church; but
          must know that both believing Jews and Gentiles were to constitute a
          new church, state, and to partake of new privileges and ordinances,
          which the Jewish church knew nothing of:—men, who were utter strangers
          to the baptism of Gentile proselytes, to the Jewish religion, and of
          their infants; and to any baptism, but the ceremonial ablutions,
          before the times of John the Baptist:—men, who were not tenacious of
          their ancient rites after the Spirit was poured down upon them at
          Pentecost, but knew they were now abolished, and at an end:—men,
          though they had seen little children brought to Christ to have his
          hands laid on them, yet had never seen an infant baptized in their
          days:—men, who though they knew that infants were sinners, and under a
          sentence of condemnation, and needed remission of sin and
          justification, and that baptism was a means of leading the faith of
          adult persons to Christ for them; yet knew that it was not by baptism,
          but by the blood of Christ, that there things are obtained:—men, that
          knew that Christ came to set up a new church-state; not national as
          before, but congregational; not consisting of carnal men, and of
          infants without understanding; but of spiritual and rational men,
          believers in Christ; and therefore could not be led to conclude that
          infants were comprehended in the commission: nor is Christ's silence
          with respect to infants to be construed into a strong and most
          manifest presumption in their favor, which would be presumption
          indeed; or his not excepting them, a permission or order to admit
          them: persons capable of making such constructions, are capable of
          doing and saying any thing. I hasten to The fourth argument, drawn
          from the evident and clear consequences of other passages of
          scripture;[89] as,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. From Rom11:17 and if some of the branches be broken off, etc. here
          let it be noted, that the olive tree is not the Abrahamic covenant or
          church, into which the Gentiles were grafted; for they never were
          grafted into the Jewish church, that, with all its peculiar
          ordinances, being abolished by Christ; signified by the shaking of the
          heaven and the earth, and the removing of things shaken (Heb 12:26-27)
          but the gospel church-state, out of which the unbelieving Jews were
          left, and into which the believing Gentiles were engrafted, but not in
          the stead of the unbelieving Jews: and by the root and fatness of the
          olive-tree, are meant, not the religious privileges and grants
          belonging to the Jewish covenant or church, which the Gentiles had
          nothing to do with, and are abolished; but the privileges and
          ordinances of the gospel-church, which they with the believing Jews
          jointly partook of, being incorporated together in the same
          church-state; and which, as it is the meaning of Rom11:17 so of Eph
          3:6 in all which there is not the least syllable of baptism; and much
          less of infant, baptism; or of the faith of a parent grafting his
          children with himself, into the church or covenant-relation to God,
          which is a mere chimera, that has no foundation either in reason or
          scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. From Mk 10:14. Suffer little children to come unto me, etc. and Jn
          3:5. Except any one is born of water, etc. from there two passages put
          together, it is said, the right of infants to baptism may be clearly
          inferred; for in one they are declared actually to have a place in
          God's kingdom or church, and yet into it, the other as expressly says,
          none can be admitted without being baptized. But supposing the former
          of these texts is to be understood of infants, not in a metaphorical
          sense, or of such as are compared to infants for humility, etc. which
          sense some versions lead unto, and in which way some Paedobaptists
          interpret the words, particularly Calvin, but literally; then by the
          kingdom of God, is not meant the visible church on earth, or a gospel
          church-state, which is not national, but congregational; consisting of
          persons gathered out of the world by the grace of God, and that make a
          public profession of the name of Christ, which infants are incapable
          of, and so are not taken into it: betides, this sense would prove too
          much, and what this writer would not choose to give into, viz. that
          infants, having a place in this kingdom or church, must have a right
          to all the privileges of it; to the Lord's supper, as well as to
          baptism; and ought to be treated in all respects as other members of
          it. Wherefore it should be interpreted of the kingdom of glory, into
          which we doubt not that such as these in the text are admitted; and
          then the strength of our Lord's argument lies here; that since he came
          to save such infants as these, as well as adult persons, and bring
          them to heaven, they should not be hindered from being brought to him
          to be touched by him, and healed of their bodily diseases: and so the
          other text is to be understood of the kingdom of God, or heaven, in
          the same sense; but not of water-baptism as necessary to it, or that
          without which there is no entrance into it; which mistaken, shocking
          and stupid sense of them, led Austin, and the African churches, into a
          confirmed belief and practice of infant-baptism; and this sense being
          imbibed, will justify him in all his monstrous, absurd and impious
          tenets, as this writer calls them, about the ceremony of baptismal
          water, and the absolute necessity of it unto salvation: whereas the
          plain meaning of the words is, that except a man be born again of the
          grace of the Spirit of God, comparable to water, he cannot enter into
          the kingdom of God, or be a partaker of the heavenly glory; or without
          the regenerating grace of the Spirit of God, which in Titus 3:5 is
          called the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghost,
          there can be no meetness for, no reception into, the kingdom of
          heaven; and therefore makes nothing for the baptizing of infants.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. A distinction between the children of believers and of unbelievers,
          is attempted from 1Cor 7:14 as if the one were in a visible
          covenant-relation to God, and the other not; whereas the text speaks
          not of two sorts of children, but of one and the same, under supposed
          different circumstances; and is to be understood not of any federal,
          but matrimonial holiness, as I have shewn elsewhere,[90] to which I
          refer the reader. As for the Queries with which the argument is
          concluded, they are nothing to the purpose, unless it could be made
          out, that it is the will of God that infants should be baptized, and
          that the baptism of them would give them the remission of sins, and
          justify their persons; neither of which are true: and of the same kind
          is the harangue in the introduction to this treatise: and after all a
          poor, slender provision is made for the salvation of infants,
          according to this author's own scheme, which only concerns the infants
          of believers, and leaves all others to the uncovenanted mercies of
          God, as he calls them; seeing the former are but a very small part of
          the thousands of infants that every day languish under grievous
          distempers, are tortured, convulsed, and in piteous agonies give up
          the ghost. Nor have I any thing to do with what this writer lays,
          concerning the moral purposes and use of infant-baptism in religion;
          since the thing itself is without any foundation in the word of God:
          upon the whole, the baptism of infants is so far from being a
          reasonable service, that it is a most unreasonable one; since there is
          neither precept nor precedent for it in the sacred writings; and it is
          neither to be proved by scripture nor tradition.
