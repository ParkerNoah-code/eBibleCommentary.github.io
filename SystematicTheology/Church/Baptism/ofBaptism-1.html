        <h2>A Divine Command to be Observed</h2>
        <p>
          Being A Sermon Preached At Barbican, October 9, 1765 At The Baptism Of
          The Reverend
        </p>
        <p>Mr. Robert Carmichael, Minister Of The Gospel In Edinburgh.</p>
        <h2>The Preface</h2>
        <p>
          The following discourse was not designed for the press; had it, the
          subject of it would have been a little more enlarged upon; and,
          perhaps, might have appeared in a little better dress; but as the
          publication of it is become necessary, I chose to let it go just as it
          was delivered, as nearly in the very words and expressions, as my
          memory could assist me; the sense, I am sure, is no where departed
          from; that it might not be said, that any thing that was spoken is
          concealed, changed, or altered. The warmest solicitations of my
          friends would never have prevailed upon me to have made it public,
          being unwilling to renew the controversy about baptism unnecessarily;
          and being determined only to write in self-defense, when attacked, or
          whenever the controversy is renewed by others; for I am very sensible,
          that the argument on both sides is greatly exhausted, and scarce any
          thing new can be expected, that is serious and pertinent: but the rude
          attack upon the sermon in two letters in a news-paper, determined me
          at once to send it out into the world, as being a sufficient
          confutation of itself, without any remarks at all, of the lies and
          falsehoods, calumnies, cavils and impertinencies, with which the
          letters abound; whereby it will appear to every reader, how fairly
          that writer charges me with railing against my brethren, and the whole
          Christian world; and how injuriously he represents me, as treating all
          that differ from me as fools, unlearned, ignorant of the scriptures,
          and unclean. It is hard we cannot practice what we believe, and speak
          in vindication of our practice, without being abused, vilified and
          insulted in a public news-paper; is this treating us as brethren, as
          the writer of the letters, in a canting way, affects to call us? And
          how does this answer to the false character of Candidus, he assumes? I
          shall not let myself down so low, nor do I think it fitting and decent
          to go into, and carry on a religious controversy in a newspaper, and
          especially with so worthless a writer, and without a name. This base
          and cowardly way of writing, is like the Indians’ manner of fighting;
          who set up an hideous yell, pop off their guns behind bushes and
          hedges, and then run away and hide themselves in the thickets.
          However, if the publication of this discourse should be of any service
          to relieve or strengthen the minds of any, with respect to their duty
          in the observance of the ordinance of baptism, I am content to bear
          the indignities of men, and shall reckon it an over-balance to all
          their reproaches and insults. - J. G.
        </p>
        <h2>Baptism A Divine Commandment</h2>
        <p>
          Being about to administer the Ordinance of Baptism, before we enter
          upon the administration of it, I shall drop a few words on the
          occasion, from a passage of scripture you will find in
        </p>
        <p>
          "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments, and his
          commandments are not grievous." - 1 Jn 5:3
        </p>
        <p>
          What I shall say in the following discourse, will much depend upon the
          sense of the word commandments; by which are meant, not the ten
          commandments, or the commandments of the moral law delivered by Moses
          to the children of Israel; which, though they are the commands of God,
          and to be observed by Christians under the present dispensation; since
          we are not without law to God, but under the law to Christ (1Cor
          9:21); and are to be kept from a principle of love to God, for the end
          of the commandment is charity, or love, out of a pure heart, and of a
          good conscience, and of faith unfeigned (1Tim 1:5); yet there commands
          are not easy of observation, through the weakness of the flesh, or
          corruption of nature; nor can they be perfectly kept by any of Adam’s
          fallen race; for there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good
          and sinneth not (Ecc 7:20); and he that offends in one point is guilty
          of all (Jam 2:10); and is exposed to the curse and condemnation of the
          law, which runs in this tenor, Cursed is every one that continueth not
          in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them
          (Gal 3:10); hence this law in general is called a fiery law, the
          letter which kills, and the ministration of condemnation and death,
          which make it terrible to offenders; however, it may be delighted in
          by believers in Christ after the inward man: nor are the commandments
          of the ceremonial law intended, which being many and numerous, were
          burdensome; especially to carnal men, who were frequently ready to say
          concerning them, What a weariness is it? One of its precepts,
          circumcision, is called a yoke, which, says the apostle Peter, neither
          our fathers nor we were able to bear (Acts 15:10); because it bound
          persons to keep the whole law, which they could not do; and the whole
          is said to be a yoke of bondage (Gal 5:1), and consequently its
          commandments grievous; besides this law was abrogated before the
          apostle John wrote this epistle, and its commandments were not to be
          kept; Christ had abolished this law of commandments contained in
          ordinances; and there is now a disannulling of the whole of it,
          because of its weakness and unprofitableness (Eph 2:15; Heb 7:18);
          rather the commandments of faith and love the apostle speaks of in 1
          Jn 3:23 may be designed; And this is his commandment, that we should
          believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as
          he gave us commandment: there were exhortations, injunctions and
          commands of Christ to his disciples, which were to be kept by them,
          and were not grievous. Ye believe in God, says he (Jn 14:1), believe
          also in me; and again, A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love
          one another, as I have loved you (Jn 8:34); but inasmuch as Christ, as
          lawgiver in his church, has appointed some special and peculiar laws
          and ordinances to be observed, and which he calls his commandments, he
          that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me
          (Jn 14:21); very agreeably to our text; and after he had given his
          apostles a commission to preach and baptize, he adds, teaching them to
          observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you (Mat 28:20); and
          whereas, among these commandments and ordinances, baptism and the
          Lord’s supper are the chief and principal, I choose to understand the
          text of them;[1] and since we are about to administer the first of
          these at this time, I shall confine my discourse chiefly to that, and
          shall attempt the following things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. To shew that baptism, water-baptism, is a command of God and
          Christ, or a divine command.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. That being a divine command, it ought to be kept and observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The encouragement to keep it; it is the love of God, and it is a
          commandment not grievous.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The ordinance of water-baptism is a divine command. John, the
          forerunner of our Lord, was the first administrator of it, and from
          thence was called the Baptist; and he did not administer it of his own
          mind and will, but had a mission and commission from God to do it;
          There was a man sent from God, whole name was John; and he was sent by
          him, not to preach the gospel only, but to baptize; for so he himself
          says, he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me,
          etc. (Jn 1:6; Jn 1:33). Hence Christ put this question to the chief
          priests and elders of the Jews, the baptism of John, whence was it?
          from heaven or of men? (Mat 21:25-26), this brought them into such a
          dilemma, that they knew not what answer to give, and chose to give
          none; our Lord’s design by the question was to shew that John’s
          baptism was of divine institution, and not human; wherefore he charges
          the Pharisees and Lawyers with rejecting the counsel of God against
          themselves, being not baptized of him (Lk 7:30), that is, of John; and
          he elsewhere (Mat 3:15), speaks of his baptism as a part of
          righteousness to be fulfilled, and was fulfilled by him. Now John’s
          baptism and Christ’s were, as to the substance of them, the same;
          John’s baptism was allowed of and approved of by Christ, as appears
          from his submission to it; and the ordinance was confirmed by the
          order he gave to his apostles to administer it: one of John’s
          disciples said to his master, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond
          Jordan, to whom thou bearest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and
          all men come to him (Jn 3:26); though, as is said afterwards, Jesus
          himself baptized not, but his disciples (Jn 4:2); that is, they
          baptized by his orders; and which were renewed after his resurrection
          from the dead, saying, Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,
          baptizing them, etc. (Mat 28:19), and which orders were obeyed by his
          apostles, as many instances in the Acts of the Apostles shew; and that
          it was water baptism they administered, according to Christ’s
          instructions and directions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In matters of worship there ought to be a command for what is done; as
          this ordinance of baptism is a solemn act of worship, being performed
          in the name of the Father, and of the San, and of the holy Ghost. God
          is a jealous God, and especially with respect to the worship of him;
          nor should any thing be introduced into it but what he has commanded;
          and careful should we be hereof, left he should say unto us, who hath
          required this at your hands? (Isa 1:12), it is not enough that such
          and such things are not forbidden; for on this footing a thousand
          fooleries may be brought into the worship of God, which will be
          relented by him. When Nadab and Abibu offered strange fire to the
          Lord, which he commanded not, fire came down from heaven and destroyed
          them: we should have a precept for what we do, and that not from men,
          but from God; lest we incur the charge of worshipping God in vain,
          teaching for doctrines the commandments of men (Mat 15:9), and involve
          ourselves in the guilt of superstition, and will-worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherefore, the baptism of infants must be wrong; since there is no
          command of God and Christ for it; if there was any, it might be
          expected in the New Testament, and in that only; it is absurd to send
          us to the Old Testament for a command to observe a New
          Testament-ordinance; it is a groin absurdity to send us so far back as
          to Gen 17:1-27 [2] for a warrant for the ordinance of baptism; we
          might as well be lent to the first chapter of that book; for there is
          no more relating to that ordinance in the one than in the other. Was
          there a like precept for the baptism of infants under the New
          Testament, as there was for the circumcision of infants under the Old
          Testament, there could be no objection to it; but it is an absurdity
          of absurdities to affirm, that baptism comes in the room of
          circumcision; since baptism was in force and use long before
          circumcision was abolished; circumcision was not abolished until the
          death of Christ, when that, with other ceremonies, had an end in him;
          but baptism was administered many years before to multitudes, by John,
          by the order of Christ, and by his apostles; now where is the good
          sense of saying, and with what propriety can it be laid, that one
          thing succeeds another, as baptism circumcision, when the one, said to
          succeed, was in use and force long before the other teared, it is
          pretended it succeeded?
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is any precept for Infant-baptism, it must be in the New
          Testament; there only it can be expected, but there it cannot be
          found; not in Mat 19:14, Suffer little children, and forbid them not
          to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven; which is no
          precept, but a permission, or grant, that little children might come,
          or be brought unto him; but for what? not for baptism; but for that
          for which they were brought, and which is mentioned by the evangelist
          in the preceding verse, that he should put his hands on them, and
          pray, or give them his blessing; as it reams it was usual in those
          times, and with those people, as formerly, to bring their children to
          persons venerable for religion and piety, to be blessed by them in
          this way; and such an one they might take Jesus to be, though they
          might not know he was the Messiah. Two other evangelists say, they
          were brought unto him that he should touch them; as he sometimes
          touched diseased persons when he healed them; and these children might
          be diseased, and brought to him to be cured of their diseases;
          however, not to be baptized by thrill, for he baptized none; they
          would rather have brought them to the disciples, had it been for such
          a purpose; and had it been the practice of the apostles to baptize
          infants, they would not have refused them; and our Lord’s entire
          silence about Infant-baptism at this time, when there was so fair an
          opportunity to speak of it, and enjoin it, had it been his will, has
          no favorable aspect on that practice. The reason given by thus for the
          permission of infants to come to him, for of such is the kingdom of
          heaven, is figurative and metaphorical; and not to be understood of
          the infants themselves, but of such as they; of such who are
          comparable to them for their humble deportment, and harmless lives; or
          to use our Lord’s words elsewhere, such who are converted, and become
          at little children (Mat 18:2).[3] Nor is a command for Infant-baptism
          contained in the commission to baptize (Mat 28:19), Go ye, therefore,
          and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and
          of the Son, and of the holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is argued, that "since all nations are to be baptized, and infants
          are a part of them, then, according to the command of Christ, they are
          to be baptized." But it should be observed, that the commission is
          indeed to teach all nations, but not to baptize all nations; the
          antecedent to the relative them, is not all nations; the words pagta
          ta eqnh, all nations,are of the neuter gender; but autouv, them, is of
          the masculine, and do not agree; the antecedent is maqhtav, disciples,
          which is understood, and supposed, and contained in the word
          maqhteusate, teach, or make disciples; and the sense is, teach all
          nations, and baptize them that are taught, or are made disciples by
          teaching. If the above argument proves any thing, it would prove too
          much; and what proves too much, proves nothing: it would prove, that
          not only the infants of Christians, but the infants of Turks, Jews,
          and Pagans, should be baptized, since they are part of all nations;
          yea, that every individual person in the world should be baptized,
          heathens, as well as Christians, and even the molt profligate and
          abandoned of mankind, since they are part of all nations.[4]
        </p>
        <p>
          And as there is no precept for the baptism of infants, so no precedent
          for it in the word of God. Though there was no clear and express
          command for it, which yet we think is necessary, and is required in
          such a case; yet, if there was a precedent of any one infant being
          baptized, we should think ourselves obliged to pay a regard unto it;
          but among the many thousands baptized by John, by Christ, or, however,
          by his order, and by his apostles, not one single instance of an
          infant being baptized can be found. We read, indeed, of households
          being baptized; from whence it is argued, that there might be, and it
          is probable there were, infants in them, who might be baptized; but it
          lies upon those who are of a different mind, to prove there were any
          in those households. To put us upon proving a negative, that there
          were none there, is unfair. However, as far as a negative can be
          proved, we are capable of it.[5] There are but three families usually
          observed, if so many; Lydia’s, the Jailor’s, and that of Stephanas, if
          not the fame with the Jailor’s, as some think. As for Lydia’s
          household, or those in her house, they were brethren; whom,
          afterwards, the apostles went to see, and whom they comforted; and so
          not infants. As for the Jailor’s household, they were such as were
          capable of hearing the word preached to them, and of believing it; for
          it is said, he rejoiced, believing in God with all his house (Acts
          16:40; Acts 16:34): and if any man can find any other in his house,
          besides all that were in it, he must be reckoned a very sagacious
          person. As for the household of Stephanas, (if different from the
          Jailor’s) it is said, that they addicted themselves to the ministry of
          the saints (1Cor 1:16; 1Cor 16:15): and whether this be understood of
          the ministry of the word to the saints, or of the ministration of
          their substance to the poor, they must be adult persons, and not
          infants. Seeing then there is neither precept nor precedent for
          Infant-baptism in the word of God, of which I defy the whole world to
          give one tingle precedent, we cannot but condemn it as unscriptural,
          and unwarrantable.[6] I proceed,
        </p>
        <p>
          II. To shew that the ordinance of water-baptism, being a divine
          command, it ought to be kept, and observed, as directed to in the word
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I shall shew, by whom it is to be kept and observed. 1. By
          sensible, repenting sinners. John’s baptism was called the baptism of
          repentance (Mk 1:4); because repentance was previous to it; and the
          very first persons that were baptized by him, were such who were
          sensible of their sins, repented of them, and ingenuously confessed
          them; for it is said, they were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing
          their sins; and whereas others applied to him for baptism, of whom he
          had no good opinion, he required of them, that they would first bring
          forth fruits meet for repentance; and not to think with themselves, we
          have Abraham to our father (Mat 3:6-9); since such a plea would be of
          no avail with him; and the very first persons that were baptized after
          our Lord had given to his apostles the commission to baptize, were
          penitent ones; for under the first sermon after this, three thousand
          were pricked in their heart, and cried out, Men and brethren, what
          shall we do? To whom the apostle Peter gave this instruction and
          direction: Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of
          Jesus Christ (Acts 2:38); and accordingly, on their repentance, they
          were baptized. 2. This command is to be kept and observed by believers
          in Christ; he that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved (Mk
          16:16). Faith goes before baptism, and is a pre-requisite to it; as
          the various instances of baptism recorded in the scriptures shew.
          Philip went down to Samaria, and preached Christ there to the
          inhabitants of it; and when they believed Philip, preaching the things
          concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were
          baptized both men and women (Acts 8:12).

        <p>
          The same minister of the word was bid to join himself to the chariot
          of an Eunuch, returning from Jerusalem, where he had been to worship,
          and whom he found reading a prophecy in Isaiah; and said unto him,
          Understandest thou what thou readest? To which he answered, How can I,
          except some man should guide me? And being taken up into the chariot
          with him: from that scripture, Philip preached Jesus to him, his word,
          and ordinances, as the sequel shews; for when they came to a certain
          water, the Eunuch laid, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be
          baptized? And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart,
          thou mayest. Otherwise not, it seems; for notwithstanding his religion
          and devotion, without faith in Christ, he had no right to that
          ordinance; He answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the
          Son of God (Acts 8:36-37); upon which profession of his faith, he was
          baptized. The apostle Paul preached the gospel at Corinth with
          success; and it is observed by the historian, that many of the
          Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptized (Acts 18:8). First
          they heard the word, then they believed in Christ, the sum and
          substance of the word, and upon the profession of their faith, were
          baptized. 3. The ordinance of water-baptism is to be attended to, and
          observed by such who are the disciples of Christ; it is said that
          Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John (Jn 4:1). First made
          them disciples, and then baptized them; that is, ordered his apostles
          to baptize them; with which his commission to them agrees, Teach all
          nations, baptizing them; make disciples, and baptize them that are so
          made. Now, what is it to be disciples of Christ? Such may be said to
          be so, who have learned to know Christ, and believe in him; who are
          taught to deny sinful self, righteous self, and civil self, for his
          sake, and to take up the cross and follow him, in the exercise of
          grace and in the discharge of duty: and, 4. Such as have received the
          Spirit of God, are proper persons to observe the ordinance of baptism,
          and submit unto it: Can any man forbid water, that these should not be
          baptized, who have received the holy Ghost as well as we? (Acts
          10:47); as a Spirit of illumination and conviction, as a Spirit of
          sanctification, faith and consolation, and as a Spirit of adoption.
        </p>
        <p>
          2dly, Next let us consider in what manner the ordinance of baptism is
          to be kept and observed: and,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It should be kept in faith; for without faith it is impossible to
          please God; and whatsoever is not of faith, is sin (Heb 11:6;
          Rom14:23).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In love, and from a principle of love to Christ, and which is the
          end of every commandment, and of this; If ye love me, says Christ’s,
          keep my commandments (Jn 14:15). It should be kept as it was at first
          delivered and observed: the manner in which it is to be performed and
          submitted to, is immersion, or covering the whole body in water; and
          which agrees with the primary sense of the word baptizw, which
          signifies to dip or plunge, as all learned men know;[7] and he must be
          a novice in the Greek language, that will take upon him to contradict
          what has been ingenuously owned by so many men of learning. Had our
          translators thought fit to have translated the word, which they have
          not in those places where the ordinance of baptism is made mention of,
          for reasons easily to be guessed at, but have adopted the Greek word
          baptize in all such places; had they truly translated it, the eyes of
          the people would have been opened, and the controversy at once would
          have been at an end, with respect to this part of it, the mode of
          baptism; however we have proof sufficient that it was performed, and
          ought to be performed by immersion, as appears,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. By the places where it was administered, as the river Jordan, where
          John baptized many, and where our Lord himself was baptized; and
          AEnon, near Salim, which he chose for this reason, because there was
          much water there (Mat 3:6; Mat 3:13); now if the ordinance was
          administered in any other way than by immersion, what need was there
          to make choice of rivers and places abounding with water to baptize
          in?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. By the instances of persons baptized, and the circumstances
          attending their baptism, as that of our Lord, of whom it is said, When
          he was baptized, he went up straightway out of the water (Mat 3:16);
          which manifestly implies that he had been in it, of which there would
          have been no need, had the ordinance been administered to him in any
          other way than by immersion; as by sprinkling or pouring a little
          water on his head, as the painter ridiculously describes it. The
          baptism of the Eunuch is another instance proving baptism by
          immersion; when he and Philip were come to a certain water, and it was
          agreed to baptize him, it is said, they went down both into the waters
          both Philip and the Eunuch, and he baptized him. And when they were
          come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip
          (Acts 8:38-39). The circumstances of going down into the water, and
          coming up out of it, manifestly shew in what manner the Eunuch was
          baptized, namely, by immersion; for what reason can be given why they
          should go into the water, had it been performed in any other way?
        </p>
        <p>
          3.[8] The end of baptism, which is to represent the burial and
          resurrection of Christ, cannot be answered any other way than by
          immersion; that it is an emblem of the burial and resurrection of
          Christ, and of the burial and resurrection of believers in him, is
          clear from Rom6:4, Col 2:12 buried with him by baptism, and in
          baptism. Now only an immersion or covering of the whole body in water,
          and not pouring or sprinkling a little water on the face, can be a
          representation of a burial; will any man in his senses say, that a
          corpse is buried, when only a little dust or earth is sprinkled or
          poured on its face?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The figurative baptisms, or the allusions made to baptism in
          scripture, shew in what manner it was administered; the passage of the
          Israelites under the cloud, and through the sea, is called a being
          baptized in the cloud and in the sea (1Cor 10:1-2); and with great
          propriety may it be called a baptism, as that is by immersion; for the
          waters standing up as a wall on each fide of them, through which, and
          the cloud over their heads, under which they passed, they were like
          persons immersed in water:[9] likewise the overwhelming sufferings of
          Christ are fitly called a baptism, in allusion to baptism by
          immersion.[10] I have a baptism to be baptized with, says he; and how
          am I straitened until it be accomplished? (Lk 12:50); and which
          sufferings of Christ, in prophetic language, agreeable to baptism by
          immersion, are thus described; I am come into deep waters, where the
          floods overflow me (Ps 119:1-2). Once more; the extraordinary donation
          of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, is called a being baptized with
          the holy Ghost (Acts 1:5); the emblem of which was a rushing mighty
          wind, which filled all the house where they were sitting (Acts 2:2);
          so that they were as if immersed into it, and covered with it, and
          therefore very properly called a baptism, in allusion to baptism by
          immersion. I go on,
        </p>
        <p>
          III. To observe the encouragement, motives, and reasons given to keep
          this ordinance, as well as others,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The apostle says, this is the love of God; that is, this shews love
          to God; it is a plain case, that a man loves God, when he keeps his
          commandments; this is an evidence, that he loves not in word, and in
          tongue only, but in deed and in truth. Others may say that they love
          God and Christ; but this is the man that truly loves them, even he
          that hath my commandments, says Christ (Jn 14:21), and keepeth them;
          he it is that loveth me: and it is a clear care, that such a man has a
          sense of the love of God and Christ; the love of the Father is in him;
          and the love of Christ constrains him to observe his ordinances, and
          keep his commands; and such may expect greater manifestations of the
          love of God and Christ unto them; for of such that keep the
          commandments of Christ, he says, I will love him, and manifest myself
          to him; — and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and
          make our abode with him (Jn 14:23); which is no small inducement and
          encouragement to an observation of the ordinances and commands of
          Christ, and among the rest this of baptism.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Another encouraging motive and reason is, the commandments of God
          and Christ are not grievous, hard and difficult to be performed. The
          Lord’s supper is not; nor is baptism. What is baptism in water, to the
          baptism of sufferings Christ endured for us? And yet how desirous was
          he of accomplishing it? (Lk 12:50). And therefore why should we think
          it an hardship, or be backward to comply with his will, in submitting
          to the ordinance of water-baptism? When Naaman was bid by Elisha to
          dip himself in Jordan, and be clean; which he relented as too little
          and trifling a thing, and thought he might as well have stayed in his
          own land, and dipped himself in one of the rivers of Syria; one of his
          servants took upon him to allay and repress the heat of his passion
          and resentment, by observing, that if the prophet had bid him do some
          great thing, which was hard and difficult to be performed, he would
          have gone about it readily; how much rather then, he argued, should he
          attend to the direction of the prophet, when he only bid him wash in
          Jordan, and be clean? (2 Kin 5:13). There are many that will go into
          baths, and plunge themselves in them for pleasure or profit, to
          refresh their bodies, or cure them of disorders; but if plunging in
          water is directed to, as an ordinance of God, then it is a grievous
          thing; and, indeed, no ordinance is grateful to a carnal mind; but to
          believers in Christ, wisdom’s ways are ways of pleasantness, and her
          paths of peace. Christ’s yoke, if it may be called so, is easy, and
          his burden light. Now to close with a few words:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Let none despise this command of God, the ordinance of baptism;
          remember it is a command of his; be it at your peril if you do; it is
          hard kicking against the pricks; it is dangerous to treat with
          contempt any of the commands of God, and ordinances of Christ; beware,
          lest that should come upon you, and be fulfilled in you, behold, ye
          despisers, and wonder, and perish. (Acts 8:40-41).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Let such who see it their duty to be baptized, not tarry, but
          immediately submit unto it; let them make haste, and delay not, to
          keep this command; remembering the motives, and encouragement to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Let those that yield obedience to it, do it in the name and
          strength of Christ; in the faith of him, from love to him, and with a
          view to his glory.
        </p>

        <h2>ENDNOTES:</h2>
        <p>
          [1] Let the commandments be what they may, which are chiefly intended
          in the text; yet since water-baptism is a commandment of God, and
          allowed to be such, and the rest of the commandments mentioned are not
          denied to be, nor excluded from being the commandments of God; there
          can be no impropriety in treating on the commandment of baptism
          particularly and singly from this passage of scripture; and it might
          have escaped, one would have thought, a sneer, though it has not, of a
          scurrilous writer, in a late newspaper, referred to in the preface.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2] That we are ever referred to this chap. or, for a proof of
          Infant-baptism, is denied, and pronounced a willful, is
          representation, by the above mentioned writer, in his second letter in
          the newspaper. This man must have read very little in the controversy,
          to be ignorant of this. The very last writer that wrote in the
          controversy, that I know of, calls the covenant made with Abraham in
          that chapter “the grand turning point, on which the issue of the
          controversy very much depends; and that if Abraham’s covenant, which
          included his infant-children, and gave them a sight to circumcision,
          was not the covenant of grace; then he freely confesses, that the main
          ground, on which they assert the right of infants to baptism, is taken
          away; and consequently, the principal arguments in support of the
          doctrine, are overturned.” Bostwick’s Fair and Rational Vindication of
          the Right of Infants to the Ordinance of Baptism, etc. p. 19.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3] The above letter-writer, in the news-paper, observes, “that the
          kingdom of heaven signifies either the kingdom, or church of Christ
          here, or the kingdom of glory above. If the former, they are declared,
          by Christ himself, real subjects of his among men; if the latter, if
          members of the invisible church, why not of the visible?” But, in
          fact, they themselves are not intended, only such as they; such who
          are comparable to them for meekness and humility; for freedom from
          malice, pride, and ambition. But admitting that the words are to be
          understood of infants literally, the kingdom of heaven cannot design
          the kingdom, or church of Christ under the gospel dispensation, which
          is not national, but congregational; consisting of men gathered out of
          the world, by the grace of God, and who make a public profession of
          Christ, which infants are not capable of, and so cannot be real
          subjects of it; and if they were, they mull have an equal right to the
          Lord’s supper, as to baptism, of which they are equally capable. The
          kingdom of glory then being recant, it is asked, if members of the
          invisible church, why not of the visible? They may be, when it appears
          that they are of the invisible church, which only can be manifest by
          the grace of God bestowed on them; and it is time enough to talk of
          their baptism when that is evident; and when it is clear they have
          both a right unto, and meetness for the kingdom of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          [4] But our letter-writer says, “When the apostles received their
          commission, they could not understand it otherwise than to baptize the
          parents that embraced the faith of Christ; through their preaching,
          and all their children with them, as was the manner of the ministers
          of God in preceding ages, by circumcision;” but if they so understood
          it, and could not other ways understand it, it is strange they should
          not practice according to it, and baptize children with their parents;
          of which we have no one instance. By the ministers of God in preceding
          ages, I suppose, he means the priests and prophets, under the Old
          Testament-dispensation; but these were not the operators of
          circumcision, which was done by parents and others: and surely it
          cannot be said, it was the usual manner of ministers to baptize
          parents, and their children with them in those ages; and it is pretty
          unaccountable how they should baptize them by circumcision, as is
          affirmed; this is something unheard of before, and monstrously
          ridiculous and absurd.
        </p>
        <p>
          [5] The above writer affirms, that my manner of “proving the negative,
          was by barely asserting there were no children in any of the families,
          mentioned in the scriptures, as baptized.” The falsity of which
          appears by the following descriptive, characters given of the patrons
          in the several, families, and the reasonings upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          [6] In his turn, the writer in the news-paper, “defies me to produce
          one scripture precept, or precedent, for delaying the baptism of
          children of Christian parents; or for baptizing adult persons, born of
          such parents. On this the controversy hinges.” It is ridiculous to
          talk of a precept for delaying that which was not in being; and of a
          precedent for delaying that which had never been practiced. If a
          warrant is required for baptizing adult persons, believers, it is
          ready at hand (Mk 16:16), and precedents enough: and we know of no
          precept to baptize any other, let them be born of whom they may; and
          as for precedents of the baptism of adult persons, born of Christian
          parents, it cannot be expected, nor reasonably required of us; since
          the Acts of the Apostles only give an account of the planting of the
          first churches; and of the baptism of those of which they first
          consisted; and not of those that in a course of years were added to
          them. Wherefore, to demand instances of persons, born of Christian
          parents, and brought up by them, as baptized in adult age, which would
          require length of time, is unreasonable; and if the controversy hinges
          on this, it ought to be at an end, and given up by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          [7] The letter-writer makes me to say, “All the world acknowledge
          baptizw, signifies to dip or plunge, and never to sprinkle or pour
          water on any thing,” which is a false representation of my words, and
          of the manner in which they were delivered; however, this I affirm,
          that in all the Greek Lexicons I ever few, and I have seen a pretty
          many, I do not pretend in have fern all that have been published; yet
          in what my small library furnishes me with, the word is always
          rendered in the first and primary sense by mergo, immergo, to dip or
          plunge into; and in a secondary and consequential sense, by abluo,
          lavo, to wash, because what is dipped is washed; and never by persundo
          or aspergo, to pour or sprinkle; as the Lexicon published by
          Constantine, Budaeus, etc. those of Hadrian, Junius, Plantinus,
          Scapula. Sebreveius, and Stockins, besides a great number of critics
          that might be mentioned; and if this writer can produce any one
          Lexicographer of any note, that renders the word to pour or sprinkle,
          let him name him. This ignorant scribbler puts the following
          questions, “Did the Jews plunge their whole bodies in water always
          before they did eat? Did they dip their pots, brazen vessels and
          beds?” He does not suffer me to answer the questions, but answers for
          me, “He knows the contrary.” But if I may be allowed to answer for
          myself, I must say, by the testimonies of the Jews themselves, and of
          others, I know they did; that is, when they came flora market, having
          touched the common people, or their clothes, immersed themselves in
          water; so says Maimonides in Misn. Chagigah. c. e. sect. 7. “If the
          Pharisees touched but the garments of the common people they were
          defiled, and needed immersion, and were obliged to it.” And Scaliger
          observes, de Emend. Temp. 1. 6. p. 271. “That the more superstitious
          part of the Jews, every day before they sat down to meat, dipped the
          whole body; hence the Pharisee’s admiration at Christ (Lk 11:38).”
          According to the law of Moses (Lev 11:32), unclean vessels were washed
          by putting or dipping them into water; and according to the traditions
          of the ciders, to which our Lord refers (Mk 7:4), not only brazen
          vessels and tables, but even beds, bolsters and pillows unclean, in a
          ceremonial sense, were washed by immersion in water. So the Jews say
          in their Misnah, or book of traditions, “A bed that is wholly defiled,
          a man dips it part by part.” Celim, c. 26. sect. 14. See also Mikvaot,
          c. 7. sect. 7.
        </p>
        <p>
          [8] The above letter-writer asks, “How often must I be told, that the
          particle eiv and ek are in hundreds of places in the New Testament
          rendered unto and from?” be it so; it follows not, that they mull be
          so rendered here. Greek particles or prepositions have different
          significations, according to the words and circumstances with which
          they are used; nor is it as proper or a more just reading of the
          words, “they went down unto the water and came up from it;” it is
          neither proper nor just; for before this, they are expressly said to
          come to a certain water, to the waterside; wherefore when they went
          down, they went not unto it, if they were there before, but into it;
          as it must be allowed the preposition sometimes, at least, signifies;
          and circumstances require that it should be so rendered here, let it
          signify what it may elsewhere; and this determines the sense of the
          other preposition, that it tour and ought to be rendered out of; for
          as they went down into the water, when they came up, it must be out of
          it. What he means by the strange question that follows, “What will he
          make of Christ’s going into a mountain?” I cannot devise, unless he
          thinks the translation of Lk 6:12 is wrong, or nonsense, or both; but
          has this wiseacre never heard or read of a cave in a mountain, into
          which men may go, and properly be said to go into the mountain; and
          such an one it is highly probable our Lord went into, to pray alone;
          such as the cave in mount Horeb, into which Elijab went. But his
          tip-top translation of all is that of John’s baptizing in Jordan,
          which he supposes might be rendered, by baptizing the people with the
          river Jordan. This is the man that reproaches me with very freely
          finding fault with the translators; my complaint is only of a
          non-translation, not of a wrong one; but this man finds fault with the
          translation as wrong, or however thinks it may be corrected or mended,
          and that in more places than one.

          [9] The letter-writer I have often referred to, affirms, that “the
          learned world universally maintain, that the Israelites were no other
          ways baptized in the sea, than by being sprinkled with the spray of
          the tolling waves, agitated by the wind that blew as they passed
          through the channel.” Who the learned world be, that maintain this
          whimsical notion, I own, I am quite ignorant of, having never yet met
          with any learned man that ever asserted it. It is a mere conceit and a
          wild imagination, and contrary to the sacred scriptures, which
          represent the waves of the feat through which the Israelites passed,
          not as agitated and tossed about, but as standing unmoved, as a wall
          on each side of them, whatever was the care in that part where the
          Egyptians were; The floods, says the inspired writer, stood uprights
          as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea (Ex
          15:8). And if there was a continual spray of the tossing waves, as the
          Israelites passed through the channel, how could they pass through the
          sea on dry ground? As they are said to do (Ex 14:16; Ex 14:22; Ex
          14:29). What this man scoffs at, the celebrated Grotius, who is
          universally allowed to be a man of learning and sense, expresses in a
          note on 1Cor 10:2 “were baptized, that is, as if they were baptized;
          for there was some likeness in it; the cloud was over their heads, and
          so water is over them that are baptized; the sea encompassed the sides
          of them, and so water those that are baptized.”

          [10] The same writer is pleased to represent this explanation of the
          baptism of the Spirit as ridiculous; but some of greater learning than
          he can pretend to, have so explained it, as particularly Dr. Casaubon,
          famous for his great knowledge of the Greek language; though perhaps
          this very illiberal man will call the learned doctor a dunce for what
          he says; his words on Acts 1:5 are these, “though I do not disapprove
          of the word baptize being retained here, that the antithesis may be
          full; yet I am of opinion that regard is had in this place to its
          proper signification, for baptizein is to immerse, so as to tinge or
          dip; and in this sense the apostles were truly said to be baptized;
          for the house in which this was done was filled with the holy Ghost,
          so that the apostles seemed to be plunged into it as into a pool.” In
          confirmation of which, he makes mention on Acts 2:2 of an observation
          in a Greek commentary on it, “the wind filled the whole house, filling
          it like a pool; since it was promised to them (the apostles) that they
          should be baptized, with the Holy Ghost.” It seems to be the same
          commentary, Erasmus, on the place, says went under the name of
          Chrysostom, in which are there words, as he gives them, “the whole
          house was so filled with fire, though invisible, as a pool is filled
          with water.” — Our scribbler, in order to expose the notion of
          dipping, as used in the baptism of the spirit, and fire, condescends,
          for once, to read dip, instead of baptize; “John said I indeed dip you
          with water, but one, mightier than I, cometh, he shall dip you with
          the holy Ghost, and with fire.” But not only the word baptize should
          be read dip, but the preposition “should be rendered in; in water; and
          in the holy Ghost; and in fire; and the phrase of dipping in fire, is
          no unusual one, both in Jewish and Greek authors; as I have shewn in
          my Exposition of the place, and of Acts 2:3.
