            him in water." In the ritual of Severus, patriarch of Antioch, the
            following passages occur, "John mixed the waters of baptism, and
            Christ sanctified them, end descended that he might be baptized in
            them. Altitude and profundity imparted glory to him," —" Who hast

            sacramentary of Gregory the Great directs that persons to be
            baptized should be immersed. All the ancient Greek rituals require
            immersion. In the Manuale ad usum Sarum, published in England in the
            twenty-first year of Henry the eighth, is a direction to the priest
            to take the child and </span

            Tertullian, who died A.D. 220, speaking of the mode of baptism in
            Africa, tells us that a baptized person is "let down into the water,
            and dipped between the utterance of a few words." "I do not see,"
            confesses Professor Stuart, "how any doubt can well remain, that in
            Tertullian's time the practice of the African church, to say the
            least, as to the mode of baptism, must have been that of trine
            immersion." Gregory of Nyssa, says, "Coming into the water...we hide
            ourselves in it;" and Basil speaks of three immersions. Thus, then,
            in Asia Minor, for there these two bishops lived during the fourth
            century, the custom was like our own. Chrysostom, on the third
            chapter of John, informs us of the manner in which baptism was
            administered in Constantinople during the same century.

            water, the old man is buried, and sinking down, the whole is
            concealed at once; then, as we emerge, the new man rises again,"
            Ambrose, archbishop of Milan at the same period, says, "Thou saidst,
            I believe, and thus wast immerged, that is, thou wast buried."

            testimony. Thus, then, as late as the fourth century, immersion was
            still customary in Europe, Asia Minor, and Africa. The Oriental and
            Greek churches have always practised dipping, as they yet do. Even
            as late as the year 850, W. Strabo speaks of immersion as being
            general.

            "in the times of Thomas Aquinas (thirteenth century) and
            Bonaventure, immersion was in Italy the most common way." Such,
            according to Fuller, was the practice of the English church from the
            beginning, —a statement borne out by the language of Tyndale, who,
            at the eve of the Reformation, speaks of it as the general practice;
            and by the autobiography of bishop Chappell, who states that he was
            immersed, as was the custom in the parish in which he was born.

            for the performance of this rite. Tertullian tells us that "it
            mattered not where a person was baptized, whether in the sea, or in
            standing or running water, in fountain, lake, or river."
            Subsequently, baptistries were built for immersion, large enough for
            ecclesiastical councils to be held in them, as indeed was sometimes
            the case. More recently still fonts were erected, that in them the
            subjects of baptism might be dipped. Hundreds of these fonts are yet
            in existence. The fathers, in speaking of the place of baptism,
            frequently call it "the bath." All these statements point to one
            result.</span

            occurs, "And again, the word baptism will not express any other
            thing besides dipping." Strong proof, this! The most able scholar
            among the modern Greeks, Dr. Cory, who dies 1834, in the "Synopsis
            of Orthodox Doctrine," published for the use of the schools in
            Athens, says that the baptized person is "plunged into the water."
            Indeed the members of the Greek church call those of the western
            churches "sprinkled christians," by way of ridicule. Pity that these
            Greeks had not the valuable assistance of one Canadian scholar. They

            have those that are to be baptized, to be altogether dipped into the
            water, as the word doth sound, and the mystery doth signify."
            Milton, Seldon, and Johnson all confess the same. Seldon says, "In
