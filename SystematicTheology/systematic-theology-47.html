        <p>VII. Conversion</p>
        <p>
          From the discussion of regeneration and effectual calling there is a
          natural transition to that of conversion. By a special operation of
          the Holy Spirit the former issues in the latter. Conversion may be a
          sharply marked crisis in the life of the individual, but may also come
          in the form of a gradual process. In the psychology of religion the
          two are generally identified. All this points to the close relation
          between the two.
        </p>
        <p>A. THE SCRIPTURAL TERMS FOR CONVERSION.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE OLD TESTAMENT WORDS. The Old Testament employs especially two
          words for conversion, namely:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Nacham which serves to express a deep feeling, either of sorrow
          (niphal) or of relief (piel). In niphal it means to repent, and this
          repentance is often accompanied with a change of plan and of action,
          while in piel it signifies to comfort or to comfort one's self. As a
          designation of repentanceâ€”and this is the meaning with which we are
          concerned here â€”it is used not only of man but also of God,
          Gen_6:6-7; Exo_32:14; Jdg_2:18; 1Sa_15:11.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Shubh which is the most common word for conversion, means to turn,
          to turn about, and to return. It is often used in a literal sense of
          both God and man, but soon acquired a religious and ethical
          signification. This meaning is most prominent in the prophets, where
          it refers to Israel's return to the Lord, after it has departed from
          Him. The word clearly shows that, what the Old Testament calls
          conversion, is a return to Him from whom sin has separated man. This
          is a very important element in conversion. It finds expression in the
          words of the prodigal son, "I will return, and go to my father."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE NEW TESTAMENT WORDS. There are especially three words that come
          into consideration here:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Metanoia (verbal form, metanoeo). This is the most common word for
          conversion in the New Testament, and is also the most fundamental of
          the terms employed. The word is composed of meta and nous, which is
          again connected with the verb ginosko (Lat. noscere; Eng., to know ),
          all of which refers to the conscious life of man. In the English Bible
          the word is translated " repentance " but this rendering hardly does
          justice to the original, since it gives undue prominence to the
          emotional element. Trench points out that in the classics the word
          means: (1) to know after, after-knowledge; (2) to change the mind as
          the result of this after-knowledge; (3) in consequence of this change
          of mind, to regret the course pursued; and (4) a change of conduct for
          the future, springing from all the preceding. It might indicate a
          change for the worse as well as for the better, however, and did not
          necessarily include a resipiscentia â€” a becoming wise again. In the
          New Testament, however, its meaning is deepened, and it denotes
          primarily a change of mind, taking a wiser view of the past, including
          regret for the ill then done, and leading to a change of life for the
          better. Here the element of resipiscentia is present. Walden in his
          work on The Great Meaning of Metanoia comes to the conclusion that it
          conveys the idea of "a general change of mind, which becomes in its
          fullest development an intellectual and moral regeneration."60 While
          maintaining that the word denotes primarily a change of mind, we
          should not lose sight of the fact that its meaning is not limited to
          the intellectual, theoretical consciousness, but also includes the
          moral consciousness, the conscience. Both the mind and the conscience
          are defiled, Tit_1:15, and when a person's nous is changed, he not
          only receives new knowledge, but the direction of his conscious life,
          its moral quality, is also changed. To become more particular, the
          change indicated by his word has reference, (1) to the intellectual
          life, 2Ti_2:25, to a better knowledge of God and His truth, and a
          saving acceptance of it (identical with the action of faith); (2) to
          the conscious volitional life, Act_8:22, to a turning from self to God
          (thus again including an action of faith); and (3) to the emotional
          life, in so far as this change is accompanied with godly sorrow,
          2Co_7:10, and opens new fields of enjoyment for the sinner. In all
          these respects metanoia includes a conscious opposition to the former
          condition. This is an essential element in it, and therefore deserves
          careful attention. To be converted, is not merely to pass from one
          conscious direction to another, but to do it with a clearly perceived
          aversion to the former direction. In other words metanoia has not only
          a positive but also a negative side; it looks backward as well as
          forward. The converted person becomes conscious of his ignorance and
          error, his wilfulness and folly. His conversion includes both faith
          and repentance. Sad to say, the Church gradually lost sight of the
          original meaning of metanoia. In Latin theology Lactantius rendered it
          " resipiscentia," a becoming-wise-again, as if the word were derived
          from meta and anoia, and denoted a return from madness or folly. The
          majority of Latin writers, however, preferred to render it "
          poenitentia " a word that denotes the sorrow and regret which follows
          when one has made a mistake or has committed an error of any kind.
          This word passed into the Vulgate as the rendering of metanoia, and,
          under the influence of the Vulgate, the English translators rendered
          the Greek word by "repentance," thus stressing the emotional element
          and making metanoia equivalent to metameleia. In some cases the
          deterioration went even farther. The Roman Catholic Church
          externalized the idea of repentance in its sacrament of penance so
          that the metanoeite of the Greek Testament (Mat_3:2) became
          poenitentiam agite, â€” "do penance," in the Latin Version.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Epistrophe (verbal form, epistrepho). This word is next in
          importance to metanoia. While in the Septuagint metanoia is one of the
          renderings of nacham, the words epistrophe and epistrepho serve to
          render the Hebrew words teshubhah and shubh. They are constantly used
          in the sense of turning again or turning back. The Greek words must be
          read in the light of the Hebrew, in order to bring out the important
          point that the turning indicated is in reality a re-turning. In the
          New Testament the noun epistrophe is used but once, Act_15:3, while
          the verb occurs several times. It has a somewhat wider signification
          than metanoeo and really indicates the final act of conversion. It
          denotes not merely a change of the nous or mind, but stresses the fact
          that a new relation is established, that the active life is made to
          move in another direction. This must be borne in mind in the
          interpretation of Act_3:19, where the two are used alongside of each
          other. Sometimes metanoeo contains the idea of repentance only, while
          epistrepho always includes the element of faith. Metanoeo and
          pisteuein can be used alongside of each other; not so epistrepho and
          pisteuein.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Metameleia (verbal form, metamelomai). Only the verbal form is used
          in the New Testament, and literally means to become a care to one
          afterwards. It is one of the renderings of the Hebrew nicham in the
          Septuagint. In the New Testament it is found only five times, namely,
          in Mat_21:29; Mat_21:32; Mat_27:3; 2Co_7:10; Heb_7:21. It is evident
          from these passages that the word stresses the element of repentance,
          though this is not necessarily true repentance. In it the negative,
          retrospective and emotional element is uppermost, while metanoeo also
          includes a volitional element and denotes an energetic turn-about of
          the will. While metanoeo is sometimes used in the imperative, this is
          never the case with metamelomai. The feelings do not permit themselves
          to be commanded. This word corresponds more nearly to the Latin
          poenitentia than does metanoeo.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE BIBLICAL IDEA OF C.ONVERSION. DEFINITION.</p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of conversion is, of course, like all other doctrines,
          based on Scripture and should be accepted on that ground. Since
          conversion is a conscious experience in the lives of many, the
          testimony of experience can be added to that of the Word of God, but
          this testimony, however valuable it may be, does not add to the
          certainty of the doctrine taught in the Word of God. We may be
          grateful that in recent years the Psychology of Religion paid
          considerable attention to the fact of conversion, but should always
          bear in mind that, while it has brought some interesting facts to our
          attention, it did little or nothing to explain conversion as a
          religious phenomenon. The Scriptural doctrine of conversion is based
          not merely on the passages containing one or more of the terms
          mentioned in the preceding, but also on many others in which the
          phenomenon of conversion is described or represented concretely in
          living examples. The Bible does not always speak of conversion in the
          same sense. We may distinguish the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. NATIONAL CONVERSIONS. In the days of Moses, Joshua, and the Judges,
          the people of Israel repeatedly turned their backs upon Jehovah, and
          after experiencing the displeasure of God, repented of their sin and
          returned unto the Lord; there was a national conversion in the kingdom
          of Judah in the days of Hezekiah and again in the days of Josiah. Upon
          the preaching of Jonah the Ninevites repented of their sins and were
          spared by the Lord, Jon_3:10. These national conversions were merely
          of the nature of moral reformations. They may have been accompanied
          with some real religious conversions of individuals, but fell far
          short of the true conversion of all those that belonged to the nation.
          As a rule they were very superficial. They made their appearance under
          the leadership of pious rulers, and when these were succceeded by
          wicked men, the people at once fell back into their old habits.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. TEMPORARY CONVERSIONS. The Bible also refers to conversions of
          individuals that represent no change of the heart, and are therefore
          of only passing significance. In the parable of the sower Jesus speaks
          of such as hear the word and at once receive it with joy, but have no
          root in themselves, and therefore endure but for a while. When
          tribulations and trials and persecutions come, they are speedily
          offended and fall away. Mat_13:20-21. Paul makes mention of Hymenaeus
          and Alexander, who "made shipwreck concerning the faith," 1Ti_1:19-20.
          Cf. also 2Th_2:17-18. And in 2Ti_4:10 he refers to Demas who left him,
          because the love of the present world gained the upper hand. And the
          writer of Hebrews speaks of some as falling away "who were once
          enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers
          of the Holy Spirit, and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of
          the age to come," Heb_6:4-6. Finally, John says of some who had turned
          their backs upon the faithful: "They went out from us, but they were
          not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with
          us," 1Jn_2:19. Such temporary conversions may for a time have the
          appearance of true conversions.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. TRUE CONVERSION (CONVERSIS ACTUALIS PRIMA). True conversion is born
          of godly sorrow, and issues in a life of devotion to God, 2Co_7:10. It
          is a change that is rooted in the work of regeneration, and that is
          effected in the conscious life of the sinner by the Spirit of God; a
          change of thoughts and opinions, of desires and volitions, which
          involves the conviction that the former direction of life was unwise
          and wrong and alters the entire course of life. There are two sides to
          this conversion, the one active and the other passive; the former
          being the act of God, by which He changes the conscious course of
          man's life, and the latter, the result of this action as seen in man's
          changing his course of life and turning to God. Consequently, a
          twofold definition must be given of conversion: (a) Active conversion
          is that act of God whereby He causes the regenerated sinner, in His
          conscious life, to turn to Him in repentance and faith. (b) Passive
          conversion is the resulting conscious act of the regenerated sinner
          whereby he, through the grace of God, turns to God in repentance and
          faith. This true conversion is the conversion with which we are
          primarily concerned in theology. The Word of God contains several
          striking examples of it, as, for instance, the conversions of Naaman,
          2Ki_5:15; Manasseh, 2Ch_33:12-13; Zaccheus, Luk_19:8-9; the man born
          blind, Joh_9:38; the Samaritan woman, Joh_4:29; Joh_4:39; the eunuch,
          Act_8:30 ff.; Cornelius, Act_10:44 ff.; Paul, Act_9:5 ff.; Lydia,
          Act_16:14. and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. REPEATED CONVERSION. The Bible also speaks of a repeated
          conversion, in which a converted person, after a temporary lapse into
          the ways of sin, turns back to God. Strong prefers not to use the word
          "conversion" for this change, but to employ such words and phrases as
          "breaking off, forsaking, returning from, neglects or transgressions,"
          and "coming back to Christ, trusting Him anew." But Scripture itself
          uses the word "conversion" for such cases, Luk_22:32; Rev_2:5;
          Rev_2:16; Rev_2:21-22; Rev_3:3; Rev_3:19. It should be understood,
          however, that conversion in the strictly soteriological sense of the
          word is never repeated. They who have experienced a true conversion
          may temporarily fall under the spell of evil and fall into sin; they
          may at times even wander far from home; but the new life is bound to
          re-assert itself and will eventually cause them to return to God with
          penitent hearts.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CONVERSION.</p>
        <p>
          Conversion is simply one part of the saving process. But because it is
          a part of an organic process, it is naturally closely connected with
          every other part. Sometimes a tendency becomes apparent, especially in
          our country, to identify it with some of the other parts of the
          process or to glorify it as if it were by far the most important part
          of the process. It is a well known fact that some, in speaking of
          their redemption, never get beyond the story of their conversion and
          forget to tell about their spiritual growth in later years. This is
          undoubtedly due to the fact that in their experience conversion stands
          out as a sharply marked crisis, and a crisis which called for action
          on their part. In view of the present day tendency to lose sight of
          the lines of demarcation in the saving process, it is well to remind
          ourselves of the truth of the old Latin adage, " Qui bene distinguet,
          bene docet. " We should note the following characteristics of
          conversion:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Conversion belongs to the re-creative rather than to the judicial
          acts of God. It does not alter the state but the condition of man. At
          the same time it is closely connected with the divine operations in
          the judicial sphere. In conversion man becomes conscious of the fact
          that he is worthy of condemnation and is also brought to a recognition
          of that fact. While this already presupposes faith, it also leads to a
          greater manifestation of faith in Jesus Christ, a confident trusting
          in Him for salvation. And this faith, in turn, by appropriating the
          righteousness of Jesus Christ, is instrumental in the sinner's
          justification. In conversion man awakens to the joyous assurance that
          all his sins are pardoned on the basis of the merits of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. As the word metanoia clearly indicates, conversion takes place, not
          in the subconscious, but in the conscious life of the sinner. This
          does not mean that it is not rooted in the subconscious life. Being a
          direct effect of regeneration, it naturally includes a transition in
          the operations of the new life from the subconscious to the conscious
          life. In view of this it may be said that conversion begins below
          consciousness, but that, as a completed act, it certainly falls within
          the range of the conscious life. This brings out the close connection
          between regeneration and conversion. A conversion that is not rooted
          in regeneration is no true conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Conversion marks the conscious beginning, not only of the putting
          away of the old man, a fleeing from sin, but also of the putting on of
          the new man, a striving for holiness of life. In regeneration the
          sinful principle of the old life is already replaced by the holy
          principle of the new life. But it is only in conversion that this
          transition penetrates into the conscious life, turning it into a new
          and Godward direction. The sinner consciously forsakes the old sinful
          life and turns to a life in communion with and devoted to God. This
          does not mean, however, that the struggle between the old and the new
          is at once ended; it will continue as long as man lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If we take the word "conversion" in its most specific sense, it
          denotes a momentary change and not a process like sanctification. It
          is a change that takes place once and that cannot be repeated, though,
          as stated above, the Bible also speaks of the Christian's return to
          God, after he has fallen into sin, as conversion. It is the believer's
          turning to God and holiness again, after he has temporarily lost sight
          of these. In connection with regeneration we cannot possibly speak of
          repetition; but in the conscious life of the Christian there are ups
          and downs, seasons of close communion with God and seasons of
          estrangement from Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Over against those who think of conversion only as a definite
          crisis in life, it should be noted that, while conversion may be such
          a sharply marked crisis, it may also be a very gradual change. Older
          theology has always distinguished between sudden and gradual
          conversions (as in the cases of Jeremiah, John the Baptist, and
          Timothy); and in our day the psychology of conversion stresses the
          same distinction. Crisis conversions are most frequent in days of
          religious declension, and in the lives of those who have not enjoyed
          the privileges of a real religious education, and who have wandered
          far from the path of truth, of righteousness, and of holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Finally, in our day, in which many psychologists show an
          inclination to reduce conversion to a general and natural phenomenon
          of the adolescent period of life, it becomes necessary to point out
          that, when we speak of conversion, we have in mind a supernatural work
          of God, resulting in a religious change. The psychologists sometimes
          intimate that conversion is but a natural phenomenon by calling
          attention to the fact that sudden changes also occur in the
          intellectual and moral life of man. Some of them hold that the
          emergence of the idea of sex plays an important part in conversion.
          Over against this rationalistic and naturalistic tendency the specific
          character of religious conversion must be maintained.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS IN CONVERSION.</p>
        <p>
          It already appears from the preceding that conversion comprises two
          elements, namely, repentance and faith. Of these the former is
          retrospective, and the latter prospective. Repentance is directly
          connected with sanctification, while faith is closely, though not
          exclusively, related to justification. In view of the fact that faith
          will be discussed in a separate chapter, we limit ourselves to
          repentance here, and define it as that change wrought in the conscious
          life of the sinner, by which he turns away from sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE ELEMENTS OF REPENTANCE. We distinguish three elements in
          repentance:
        </p>
        <p>
          a.An intellectual element. There is a change of view, a recognition of
          sin as involving personal guilt, defilement, and helplessness. It is
          designated in Scripture as epignosis hamartias (knowledge of sin),
          Rom_3:20; cf. Rom_1:32. If this is not accompanied by the following
          elements, it may manifest itself as fear of punishment, while there is
          as yet no hatred of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. An emotional element. There is a change of feeling, manifesting
          itself in sorrow for sin committed against a holy and just God,
          Psa_51:2; Psa_51:10; Psa_51:14. This element of repentance is
          indicated by the word metamelomai. If it is accompanied by the
          following element, it is a lupe kata theou (godly sorrow), but if it
          is not so accompanied, it is a lupe tou kosmou (sorrow of the world),
          manifesting itself in remorse and despair, 2Co_7:9-10; Mat_27:3;
          Luk_18:23.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. A volitional element. There is also a volitional element,
          consisting in a change of purpose, an inward turning away from sin,
          and a disposition to seek pardon and cleansing, Psa_51:5; Psa_51:7;
          Psa_51:10; Jer_25:5. This includes the two other elements, and is
          therefore the most important aspect of repentance. It is indicated in
          Scripture by the word metanoia, Act_2:38; Rom_2:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE IN THE CHURCH OF ROME. The Church of Rome
          has externalized the idea of repentance entirely. The most important
          elements in its sacrament of penance are contrition, confession,
          satisfaction, and absolution. Of these four contrition is the only one
          that properly belongs to repentance, and even from this the Romanist
          excludes all sorrow for inborn sin, and retains only that for personal
          transgressions. And because only few experience real contrition, he is
          also satisfied with attrition. This is "the mental conviction that sin
          deserves punishment, but does not include trust in God and a purpose
          to turn away from sin. It is the fear of hell."60 Confession in the
          Roman Catholic Church is confession to the priest, who absolves, not
          declaratively, but judicially. Moreover, satisfaction consists in the
          sinner's doing penance, that is, enduring something painful, or
          performing some difficult or distasteful task. The central thought is
          that such outward performances really constitute a satisfaction for
          sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE SCRIPTURAL VIEW OF REPENTANCE. Over against this external view
          of repentance the Scriptural idea should be maintained. According to
          Scripture repentance is wholly an inward act, and should not be
          confounded with the change of life that proceeds from it. Confession
          of sin and reparation of wrongs are fruits of repentance. Repentance
          is only a negative condition, and not a positive means of salvation.
          While it is the sinner's present duty, it does not offset the claims
          of the law on account of past transgressions. Moreover, true
          repentance never exists except in conjunction with faith, while, on
          the other hand, wherever there is true faith, there is also real
          repentance. The two are but different aspects of the same turning, â€”
          a turning away from sin in the direction of God. Luther sometimes
          spoke of a repentance preceding faith, but seems nevertheless to have
          agreed with Calvin in regarding true repentance as one of the fruits
          of faith. Lutherans are wont to stress the fact that repentance is
          wrought by the law and faith by the gospel. It should be borne in
          mind, however, that the two cannot be separated; they are simply
          complementary parts of the same process.
        </p>
        <p>E. THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CONVERSION.</p>
        <p>
          During recent years psychologists have made a special study of the
          phenomena of conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE NATURE OF THIS STUDY. The nature of this study can best be
          learned from such works as those of Coe, The Spiritual Life; Starbuck,
          The Psychology of Religion; James, Varieties of Religious Experience;
          Ames, The Psychology of Religious Experience; Pratt,; The Religious
          Consciousness; Clark, The Psychology of Religious Awakening; Hughes,;
          The New Psychology and Religious Experience; and Horton, The
          Psychological Approach to Theology. For a long time Psychology
          neglected the facts of the religious life altogether, but for more
          than a quarter of a century now it has taken notice of them. At first
          the attention was focussed primarily â€” not to say exclusively â€” on
          what must have appeared to be the great central fact of religious
          experience, the fact of conversion. Psychologists have studied many
          cases of conversion inductively and have attempted to classify the
          various forces at work in conversion, to distinguish the different
          types of religious experience, to determine the period of life in
          which conversion is most apt to occur, and to discover the laws that
          control the phenomena of conversion. While they presented their study
          as a purely inductive investigation into the phenomena of religion as
          shown in individual experience, and in some cases expressed the
          laudable desire and intention to keep their own philosophical and
          religious convictions in the background, they nevertheless in several
          instances clearly revealed a tendency to look upon conversion as a
          purely natural process, just as amenable to the ordinary laws of
          psychology as any other psychical fact; and to overlook, if not to
          deny explicitly, its supernatural aspect. The more careful scholars
          among them ignore, but do not deny, the supernatural in conversion.
          They explain their silence respecting the deeper aspects of this
          central fact in religious experience by calling attention to their
          limitations as psychologists. They can only deal with observed facts
          and the psychical laws which evidently control them, but have no right
          to probe into the possible or probable spiritual background, in which
          these facts find their explanation. They have pointed out that
          conversion is not a specifically Christian phenomenon, but is also
          found in other religions; and that it is not necessarily a religious
          phenomenon, but also occurs in non-religious spheres. In fact, it is
          but one of the many changes that occur in the period of adolescence,
          "a sudden readjustment to a larger spiritual environment," a surrender
          of the old self to a truer one. "At its best," says Starbuck, "it is
          the individual will coming into harmony with what it feels to be the
          divine will."62 As Pratt understands it, "the essential thing about
          conversion is just the unification of character, the achievement of a
          new self."63 As to the question, whether there is anything
          supernatural about conversion, there is a difference of opinion among
          the psychologists. Coe puts the question: "Shall we therefore conclude
          that conversion is practically an automatic performance?" And he
          answers: "Not unless we first define conversion so as to ignore its
          profound relation to God and to the principle of a good life.... The
          substance of religious experiences as far transcends their emotional
          forms as a man transcends the clothes he wears."64 James feels that an
          orthodox Christian might ask him, whether his reference of the
          phenomena of conversion to the subliminal self does not exclude the
          notion of the direct presence of the Deity in it altogether; and he
          replies in these words: "I have to say frankly that as a psychologist
          I do not see why it necessarily should."65 He finds that, "if there
          are higher powers able to impress us, they may gain access only
          through the subliminal door."66 The representatives of the New
          Psychology, that is, of the Behaviourist School and of the School of
          Psychoanalysis, frankly take the position that conversion may come
          about in a perfectly natural way, without any supernatural influence.
          James and others hold that the real secret of the sudden change in
          conversion lies in some activity of the subliminal self, which may or
          may not be subject to some divine influence. Students of Psychology
          are rather generally agreed that there are three distinct steps in
          conversion, which Ames describes as follows: "First, a sense of
          perplexity and uneasiness; second, a climax and turning point; and
          third, a relaxation marked by rest and joy."67 It is quite generally
          agreed that there are at least two outstanding types of conversion,
          which are designated in various ways. Speaking of these two kinds of
          conversion, Starbuck says that the one is accompanied with a violent
          sense of sin, and the other, with a feeling of incompleteness, a
          struggle after a larger life, and a desire for spiritual illumination.
          A distinction is made between childhood and adult conversion, between
          gradual and sudden (violent) conversions, and between intellectual and
          emotional conversions. These are but different names for the two
          recognized types of conversion. While conversion in general may be
          regarded as a rather normal experience, it is sometimes found to take
          on an abnormal aspect, especially during revivals, and then becomes a
          pathological phenomenon. As far as the time of conversion is
          concerned, it is pointed out that conversion does not occur with the
          same frequency at all periods of life, but belongs almost exclusively
          to the years between 10 and 25, and is extremely rare after 30. This
          means that it is peculiarly characteristic of the period of
          adolescence. Environment, education, and religious training, all
          affect the nature and the frequency of its occurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. EVALUATION OF THESE STUDIES. The value of these psychological
          studies of conversion need not be denied. It would be folly to brush
          them aside as of little or no significance, or to ignore them just
          because they do not take due account of the supernatural in
          conversion. They shed a welcome light on some of the laws that apply
          in the psychical life of man, on some of the phenomena that accompany
          the spiritual crisis in the conscious life of man, and on the various
          types of conversion and the factors that determine these. They deepen
          our insight into the different types of conversion, which have always
          been recognized in Reformed theology, confirm our conviction
          respecting the three elements that are found in conversion, and are
          quite in agreement with the theological conviction that conversion is
          rooted in the subconscious life; though they do not explicitly affirm,
          and in some cases even deny that it finds its explanation in a divine
          work of the Holy Spirit below the threshold of consciousness, â€” the
          work of regeneration. At the same time we should not overrate these
          studies. Some of them, as, for instance, the work of James is
          decidedly one-sided, since it is based entirely on the study of
          extraordinary conversions, which he found most interesting. Moreover,
          they have not escaped the danger of carrying the idea of the operation
          of psychical law in conversion too far, and of overlooking the divine
          and supernatural side of the important process of conversion. James
          deals with it all as a moral change and defines it in a general way as
          "the process, gradual or sudden, by which a self hitherto divided, and
          consciously wrong, inferior and unhappy, becomes unified and
          consciously right, superior, and happy, in consequence of its firmer
          hold upon religious realities."68 Others reduce it to a purely natural
          phenomenon, and even explain it materialistically, as controlled by
          physical laws. They do not, and even from the nature of the case
          cannot, go down to the root of the matter, do not and cannot penetrate
          to the hidden depths from which conversion springs. There is an
          obvious tendency to challenge the old, orthodox idea of conversion,
          regarding it as unscientific to teach that the religious nature of man
          is miraculously implanted. They do not accept the light of the Word of
          God, and therefore have no standard by which to judge the deeper
          things of life. Snowden says: "As some psychologists have tried to
          work out a psychology of the soul without any soul, so some of them
          have endeavored to construct a psychology of religion without
          religion. Under their treatment of it religion has evaporated into a
          mere subjective feeling or delusion without any objective reality, and
          such a psychology of religion is baseless and worthless both as
          psychology and as religion."69
        </p>
        <p>F. THE AUTHOR OF CONVERSION.</p>
        <p>
          1. GOD THE AUTHOR OF CONVERSION. God only can be called the author of
          conversion. This is the clear teaching of Scripture. In Psa_85:4 the
          poet prays, "Turn us, O God of our salvation," and in Jer_31:18
          Ephraim prays, "Turn thou me, and I shall be turned." A similar prayer
          is found in Lam_5:21. In Act_11:18 Peter calls attention to the fact
          that God has granted unto the Gentiles repentance unto life. A similar
          statement is found in 2Ti_2:25. There is a twofold operation of God in
          the conversion of sinners, the one moral and the other hyper-physical.
          In general it may be said that He works repentance by means of the
          law, Psa_19:7; Rom_3:20, and faith by means of the gospel, Rom_10:17.
          Yet we cannot separate these two, for the law also contains a
          presentation of the gospel, and the gospel confirms the law and
          threatens with its terrors, 2Co_5:11. But God also works in an
          immediate, hyperphysical manner in conversion. The new principle of
          life that is implanted in the regenerate man, does not issue into
          conscious action by its own inherent power, but only through the
          illuminating and fructifying influence of the Holy Spirit. Cf.
          Joh_6:44; Php_2:13. To teach otherwise would be Lutheran and Arminian.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. MAN CO-OPERATES IN CONVERSION. But though God only is the author of
          conversion, it is of great importance to stress the fact, over against
          a false passivity, that there is also a certain co-operation of man in
          conversion. Dr. Kuyper calls attention to the fact that in the Old
          Testament shubh is used 74 times of conversion as a deed of man, and
          only 15 times, of conversion as a gracious act of God; and that the
          New Testament represents conversion as a deed of man 26 times, and
          speaks of it only 2 or 3 times as an act of God.70 It should be borne
          in mind, however, that this activity of man always results from a
          previous work of God in man, Lam_5:21; Php_2:13. That man is active in
          conversion is quite evident from such passages as Isa_55:7; Jer_18:11;
          Eze_18:23; Eze_33:11; Act_2:38; Act_17:30, and others.
        </p>
        <p>G. THE NECESSITY OF CONVERSION.</p>
        <p>
          The Bible speaks in absolute terms of the necessity of regeneration;
          not so of the necessity of conversion. It tells us plainly that,
          "Except a man be born again (anew, or, from above), he cannot see the
          kingdom of God," Joh_3:3, but does not speak of the need of conversion
          in the same general way, which allows of no exceptions. Naturally,
          they who identify the two cannot admit this distinction. Undoubtedly
          there are passages of Scripture which contain a call to conversion, in
          order to enjoy the blessings of God, such as Eze_33:11; Isa_55:7, and
          these imply the necessity of conversion in the case of those addressed
          or mentioned there. The passage that comes nearest to an absolute
          declaration is found in Mat_18:3, "Verily, I say unto you, Except ye
          turn and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the
          kingdom of heaven." But even in this case one might insist that this
          refers only to the persons addressed. The expressed or implied
          exhortations to turn about, found in Scripture, come only to those to
          whom they are addressed and do not necessarily mean that every one
          must pass through a conscious conversion, in order to be saved. The
          question as to the necessity of conversion should be answered with
          discrimination. Those who die in infancy must be regenerated, in order
          to be saved, but cannot very well experience conversion, a conscious
          turning from sin unto God. In the case of adults, however, conversion
          is absolutely essential, but it need not appear in each one's life as
          a strongly marked crisis. Such a definite crisis can, as a rule, be
          expected only in the lives of those who, after a life of sin and
          shame, are arrested in their evil course by the regenerating power of
          the Holy Spirit and by the effectual call to conversion. In them the
          life of conscious enmity is at once transformed into a life of
          friendship with God. It can hardly be looked for, however, in the
          lives of those who, like John the Baptist and Timothy, served the Lord
          from early youth. At the same time, conversion is necessary in the
          case of all adults in the sense that its elements, namely, repentance
          and faith must be present in their lives. This means that they must in
          some form experience the essence of conversion.
        </p>
        <p>H. RELATION OF CONVERSION TO OTHER STAGES OF THE SAVING PROCESS.</p>
        <p>
          1. TO REGENERATION. This has already been indicated to some extent.
          The two words "regeneration" and "conversion" are used synonymously by
          some. Yet in present day theology they generally refer to different,
          though closely related matters. The principle of the new life
          implanted in regeneration comes into active expression in the
          conscious life of the sinner when he is converted. The change that is
          effected in the subconscious life in regeneration passes into the
          conscious life in conversion. Logically, conversion follows
          regeneration. In the case of those who are regenerated in infancy,
          there is necessarily a temporal separation of the two, but in the case
          of those who are regenerated after they have come to years of
          discretion, the two generally coincide. In regeneration the sinner is
          entirely passive, but in conversion he is both passive and active. The
          former can never be repeated, but the latter can to a certain extent,
          though the conversio actualis prima occurs but once.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. TO EFFECTUAL CALLING. Conversion is the direct result of internal
          calling. As an effect in man, internal calling and the beginning of
          conversion really coincide. The situation is not such that God calls
          the sinner, and that then the sinner in his own strength turns to God.
          It is exactly in the internal calling that man becomes conscious of
          the fact that God is working conversion in him. The truly converted
          man will feel all along that his conversion is the work of God. This
          distinguishes him from the man who aims at superficial moral
          improvement. The latter works in his own strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. TO FAITH. As already indicated, conversion consists in repentance
          and faith, so that faith is really a part of conversion. Yet we should
          distinguish here. There are two kinds of true faith, each having a
          distinct object, namely, (a) a recognition of the truth of God's
          revelation of redemption, not merely in a detached, historical sense,
          but in such a way that it is recognized as a reality that cannot be
          ignored with impunity, because it affects life in a vital way; and (b)
          a recognition and acceptance of the salvation offered in Jesus Christ,
          which is saving faith in the proper sense of the word. Now there is no
          doubt that faith in the former sense is present at once in conversion.
          The Holy Spirit causes the sinner to see the truth as it applies to
          his own life, so that he comes under "conviction," and thus becomes
          conscious of his sin. But he may remain in this stage for some time,
          so that it is hard to say in how far saving faith, that is, trust in
          Christ unto salvation, is at once included in conversion. There is no
          doubt that, logically, repentance and the knowledge of sin precedes
          the faith that yields to Christ in trusting love.
        </p>
        <p>QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY:</p>
        <p>
          Why did Beza prefer to call conversion resipiscentia rather than
          poenitentia? Why is the term 'repentance' inadequate to express the
          idea of conversion? How did Luther's conception of repentance differ
          from that of Calvin? Is conversion always preceded by 'conviction of
          sin'? Can we speak of prevenient grace relative to conversion? Is
          conversion an instantaneous act or is it a process? What is meant by
          the term 'daily conversion'? What is the proper view of the necessity
          of conversion? Does covenant preaching have a tendency to silence the
          call to conversion? What is the Methodist conception of conversion?
          Are the methods of the revival meetings commendable? What about the
          lasting character of the conversions of which they boast? Do the
          statistics of the Psychology of conversion give us any information on
          this point?
