        <p>I. Name and Concept of the Covenant</p>
        <p>A.THE NAME</p>
        <p>
          1. IN THE OLD TESTAMENT. The Hebrew word for covenant is always
          berith, a word of uncertain derivation. The most general opinion is
          that it is derived from the Hebrew verb barah, to cut, and therefore
          contains a reminder of the ceremony mentioned in
        </p>
        <p>
          Gen_15:17. Some, however, prefer to think that it is derived from the
          Assyrian word beritu, meaning "to bind." This would at once point to
          the covenant as a bond. The question of the derivation is of no great
          importance for the construction of the doctrine. The word berith may
          denote a mutual voluntary agreement (dipleuric), but also a
          disposition or arrangement imposed by one party on another
          (monopleuric). Its exact meaning does not depend on the etymology of
          the word, nor on the historical development of the concept, but simply
          on the parties concerned. In the measure in which one of the parties
          is subordinate and has less to say, the covenant acquires the
          character of a disposition or arrangement imposed by one party on the
          other. Berith then becomes synonymous with choq (appointed statute or
          ordinance), Exo_34:10; Isa_59:21; Jer_31:36; Jer_33:20; Jer_34:13.
          Hence we also find that karath berith (to cut a covenant) is construed
          not only with the prepositions ' am and ben (with), but also with
          lamedh (to), Jos_9:6; Isa_55:3; Isa_61:8; Jer_32:40. Naturally, when
          God establishes a covenant with man, this monopleuric character is
          very much in evidence, for God and man are not equal parties. God is
          the Sovereign who imposes His ordinances upon His creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. In the Septuagint the word berith is rendered
          diatheke in every passage where it occurs with the exception of
          Deu_9:15 (marturion) and 1Ki_11:11 (entole). The word diatheke is
          confined to this usage, except in four passages. This use of the word
          seems rather peculiar in view of the fact that it is not the usual
          Greek word for covenant, but really denotes a disposition and
          consequently also a testament. The ordinary word for covenant is
          suntheke. Did the translators intend to substitute another idea for
          the covenant idea? Evidently not, for in Isa_28:15 they use the two
          words synonymously, and there diatheke evidently means a pact or an
          agreement. Hence there is no doubt about it that they ascribe this
          meaning to diatheke. But the question remains, Why did they so
          generally avoid the use of suntheke and substitute for it a word which
          denotes a disposition rather than an agreement? In all probability the
          reason lies in the fact that in the Greek world the covenant idea
          expressed by suntheke was based to such an extent on the legal
          equality of the parties, that it could not, without considerable
          modification, be incorporated in the Scriptural system of thought. The
          idea that the priority belongs to God in the establishment of the
          covenant, and that He sovereignly imposes His covenant on man was
          absent from the usual Greek word. Hence the substitution of the word
          in which this was very prominent. The word diatheke thus, like many
          other words, received a new meaning, when it became the vehicle of
          divine thought, This change is important in connection with the New
          Testament use of the word. There has been considerable difference of
          opinion respecting the proper translation of the word. In about half
          of the passages in which it occurs the Holland and the Authorized
          Versions render the word "covenant," while in the other half they
          render it "testament." The American Revised Version, however, renders
          it "covenant"throughout, except in Heb_9:16-17. It is but natural,
          therefore, that the question should be raised, What is the New
          Testament meaning of the word? Some claim that it has its classical
          meaning of disposition or testament, wherever it is found in the New
          Testament, while others maintain that it means testament in some
          places, but that in the great majority of passages the covenant idea
          is prominently in the foreground. This is undoubtedly the correct
          view. We would expect a priorily that the New Testament usage would be
          in general agreement with that of the LXX; and a careful study of the
          relevant passages shows that the American Revised Version is
          undoubtedly on the right track, when it translates diatheke by
          "testament" only in Heb_9:16-17. In all probability there is not a
          single other passage where this rendering would be correct, not even
          2Co_3:6; 2Co_3:14. The fact that several translations of the New
          Testament substituted "testament" for "covenant" in so many places is
          probably due to three causes: (a) the desire to emphasize the priority
          of God in the transaction; (b) the assumption that the word had to be
          rendered as much as possible in harmony with Heb_9:16-17; and (c) the
          influence of the Latin translation, which uniformly rendered diatheke
          by "testamentum."

        <p>B. THE CONCEPT.</p>
        <p>
          The covenant idea developed in history before God made any formal use
          of the concept in the revelation of redemption. Covenants among men
          had been made long before God established His covenant with Noah and
          with Abraham, and this prepared men to understand the significance of
          a covenant in a world divided by sin, and helped them to understand
          the divine revelation, when it presented man's relation to God as a
          covenant relation. This does not mean, however, that the covenant idea
          originated with man and was then borrowed by God as an appropriate
          form for the description of the mutual relationship between Himself
          and man. Quite the opposite is true; the archetype of all covenant
          life is found in the trinitarian being of God, and what is seen among
          men is but a faint copy (ectype) of this. God so ordered the life of
          man that the covenant idea should develop there as one of the pillars
          of social life, and after it had so developed, He formally introduced
          it as an expression of the existing relation between Himself and man.
          The covenant relationship between God and man existed from the very
          beginning, and therefore long before the formal establishment of the
          covenant with Abraham. While the word berith is often used of
          covenants among men, yet it always includes a religious idea. A
          covenant is a pact or agreement between two or more parties. It may
          be, and among men most generally is, an agreement to which parties,
          which can meet on a footing of equality, voluntarily come after a
          careful stipulation of their mutual duties and privileges; but it may
          also be of the nature of a disposition or arrangement imposed by a
          superior party on one that is inferior and accepted by the latter. It
          is generally confirmed by a solemn ceremony as in the presence of God,
          and thereby obtains an inviolable character. Each one of the parties
          binds himself to the fulfilment of certain promises on the basis of
          stipulated conditions. Now we should not say that we cannot properly
          speak of a covenant between God and man, because the parties are too
          unequal, and therefore proceed on the assumption that the covenant of
          grace is nothing but the promise of salvation in the form of a
          covenant. By doing that we would fail to do justice to the covenant
          idea as it is revealed in Scripture. It is perfectly true that both
          the covenant of works and (as the sequel will show) the covenant of
          grace are monopleuric in origin, that they are of the nature of
          arrangements ordained and instituted by God, and that God has the
          priority in both; but they are nevertheless covenants. God graciously
          condescended to come down to the level of man, and to honor him by
          dealing with him more or less on the footing of equality. He
          stipulates His demands and vouchsafes His promises, and man assumes
          the duties thus imposed upon him voluntarily and thus inherits the
          blessings. In the covenant of works man could meet the requirements of
          the covenant in virtue of his natural endowments, but in the covenant
          of grace he is enabled to meet them only by the regenerating and
          sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit. God works in man both to
          will and to do, graciously bestowing upon him all that He requires of
          him. It is called the covenant of grace, because it is an unparalleled
          revelation of the grace of God, and because man receives all its
          blessings as gifts of divine grace.
