        <p>III. The Government of the Church</p>
        <p>A. DIFFERENT THEORIES RESPECTING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CHURCH.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE VIEW OF QUAKERS AND DARBYITES. It is a matter of principle with
          the Quakers and Darbyites to reject all Church Government. According
          to them every external Church formation necessarily degenerates and
          leads to results that are contrary to the spirit of Christianity. It
          exalts the human element at the expense of the divine. It neglects the
          divinely given charisms and substitutes for them offices instituted by
          man, and consequently offers the Church the husk of human knowledge
          rather than the vital communications of the Holy Spirit. Therefore
          they regard it as not only unnecessary but decidedly sinful to
          organize the visible Church. Thus the offices fall by the way, and in
          public worship each simply follows the promptings of the Spirit. The
          tendency that becomes apparent in these sects, which gives clear
          evidence of the leaven of Mysticism, must be regarded as a reaction
          against the hierarchical organization and the formalism of the
          Established Church of England. In our country some of the Quakers have
          regularly ordained ministers and conduct their worship very much as
          other Churches do.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE ERASTIAN SYSTEM, NAMED AFTER ERASTUS, 1524-1583. Erastians
          regard the Church as a society which owes its existence and form to
          regulations enacted by the State. The officers of the Church are
          merely instructors or preachers of the Word, without any right or
          power to rule, except that which they derive from the civil
          magistrates. It is the function of the State to govern the Church, to
          exercise discipline and to excommunicate. Church censures are civil
          punishments, though their application may be entrusted to the legal
          officers of the Church. This system has been variously applied in
          England, Scotland, and Germany (Lutheran Churches). It conflicts with
          the fundamental principle of the Headship of Jesus Christ, and does
          not recognize the fact that Church and State are distinct and
          independent in their origin, in their primary objects, in the power
          they exercise, and in the administration of that power.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE EPISCOPALIAN SYSTEM. The Episcopalians hold that Christ, as the
          Head of the Church, has entrusted the government of the Church
          directly and exclusively to an order of prelates or bishops, as the
          successors of the apostles; and that He has constituted these bishops
          a separate, independent, and self-perpetuating order. In this system
          the coetus fidelium or community of believers has absolutely no share
          in the government of the Church. In the early centuries this was the
          system of the Roman Catholic Church. In England it is combined with
          the Erastian system. But the Bible does not warrant the existence of
          such a separate class of superior officers, who have the inherent
          right of ordination and jurisdiction, and therefore do not represent
          the people nor, in any sense of the word, derive their office from
          them. Scripture clearly shows that the apostolic office was not of a
          permanent nature. The apostles did form a clearly distinct and
          independent class, but it was not their special task to rule and
          administer the affairs of the churches. It was their duty to carry the
          gospel to unevangelized districts, to found churches, and then to
          appoint others from among the people for the task of ruling these
          churches. Before the end of the first century the Apostolate had
          disappeared entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC SYSTEM. This is the Episcopal system carried to
          its logical conclusion. The Roman Catholic system pretends to
          comprise, not only successors of the apostles, but also a successor to
          Peter, who is said to have had the primacy among the apostles, and
          whose successor is now recognized as the special representative of
          Christ. The Church of Rome is of the nature of an absolute monarchy,
          under the control of an infallible Pope, who has the right to
          determine and regulate the doctrine, worship, and government, of the
          Church. Under him there are inferior classes and orders, to whom
          special grace is given, and whose duty it is to govern the Church in
          strict accountability to their superiors and to the supreme Pontiff.
          The people have absolutely no voice in the government of the Church.
          This system also conflicts with Scripture, which recognizes no such
          primacy of Peter as that on which the system is built, and distinctly
          recognizes the voice of the people in ecclesiastical affairs.
          Moreover, the claim of the Roman Catholic Church, that there has been
          an unbroken line of succession from the time of Peter down to the
          present day, is contradicted by history. The papal system is, both
          exegetically and historically, untenable.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. THE CONGREGATIONAL SYSTEM. This is also called the system of
          independency. According to it each church or congregation is a
          complete church, independent of every other. In such a church the
          governing power rests exclusively with the members of the church, who
          are entitled to regulate their own affairs. Officers are simply
          functionaries of the local church, appointed to teach and to
          administer the affairs of the church, and have no governing power
          beyond that which they possess as members of the church. If it is
          considered expedient that the various churches should exercise
          communion with one another, as is sometimes the case, this fellowship
          finds expression in ecclesiastical councils and in local or provincial
          conferences, for the consideration of their common interests. But the
          actions of such associated bodies are held to be strictly advisory or
          declarative, and are not binding on any particular church. This theory
          of popular government, making the office of the ministry altogether
          dependent on the action of the people, is certainly not in harmony
          with what we learn from the Word of God. Moreover, the theory that
          each church is independent of every other church, fails to express the
          unity of the Church of Christ, has a disintegrating effect, and opens
          the door for all kinds of arbitrariness in church government. There is
          no appeal from any of the decisions of the local church.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. THE NATIONAL-CHURCH SYSTEM. This system, also called the Collegial
          system (which supplanted the Territorial system) was developed in
          Germany especially by C. M. Pfaff (1686-1780), and was later on
          introduced into the Netherlands. It proceeds on the assumption that
          the Church is a voluntary association, equal to the State. The
          separate churches or congregations are merely sub-divisions of the one
          national Church. The original power resides in a national
          organization, and this organization has jurisdiction over the local
          churches. This is just the reverse of the Presbyterian system,
          according to which the original power has its seat in the consistory.
          The Territorial system recognized the inherent right of the State to
          reform public worship, to decide disputes respecting doctrine and
          conduct, and to convene synods, while the Collegial system ascribes to
          the State only the right of supervision as an inherent right, and
          regards all other rights, which the State might exercise in Church
          matters, as rights which the Church by a tacit understanding or by a
          formal pact conferred upon the State. This system disregards
          altogether the autonomy of the local churches, ignores the principles
          of self-government and of direct responsibility to Christ, engenders
          formalism, and binds a professedly spiritual Church by formal and
          geographical lines. Such a system as this, which is akin to the
          Erastian system, naturally fits in best with the present-day idea of
          the totalitarian State.
        </p>
        <p>
          B. THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE REFORMED OR PRESBYTERIAN SYSTEM.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reformed Churches do not claim that their system of Church government
          is determined in every detail by the Word of God, but do assert that
          its fundamental principles are directly derived from Scripture. They
          do not claim a jus divinum for the details, but only for the general
          fundamental principles of the system, and are quite ready to admit
          that many of its particulars are determined by expediency and human
          wisdom. From this it follows that, while the general structure must be
          rigidly maintained, some of the details may be changed in the proper
          ecclesiastical manner for prudential reasons, such as the general
          profit of the churches. The following are its most fundamental
          principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. CHRIST IS THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH AND THE SOURCE OF ALL ITS
          AUTHORITY. The Church of Rome considers it of the greatest importance
          to maintain the headship of the Pope over the Church. The Reformers
          maintained and defended the position, in opposition to the claims of
          the Papacy, that Christ is the only Head of the Church. They did not
          entirely avoid the danger, however, of recognizing, the one more and
          the other less, the supremacy of the State over the Church.
          Consequently the Presbyterian and Reformed Churches had to fight
          another battle later on, the battle for the Headship of Jesus Christ
          in opposition to the unwarranted encroachments of the State. This
          battle was fought first of all in Scotland, and later on also in The
          Netherlands. The very fact that it was fought against such external
          powers as the Papacy and the State or the King, both of whom claimed
          to be the head of the visible Church, clearly implies that they who
          were engaged in this battle were particularly interested in
          establishing and maintaining the position that Christ is the only
          lawful Head of the visible Church, and is therefore the only supreme
          Lawgiver and King of the Church. Naturally, they also recognized
          Christ as the organic Head of the invisible Church. They realized that
          the two could not be separated, but, since the Pope and the King could
          hardly claim to be the organic head of the invisible Church, this was
          not really the point in question. Respecting the Scottish teachers
          Walker says: "They meant that Christ is the real King and Head of the
          Church, as a visible organisation, ruling it by His statutes, and
          ordinances, and officers, and forces, as truly and literally as David
          or Solomon ruled the covenant people of old."28
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible teaches us that Christ is Head over all things: He is the
          Lord of the universe, not merely as the second person of the Trinity,
          but in His mediatorial capacity, Mat_28:18; Eph_1:20-22; Php_2:10-11;
          Rev_17:14; Rev_19:16. In a very special sense, however, He is the Head
          of the Church, which is His body. He stands in a vital and organic
          relation to it, fills it with His life, and controls it spiritually,
          Joh_15:1-8; Eph_1:10; Eph_2:20-22; Eph_5:30; Col_1:18; Col_1:18;
          Col_2:19; Col_3:11. Premillenarians claim that this is the only sense
          in which Christ is the Head of the Church, for they deny the very
          point for which our Reformed Fathers contended, namely, that Christ is
          the King of the Church, and therefore the only supreme authority to be
          recognized in it. Scripture plainly teaches, however, that Christ is
          the Head of the Church, not only in virtue of His vital relationship
          to it, but also as its Legislator and King. In the organic and vital
          sense He is the Head primarily, though not exclusively, of the
          invisible Church, which constitutes His spiritual body. But He is also
          the Head of the visible Church, not only in the organic sense, but
          also in the sense that He has authority and rule over it,
          Mat_16:18-19; Mat_23:8; Mat_23:10; Joh_13:13; 1Co_12:5; Eph_1:20-23;
          Eph_4:4-5; Eph_4:11-12; Eph_5:23-24. This Headship of Christ over the
          visible Church is the principal part of the dominion bestowed upon Him
          as the result of His sufferings. His authority is manifested in the
          following points: (a) He instituted the Church of the New Testament,
          Mat_16:18, so that it is not, as many regard it in our day, a mere
          voluntary society, which has its only warrant in the consent of its
          members. (b) He instituted the means of grace which the Church must
          administer, namely, the Word and the sacraments, Mat_28:19-20;
          Mar_16:15-16; Luk_22:17-20; 1Co_11:23-29. In these matters no one else
          has the right to legislate. (c) He gave to the Church its constitution
          and officers, and clothed them with divine authority, so that they can
          speak and act in His name, Mat_10:1; Mat_16:19; Joh_20:21-23;
          Eph_4:11-12. (d) He is ever present in the Church when it meets for
          worship, and speaks and acts through its officers. It is Christ as
          King that warrants them in speaking and acting with authority,
          Mat_10:40; 2Co_13:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. CHRIST EXERCISES HIS AUTHORITY BY MEANS OF HIS ROYAL WORD. The
          reign of Christ is not in all respects similar to that of earthly
          kings. He does not rule the Church by force, but subjectively by His
          Spirit, which is operative in the Church, and objectively by the Word
          of God as the standard of authority. All believers are unconditionally
          bound to obey the word of the King. As Christ is the only sovereign
          Ruler of the Church, His word is the only word that is law in the
          absolute sense. Consequently, all despotic power is contraband in the
          Church. There is no ruling power independent of Christ. The Pope of
          Rome stands condemned in that he, while professing to be Christ's
          vicar on earth, virtually supplants Christ and supersedes His word by
          human innovations. He not only places tradition on an equal footing
          with Scripture, but also claims to be the infallible interpreter of
          both when speaking ex cathedra in matters of faith and morals.
          Scripture and tradition may be the mediate or remote rules of faith,
          the immediate rule is the teaching of the Church, which has its
          guarantee in papal infallibility.29The word of the Pope is the word of
          God. But while it is true that Christ exercises His authority in the
          Church through the officers, this is not to be understood in the sense
          that He transfers His authority to His servants. He Himself rules the
          Church through all the ages, but in doing this, He uses the officers
          of the Church as His organs. They have no absolute or independent, but
          only a derived and ministerial power.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. CHRIST AS KING HAS ENDOWED THE CHURCH WITH POWER. A rather delicate
          question arises at this point, namely, Who are the first and proper
          subjects of Church power? To whom has Christ committed this power in
          the first instance? Roman Catholics and Episcopalians answer: to the
          officers as a separate class, in contradistinction from the ordinary
          members of the Church. This view has also been held by some eminent
          Presbyterian divines, such as Rutherford and Baillie. Diametrically
          opposed to this is the theory of the Independents, that this power is
          vested in the Church at large, and that the officers are merely the
          organs of the body as a whole. The great Puritan divine, Owen, adopts
          this view with some modifications. In recent years some Reformed
          theologians apparently favored this view, though without subscribing
          to the separatism of the Independents. There is another view, however,
          representing a mean between these two extremes, which would seem to
          deserve preference. According to it ecclesiastical power is committed
          by Christ to the Church as a whole, that is to the ordinary members
          and the officers alike; but in addition to that the officers receive
          such an additional measure of power as is required for the performance
          of their respective duties in the Church of Christ. They share in the
          original power bestowed upon the Church, and receive their authority
          and power as officers directly from Christ. They are representatives,
          but not mere deputies or delegates of the people. Older theologians
          often say: "All Church power, in actu primo, or fundamentally, is in
          the Church itself; in actu secundo, or its exercise, in them that are
          specially called thereto." This is substantially the view held by
          Voetius, Gillespie (in his work on Ceremonies), Bannerman, Porteous,
          Bavinck, and Vos.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. CHRIST PROVIDED FOR THE SPECIFIC EXERCISE OF THIS POWER BY
          REPRESENTATIVE ORGANS. While Christ committed power to the Church as a
          whole, He also provided for it that this power should be exercised
          ordinarily and specifically by representative organs, set aside for
          the maintenance of doctrine, worship, and discipline. The officers of
          the Church are the representatives of the people chosen by popular
          vote. This does not mean, however, that they receive their authority
          from the people, for the call of the people is but the confirmation of
          the inner call by the Lord Himself; and it is from Him that they
          receive their authority and to Him that they are responsible. When
          they are called representatives, this is merely an indication of the
          fact that they were chosen to their office by the people, and does not
          imply that they derive their authority from them. Hence they are no
          deputies or tools that merely serve to carry out the wishes of the
          people, but rulers whose duty it is to apprehend and apply
          intelligently the laws of Christ. At the same time they are in duty
          bound to recognize the power vested in the Church as a whole by
          seeking its assent or consent in important matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. THE POWER OF THE CHURCH RESIDES PRIMARILY IN THE GOVERNING BODY OF
          THE LOCAL CHURCH. It is one of the fundamental principles of Reformed
          or Presbyterian government, that the power or authority of the Church
          does not reside first of all in the most general assembly of any
          Church, and is only secondarily and by derivation from this assembly,
          vested in the governing body of the local Church; but that it has its
          original seat in the consistory or session of the local Church, and is
          by this transferred to the major assemblies, such as classes
          (presbyteries) and synods or general assemblies. Thus the Reformed
          system honors the autonomy of the local church, though it always
          regards this as subject to the limitations that may be put upon it as
          the result of its association with other churches in one denomination,
          and assures it the fullest right to govern its own internal affairs by
          means of its officers. At the same time it also maintains the right
          and duty of the local church to unite with other similar churches on a
          common confessional basis, and form a wider organization for
          doctrinal, judicial, and administrative purposes, with proper
          stipulations of mutual obligations and rights. Such a wider
          organization undoubtedly imposes certain limitations on the autonomy
          of the local churches, but also promotes the growth and welfare of the
          churches, guarantees the rights of the members of the Church, and
          serves to give fuller expression to the unity of the Church.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE OFFICERS OF THE CHURCH.</p>
        <p>
          Different kinds of officers may be distinguished in the Church. A very
          general distinction is that between extraordinary and ordinary
          officers.
        </p>
        <p>1. EXTRAORDINARY OFFICERS.</p>
        <p>
          a. Apostles. Strictly speaking, this name is applicable only to the
          Twelve chosen by Jesus and to Paul; but it is also applied to certain
          apostolic men, who assisted Paul in his work, and who were endowed
          with apostolic gifts and graces, Act_14:4; Act_14:14; 1Co_9:5-6;
          2Co_8:23; Gal_1:19 (?). The apostles had the special task of laying
          the foundation for the Church of all ages. It is only through their
          word that believers of all following ages have communion with Jesus
          Christ. Hence they are the apostles of the Church in the present day
          as well as they were the apostles of the primitive Church. They had
          certain special qualifications. They (a) received their commission
          directly from God or from Jesus Christ, Mar_3:14; Luk_6:13; Gal_1:1;
          (b) were witnesses of the life of Christ and especially of His
          resurrection, Joh_15:27; Act_1:21-22; 1Co_9:1; (c) were conscious of
          being inspired by the Spirit of God in all their teaching, both oral
          and written, Act_15:28; 1Co_2:13; 1Th_4:8; 1Jn_5:9-12; (d) had the
          power to perform miracles and used this on several occasions to ratify
          their message, 2Co_12:12; Heb_2:4; and (e) were richly blessed in
          their work as a sign of the divine approval of their labors,
          1Co_9:1-2; 2Co_3:2-3; Gal_2:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Prophets. The New Testament also speaks of prophets, Act_11:28;
          Act_13:1-2; Act_15:32; 1Co_12:10; 1Co_13:2; 1Co_14:3; Eph_2:20;
          Eph_3:5; Eph_4:11; 1Ti_1:18; 1Ti_4:14;
        </p>
        <p>
          Rev_11:6. Evidently the gift of speaking for the edification of the
          Church was highly developed in these prophets, and they were
          occasionally instrumental in revealing mysteries and predicting future
          events. The first part of this gift is permanent in the Christian
          Church, and was distinctly recognized by the Reformed Churches
          (prophesyings), but the last part of it was of a charismatic and
          temporary character. They differed from ordinary ministers in that
          they spoke under special inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Evangelists. In addition to apostles and prophets, evangelists are
          mentioned in the Bible, Act_21:8; Eph_4:11; 2Ti_4:5. Philip, Mark,
          Timothy, and Titus belonged to this class. Little is known about these
          evangelists. They accompanied and assisted the apostles, and were
          sometimes sent out by these on special missions. Their work was to
          preach and baptize, but also to ordain elders, Tit_1:5; 1Ti_5:22, and
          to exercise discipline, Tit_3:10. Their authority seems to have been
          more general and somewhat superior to that of the regular ministers.
        </p>
        <p>2. ORDINARY OFFICERS.</p>
        <p>
          a. Elders. Among the common officers of the Church the presbuteroi or
          episkopoi are first in order of importance. The former name simply
          means "elders," that is, older ones, and the latter, "overseers." The
          term presbuteroi is used in Scripture to denote old men, and to
          designate a class of officers somewhat similar to those who functioned
          in the synagogue. As a designation of office the name was gradually
          eclipsed and even superseded by the name episkopoi. The two terms are
          often used interchangeably, Act_20:17; Act_20:28; 1Ti_3:1; 1Ti_4:14;
          1Ti_5:17; 1Ti_5:19; Tit_1:5; Tit_1:7; 1Pe_5:1-2. Presbuteroi are first
          mentioned in Act_11:30, but the office was evidently well known
          already when Paul and Barnabas went to Jerusalem, and may have been in
          existence even before the institution of the diaconate. At least the
          term hoi neoteroi in Act_5:1-42 seems to point to a distinction
          between these and the presbuteroi. Frequent mention is made of them in
          the book of Acts, Act_14:23; Act_15:6, Act_15:22; Act_16:4; Act_20:17,
          Act_20:28; Act_21:18. Probably the presbyterial or episcopal office
          was first instituted in the churches of the Jews, Jas_5:14; Heb_13:7;
          Heb_13:17, and then, shortly after, also in those of the Gentiles.
          Several other names are applied to these officers, namely,
          proistamenoi, Rom_12:8; 1Th_5:12; kuberneseis 1Co_12:28; hegoumenoi,
          Heb_13:7; Heb_13:17; Heb_13:24; and poimenes, Eph_4:11. These officers
          clearly had the oversight of the flock that was entrusted to their
          care. They had to provide for it, govern it, and protect it, as the
          very household of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Teachers. It is clear that the elders were not originally teachers.
          There was no need of separate teachers at first, since there were
          apostles, prophets, and evangelists. Gradually, however, the
          didaskalia was connected more closely with the episcopal office; but
          even then the teachers did not at once constitute a separate class of
          officers. Paul's statement in Eph_4:11, that the ascended Christ also
          gave "pastors and teachers," mentioned as a single class, to the
          Church, clearly shows that these two did not constitute two different
          classes of officers, but one class having two related functions.
          1Ti_5:17 speaks of elders who labor in the Word and in teaching, and
          according to Heb_13:7 the hegoumenoi were also teachers. Moreover, in
          2Ti_2:2 Paul urges upon Timothy the necessity of appointing to office
          faithful men who shall also be able to teach others. In course of time
          two circumstances led to a distinction between the elders or overseers
          that were entrusted only with the government of the Church, and those
          that were also called upon to teach: (1) when the apostles died and
          heresies arose and increased, the task of those who were called upon
          to teach became more exacting and demanded special preparation,
          2Ti_2:2; Tit_2:2; and (2) in view of the fact that the laborer is
          worthy of his hire, those who were engaged in the ministry of the
          Word, a comprehensive task requiring all their time, were set free
          from other work, in order that they might devote themselves more
          exclusively to the work of teaching. In all probability the aggeloi
          who were addressed in the letters to the seven churches of Asia Minor,
          were the teachers or ministers of those churches, Rev_3:1; Rev_3:7;
          Rev_3:14. In Reformed circles the ministers now rule the churches
          together with the elders, but in addition to that administer the Word
          and the sacraments. Together they make the necessary regulations for
          the government of the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Deacons. Besides the presbuteroi the diakonoi are mentioned in the
          New Testament, Php_1:1; 1Ti_3:8; 1Ti_3:10; 1Ti_3:12. According to the
          prevailing opinion Act_6:1-6 contains the record of the institution of
          the diaconate. Some modern scholars doubt this, however, and regard
          the office mentioned in Act_6:1-15, either as a general office in
          which the functions of elders and deacons were combined, or as a
          merely temporal office serving a special purpose. They call attention
          to the fact that some of the seven chosen, as Philip and Stephen,
          evidently engaged in teaching; and that the money collected at Antioch
          for the poor in Judea was delivered into the hands of the elders. No
          mention is made of deacons whatsoever in Act_11:30, though these, if
          they had existed as a separate class, would have been the natural
          recipients of that money. And yet in all probability Act_6:1-15 does
          refer to the institution of the diaconate, for: (1) The name diakonoi,
          which was, previous to the event narrated in Act_6:1-15, always used
          in the general sense of servant, subsequently began to be employed,
          and in course of time served exclusively, to designate those who were
          engaged in works of mercy and charity. The only reason that can be
          assigned for this is found in Act_6:1-15. (2) The seven men mentioned
          there were charged with the task of distributing properly the that
          were brought for the agapae, a ministry that is elsewhere more
          particularly described by the word diakonia, Act_11:29; Rom_12:7;
          2Co_8:4; 2Co_9:1; 2Co_9:12-13; Rev_2:19. (3) The requirements for the
          office, as mentioned in Act_6:1-15, are rather exacting, and in that
          respect agree with the demands mentioned in 1Ti_3:8-10; 1Ti_3:12. (4)
          Very little can be said in favor of the pet idea of some critics that
          the diaconate was not developed until later, about the time when the
          episcopal office made its appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE CALLING OF THE OFFICERS AND THEIR INDUCTION INTO OFFICE. A
          distinction should be made between the calling of the extraordinary
          officers, such as apostles, and that of the ordinary officers. The
          former were called in an extraordinary way with an immediate calling
          from God, and the latter, in the ordinary manner and through the
          agency of the Church. We are concerned more particularly with the
          calling of the ordinary officers.
        </p>
        <p>a. The calling of the ordinary officers. This is twofold:</p>
        <p>
          (1) Internal calling. It is sometimes thought that the internal
          calling to an office in the Church consists in some extraordinary
          indication of God to the effect that one is called, â€” a sort of
          special revelation. But this is not correct. It consists rather in
          certain ordinary providential indications given by God, and includes
          especially three things: (a) the consciousness of being impelled to
          some special task in the Kingdom of God, by love to God and His cause;
          (b) the conviction that one is at least in a measure intellectually
          and spiritually qualified for the office sought; and (c) the
          experience that God is clearly paving the way to the goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) External calling. This is the call that comes to one through the
          instrumentality of the Church. It is not issued by the Pope (Roman
          Catholic), nor by a bishop or a college of bishops (Episcopalian), but
          by the local church. Both the officers and the ordinary members of the
          church have a part in it. That the officers have a guiding hand in it,
          but not to the exclusion of the people, is evident from such passages
          as ; Act_1:15-26; Act_6:2-6; Act_14:23. The people were recognized
          even in the choice of an apostle, according to Act_1:15-26. It would
          seem that in the apostolic age the officers guided the choice of the
          people by calling attention to the necessary qualifications that were
          required for the office, but allowed the people to take part in the
          choosing, Act_1:15-26; Act_6:1-6; 1Ti_3:2-13. Of course, in the case
          of Matthias God Himself made the final choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The officers' induction into office. There are especially two rites
          connected with this:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Ordination. This presupposes the calling and examination of the
          candidate for office. It is an act of the classis or the presbytery
          (1Ti_4:14). Says Dr. Hodge: "Ordination is the solemn expression of
          the judgment of the Church, by those appointed to deliver such
          judgment, that the candidate is truly called of God to take part in
          this ministry, thereby authenticating to the people the divine
          call."30 This authentication is, under all ordinary circumstances, the
          necessary condition for the exercise of the ministerial office. It may
          briefly be called a public acknowledgement and confirmation of the
          candidate's calling to this office.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Laying on of hands. Ordination is accompanied with the laying on
          of hands. Clearly, the two went hand in hand in apostolic times,
          Act_6:6; Act_13:3; 1Ti_4:14; 1Ti_5:22. In those early days the laying
          on of hands evidently implied two things: it signified that a person
          was set aside for a certain office, and that some special spiritual
          gift was conferred upon him. The Church of Rome is of the opinion that
          these two elements are still included in the laying on of hands, that
          it actually confers some spiritual grace upon the recipient, and
          therefore ascribes to it sacramental significance. Protestants
          maintain, however, that it is merely a symbolical indication of the
          fact that one is set aside for the ministerial office in the Church.
          While they regard it as a Scriptural rite and as one that is entirely
          appropriate, they do not regard it as absolutely essential. The
          Presbyterian Church makes it optional.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE ECCLESIASTICAL ASSEMBLIES.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE GOVERNING BODIES (CHURCH COURTS) IN THE REFORMED SYSTEM.
          Reformed Church government is characterized by a system of
          ecclesiastical assemblies in an ascending or a descending scale,
          according to the point of view from which they are considered. These
          are the consistory (session), the classis (presbytery), the synod(s),
          and (in some cases) the general assembly. The consistory consists of
          the minister (or, ministers) and the elders of the local church. The
          classis is composed of one minister and one elder of each local church
          within a certain district. This is somewhat different in the
          Presbyterian Church, however, where the presbytery includes all the
          ministers within its boundaries, and one elder from each of its
          congregations. The synod, again, consists of an equal number of
          ministers and elders from each classis or presbytery. And, finally,
          the general assembly is (in the case of the Presbyterians) composed of
          an equal delegation of ministers and elders from each of the
          presbyteries, and not, as might be expected, from each of the
          particular synods.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT OF THE LOCAL CHURCH AND ITS RELATIVE
          AUTONOMY.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The representative government of the local church. Reformed
          churches differ, on the one hand, from all those churches in which the
          government is in the hands of a single prelate or presiding elder, and
          on the other hand, from those in which it rests with the people in
          general. They do not believe in any one man rule, be he an elder, a
          pastor, or a bishop; neither do they believe in popular government.
          They choose ruling elders as their representatives, and these,
          together with the minister(s), form a council or consistory for the
          government of the local church. Very likely the apostles were guided
          by the venerated custom of having elders in the synagogue rather than
          by any direct commandment, when they ordained elders in the various
          churches founded by them. The Jerusalem church had elders, Act_11:30.
          Paul and Barnabas ordained them in the churches which they organized
          on the first missionary journey, Act_14:23. Elders were evidently
          functioning at Ephesus, Act_20:17, and at Philippi, Php_1:1. The
          Pastoral Epistles repeatedly make mention of them, 1Ti_3:1-2; Tit_1:5;
          Tit_1:7. It deserves attention that they are always spoken of in the
          plural, 1Co_12:28; 1Ti_5:17; Heb_13:7; Heb_13:17; Heb_13:24; 1Pe_5:1.
          The elders are chosen by the people as men who are specially qualified
          to rule the Church. Scripture evidently intends that the people shall
          have a voice in the matter of their selection, though this was not the
          case in the Jewish synagogue, Act_1:21-26; Act_6:1-6; Act_14:23. In
          the last passage, however, the word cheirotoneo may have lost its
          original meaning of appointing by stretching out the hand, and may
          simply mean to appoint. At the same time it is perfectly evident that
          the Lord Himself places these rulers over the people and clothes them
          with the necessary authority, Mat_16:19; Joh_20:22-23; Act_1:24;
          Act_1:26; Act_20:28; 1Co_12:28; Eph_4:11-12; Heb_13:17. The election
          by the people is merely an external confirmation of the inner calling
          by the Lord Himself. Moreover, the elders, though representatives of
          the people, do not derive their authority from the people, but from
          the Lord of the Church. They exercise rule over the house of God in
          the name of the King, and are responsible only to Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The relative autonomy of the local church. Reformed Church
          government recognizes the autonomy of the local church. This means:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) That every local church is a complete church of Christ, fully
          equipped with everything that is required for its government. It has
          absolutely no need of it that any government should be imposed upon it
          from without. And not only that, but such an imposition would be
          absolutely contrary to its nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) That, though there can be a proper affiliation or consolidation of
          contiguous churches, there may be no union which destroys the autonomy
          of the local church. Hence it is better not to speak of classes and
          synods as higher, but to describe them as major or more general
          assemblies. They do not represent a higher, but the very same, power
          that inheres in the consistory, though exercising this on a broader
          scale. McGill speaks of them as higher and remoter tribunals.31
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) That the authority and prerogatives of the major assemblies are
          not unlimited, but have their limitation in the rights of the sessions
          or consistories. They are not permitted to lord it over a local church
          or its members, irrespective of the constitutional rights of the
          consistory; nor to meddle with the internal affairs of a local church
          under any and all circumstances. When churches affiliate, their mutual
          rights and duties are circumscribed in a Church Order or Form of
          Government. This stipulates the rights and duties of the major
          assemblies, but also guarantees the rights of the local church. The
          idea that a classis (presbytery) or synod can simply impose whatever
          it pleases on a particular church is essentially Roman Catholic.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) That the autonomy of the local church has its limitations in the
          relation in which it stands to the churches with which it is
          affiliated, and in the general interests of the affiliated churches.
          The Church Order is a sort of Constitution, solemnly subscribed to by
          every local church, as represented by its consistory. This on the one
          hand guards the rights and interests of the local church, but on the
          other hand also, the collective rights and interests of the affiliated
          churches. And no single church has the right to disregard matters of
          mutual agreement and of common interest. The local group may be even
          called upon occasionally to deny itself for the far greater good of
          the Church in general.
        </p>
        <p>3. THE MAJOR ASSEMBLIES.</p>
        <p>
          a. Scripture warrant for major assemblies. Scripture does not contain
          an explicit command to the effect that the local churches of a
          district must form an organic union. Neither does it furnish us with
          an example of such a union. In fact, it represents the local churches
          as individual entities without any external bond of union. At the same
          time the essential nature of the Church, as described in Scripture,
          would seem to call for such a union. The Church is described as a
          spiritual organism, in which all the constituent parts are vitally
          related to one another. It is the spiritual body of Jesus Christ, of
          which He is the exalted Head. And it is but natural that this inner
          unity should express itself in some visible manner, and should even,
          as much as possible in this imperfect and sinful world, seek
          expression in some corresponding external organization. The Bible
          speaks of the Church not only as a spiritual body, but also as a
          tangible body, as a temple of the Holy Spirit, as a priesthood, and as
          a holy nation. Every one of these terms points to a visible unity.
          Congregationalists or Independents and Undenominationalists lose sight
          of this important fact. The existing divisions in the visible Church
          at the present time should not cause us to lose sight of the fact that
          there are certain passages of Scripture which seem to indicate rather
          clearly that, not only the invisible Church, but also the visible
          Church is a unity. The word ekklesia is used in the singular as an
          indication of the visible church in a wider sense than that of the
          purely local church, Act_9:31 (according to the now accepted reading),
          1Co_12:28, and probably also 1Co_10:32. In the descriptions of the
          Church in 1Co_12:12-31 and Eph_4:4-16 the apostle also has its visible
          unity in mind. Moreover, there are reasons for thinking that the
          Church at Jerusalem and at Antioch consisted of several separate
          groups, which together formed a sort of unity. And, finally,
          Act_15:1-41 acquaints us with the example of the council of Jerusalem.
          This council was composed of apostles and elders, and therefore did
          not constitute a proper example and pattern of a classis or synod in
          the modern sense of the word. At the same time it was an example of a
          major assembly, and of one that spoke with authority and not merely in
          an advisory capacity.

          b. The representative character of the major assemblies. In the
          abstract it may be said that the major assemblies might have been
          composed of all the representatives of all the local churches under
          their jurisdiction; but, on account of the number of the churches
          represented, such a body would in most cases prove unwieldy and
          inefficient. In order to keep the number of representatives down to
          reasonable proportions, the principle of representation is carried
          through also in connection with the major assemblies. Not the local
          churches, but the classes or presbyteries, send their representatives
          to Synods. This affords the gradual contraction that is necessary for
          a well-compacted system. The immediate representatives of the people
          who form the consistories or sessions, are themselves represented in
          classes or presbyteries; and these in turn are represented in synods
          or general assemblies. The more general the assembly, the more remote
          it is from the people; yet none of them is too remote for the
          expression of the unity of the Church, for the maintenance of good
          order, and for the general effectiveness of its work.

          c. The matters that fall under their jurisdiction. The ecclesiastical
          character of these assemblies should always be borne in mind. It is
          because they are Church assemblies, that purely scientific, social,
          industrial, or political matters do not, as such, fall under their
          jurisdiction. Only ecclesiastical matters belong to their province,
          such as matters of doctrine or morals, of church government and
          discipline, and whatever pertains to the preservation of unity and
          good order in the Church of Jesus Christ. More particularly, they deal
          with (1) matters which, as to their nature, belong to the province of
          a minor assembly, but for some reason or other cannot be settled
          there; and (b) matters which, as to their nature, belong to the
          province of a major assembly, since they pertain to the churches in
          general, such as matters touching the Confession, the Church Order, or
          the liturgy of the Church.

          d. The power and authority of these assemblies. The major assemblies
          do not represent a higher kind of power than is vested in the
          consistory or session. The Reformed churches know of no higher kind of
          ecclesiastical power than that which resides in the consistory. At the
          same time their authority is greater in degree and wider in extent
          than that of the consistory. Church power is represented in greater
          measure in the major assemblies than in the consistory, just as
          apostolic power was represented in greater measure in twelve than in a
          single apostle. Ten churches certainly have more authority than a
          single church; there is an accumulation of power. Moreover, the
          authority of the major assemblies does not apply to a single church
          only, but extends to all the affiliated churches. Consequently, the
          decisions of a major assembly carry great weight and can never be set
          aside at will. The assertion sometimes made that they are only of an
          advisory character and therefore need not be carried out, is a
          manifestation of the leaven of Independency. These decisions are
          authoritative, except in cases where they are explicitly declared to
          be merely advisory. They are binding on the churches as the sound
          interpretation and application of the law, â€” the law of Christ, the
          King of the Church. They cease to be binding only when they are shown
          to be contrary to the Word of God.

          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: What is the difference between the New
          Testament meaning of the word episkopos and its later connotation? Why
          are regular offices necessary in the Church? Does Scripture favor the
          idea that the people should have some part in the government of the
          Church? What is the chief characteristic of Prelatism? What is the
          Roman Catholic distinction between a hierarchy of order and a
          hierarchy of jurisdiction? How did the Territorial and the Collegial
          systems originate, and how do they differ? What system did the
          Arminians adopt, and how did this affect their position? What is the
          present form of Church government in the Lutheran Church? How does the
          idea that Christ is the Head of the Church only in an organic sense
          affect the offices and the authority of the Church? What important
          practical bearing does the Headship of Christ (including His kingship)
          have on the life, the position, and the government of the Church? Can
          any Church be considered autonomous in the absolute sense of the word?
          How do Reformed major assemblies differ from Congregational
          conferences and general councils?
