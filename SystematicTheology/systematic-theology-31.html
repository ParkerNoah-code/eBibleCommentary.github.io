        <p>I. The State of Humiliation</p>
        <p>A. INTRODUCTORY: THE DOCTRINE OF THE STATES OF CHRIST IN GENERAL.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A STATE AND A CONDITION. It should be borne
          in mind that, though the word "state" is sometimes used synonymously
          with "condition," the word as applied to Christ in this connection
          denotes a relationship rather than a condition. In general a state and
          a condition may be distinguished as follows: A state is one's position
          or status in life, and particularly the forensic relationship in which
          one stands to the law, while a condition is the mode of one's
          existence, especially as determined by the circumstances of life. One
          who is found guilty in a court of justice is in a state of guilt or
          condemnation, and this is usually followed by a condition of
          incarceration with all its resulting deprivation and shame. In
          theology the states of the Mediator are generally considered as
          including the resulting conditions. In fact, the different stages of
          the humiliation and of the exaltation, as usually stated, have a
          tendency to make the conditions stand out more prominently than the
          states. Yet the states are the more fundamental of the two and should
          be so considered.11 In the state of humiliation Christ was under the
          law, not only as a rule of life, but as the condition of the covenant
          of works, and even under the condemnation of the law; but in the state
          of exaltation He is free from the law, having met the condition of the
          covenant of works and having paid the penalty for sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE DOCTRINE OF THE STATES OF CHRIST IN HISTORY. The doctrine of
          the states of Christ really dates from the seventeenth century, though
          traces of it are already found in the writings of the Reformers, and
          even in some of the early Church Fathers. It was first developed among
          the Lutherans when they sought to bring their doctrine of the
          communicatio idiomatum in harmony with the humiliation of Christ as it
          is pictured in the Gospels, but was soon adopted also by the Reformed.
          They differed, however, as to the real subject of the states.
          According to the Lutherans it is the human nature of Christ, but
          according to the Reformed, the person of the Mediator. There was
          considerable difference of opinion even among the Lutherans on the
          subject. Under the influence of Schleiermacher the idea of the states
          of the Mediator gradually disappeared from theology. By his
          pantheizing tendency the lines of demarcation between the Creator and
          the creature were practically obliterated. The emphasis was shifted
          from the transcendent to the immanent God; and the sovereign God whose
          law is the standard of right disappeared. In fact, the idea of
          objective right was banished from theology, and under such conditions
          it became impossible to maintain the idea of a judicial position, that
          is, of a state of the Mediator. Moreover, in the measure in which the
          humanity of Christ was stressed to the exclusion of His deity, and on
          the one hand His pre-existence, and on the other, His resurrection was
          denied, all speaking about the humiliation and exaltation of Christ
          lost its meaning. The result is that in many present day works on
          Dogmatics we look in vain for a chapter on the states of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE NUMBER OF THE STATES OF THE MEDIATOR. There is a difference of
          opinion as to the number of the states of the Mediator. Some are of
          the opinion that, if we assume that the person of the Mediator is the
          subject of the states, strict logic requires that we speak of three
          states or modes of existence: the pre-existent state of eternal divine
          being, the earthly state of temporal human existence, and the heavenly
          state of exaltation and glory.12 But since we can speak of the
          humiliation and exaltation of the person of Christ only in connection
          with Him as the God-man, it is best to speak of only two states.
          Reformed theologians do find an anticipation of both the humiliation
          and the exaltation of Christ in His pre-existent state: of His
          humiliation in that He freely took upon Himself in the pactum salutis
          to merit and administer our salvation; and of His exaltation in the
          glory which He as our prospective Mediator enjoyed before the
          incarnation, cf. Joh_17:5. The two states are clearly indicated in
          2Co_8:9; Gal_4:4-5; Php_2:6-11; Heb_2:9.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE STATE OF HUMILIATION.</p>
        <p>
          On the basis of Php_2:7-8, Reformed theology distinguishes two
          elements in the humiliation of Christ, namely, (1) the kenosis
          (emptying, exinanitio), consisting in this that He laid aside the
          divine majesty, the majesty of the sovereign Ruler of the universe,
          and assumed human nature in the form of a servant; and (2) the
          tapeinosis (humiliatio), consisting in that He became subject to the
          demands and to the curse of the law, and in His entire life became
          obedient in action and suffering to the very limit of a shameful
          death. On the basis of the passage in Philippians it may be said that
          the essential and central element in the state of humiliation is found
          in the fact that He who was the Lord of all the earth, the supreme
          Lawgiver, placed Himself under the law, in order to discharge its
          federal and penal obligations in behalf of His people. By doing this
          He became legally responsible for our sins and liable to the curse of
          the law. This state of the Saviour, briefly expressed in the words of
          Gal_4:4, "born under the law," is reflected in the corresponding
          condition, which is described in the various stages of the
          humiliation. While Lutheran theology speaks of as many as eight stages
          in the humiliation of Christ, Reformed theology generally names only
          five, namely: (1) incarnation, (2) suffering, (3) death, (4) burial,
          and (5) descent into hades.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE INCARNATION AND BIRTH OF CHRIST. Under this general heading
          several points deserve attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The subject of the incarnation. It was not the triune God but the
          second person of the Trinity that assumed human nature. For that
          reason it is better to say that the Word became flesh than that God
          became man. At the same time we should remember that each of the
          divine persons was active in the incarnation, Mat_1:20; Luk_1:35;
          Joh_1:14; Act_2:30; Rom_8:3; Gal_4:4; Php_2:7. This also means that
          the incarnation was not something that merely happened to the Logos,
          but was an active accomplishment on His part. In speaking of the
          incarnation in distinction from the birth of the Logos, His active
          participation in this historical fact is stressed, and His
          pre-existence is assumed. It is not possible to speak of the
          incarnation of one who had no previous existence. This pre-existence
          is clearly taught in Scripture: "In the beginning was the Word, and
          the Word was with God, and the Word was God," Joh_1:1. "I am come down
          from heaven," Joh_6:38. "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus
          Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor,"
          2Co_8:9. "Who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on
          an equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself,
          taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men,"
          Php_2:6-7. "But when the fulness of the time came God sent forth His
          Son," Gal_4:4. The pre-existent Son of God assumes human nature and
          takes to Himself human flesh and blood, a miracle that passes our
          limited understanding. It clearly shows that the infinite can and does
          enter into finite relations, and that the supernatural can in some way
          enter the historical life of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The necessity of the incarnation. Since the days of Scholasticism
          the question has been debated, whether the incarnation should be
          regarded as involved in the idea of redemption, or as already involved
          in the idea of creation. Popularly stated, the question was, whether
          the Son of God would have come in the flesh even if man had not
          sinned. Rupert of Deutz was the first to assert clearly and positively
          that He would have become incarnate irrespective of sin. His view was
          shared by Alexander of Hales and Duns Scotus, but Thomas Aquinas took
          the position that the reason for the incarnation lay in the entrance
          of sin into the world. The Reformers shared this view, and the
          Churches of the Reformation teach that the incarnation was
          necessitated by the fall of man. Some Lutheran and Reformed scholars,
          however, such as Osiander, Rothe, Dorner, Lange, Van Oosterzee,
          Martensen, Ebrard, and Westcott, were of the contrary opinion. The
          arguments adduced by them are such as the following: Such a stupendous
          fact as the incarnation cannot be contingent, and cannot find its
          cause in sin as an accidental and arbitrary act of man. It must have
          been included in the original plan of God. Religion before and after
          the fall cannot be essentially different. If a Mediator is necessary
          now, He must have been necessary also before the fall. Moreover,
          Christ's work is not limited to the atonement and His saving
          operations. He is Mediator, but also Head; He is not only the arche,
          but also the telos of creation, 1Co_15:45-47; Eph_1:10; Eph_1:21-23;
          Eph_5:31-32; Col_1:15-17.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it should be noted that Scripture invariably represents the
          incarnation as conditioned by human sin. The force of such passages as
          Luk_19:10; Joh_3:16; Gal_4:4; 1Jn_3:8; and Php_2:5-11 is not easily
          broken. The idea, sometimes expressed, that the incarnation in itself
          was fitting and necessary for God, is apt to lead to the pantheistic
          notion of an eternal self-revelation of God in the world. The
          difficulty connected with the plan of God, supposed to burden this
          view, does not exist, if we consider the matter sub specie
          aeternitatis. There is but one plan of God, and this plan includes sin
          and the incarnation from the very beginning. In the last analysis, of
          course, the incarnation, as well as the whole work of redemption was
          contingent, not on sin, but on the good pleasure of God. The fact that
          Christ also has cosmical significance need not be denied, but this too
          is linked up with His redemptive significance in Eph_1:10;
          Eph_1:20-23; Col_1:14-20.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The change effected in the incarnation. When we are told that the
          Word became flesh, this does not mean that the Logos ceased to be what
          He was before. As to His essential being the Logos was exactly the
          same before and after the incarnation. The verb egeneto in Joh_1:14
          (the Word became flesh) certainly does not mean that the Logos changed
          into flesh, and thus altered His essential nature, but simply that He
          took on that particular character, that He acquired an additional
          form, without in any way changing His original nature. He remained the
          infinite and unchangeable Son of God. Again, the statement that the
          Word became flesh does not mean that He took on a human person, nor,
          on the other hand, merely that He took on a human body. The word sarx
          (flesh) here denotes human nature, consisting of body and soul. The
          word is used in a somewhat similar sense in Rom_8:3; 1Ti_3:16;
          1Jn_4:2; 2Jn_1:7 (comp. Php_2:7).
        </p>
        <p>
          d. The incarnation constituted Christ one of the human race. In
          opposition to the teachings of the Anabaptists, our Confession affirms
          that Christ assumed His human nature from the substance of His mother.
          The prevailing opinion among the Anabaptists was that the Lord brought
          His human nature from heaven, and that Mary was merely the conduit or
          channel through which it passed. On this view His human nature was
          really a new creation, similar to ours, but not organically connected
          with it. The importance of opposing this view will be readily seen. If
          the human nature of Christ was not derived from the same stock as ours
          but merely resembled it, there exists no such relation between us and
          Him as is necessary to render His mediation available for our good.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. The incarnation effected by a supernatural conception and a virgin
          birth. Our Confession affirms that the human nature of Christ was
          "conceived in the womb of the blessed virgin Mary by the power of the
          Holy Ghost, without the means of man." This emphasizes the fact that
          the birth of Christ was not at all an ordinary but a supernatural
          birth, in virtue of which He was called "the Son of God." The most
          important element in connection with the birth of Jesus was the
          supernatural operation of the Holy Spirit, for it was only through
          this that the virgin birth became possible. The Bible refers to this
          particular feature in Mat_1:18-20; Luk_1:34-35; Heb_10:5. The work of
          the Holy Spirit in connection with the conception of Jesus was
          twofold: (1) He was the efficient cause of what was conceived in the
          womb of Mary, and thus excluded the activity of man as an efficient
          factor. This was entirely in harmony with the fact that the person who
          was born was not a human person, but the person of the Son of God, who
          as such was not included in the covenant of works and was in Himself
          free from the guilt of sin. (2) He sanctified the human nature of
          Christ in its very inception, and thus kept it free from the pollution
          of sin. We cannot say exactly how the Holy Spirit accomplished this
          sanctifying work, because it is not yet sufficiently understood just
          how the pollution of sin ordinarily passes from parent to child. It
          should be noted, however, that the sanctifying influence of the Holy
          Spirit was not limited to the conception of Jesus, but was continued
          throughout His life, Joh_3:34; Heb_9:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was only through this supernatural conception of Christ that He
          could be born of a virgin. The doctrine of the virgin birth is based
          on the following passages of Scripture: Isa_7:14; Mat_1:18; Mat_1:20;
          Luk_1:34-35, and is also favored by Gal_4:4. This doctrine was
          confessed in the Church from the earliest times. We meet with it
          already in the original forms of the Apostolic Confession, and further
          in all the great Confessions of the Roman Catholic and Protestant
          Churches. Its present denial is not due to the lack of Scriptural
          evidence for it, nor to any want of ecclesiastical sanction, but to
          the current general aversion to the supernatural. The passages of
          Scripture on which the doctrine is based are simply ruled out of court
          on critical grounds which are far from convincing; and that in spite
          of the fact that the integrity of the narratives is proved to be
          beyond dispute; and it is gratuitously assumed that the silence of the
          other New Testament writers respecting the virgin birth proves that
          they were not acquainted with the supposed fact of the miraculous
          birth. All kinds of ingenious attempts are made to explain how the
          story of the virgin birth arose and gained currency. Some seek it in
          Hebrew, and others in Gentile, traditions. We cannot enter upon a
          discussion of the problem here, and therefore merely refer to such
          works as Machen, The Virgin Birth of Christ; Orr, The Virgin Birth of
          Christ; Sweet, The Birth and Infancy of Jesus Christ; Cooke, Did Paul
          Know the Virgin Birth? Knowling, The Virgin Birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question is sometimes asked, whether the virgin birth is a matter
          of doctrinal importance. Brunner declares that he is not interested in
          the subject at all. He rejects the doctrine of the miraculous birth of
          Christ and holds that it was purely natural, but is not sufficiently
          interested to defend his view at length. Moreover, he says: "The
          doctrine of the virgin birth would have been given up long ago were it
          not for the fact that it seemed as though dogmatic interests were
          concerned in its retention."13 Barth recognizes the miracle of the
          virgin birth, and sees in it a token of the fact that God has
          creatively established a new beginning by condescending to become
          Man_1:14 He also finds in it doctrinal significance. According to him
          the "sin-inheritance" is passed on by the male parent, so that Christ
          could assume "creatureliness" by being born of Mary, and at the same
          time escape the "sin-inheritance" by the elimination of the human
          father.15 In answer to the question, whether the virgin birth has
          doctrinal significance, it may be said that it would be inconceivable
          that God should cause Christ to be born in such an extraordinary
          manner, if it did not serve some purpose. Its doctrinal purpose may be
          stated as follows: (1) Christ had to be constituted the Messiah and
          the Messianic Son of God. Consequently, it was necessary that He
          should be born of a woman, but also that He should not be the fruit of
          the will of man, but should be born of God. What is born of flesh is
          flesh. In all probability this wonderful birth of Jesus was in the
          background of the mind of John when he wrote as he did in Joh_1:13.
          (2) If Christ had been generated by man, He would have been a human
          person, included in the covenant of works, and as such would have
          shared the common guilt of mankind. But now that His subject, His ego,
          His person, is not out of Adam, He is not in the covenant of works and
          is free from the guilt of sin. And being free from the guilt of sin,
          His human nature could also be kept free, both before and after His
          birth, from the pollution of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          f. The incarnation itself part of the humiliation of Christ. Was the
          incarnation itself a part of the humiliation of Christ or not? The
          Lutherans, with their distinction between the incarnatio and the
          exinanitio, deny that it was, and base their denial on the fact that
          His humiliation was limited to His earthly existence, while His
          humanity continues in heaven. He still has His human nature, and yet
          is no more in a state of humiliation. There was some difference of
          opinion on this point even among Reformed theologians. It would seem
          that this question should be answered with discrimination. It may be
          said that the incarnation, altogether in the abstract, the mere fact
          that God in Christ assumed a human nature, though an act of
          condescension, was not in itself a humiliation, though Kuyper thought
          it was.16 But it certainly was a humiliation that the Logos assumed
          "flesh," that is, human nature as it is since the fall, weakened and
          subject to suffering and death, though free from the taint of sin.
          This would seem to be implied in such passages as Rom_8:3; 2Co_8:9;
          Php_2:6-7.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE SUFFERINGS OF THE SAVIOUR. Several points should be stressed in
          connection with the sufferings of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. He suffered during His entire life. In view of the fact that Jesus
          began to speak of His coming sufferings towards the end of His life,
          we are often inclined to think that the final agonies constituted the
          whole of His sufferings. Yet His whole life was a life of suffering.
          It was the servant-life of the Lord of Hosts, the life of the Sinless
          One in daily association with sinners, the life of the Holy One in a
          sin-cursed world. The way of obedience was for Him at the same time a
          way of suffering. He suffered from the repeated assaults of Satan,
          from the hatred and unbelief of His own people, and from the
          persecution of His enemies. Since He trod the wine-press alone, His
          loneliness must have been oppressive, and His sense of responsibility,
          crushing. His suffering was consecrated suffering, increasing in
          severity as He approached the end. The suffering that began in the
          incarnation finally reached its climax in the passio magna at the end
          of His life. Then all the wrath of God against sin bore down upon Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. He suffered in body and soul. There has been a time when the
          attention was fixed too exclusively on the bodily sufferings of the
          Saviour. It was not the blind physical pain as such that constituted
          the essence of His suffering, but that pain accompanied with anguish
          of soul and with a mediatorial consciousness of the sin of humanity
          with which He was burdened. Later on it became customary to minimize
          the importance of the bodily sufferings, since it was felt that sin,
          being of a spiritual nature, could only be atoned for by purely
          spiritual sufferings. These one-sided views must be avoided. Both body
          and soul were affected by sin, and in both the punishment had to be
          borne. Moreover, the Bible clearly teaches that Christ suffered in
          both. He agonized in the garden, where His soul was "exceeding
          sorrowful, even unto death," and He was buffeted and scourged and
          crucified.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. His sufferings resulted from various causes. In the last analysis
          all the sufferings of Christ resulted from the fact that He took the
          place of sinners vicariously. But we may distinguish several proximate
          causes, such as: (1) The fact that He who was the Lord of the universe
          had to occupy a menial position, even the position of a bond-servant
          or slave, and that He who had an inherent right to command was in duty
          bound to obey. (2) The fact that He who was pure and holy had to live
          in a sinful, polluted atmosphere, in daily association with sinners,
          and was constantly reminded of the greatness of the guilt with which
          He was burdened by the sins of His contemporaries. (3) His perfect
          awareness and clear anticipation, from the very beginning of His life,
          of the extreme sufferings that would, as it were, overwhelm Him in the
          end. He knew exactly what was coming, and the outlook was far from
          cheerful. (4) Finally, also the privations of life, the temptations of
          the devil, the hatred and rejection of the people, and the
          maltreatment and persecutions to which He was subjected.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. His sufferings were unique. We sometimes speak of the "ordinary"
          sufferings of Christ, when we think of those sufferings that resulted
          from the ordinary causes of misery in the world. But we should
          remember that these causes were far more numerous for the Saviour than
          they are for us. Moreover, even these common sufferings had an
          extraordinary character in His case, and were therefore unique. His
          capacity for suffering was commensurate with the ideal character of
          His humanity, with His ethical perfection, and with His sense of
          righteousness and holiness and veracity. No one could feel the
          poignancy of pain and grief and moral evil as Jesus could. But besides
          these more common sufferings there were also the sufferings caused by
          the fact that God caused our iniquities to come upon Him like a flood.
          The sufferings of the Saviour were not purely natural, but also the
          result of a positive deed of God, Isa_53:6; Isa_53:10. To the more
          special sufferings of the Saviour may also be reckoned the temptations
          in the desert, and the agonies of Gethsemane and Golgotha.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. His sufferings in temptations. The temptations of Christ formed an
          integral part of His sufferings. They are temptations that are
          encountered in the pathway of suffering, Mat_4:1-11 (and parallels);
          Luk_22:28; Joh_12:27; Heb_4:15; Heb_5:7-8. His public ministry began
          with a period of temptation, and even after that time temptations were
          repeated at intervals right on into dark Gethsemane. It was only by
          entering into the very trials of men, into their temptations, that
          Jesus could become a truly sympathetic High Priest and attain to the
          heights of a proved and triumphant perfection, Heb_4:15; Heb_5:7-9. We
          may not detract from the reality of the temptations of Jesus as the
          last Adam, however difficult it may be to conceive of one who could
          not sin as being tempted. Various suggestions have been made to
          relieve the difficulty, as for instance, that in the human nature of
          Christ, as in that of the first Adam, there was the nuda possibilitas
          peccandi, the bare abstract possibility of sinning (Kuyper); that
          Jesus' holiness was an ethical holiness, which had to come to high
          development through, and maintain itself in, temptation (Bavinck); and
          that the things with which Christ was tempted were in themselves
          perfectly lawful, and appealed to perfectly natural instincts and
          appetites (Vos). But in spite of all this the problem remains, How was
          it possible that one who in concreto, that is, as He was actually
          constituted, could not sin nor even have an inclination to sin,
          nevertheless be subject to real temptation?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE DEATH OF THE SAVIOUR. The sufferings of the Saviour finally
          culminated in His death. In connection with this the following points
          should be emphasized:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The extent of His death. It is but natural that, when we speak of
          the death of Christ in this connection, we have in mind first of all
          physical death, that is, the separation of body and soul. At the same
          time we should remember that this does not exhaust the idea of death
          as it is represented in Scripture. The Bible takes a synthetic view of
          death, and regards physical death merely as one of its manifestations.
          Death is separation from God, but this separation can be viewed in two
          different ways. Man separates himself from God by sin, and death is
          the natural result, so that it can even be said that sin is death. But
          it was not in that way that Jesus became subject to death, since He
          had no personal sin. In this connection it should be borne in mind
          that death is not merely the natural consequence of sin, but above all
          the judicially imposed and inflicted punishment of sin. It is God's
          withdrawing Himself with the blessings of life and happiness from man
          and visiting man in wrath. It is from this judicial point of view that
          the death of Christ must be considered. God imposed the punishment of
          death upon the Mediator judicially, since the latter undertook
          voluntarily to pay the penalty for the sin of the human race. Since
          Christ assumed human nature with all its weaknesses, as it exists
          after the fall, and thus became like us in all things, sin only
          excepted, it follows that death worked in Him from the very beginning
          and manifested itself in many of the sufferings to which He was
          subject. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. The
          Heidelberg Catechism correctly says that "all the time He lived on
          earth, but especially at the end of His life, He bore, in body and
          soul, the wrath of God against the sin of the whole human race."17
          These sufferings were followed by His death on the cross. But this was
          not all; He was subject not only to physical, but also to eternal
          death, though He bore this intensively and not extensively, when He
          agonized in the garden and when He cried out on the cross, "My God, my
          God, why hast thou forsaken me?" In a short period of time He bore the
          infinite wrath against sin to the very end and came out victoriously.
          This was possible for Him only because of His exalted nature. At this
          point we should guard against misunderstanding, however. Eternal death
          in the case of Christ did not consist in an abrogation of the union of
          the Logos with the human nature, nor in the divine nature's being
          forsaken of God, nor in the withdrawal of the Father's divine love or
          good pleasure from the person of the Mediator. The Logos remained
          united with the human nature even when the body was in the grave; the
          divine nature could not possibly be forsaken of God; and the person of
          the Mediator was and ever continued to be the object of divine favor.
          It revealed itself in the human consciousness of the Mediator as a
          feeling of Godforsakenness. This implies that the human nature for a
          moment missed the conscious comfort which it might derive from its
          union with the divine Logos, and the sense of divine love, and was
          painfully conscious of the fulness of the divine wrath which was
          bearing down upon it. Yet there was no despair, for even in the
          darkest hour, while He exclaims that He is forsaken, He directs His
          prayer to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The judicial character of His death. It was quite essential that
          Christ should die neither a natural nor an accidental death; and that
          He should not die by the hand of an assassin, but under a judicial
          sentence. He had to be counted with the transgressors, had to be
          condemned as a criminal. Moreover, it was providentially arranged by
          God that He should be tried and sentenced by a Roman judge. The Romans
          had a genius for law and justice, and represented the highest judicial
          power in the world. It might be expected that a trial before a Roman
          judge would serve to bring out clearly the innocence of Jesus, which
          it did, so that it became perfectly clear that He was not condemned
          for any crime which He had committed. It was a testimony to the fact
          that, as the Lord says, "He was cut off out of the land of the living
          for the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke was due." And
          when the Roman judge nevertheless condemned the innocent, he, it is
          true, also condemned himself and human justice as he applied it, but
          at the same time imposed sentence on Jesus as the representative of
          the highest judicial power in the world, functioning by the grace of
          God and dispensing justice in God's name. The sentence of Pilate was
          also the sentence of God, though on entirely different grounds. It was
          significant too that Christ was not beheaded or stoned to death.
          Crucifixion was not a Jewish but a Roman form of punishment. It was
          accounted so infamous and ignominious that it might not be applied to
          Roman citizens, but only to the scum of mankind, to the meanest
          criminals and slaves. By dying that death, Jesus met the extreme
          demands of the law. At the same time He died an accursed death, and
          thus gave evidence of the fact that He became a curse for us,
          Deu_21:23; Gal_3:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE BURIAL OF THE SAVIOUR. It might seem that the death of Christ
          was the last stage of His humiliation, especially in view of one of
          the last words spoken on the cross, "It is finished." But that word in
          all probability refers to His active suffering, that is, the suffering
          in which He Himself took an active part. This was indeed finished when
          He died. It is clear that His burial also formed a part of His
          humiliation. Notice especially the following: (a) Man's returning to
          the dust from which he is taken, is represented in Scripture as part
          of the punishment of sin, Gen_3:19. (b) Several statements of
          Scripture imply that the Saviour's abode in the grave was a
          humiliation, Psa_16:10; Act_2:27; Act_2:31; Act_13:34-35. It was a
          descent into hades in itself dismal and dreary, a place of corruption,
          though in it He was kept from corruption. (c) Burial is a going down,
          and therefore a humiliation. The burial of dead bodies was ordered by
          God to symbolize the humiliation of the sinner. (d) There is a certain
          agreement between the stages in the objective work of redemption and
          the order in the subjective application of the work of Christ. The
          Bible speaks of the sinner's being buried with Christ. Now this
          belongs to the putting off of the old man, and not to the putting on
          of the new, cf. Rom_6:1-6. Consequently also the burial of Jesus forms
          a part of His humiliation. His burial, moreover, did not merely serve
          to prove that Jesus was really dead, but also to remove the terrors of
          the grave for the redeemed and to sanctify the grave for them.
        </p>
        <p>5. THE SAVIOUR'S DESCENT INTO HADES.</p>
        <p>
          a. This doctrine in the Apostolic Confession. After the Apostolic
          Confession has mentioned the sufferings, death, and burial, of the
          Lord, it continues with the words, "He descended into hell (hades)."
          This statement was not in the Creed as early nor as universally as the
          others. It was first used in the Aquileian form of the Creed (c. 390
          A.D.), " descendit in inferna. " Among the Greeks some translated
          "inferna" by "hades," and others by "lower parts." Some forms of the
          Creed in which these words were found did not mention the burial of
          Christ, while the Roman and Oriental forms generally mentioned the
          burial but not the descent into hades. Rufinus remarks that they
          contained the idea of the descent in the word "buried." Later on,
          however, the Roman form of the Creed added the statement in question
          after its mention of the burial. Calvin correctly argues that for
          those who added them after the word "buried," they must have denoted
          something additional.18 It should be borne in mind that these words
          are not found in Scripture, and are not based on such direct
          statements of the Bible as the rest of the articles of the Creed.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Scriptural basis for the expression. There are especially four
          passages of Scripture that come into consideration here. (1) Eph_4:9,
          "Now this, He ascended, what is it but that He also descended into the
          lower parts of the earth?" They who seek support in this passage take
          the expression "lower parts of the earth" as the equivalent of
          "hades." But this is a doubtful interpretation. The apostle argues
          that the ascent of Christ presupposes a descent. Now the opposite of
          the ascension is the incarnation, cf. Joh_3:13. Hence the majority of
          commentators take the expression as referring simply to the earth. The
          expression may be derived from Psa_139:15 and refer more particularly
          to the incarnation. (2) 1Pe_3:18-19, which speaks of Christ as "being
          put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, in which He
          also went and preached unto the spirits in prison." This passage is
          supposed to refer to the descent into hades and to state the purpose
          of it. The Spirit referred to is then understood to be the soul of
          Christ, and the preaching mentioned must have taken place between His
          death and resurrection. But the one is just as impossible as the
          other. The Spirit mentioned is not the soul of Christ but the
          quickening Spirit, and it was by that same life-giving Spirit that
          Christ preached. The common Protestant interpretation of this passage
          is that in the Spirit Christ preached through Noah to the disobedient
          that lived before the flood, who were spirits in prison when Peter
          wrote, and could therefore be designated as such. Bavinck considers
          this untenable and interprets the passage as referring to the
          ascension, which he regards as a rich, triumphant, and powerful
          preaching to the spirits in prison.19 (3) 1Pe_4:4-6, particularly
          1Pe_4:6, which reads as follows: "For unto this end was the gospel
          preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed according
          to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit." In this
          connection the apostle warns the readers that they should not live the
          rest of their life in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will
          of God, even if they should give offense to their former companions
          and be slandered by them, since they shall have to give an account of
          their doing to God, who is ready to judge the living and the dead. The
          "dead" to whom the gospel was preached were evidently not yet dead
          when it was preached unto them, since the purpose of this preaching
          was in part "that they might be judged according to men in the flesh."
          This could only take place during their life on earth. In all
          probability the writer refers to the same spirits in prison of which
          he spoke in the preceding chapter. (4) Psa_16:8-10 (comp. Act_2:25-27;
          Act_2:30-31). It is especially the 10th verse that comes into
          consideration here, "For thou wilt not leave my soul in Sheol; neither
          wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption." From this passage
          Pearson concludes that the soul of Christ was in hell (hades) before
          the resurrection, for we are told that it was not left there.20 But we
          should note the following: (a) The word nephesh (soul) is often used
          in Hebrew for the personal pronoun, and sheol, for the state of death.
          (b) If we so understand these words here, we have a clear synonymous
          parallelism. The idea expressed would be that Jesus was not left to
          the power of death. (c) This is in perfect harmony with the
          interpretation of Peter in Act_2:30-31, and of Paul in Act_13:34-35.
          In both instances the psalm is quoted to prove the resurrection of
          Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Different interpretations of the creedal expression. (1) The
          Catholic Church takes it to mean that, after His death, Christ went
          into the Limbus Patrum, where the Old Testament saints were awaiting
          the revelation and application of His redemption, preached the gospel
          to them, and brought them out to heaven. (2) The Lutherans regard the
          descent into hades as the first stage of the exaltation of Christ.
          Christ went into the underworld to reveal and consummate His victory
          over Satan and the powers of darkness, and to pronounce their sentence
          of condemnation. Some Lutherans place this triumphal march between the
          death of Christ and His resurrection; others, after the resurrection.
          (3) The Church of England holds that, while Christ's body was in the
          grave, the soul went into hades, more particularly into paradise, the
          abode of the souls of the righteous, and gave them a fuller exposition
          of the truth. (4) Calvin interprets the phrase metaphorically,21 as
          referring to the penal sufferings of Christ on the cross, where He
          really suffered the pangs of hell. Similarly, the Heidelberg
          Catechism.22 According to the usual Reformed position the words refer
          not only to the sufferings on the cross, but also to the agonies of
          Gethsemane. (5) Scripture certainly does not teach a literal descent
          of Christ into hell. Moreover, there are serious objections to this
          view. He cannot have descended into hell according to the body, for
          this was in the grave. If He really did descend into hell, it can only
          have been as to His soul, and this would mean that only half of His
          human nature shared in this stage of His humiliation (or exaltation).
          Moreover, as long as Christ had not yet risen from the dead, the time
          had not come for a triumphal march such as the Lutherans assume. And,
          finally, at the time of His death Christ commended His spirit to His
          Father. This seems to indicate that He would be passive rather than
          active from the time of His death until He arose from the grave. On
          the whole it seems best to combine two thoughts: (a) that Christ
          suffered the pangs of hell before His death, in Gethsemane and on the
          cross; and (b) that He entered the deepest humiliation of the state of
          death.

          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: How were state and condition related to
          each other in the case of Adam, when he fell? In the case of the Word
          becoming flesh? How are they related in the redemption of sinners? Do
          one's state and condition always correspond? How should the state of
          humiliation be defined? What does Kuyper mean, when he distinguishes
          between the status generis and the status modi? What stages does he
          distinguish in the state of humiliation? Is there any biblical proof
          for the virgin birth, except in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke? What
          are the doctrinal bearings of this doctrine? Have the theories of the
          mythical origin of the idea of the virgin birth been found adequate?
          What do we understand by Christ's subjection to the law? In what legal
          relation did He stand as Mediator during His humiliation? Was the
          human nature of Christ inherently subject to the law of death? Did
          eternal death in the case of Christ include all the elements that are
          included in the eternal death of sinners? How can the burial of the
          Saviour be conceived of as a proof that He really died?
