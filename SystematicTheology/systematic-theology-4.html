        <p>V. The Attributes of God in General</p>
        <p>A. EVALUATION OF THE TERMS USED</p>
        <p>
          The name "attributes" is not ideal, since it conveys the notion of
          adding or assigning something to one, and is therefore apt to create
          the impression that something is added to the divine Being.
          Undoubtedly the term "properties" is better, as pointing to something
          that is proper to God and to God only. Naturally, in so far as some of
          the attributes are communicable, the absolute character of the
          proprium is weakened, for to that extent some of the attributes are
          not proper to God in the absolute sense of the word. But even this
          term contains the suggestion of a distinction between the essence or
          nature of God and that which is proper to it. On the whole it is
          preferable to speak of the "perfections" or "virtues" of God, with the
          distinct understanding, however, that in this case the term "virtues"
          is not used in a purely ethical sense. By so doing we (a) follow the
          usage of the Bible, which uses the term arete, rendered virtues or
          excellencies, in 1Pe_2:9; and (b) avoid the suggestion that something
          is added to the Being of God. His virtues are not added to His Being,
          but His Being is the pleroma of His virtues and reveals itself in
          them. They may be defined as the perfections which are predicated of
          the Divine Being in Scripture, or are visibly exercised by Him in His
          works of creation, providence, and redemption. If we still continue to
          use the name "attributes," it is because it is commonly used and with
          the distinct understanding that the notion of something added to the
          Being of God must be rigidly excluded.
        </p>
        <p>B. METHOD OF DETERMINING THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD</p>
        <p>
          Scholastics in their attempt to construct a system of natural theology
          posited three ways in which to determine the attributes of God, which
          they designated as the via causalitatis, via negationis, and via
          eminentiae. By the way of causality we rise from the effects which we
          see in the world round about us to the idea of a first Cause, from the
          contemplation of creation, to the idea of an almighty Creator, and
          from the observation of the moral government of the world, to the idea
          of a powerful and wise Ruler. By way of negation we remove from our
          idea of God all the imperfections seen in His creatures, as
          inconsistent with the idea of a Perfect Being, and ascribe to Him the
          opposite perfection. In reliance on that principle we speak of God as
          independent, infinite, incorporeal, immense, immortal, and
          incomprehensible. And finally, by way of eminence we ascribe to God in
          the most eminent manner the relative perfections which we discover in
          man, according to the principle that what exists in an effect,
          pre-exists in its cause, and even in the most absolute sense in God as
          the most perfect Being. This method may appeal to some, because it
          proceeds from the known to the unknown, but is not the proper method
          of dogmatic theology. It takes its starting point in man, and
          concludes from what it finds in man to what is found in God. And in so
          far as it does this it makes man the measure of God. This is certainly
          not a theological method of procedure. Moreover, it bases its
          knowledge of God on human conclusions rather than on the self-
          revelation of God in His divine Word. And yet this is the only
          adequate source of the knowledge of God. While that method might be
          followed in a so-called natural theology, it does not fit in a
          theology of revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same may be said of the methods suggested by modern
          representatives of experimental theology. A typical example of this
          may be found in Macintosh's Theology as an Empirical Science.18 He
          also speaks of three methods of procedure. We may begin with our
          intuitions of the reality of God, those unreasoned certitudes which
          are firmly rooted in immediate experience. One of these is that the
          Object of our religious dependence is absolutely sufficient for our
          imperative needs. Especially may deductions be drawn from the life of
          Jesus and the "Christlike" everywhere. We may also take our starting
          point, not in man's certainties, but in his needs. The practically
          necessary postulate is that God is absolutely sufficient and
          absolutely dependable with reference to the religious needs of man. On
          that basis man can build up his doctrine of the attributes of God.
          And, finally, it is also possible to follow a more pragmatic method,
          which rests on the principle that we can learn to a certain extent
          what things and persons are, beyond what they are immediately
          perceived to be, by observing what they do. Macintosh finds it
          necessary to make use of all three methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ritschl wants us to start with the idea that God is love, and would
          have us ask what is involved in this most characteristic thought of
          God. Since love is personal, it implies the personality of God, and
          thus affords us a principle for the interpretation of the world and of
          the life of man. The thought that God is love also carries with it the
          conviction that He can achieve His purpose of love, that is, that His
          will is supremely effective in the world. This yields the idea of an
          almighty Creator. And by virtue of this basic thought we also affirm
          God's eternity, since, in controlling all things for the realization
          of His Kingdom, He sees the end from the beginning. In a somewhat
          similar vein Dr. W. A. Brown says: "We gain our knowledge of the
          attributes by analyzing the idea of God which we already won from the
          revelation in Christ; and we arrange them in such a way as to bring
          the distinctive features of that idea to clearest expression."19
        </p>
        <p>
          All these methods take their starting point in human experience rather
          than in the Word of God. They deliberately ignore the clear
          self-revelation of God in Scripture and exalt the idea of the human
          discovery of God. They who rely on such methods have an exaggerated
          idea of their own ability to find out God and to determine the nature
          of God inductively by approved "scientific methods." At the same time
          they close their eyes to the only avenue through which they might
          obtain real knowledge of God, that is, His special revelation,
          apparently oblivious of the fact that only the Spirit of God can
          search and reveal the deep things of God and reveal them unto us.
          Their very method compels them to drag God down to the level of man,
          to stress His immanence at the expense of His transcendence, and to
          make Him continuous with the world. And as the final result of their
          philosophy we have a God made in the image of man. James condemns all
          intellectualism in religion, and maintains that philosophy in the form
          of scholastic theology fails as completely to define God's attributes
          in a scientific way as it does to establish His existence. After an
          appeal to the book of Job he says: "Ratiocination is a relatively
          superficial and unreal path to the deity." He concludes his discussion
          with these significant words: "In all sincerity I think we must
          conclude that the attempt to demonstrate by purely intellectual
          processes the truth of the deliverances of direct religious
          experiences is absolutely hopeless."20 He has more confidence in the
          pragmatic method which seeks for a God that meets the practical needs
          of man. In his estimation it is sufficient to believe that "beyond
          each man and in a fashion continuous with him there exists a larger
          power which is friendly to him and to his ideals. All that the facts
          require is that the power should be other and larger than our
          conscious selves. Anything larger will do, if it only be large enough
          to trust for the next step. It need not be infinite, it need not be
          solitary. It might conceivably even be only a larger and more godlike
          self, of which the present self would then be the mutilated
          expression, and the universe might conceivably be a collection of such
          selves, of different degree and inclusiveness, with no absolute unity
          realized in it at all."21 Thus we are left with the idea of a finite
          God.22
        </p>
        <p>
          The only proper way to obtain perfectly reliable knowledge of the
          divine attributes is by the study of God's self-revelation in
          Scripture. It is true that we can acquire some knowledge of the
          greatness and power, the wisdom and goodness of God through the study
          of nature, but for an adequate conception of even these attributes it
          will be necessary to turn to the Word of God. In the theology of
          revelation we seek to learn from the Word of God which are the
          attributes of the Divine Being. Man does not elicit knowledge from God
          as he does from other objects of study, but God conveys knowledge of
          Himself to man, a knowledge which man can only accept and appropriate.
          For the appropriation and understanding of this revealed knowledge it
          is, of course, of the greatest importance that man is created in the
          image of God, and therefore finds helpful analogies in his own life.
          In distinction from the a priori method of the Scholastics, who
          deduced the attributes from the idea of a perfect Being, this method
          may be called a posteriori since it takes its starting point, not in
          an abstract perfect Being, but in the fulness of the divine
          self-revelation, and in the light of this seeks to know the Divine
          Being.
        </p>
        <p>C. SUGGESTED DIVISIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES</p>
        <p>
          The question of the classification of the divine attributes has
          engaged the attention of theologians for a long time. Several
          classifications have been suggested, most of which distinguish two
          general classes. These classes are designated by different names and
          represent different points of view, but are substantially the same in
          the various classifications. The following are the most important of
          these:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Some speak of natural and moral attributes. The former, such as
          self-existence, simplicity, infinity, etc., belong to the
          constitutional nature of God, as distinguished from His will. The
          latter, as truth, goodness, mercy, justice, holiness, etc., qualify
          Him as a moral Being. The objection to this classification is that the
          so-called moral attributes are just as truly natural (i.e. original)
          in God as the others. Dabney prefers this division, but admits, in
          view of the objection raised, that the terms are not felicitous. He
          would rather speak of moral and non-moral attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Others distinguish between absolute and relative attributes. The
          former belong to the essence of God as considered in itself, while the
          latter belong to the divine essence considered in relation to His
          creation. The one class includes such attributes as self- existence,
          immensity, eternity; and the other, such attributes as omnipresence
          and omniscience. This division seems to proceed on the assumption that
          we can have some knowledge of God as He is in Himself, entirely apart
          from the relations in which He stands to His creatures. But this is
          not so, and therefore, properly speaking, all the perfections of God
          are relative, indicating what He is in relation to the world. Strong
          evidently does not recognize the objection, and gives preference to
          this division.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Still others divide the divine perfections into immanent or
          intransitive and emanent or transitive attributes. Strong combines
          this division with the preceding one, when he speaks of absolute or
          immanent and relative or transitive attributes. The former are those
          which do not go forth and operate outside of the divine essence, but
          remain immanent, such as immensity, simplicity, eternity, etc.; and
          the latter are such as issue forth and produce effects external to
          God, as omnipotence, benevolence, justice, etc. But if some of the
          divine attributes are purely immanent, all knowledge of them would
          seem to be excluded. H. B. Smith remarks that every one of them must
          be both immanent and transeunt.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The most common distinction is that between incommunicable and
          communicable attributes. The former are those to which there is
          nothing analogous in the creature, as aseity, simplicity, immensity,
          etc.; the latter those to which the properties of the human spirit
          bear some analogy, as power, goodness, mercy, righteousness, etc. This
          distinction found no favor with the Lutherans, but has always been
          rather popular in Reformed circles, and is found in such
          representative works as those of the Leyden Professors,23 Mastricht
          and Turretin. It was felt from the very beginning, however, that the
          distinction was untenable without further qualification, since from
          one point of view every attribute may be called communicable. None of
          the divine perfections are communicable in the infinite perfection in
          which they exist in God, and at the same time there are faint traces
          in man even of the so-called incommunicable attributes of God. Among
          more recent Reformed theologians there is a tendency to discard this
          distinction in favor of some other divisions. Dick, Shedd, and Vos
          retain the old division. Kuyper expresses himself as dissatisfied with
          it, and yet reproduces it in his virtutes per antithesin and virtutes
          per synthesin; and Bavinck, after following another order in the first
          edition of his Dogmatics, returns to it in the second edition. Honig
          prefers to follow the division given by Bavinck in his first edition.
          And, finally, the Hodges, H. B. Smith, and Thornwell follow a division
          suggested by the Westminster Catechism. However, the classification of
          the attributes under two main heads, as found in the distinction under
          consideration, is really inherent in all the other divisions, so that
          they are all subject to the objection that they apparently divide the
          Being of God into two parts, that first God as He is in Himself, God
          as the absolute Being, is discussed, and then God as He is related to
          His creatures, God as a personal Being. It may be said that such a
          treatment does not result in a unitary and harmonious conception of
          the divine attributes. This difficulty may be obviated, however, by
          having it clearly understood that the two classes of attributes named
          are not strictly co-ordinate, but that the attributes belonging to the
          first class qualify all those belonging to the second class, so that
          it can be said that God is one, absolute, unchangeable and infinite in
          His knowledge and wisdom, His goodness and love, His grace and mercy,
          His righteousness and holiness. If we bear this in mind, and also
          remember that none of the attributes of God are incommunicable in the
          sense that there is no trace of them in man, and that none of them are
          communicable in the sense that they are found in man as they are found
          in God, we see no reason why we should depart from the old division
          which has become so familiar in Reformed theology. For practical
          reasons it seems more desirable to retain it.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: What objections are there to the use of
          the term attributes as applied to God? Do the same objections apply to
          the German "Eigenschaften" and the Holland "eigenschappen"? What name
          does Calvin use for them? What objection is there to the conception of
          the attributes as parts of God or as additions to the Divine Being?
          What faulty conceptions of the attributes were current in the Middle
          Ages? Did the Scholastics in their search for the attributes follow an
          a priori or an a posteriori, a deductive or an inductive method? Why
          is their method inherently foreign to the theology of revelation? What
          classifications of the attributes were suggested in addition to those
          mentioned in the text? Why is it virtually out of the question to give
          a faultless division? What division is suggested by the Westminster
          Catechism?
