        <p>II.The State of Exaltation</p>
        <p>A. GENERAL REMARKS ON THE STATE OF EXALTATION.</p>
        <p>
          1.THE SUBJECT AND NATURE OF THE EXALTATION. As already indicated in
          the preceding, there is a difference of opinion between Lutheran and
          Reformed theology on the subject of the states of Christ. The former
          deny that the Logos, and assert that the human nature of Christ, is
          the subject of the states of humiliation and exaltation. Hence they
          exclude the incarnation from the humiliation of Christ, and maintain
          that the state of humiliation consists in this, "that Christ for a
          time renounced (truly and really, yet freely) the plenary exercise of
          the divine majesty, which His human nature had acquired in the
          personal union, and, as a lowly man, endured what was far beneath the
          divine majesty (that He might suffer and die for the love of the
          world)."23 They hold that the state of exaltation became manifest
          first of all to the lower world in the descent into hades, and further
          to this world in the resurrection and ascension, reaching its
          completion in the session at the right hand of God. The exaltation,
          then, consists in this that the human nature assumed the plenary
          exercise of the divine attributes that were communicated to it at the
          incarnation, but were used only occasionally or secretly. Reformed
          theology, on the other hand, regards the person of the Mediator, that
          is, the God-man, as the subject of the exaltation, but stresses the
          fact that it was, of course, the human nature in which the exaltation
          took place. The divine nature is not capable of humiliation or
          exaltation. In the exaltation the God-man, Jesus Christ, (a) passed
          from under the law in its federal and penal aspects, and consequently
          from under the burden of the law as the condition of the covenant of
          works, and from under the curse of the law; (b) exchanged the penal
          for the righteous relation to the law, and as Mediator entered into
          possession of the blessings of salvation which He merited for sinners;
          and (c) was crowned with a corresponding honor and glory. It had to
          appear also in His condition that the curse of sin was lifted. His
          exaltation was also His glorification.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE EXALTATION OF CHRIST BOTH SCRIPTURAL AND REASONABLE. There is
          abundant Scriptural proof for the exaltation of Christ. The gospel
          story clearly shows us that the humiliation of Christ was followed by
          His exaltation. The classical passage to prove the latter is found in
          Php_2:9-11 : "Wherefore also God highly exalted Him, and gave unto Him
          the name which is above every name; that in the name of Jesus every
          knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth, and that
          every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of
          God the Father." But in addition to this there are several others,
          such as Mar_16:19; Luk_24:26; Joh_7:39; Act_2:33; Act_5:31; Rom_8:17;
          Rom_8:34; Eph_1:20; Eph_4:10; 1Ti_3:16; Heb_1:3; Heb_2:9;
          Heb_10:12Mar_16:19; Luk_24:26; Joh_7:39; Act_2:33; Act_5:31; Rom_8:17;
          Rom_8:34; Eph_1:20; Eph_4:10; 1Ti_3:16; Heb_1:3; Heb_2:9; Heb_10:12.
          There is a close connection between the two states. The state of
          exaltation must be regarded as the judicial result of the state of
          humiliation. In His capacity as Mediator Christ met the demands of the
          law in its federal and penal aspects, paying the penalty of sin and
          meriting everlasting life. Therefore His justification had to follow
          and He had to be put in possession of the reward. Since He was a
          public person and accomplished His work publicly, justice required
          that the exaltation should also be a public matter. The exaltation of
          Christ has a threefold significance. Each one of the stages was a
          virtual declaration of God that Christ met the demands of the law, and
          was therefore entitled to His reward. The first two stages also had
          exemplary significance, since they symbolized what will take place in
          the life of believers. And, finally, all four stages were destined to
          be instrumental in the perfect glorification of believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE STATE OF EXALTATION IN MODERN LIBERAL THEOLOGY. Modern liberal
          theology, of course, knows of no state of exaltation in the life of
          Christ. Not only has it discarded the legal idea of the states of
          Christ altogether, but it has also ruled out all the supernatural in
          the life of the Saviour. Rauschenbusch closes his Theology for the
          Social Gospel with a discussion of the death of Christ. Macintosh says
          that "the difficulties in the way of accepting the ordinary
          traditional notion of the 'resurrection' of Jesus, as a reanimation of
          the dead body, its miraculous transformation and final ascension to
          'heaven,' are, to the scientific habit of thought, practically
          insuperable. . . . An undischarged burden of proof still rests upon
          those who maintain that it (the body of Christ) did not suffer
          disintegration, like the bodies of all others who have died."24
          Beckwith admits that the Bible, and particularly Paul, speaks of the
          exaltation of Christ, but says: "If we translate the Apostle's notion
          of exaltation into its modern equivalent, we shall find him saying
          that Christ is superior to all the forces of the universe and to all
          known orders of rational beings, even the highest, saving only the
          Father."25 And George Burman Foster frankly declares: "According to
          orthodoxy, the Son of God laid aside his divine glory and then took it
          up again; he alienated from himself certain divine qualities, and then
          integrated them again. What is meant is at bottom good, namely, that
          the great and merciful God serves us, and is not too good for our
          daily human food. Perhaps the form of the orthodox doctrine was
          necessary when the doctrine was excogitated, but that terrible being,
          the modern man, cannot do anything with it."26
        </p>
        <p>B. THE STAGES OF THE STATE OF EXALTATION.</p>
        <p>
          Reformed theology distinguishes four stages in the exaltation of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>1. THE RESURRECTION.</p>
        <p>
          a. The nature of the resurrection. The resurrection of Christ did not
          consist in the mere fact that He came to life again, and that body and
          soul were re-united. If this were all that it involved, He could not
          be called "the first-fruits of them that slept," 1Co_15:20, nor "the
          firstborn of the dead," Col_1:18; Rev_1:5, since others were restored
          to life before Him. It consisted rather in this that in Him human
          nature, both body and soul, was restored to its pristine strength and
          perfection and even raised to a higher level, while body and soul were
          re-united in a living organism. From the analogy of the change which,
          according to Scripture, takes place in the body of believers in the
          general resurrection, we may gather something as to the transformation
          that must have occurred in Christ. Paul tells us in 1Co_15:42-44 that
          the future body of believers will be incorruptible, that is, incapable
          of decay; glorious, which means resplendent with heavenly brightness;
          powerful, that is, instinct with energy and perhaps with new
          faculties; and spiritual, which does not mean immaterial or ethereal,
          but adapted to the spirit, a perfect instrument of the spirit. From
          the Gospel story we learn that the body of Jesus had undergone a
          remarkable change, so that He was not easily recognized and could
          suddenly appear and disappear in a surprising manner, Luk_24:31;
          Luk_24:36; Joh_20:13; Joh_20:19; Joh_21:7; but that it was
          nevertheless a material and very real body, Luk_24:39. This does not
          conflict with 1Co_15:50, for "flesh and blood" is a description of
          human nature in its present material, mortal, and corruptible state.
          But the change that takes place in believers is not only bodily but
          also spiritual. Similarly, there was not only a physical but also a
          psychical change in Christ. We cannot say that any religious or
          ethical change took place in Him; but He was endowed with new
          qualities perfectly adjusted to His future heavenly environment.
          Through the resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, 1Co_15:45.
          The resurrection of Christ had a threefold significance: (1) It
          constituted a declaration of the Father that the last enemy had been
          vanquished, the penalty paid, and the condition on which life was
          promised, met. (2) It symbolized what was destined to happen to the
          members of Christ's mystical body in their justification, spiritual
          birth, and future blessed resurrection, Rom_6:4-5; Rom_6:9; Rom_8:11;
          1Co_6:14; 1Co_15:20-22; 2Co_4:14; 2Co_4:14; Col_2:12; 1Th_4:14. (3) It
          is also connected instrumentally with their justification,
          regeneration, and final resurrection, Rom_4:25; Rom_5:10; Eph_1:20;
          Php_3:10; 1Pe_1:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The Author of the resurrection. In distinction from others who were
          raised from the dead, Christ arose through His own power. He spoke of
          Himself as the resurrection and the life, Joh_11:25, declared that He
          had the power to lay down His life, and to take it up again,
          Joh_10:18, and even predicted that He would rebuild the temple of His
          body, Joh_2:19-21. But the resurrection was not a work of Christ
          alone; it is frequently ascribed to the power of God in general,
          Act_2:24; Act_2:32; Act_3:26; Act_5:30; 1Co_6:14; Eph_1:20, or, more
          particularly, to the Father, Rom_6:4; Gal_1:1; 1Pe_1:3. And if the
          resurrection of Christ can be called a work of God, then it follows
          that the Holy Spirit was also operative in it, for all the opera ad
          extra are works of the triune God. Moreover, Rom_8:11 also implies
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Objection to the doctrine of the resurrection. One great objection
          is urged against the doctrine of a physical resurrection, namely, that
          after death the body disintegrates, and the various particles of which
          it is composed enter into the composition of other bodies, vegetable,
          animal, and human. Hence it is impossible to restore these particles
          to all the bodies of which, in the course of time, they formed a part.
          Macintosh asks, "What became of the atoms of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen,
          hydrogen and other elements which composed the earthly body of
          Jesus?"27 Now we admit that the resurrection defies explanation. It is
          a miracle. But at the same time we should bear in mind that the
          identity of a resurrection body with the body that descended into the
          grave does not require that it be composed of exactly the same
          particles. The composition of our bodies changes right along, and yet
          they retain their identity. Paul in 1Co_15:1-58 maintains the
          essential identity of the body that descends into the grave with that
          which is raised up, but also declares emphatically that the form
          changes. That which man sows in the earth passes through a process of
          death, and is then quickened; but in form the grain which he puts into
          the ground is not the same as that which he reaps in due time. God
          gives to each seed a body of its own. So it is also in the
          resurrection of the dead. It may be that there is some nucleus, some
          germ, that constitutes the essence of the body and preserves its
          identity. The argument of the apostle in 1Co_15:35-38 seems to imply
          something of the kind.28 It should be borne in mind that the real, the
          fundamental objection to the resurrection, is its supernatural
          character. It is not lack of evidence, but the fundamental tenet that
          miracles cannot happen, that stands in the way of its acceptance. Even
          liberal scholars admit that no fact is better attested than the
          resurrection of Christ â€” though others, of course, deny this. But
          this makes little difference to the modern scholar. Says Dr. Rashdall:
          "Were the testimony fifty times stronger than it is, any hypothesis
          would be more possible than that." Yet at the present time many
          eminent scientists frankly declare that they are not in a position to
          say that miracles cannot happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Attempts to explain away the fact of the resurrection. In their
          denial the anti- supernaturalists always run up against the story of
          the resurrection in the Gospels. The story of the empty tomb and of
          the appearances of Jesus after the resurrection present a challenge to
          them, and they accept the challenge and attempt to explain these
          without accepting the fact of the resurrection. The following attempts
          are some of the most important.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The falsehood theory. This is to the effect that the disciples
          practiced deliberate deception by stealing the body from the grave and
          then declaring that the Lord had risen. The soldiers who watched the
          grave were instructed to circulate that story, and Celsus already
          urged it in explanation of the empty tomb. This theory, of course,
          impugns the veracity of the early witnesses, the apostles, the women,
          the five hundred brethren, and others. But it is extremely unlikely
          that the faint-hearted disciples would have had the courage to palm
          off such a falsehood upon a hostile world. It is impossible to believe
          that they would have persisted in suffering for such a bare falsehood.
          Moreover, only the facts of the resurrection can explain the
          indomitable courage and power which they reveal in witnessing to the
          resurrection of Christ. These considerations soon led to the
          abandonment of this view.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The swoon theory. According to this theory, Jesus did not really
          die, but merely fainted, while it was thought that He had actually
          died. But this naturally raises several questions that are not easy to
          answer. How can it be explained that so many people were deceived, and
          that the spear thrust did not kill Jesus? How could Jesus in His
          exhausted condition roll away the stone from the grave and then walk
          from Jerusalem to Emmaus and back. How is it that the disciples did
          not treat Him as a sick person, but saw in Him the powerful Prince of
          Life? And what became of Jesus after that? With the resurrection the
          ascension is naturally ruled out also. Did He then return to some
          unknown place and live in secret the rest of His life? This theory is
          burdened with so many improbabilities that even Strauss ridiculed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) The vision theory. This was presented in two forms. (a) Some speak
          of purely subjective visions. In their excited state of mind the
          disciples dwelt so much on the Saviour and on the possibility of His
          return to them, that at last they actually thought they saw Him. The
          spark was applied by the nervous and excitable Mary Magdalene, and
          soon the flame was kindled and spread. This has been the favorable
          theory for a long time, but it too is freighted with difficulties. How
          could such visions arise, seeing that the disciples did not expect the
          resurrection? How could they appear while the disciples were about
          their ordinary business and not given to prayer or meditation? Could
          the rapture or ecstacy required for the creation of subjective visions
          have started as early as the third day? Would not the disciples in
          such visions have seen Jesus, either as surrounded with a halo of
          heavenly glory, or just as they had known Him and eager to renew
          fellowship with them? Do subjective visions ever present themselves to
          several persons simultaneously? How can we account for the visionary
          conversations? (b) In view of the extreme weakness of this theory some
          scholars presented a different version of it. They claim that the
          disciples saw real objective visions, miraculously sent by God, to
          persuade them to go on with the preaching of the gospel. This does
          really avoid some of the difficulties suggested, but encounters
          others. It admits the supernatural; and if this is necessary, why not
          grant the resurrection, which certainly explains all the facts?
          Moreover, this theory asks us to believe that these divinely sent
          visions were such as to mislead the apostles. Does God seek to work
          His ends by deception?
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Mythical theories. A new mythical school has come into existence,
          which discards, or at least dispenses with, theories of vision and
          apparition, and seeks to account for the resurrection legend by the
          help of conceptions imported into Judaism from Babylonia and other
          oriental countries. This school claims not only that the mythology of
          the ancient oriental religions contains analogies of the resurrection
          story, but that this story was actually derived from pagan myths. This
          theory has been worked out in several forms, but is equally baseless
          in all its forms. It is characterized by great arbitrariness in
          bolstering up a connection of the gospel story with heathen myths, and
          has not succeeded in linking them together. Moreover, it reveals an
          extreme disregard of the facts as they are found in Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. The doctrinal bearing of the resurrection. The question arises,
          Does it make any difference, whether we believe in the physical
          resurrection of Christ, or merely in an ideal resurrection? For modern
          liberal theology the resurrection of Jesus, except in the sense of a
          spiritual survival, has no real importance for Christian faith. Belief
          in the bodily resurrection is not essential, but can very well be
          dropped without affecting the Christian religion. Barth and Brunner
          are of a different opinion. They do believe in the historical fact of
          the resurrection, but maintain that as such it is merely a matter of
          history, with which the historian may deal to the best of his ability,
          and not as a matter of faith. The important element is that in the
          resurrection the divine breaks into the course of history, that in it
          the incognito of Jesus is removed and God reveals Himself. The
          historian cannot describe it, but the believer accepts it by faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Belief in the resurrection certainly has doctrinal bearings. We cannot
          deny the physical resurrection of Christ without impugning the
          veracity of the writers of Scripture, since they certainly represent
          it as a fact. This means that it affects our belief in the
          trustworthiness of Scripture. Moreover the resurrection of Christ is
          represented as having evidential value. It was the culminating proof
          that Christ was a teacher sent from God (the sign of Jonah), and that
          He was the very Son of God, Rom_1:4. It was also the supreme
          attestation of the fact of immortality. What is still more important,
          the resurrection enters as a constitutive element into the very
          essence of the work of redemption, and therefore of the gospel. It is
          one of the great foundation stones of the Church of God. The atoning
          work of Christ, if it was to be effective at all, had to terminate,
          not in death, but in life. Furthermore, it was the Father's seal on
          the completed work of Christ, the public declaration of its
          acceptance. In it Christ passed from under the law. Finally, it was
          His entrance on a new life as the risen and exalted Head of the Church
          and the universal Lord. This enabled Him to apply the fruits of His
          redemptive work.
        </p>
        <p>2. THE ASCENSION.</p>
        <p>
          a. The ascension of Christ does not stand out as boldly on the pages
          of the Bible as the resurrection does. This is probably due to the
          fact that the latter rather than the former was the real turning point
          in the life of Jesus. In a certain sense the ascension may be called
          the necessary complement and completion of the resurrection. Christ's
          transition to the higher life of glory, begun in the resurrection, was
          perfected in the ascension. This does not mean that the ascension was
          devoid of independent significance. But though the Scripture proof for
          the ascension is not as abundant as that for the resurrection, it is
          quite sufficient. Luke gives a double account of it, Luk_24:50-53, and
          Act_1:6-11. Mark refers to it in 16:19, but this passage is contested.
          Jesus spoke of it time and again before His death, Joh_6:62; Joh_14:2;
          Joh_16:5; Joh_16:10; Joh_1:1; Joh_16:28; Joh_17:5; Joh_20:17. Paul
          refers to it repeatedly, Eph_1:20; Eph_4:8-10; 1Ti_3:16; and the
          Epistle to the Hebrews calls attention to its significance, Heb_1:3;
          Heb_4:14; Heb_9:24.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The nature of the ascension. The ascension may be described as the
          visible ascent of the person of the Mediator from earth to heaven,
          according to His human nature. It was a local transition, a going from
          place to place. This implies, of course, that heaven is a place as
          well as earth. But the ascension of Jesus was not merely a transition
          from one place to another; it also included a further change in the
          human nature of Christ. That nature now passed into the fulness of
          heavenly glory and was perfectly adapted to the life of heaven. Some
          Christian scholars of recent date consider heaven to be a condition
          rather than a place, and therefore do not conceive of the ascension
          locally.29 They will admit that there was a momentary lifting up of
          Christ in the sight of the Eleven, but regard this only as a symbol of
          the lifting up of our humanity to a spiritual order far above our
          present life. The local conception, however, is favored by the
          following considerations: (1) Heaven is represented in Scripture as
          the dwelling place of created beings (angels, saints, the human nature
          of Christ). These are all in some way related to space; only God is
          above all spatial relations. Of course, the laws that apply in
          heavenly space may differ from those that apply in earthly space. (2)
          Heaven and earth are repeatedly placed in juxtaposition in Scripture.
          From this it would seem to follow that, if the one is a place, the
          other must be a place also. It would be absurd to put a place and a
          condition in juxtaposition in that way. (3) The Bible teaches us to
          think of heaven as a place. Several passages direct our thought upward
          to heaven and downward to hell, Deu_30:12; Jos_2:11; Psa_139:8;
          Rom_10:6-7. This would have no meaning if the two were not to be
          regarded as local in some sense of the word. (4) The Saviour's
          entrance into heaven is pictured as an ascent. The disciples see Jesus
          ascending until a cloud intercepts Him and hides Him from their sight.
          The same local coloring is present to the mind of the writer of
          Hebrews in Heb_4:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The Lutheran conception of the ascension. The Lutheran conception
          of the ascension differs from that of the Reformed. They regard it,
          not as a local transition, but as a change of condition, whereby the
          human nature of Christ passed into the full enjoyment and exercise of
          the divine perfections, communicated to it at the incarnation, and
          thus became permanently omnipresent. In connection with the idea that
          Christ began His session at the right hand of God at the ascension,
          they maintain that this right hand (which is merely a symbol of power)
          is everywhere. Lutherans, however, do not all think alike on the
          subject of the ubiquity of Christ's human nature. Some deny it
          altogether, and others believe that, while the ascension resulted in
          the ubiquity of Christ, it also included a local movement, whereby
          Christ withdrew His visible presence from the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. The doctrinal significance of the ascension. Barth says that the
          question may well be asked why the ascension should have a place among
          the main articles of the Christian faith, seeing that it is mentioned
          less frequently and emphatically than the resurrection, and where it
          is mentioned appears only as a natural transition from the
          resurrection to the session at God's right hand. It is exactly in this
          transition that he finds the real significance of the ascension. Hence
          he does not care to stress the ascension as a visible exaltation, a
          "vertical elevation in space" before the eyes of the disciples, since
          that is evidently not the way to the session at the right hand of God,
          which is no place. Just as the historical facts of the virgin birth
          and of the resurrection are regarded by him merely as signs of a
          revelation of Christ, so too the ascension as a sign and wonder is
          merely a " pointer to the revelation, that occurred in the
          resurrection, of Jesus Christ as the bearer of all power in heaven and
          earth."30
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be said that the ascension had a threefold significance. (1) It
          clearly embodied the declaration that the sacrifice of Christ was a
          sacrifice to God, which as such had to be presented to Him in the
          inner sanctuary; that the Father regarded the Mediatorial work of
          Christ as sufficient and therefore admitted Him to the heavenly glory;
          and that the Kingdom of the Mediator was not a kingdom of the Jews,
          but a universal kingdom. (2) It was also exemplary in that it was
          prophetic of the ascension of all believers, who are already set with
          Christ in heavenly places, Eph_2:6, and are destined to be with Him
          forever, Joh_17:24; and also in that it revealed the initial
          restoration of the original kingship of man, Heb_2:7; Heb_2:9. (3)
          Finally, it was also instrumental in preparing a place for those who
          are in Christ. The Lord Himself points to the necessity of going to
          the Father, in order to prepare a place for His disciples, Joh_14:2-3.
        </p>
        <p>3. THE SESSION AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD.</p>
        <p>
          a. Scriptural proof for the session. When Christ stood before the high
          priest He predicted that He would sit at the right hand of power,
          Mat_26:64. Peter makes mention of it in his sermons, Act_2:33-36;
          Act_5:31. In both of these passages the dative tei dexiai may have to
          be taken in its more usual instrumental sense, though in the first of
          the two the quotation in Act_5:34 favors the local interpretation. It
          is also referred to in Eph_1:20-22; Heb_10:12; 1Pe_3:22; Rev_22:1.
          Besides these passages there are several that speak of Christ's
          reigning as King, Rom_14:9; 1Co_15:24-28; Heb_2:7-8.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The significance of the session. Naturally, the expression "right
          hand of God" is anthropomorphic and cannot be taken literally. The
          expression, as used in this connection, is derived from Psa_110:1,
          "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool."
          To be seated at the right hand of the king might be merely a mark of
          honour, 1Ki_2:19, but might also denote participation in government,
          and consequently in honour and glory. In the case of Christ it was
          undoubtedly an indication of the fact that the Mediator received the
          reigns of government over the Church and over the universe, and is
          made to share in the corresponding glory. This does not mean that
          Christ was not King of Zion up to this time, but that He is now
          publicly inaugurated as Godman, and as such receives the government of
          the Church and of heaven and earth, and enters solemnly upon the
          actual administration of the power committed to Him. This is entirely
          in agreement with what Calvin says, namely, that the statement that
          Christ was seated at the right hand of God is equivalent to saying
          "that He was installed in the government of heaven and earth, and
          formally admitted to possession of the administration committed to
          Him, and not only admitted for once, but to continue until He descend
          to judgment."31 It is perfectly evident that it would be a mistake to
          infer from the fact that the Bible speaks of Christ's "sitting" at the
          right hand of God, that the life to which the risen Lord ascended is a
          life of rest. It is and continues to be a life of constant activity.
          The statements of Scripture vary. Christ is not only represented as
          sitting at the right hand of God, but also simply as being at His
          right hand, Rom_8:34; 1Pe_3:22, or as standing there, Act_7:56, and
          even as walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. And it
          would be equally wrong to conclude from the emphasis on the royal
          dignity and government of Christ, naturally suggested by the idea of
          His sitting at the right hand of God, that the work in which He is
          engaged during His heavenly session is exclusively governmental, and
          therefore neither prophetical nor priestly.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The work of Christ during His session. It deserves emphasis that
          Christ, while He is seated at the right hand of God, is not merely a
          passive recipient of divine dominion and power, majesty and glory, but
          is actively engaged in the continuation of His mediatorial work. (1)
          Since the Bible most frequently connects the session with the kingly
          rule of Christ, it is natural to think first of all of His work as
          King. He rules and protects His Church by His Spirit, and also governs
          it through His appointed officers. He has all the forces of heaven
          under His command: the angels are His messengers, always ready to
          convey His blessings to the saints, and to guard them against
          surrounding dangers. He exercises authority over the forces of nature,
          and over all the powers that are hostile to the Kingdom of God; and
          will so continue to reign until He has subjected the last enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) However, His work is not limited to His kingly rule. He is priest
          forever after the order of Melchizedek. When He cried out on the
          cross, "It is finished," He did not mean to say that His priestly work
          was at an end, but only that His active suffering had reached its
          termination. The Bible also connects priestly work with Christ's
          session at the right hand of God, Zec_6:13; Heb_4:14; Heb_7:24-25;
          Heb_8:1-6; Heb_9:11-15; Heb_9:24-26; Heb_10:19-22; 1Jn_2:2. Christ is
          continually presenting His completed sacrifice to the Father as the
          sufficient basis for the bestowal of the pardoning grace of God. He is
          constantly applying His sacrificial work, and making it effective in
          the justification and sanctification of sinners. Moreover, He is ever
          making intercession for those that are His, pleading for their
          acceptance on the basis of His completed sacrifice, and for their
          safe-keeping in the world, and making their prayers and services
          acceptable to God. The Lutherans stress the fact that the intercession
          of Christ is vocalis et realis , while the Reformed emphasize the fact
          that it consists primarily in the presence of Christ in man's nature
          with the Father, and that the prayers are to be considered as the
          presentation of legitimate claims rather than as supplications.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Christ also continues His prophetical work through the Holy
          Spirit. Before He parted with His disciples He promised them the Holy
          Spirit, to aid their memories, teach them new truths, guide them in
          all the truth, and enrich them out of the fulness of Christ,
          Joh_14:26; Joh_16:7-15. The promise was fulfilled on the day of
          Pentecost; and from that day on Christ, through the Spirit, was active
          as our great Prophet in various ways: in the inspiration of Scripture;
          in and through the preaching of the apostles and of the ministers of
          the Word; in the guidance of the Church, making it the foundation and
          pillar of the truth; and in making the truth effective in the hearts
          and lives of believers.
        </p>
        <p>4. THE PHYSICAL RETURN OF CHRIST.</p>
        <p>
          a. The return as a stage in the exaltation. The return of Christ is
          sometimes omitted from the stages of His exaltation, as if the session
          at the right hand of God were the culminating point. But this is not
          correct. The highest point is not reached until He who suffered at the
          hands of man, returns in the capacity of Judge. He himself pointed to
          this as a special mediatorial prerogative, Joh_5:22; Joh_5:27, and so
          did the apostles, Act_10:42; Act_17:31. Besides the passages that
          speak of Christ's appointment as Judge, there are several that refer
          to His judicial activity, Mat_19:28; Mat_25:31-34; JLuk_3:17;
          Rom_2:16; Rom_14:9; 2Co_5:10; 2Ti_4:1; Jas_5:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Scriptural terms for the return. Several terms are used to
          designate the future coming of Jesus Christ. The term " parousia " is
          the most common of these. It means in the first place simply
          "presence," but also serves to designate a coming preceding a
          presence. The latter is the common meaning of the term, when it is
          used in connection with the return of Jesus Christ, Mat_24:3;
          Mat_24:27; Mat_7:1; Mat_24:39; 1Co_15:23; 1Th_2:19; 1Th_3:13;
          1Th_4:15; 1Th_5:23; 2Th_2:1; Jas_5:7-8; 2Pe_3:4. A second term is "
          apocalupsis," which stresses the fact that the return will be a
          revealing of Jesus Christ. It points to the uncovering of something
          that was previously hidden from view, in this case, of the concealed
          glory and majesty of Jesus Christ, 2Th_1:7; 1Pe_1:7; 1Pe_1:13;
          1Pe_4:13. A third term is " epiphaneia," the glorious appearing of the
          Lord. The implication is that what is uncovered is something glorious,
          2Th_2:8; 1Ti_6:14; 2Ti_4:1-8; Tit_2:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The manner of Christ's return. Some place the return of Christ in
          the past, claiming that the promise of His coming again was realized
          when He returned in the Holy Spirit. They refer to the promise in
          Joh_14:1-31, Joh_15:1-27; Joh_16:1-33, and interpret the word "
          parousia " as meaning simply "presence."32 Now it may be said that, in
          a sense, Christ did return in the Holy Spirit, and as such is now
          present in the Church. But this was a spiritual return, while the
          Bible teaches us to look for a physical and visible return of Christ,
          Act_1:11. Even after Pentecost we are taught to look forward to the
          coming of Christ, 1Co_1:7; 1Co_4:5; 1Co_11:26; Php_3:20; Col_3:4;
          1Th_4:15-17; 2Th_1:7-10; Tit_2:13; Rev_1:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. The purpose of His return. The second coming of Jesus Christ will
          be for the purpose of judging the world and perfecting the salvation
          of His people. Men and angels, the living and the dead, will appear
          before Him to be judged according to the record which was kept of
          them, Mat_24:30-31; Mat_25:31-32. It will be a coming with terrible
          judgments upon the wicked, but also with blessings of eternal glory
          for the saints, Mat_25:33-36. While He will sentence the wicked to
          everlasting punishment, He will publicly justify His own and lead them
          into the perfect joy of His eternal Kingdom. This will signalize the
          completed victory of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. Objection to the doctrine of the return. The great objection to the
          doctrine of the return of Jesus Christ is of a piece with the
          objection to the doctrine of the physical resurrection of Christ. If
          there can be no physical resurrection and ascension, there can be no
          physical return from heaven. Both are equally impossible, and the
          Biblical teachings respecting them are merely crude representations of
          an unscientific age. Jesus evidently shared the carnal views of His
          day, and these colored His prophetic delineations of the future. The
          only return of which we can speak and for which we can hope is a
          return in power, in the establishment of an ethical kingdom on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: What historical proofs have we for the
          resurrection of Christ? Does 1Co_15:8 prove that the appearances were
          subjective visions? What myths are supposed to have entered into the
          shaping of the story of the resurrection? What light do the following
          passages shed on the post-resurrection condition of Jesus? 1Co_6:17;
          2Co_3:17-18; 1Ti_3:16; Rom_1:3-4; Heb_9:14; 1Pe_3:18. What is the
          difference between a soma psychicon, a soma pneumatikon, and a soma
          tes sarkos? Are "spirit" and "spiritual" antithetical to "body" and
          "bodily" in the New Testament? Does science really make it impossible
          to think of heaven as a place? Is it true that in Scripture the words
          "heaven" and "heavenly" indicate a state rather than a place? Does
          modern theology think of heaven only as a condition to be entered upon
          after death? Does its position really find support in such a passage
          as Eph_2:6? Does the Old Testament contain any references to the
          ascension and the session at the right hand of God? What serious
          objections are there to the Lutheran doctrine of the ubiquity of the
          human nature of Christ? Does the Bible teach us to regard the return
          of Christ as imminent?
