        <p>VIII. The Holy Trinity</p>
        <p>THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY IN HISTORY</p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of the Trinity has always bristled with difficulties, and
          therefore it is no wonder that the Church in its attempt to formulate
          it was repeatedly tempted to rationalize it and to give a construction
          of it which failed to do justice to the Scriptural data.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE PRE REFORMATION PERIOD. The Jews of Jesus' days strongly
          emphasized the unity of God, and this emphasis was carried over into
          the Christian Church. The result was that some ruled out the personal
          distinctions in the Godhead altogether, and that others failed to do
          full justice to the essential deity of the second and third persons of
          the Holy Trinity. Tertullian was the first to use the term "Trinity"
          and to formulate the doctrine, but his formulation was deficient,
          since it involved an unwarranted subordination of the Son to the
          Father. Origen went even farther in this direction by teaching
          explicitly that the Son is subordinate to the Father in respect to
          essence, and that the Holy Spirit is subordinate even to the Son. He
          detracted from the essential deity of these two persons in the
          Godhead, and furnished a steppingstone to the Arians, who denied the
          deity of the Son and of the Holy Spirit by representing the Son as the
          first creature of the Father, and the Holy Spirit as the first
          creature of the Son. Thus the consubstantiality of the Son and the
          Holy Spirit with the Father was sacrificed, in order to preserve the
          unity of God; and the three persons of the Godhead were made to differ
          in rank. The Arians still retained a semblance of the doctrine of
          three persons in the Godhead, but this was sacrificed entirely by
          Monarchianism, partly in the interest of the unity of God and partly
          to maintain the deity of the Son. Dynamic Monarchianism saw in Jesus
          but a man and in the Holy Spirit a divine influence, while Modalistic
          Monarchianism regarded the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
          merely as three modes of manifestation successively assumed by the
          Godhead. On the other hand there were also some who lost sight of the
          unity of God to such an extent that they landed in Tritheism. Some of
          the later Monophysites, such as John Ascunages and John Philoponus,
          fell into this error. During the Middle Ages the Nominalist,
          Roscelinus, was accused of the same error. The Church began to
          formulate its doctrine of the Trinity in the fourth century. The
          Council of Nicea declared the Son to be co-essential with the Father
          (325 A.D.), while the Council of Constantinople (381 A.D.) asserted
          the deity of the Holy Spirit, though not with the same precision. As
          to the interrelation of the three it was officially professed that the
          Son is generated by the Father, and that the Holy Spirit proceeds from
          the Father and the Son. In the East the doctrine of the Trinity found
          its fullest statement in the work of John of Damascus, and in the
          West, in Augustine's great work De Trinitate. The former still retains
          an element of subordination, which is entirely eliminated by the
          latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE POST REFORMATION PERIOD. We have no further development of the
          doctrine of the Trinity, but only encounter repeatedly some of the
          earlier erroneous constructions of it after the Reformation. The
          Arminians, Episcopius, CurcellÃ¦us, and Limborgh, revived the doctrine
          of subordination, chiefly again, so it seems, to maintain the unity of
          the Godhead. They ascribed to the Father a certain pre-eminence over
          the other persons, in order, dignity, and power. A somewhat similar
          position was taken by Samuel Clarke in England and by the Lutheran
          theologian, Kahnis. Others followed the way pointed out by Sabellius
          by teaching a species of Modalism, as, for instance, Emanuel
          Swedenborg, who held that the eternal God-man became flesh in the Son,
          and operated through the Holy Spirit; Hegel, who speaks of the Father
          as God in Himself, of the Son as God objectifying Himself, and of the
          Holy Spirit as God returning unto Himself; and Schleiermacher, who
          regards the three persons simply as three aspects of God: the Father
          is God as the underlying unity of all things, the Son is God as coming
          to conscious personality in man, and the Holy Spirit is God as living
          in the Church. The Socinians of the days of the Reformation moved
          along Arian lines, but even went beyond Arius, by making Christ merely
          a man and the Holy Spirit but a power or influence. They were the
          forerunners of the Unitarians and also of the liberal theologians who
          speak of Jesus as a divine teacher, and identify the Holy Spirit with
          the immanent God. Finally, there were also some who, since they
          regarded the statement of the doctrine of an ontological Trinity as
          unintelligible, wanted to stop short of it and rest satisfied with the
          doctrine of an economic Trinity, a Trinity as revealed in the work of
          redemption and in human experience, as Moses Stuart, W. L. Alexander,
          and W. A. Brown. For a considerable time interest in the doctrine of
          the Trinity waned, and theological discussion centered more
          particularly on the personality of God. Brunner and Barth have again
          called attention to its importance. The latter places it very much in
          the foreground, discussing it in connection with the doctrine of
          revelation, and devotes 220 pages of his Dogmatics to it. Materially,
          he derives the doctrine from Scripture, but, formally and logically,
          he finds that it is involved in the simple sentence, "God speaks." He
          is Revealer (Father), Revelation (Son) and Revealedness (Holy Spirit).
          He reveals Himself, He is the Revelation, and He is also the content
          of the Revelation. God and His revelation are identified. He remains
          God also in His revelation, absolutely free and sovereign. This view
          of Barth is not a species of Sabellianism, for he recognizes three
          persons in the Godhead. Moreover, he does not allow for any
          subordination. Says he: "Thus, to the same God who in unimpaired unity
          is Revealer, Revelation, and Revealedness, is also ascribed in
          unimpaired variety in Himself precisely this threefold mode of
          being."36
        </p>
        <p>B. GOD AS TRINITY IN UNITY</p>
        <p>
          The word "Trinity" is not quite as expressive as the Holland word
          "Drieeenheid," for it may simply denote the state of being three,
          without any implication as to the unity of the three. It is generally
          understood, however, that, as a technical term in theology, it
          includes that idea. It goes without saying that, when we speak of the
          Trinity of God, we refer to a trinity in unity, and to a unity that is
          trinal.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE PERSONALITY OF GOD AND THE TRINITY. As stated in the preceding,
          the communicable attributes of God stress His personality, since they
          reveal Him as a rational and moral Being. His life stands out clearly
          before us in Scripture as a personal life; and it is, of course, of
          the greatest importance to maintain the personality of God, for
          without it there can be no religion in the real sense of the word: no
          prayer, no personal communion, no trustful reliance and no confident
          hope. Since man is created in the image of God, we learn to understand
          something of the personal life of God from the contemplation of
          personality as we know it in man. We should be careful, however, not
          to set up man's personality as a standard by which the personality of
          God must be measured. The original form of personality is not in man
          but in God; His is archetypal, while man's is ectypal. The latter is
          not identical with the former, but does contain faint traces of
          similarity with it. We should not say that man is personal, while God
          is super- personal (a very unfortunate term), for what is
          super-personal is not personal; but rather, that what appears as
          imperfect in man exists in infinite perfection in God. The one
          outstanding difference between the two is that man is uni-personal,
          while God is tri-personal. And this tri-personal existence is a
          necessity in the Divine Being, and not in any sense the result of a
          choice of God. He could not exist in any other than the tri- personal
          form. This has been argued in various ways. It is very common to argue
          it from the idea of personality itself. Shedd bases his argument on
          the general self-consciousness of the triune God, as distinguished
          from the particular individual self- consciousness of each one of the
          Persons in the Godhead, for in self-consciousness the subject must
          know itself as an object, and also perceive that it does. This is
          possible in God because of His trinal existence. He says that God
          could not be self-contemplating, self-cognitive, and self-communing,
          if He were not trinal in His constitution.37 Bartlett presents in an
          interesting way a variety of considerations to prove that God is
          necessarily tri-personal.38 The argument from personality, to prove at
          least a plurality in God, can be put in some such form as this: Among
          men the ego awakens to consciousness only by contact with the non-ego.
          Personality does not develop nor exist in isolation, but only in
          association with other persons. Hence it is not possible to conceive
          of personality in God apart from an association of equal persons in
          Him. His contact with His creatures would not account for His
          personality any more than man's contact with the animals would explain
          his personality. In virtue of the tri-personal existence of God there
          is an infinite fulness of divine life in Him. Paul speaks of this
          pleroma (fulness) of the Godhead in Eph_3:19 and Col_1:9; Col_2:9. In
          view of the fact that there are three persons in God, it is better to
          say that God is personal than to speak of Him as a Person.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. SCRIPTURAL PROOF FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY. The doctrine of
          the Trinity is very decidedly a doctrine of revelation. It is true
          that human reason may suggest some thoughts to substantiate the
          doctrine, and that men have sometimes on purely philosophical grounds
          abandoned the idea of a bare unity in God, and introduced the idea of
          living movement and self-distinction. And it is also true that
          Christian experience would seem to demand some such construction of
          the doctrine of God. At the same time it is a doctrine which we would
          not have known, nor have been able to maintain with any degree of
          confidence, on the basis of experience alone, and which is brought to
          our knowledge only by God's special self-revelation. Therefore it is
          of the utmost importance that we gather the Scriptural proofs for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Old Testament proofs. Some of the early Church Fathers and even
          some later theologians, disregarding the progressive character of
          God's revelation, gave the impression that the doctrine of the Trinity
          was completely revealed in the Old Testament. On the other hand
          Socinians and Arminians were of the opinion that it was not found
          there at all. Both were mistaken. The Old Testament does not contain a
          full revelation of the trinitarian existence of God, but does contain
          several indications of it. And this is exactly what might be expected.
          The Bible never deals with the doctrine of the Trinity as an abstract
          truth, but reveals the trinitarian life in its various relations as a
          living reality, to a certain extent in connection with the works of
          creation and providence, but particularly in relation to the work of
          redemption. Its most fundamental revelation is a revelation given in
          facts rather than in words. And this revelation increases in clarity
          in the measure in which the redemptive work of God is more clearly
          revealed, as in the incarnation of the Son and the outpouring of the
          Holy Spirit. And the more the glorious reality of the Trinity stands
          out in the facts of history, the clearer the statements of the
          doctrine become. The fuller revelation of the Trinity in the New
          Testament is due to the fact that the Word became flesh, and that the
          Holy Spirit took up His abode in the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof for the Trinity has sometimes been found in the distinction of
          Jehovah and Elohim, and also in the plural Elohim, but the former is
          entirely unwarranted, and the latter is, to say the least, very
          dubious, though Rottenberg still maintains it in his work on De
          Triniteit in Israels Godsbegrip.39 It is far more plausible that the
          passages in which God speaks of Himself in the plural, Gen_1:16;
          Gen_11:7, contain an indication of personal distinctions in God,
          though even these do not point to a trinity but only to a plurality of
          persons. Still clearer indications of such personal distinctions are
          found in those passages which refer to the Angel of Jehovah, who is on
          the one hand identified with Jehovah, and on the other hand
          distinguished from Him, Gen_16:7-13; Gen_18:1-21; Gen_19:1-28;
          Mal_3:1; and also in passages in which the Word or Wisdom of God is
          personified, Psa_33:4; Psa_33:6; Pro_8:12-31. In some cases more than
          one person is mentioned, Psa_33:6; Psa_45:6-7 (comp. Heb_1:8-9), and
          in others God is the speaker, and mentions both the Messiah and the
          Spirit, or the Messiah is the speaker who mentions both God and the
          Spirit, Isa_48:16; Isa_61:1; Isa_63:9-10. Thus the Old Testament
          contains a clear anticipation of the fuller revelation of the Trinity
          in the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. New Testament proofs. The New Testament carries with it a clearer
          revelation of the distinctions in the Godhead. If in the Old Testament
          Jehovah is represented as the Redeemer and Saviour of His people,
          Job_19:15; Psa_19:14; Psa_78:35; Psa_106:21; Isa_41:14; Isa_43:3;
          Isa_43:11; Isa_43:14; Isa_47:4; Isa_49:7; Isa_49:26; Isa_60:16;
          Jer_14:3; Jer_50:14; Hos_13:3, in the New Testament the Son of God
          clearly stands out in that capacity, Mat_1:21; Luk_1:76-79; Luk_2:17;
          Joh_4:42; Act_5:3; Gal_3:13; Gal_4:5; Tit_2:13-14. And if in the Old
          Testament it is Jehovah that dwells among Israel and in the hearts of
          those that fear Him, Psa_74:2; Psa_135:21; Isa_8:18; Isa_57:15;
          Eze_43:7-9; Joe_3:17; Joe_3:21; Zec_2:10-11, in the New Testament it
          is the Holy Spirit that dwells in the Church, Act_2:4; Rom_8:9;
          Rom_8:11; 1Co_3:16; Gal_4:6; Eph_2:22; Jas_4:5. The New Testament
          offers the clear revelation of God sending His Son into the world,
          Joh_3:16; Gal_4:4; Heb_1:6; 1Jn_4:9; and of both the Father and the
          Son, sending the Spirit, Joh_14:26; Joh_15:26; Joh_16:7; Gal_4:6. We
          find the Father addressing the Son, Mar_1:11; Luk_3:22, the Son
          communing with the Father, Mat_11:25-26; Mat_26:39; Joh_11:41;
          Joh_12:27-28, and the Holy Spirit praying to God in the hearts of
          believers, Rom_8:26. Thus the separate persons of the Trinity are made
          to stand out clearly before our minds. At the baptism of the Son the
          Father speaks from heaven, and the Holy Spirit descends in the form of
          a dove, Mat_3:16-17. In the great commission Jesus mentions the three
          persons: "... baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the
          Son and of the Holy Spirit," Mat_28:19. They are also named alongside
          of each other in 1Co_12:4-6; 2Co_13:14; and 1Pe_1:2. The only passage
          speaking of tri-unity is 1Jn_5:7 (Auth. Ver.), but this is of doubtful
          genuineness, and is therefore eliminated from the latest critical
          editions of the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. STATEMENT OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY. The doctrine of the
          Trinity can best be discussed briefly in connection with various
          propositions, which constitute an epitome of the faith of the Church
          on this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. There is in the Divine Being but one indivisible essence (ousia,
          essentia). God is one in His essential being or constitutional nature.
          Some of the early Church Fathers used the term " substantia" as
          synonymous with "essentia," but later writers avoided this use of it
          in view of the fact that in the Latin Church " substantia" was used as
          a rendering of" hupostasis" as well as of " ousia ", and was therefore
          ambiguous. At present the two terms "substance" and "essence" are
          often used interchangeably. There is no objection to this, provided we
          bear in mind that they have slightly different connotations. Shedd
          distinguishes them as follows: "Essence is from esse, to be, and
          denotes energetic being. Substance is from substare and denotes the
          latent possibility of being.... The term essence describes God as a
          sum-total of infinite perfections; the term substance describes Him as
          the underlying ground of infinite activities. The first is,
          comparatively, an active word; the last, a passive. The first is,
          comparatively, a spiritual, the last a material term. We speak of
          material substance rather than of material essence."40 Since the unity
          of God was already discussed in the preceding, it is not necessary to
          dwell on it in detail in the present connection. This proposition
          respecting the unity of God is based on such passages as Deu_6:4;
          Jas_2:19, on the self-existence and immutability of God, and on the
          fact that He is identified with His perfections as when He is called
          life, light, truth, righteousness, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. In this one Divine Being there are three Persons or individual
          subsistences, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This is proved by the
          various passages referred to as substantiating the doctrine of the
          Trinity. To denote these distinctions in the Godhead, Greek writers
          generally employed the term hupostasis while Latin authors used the
          term persona, and sometimes substantia. Because the former was apt to
          be misleading and the latter was ambiguous, the Schoolmen coined the
          word subsistentia. The variety of the terms used points to the fact
          that their inadequacy was always felt. It is generally admitted that
          the word "person" is but an imperfect expression of the idea. In
          common parlance it denotes a separate rational and moral individual,
          possessed of self-consciousness, and conscious of his identity amid
          all changes. Experience teaches that where you have a person, you also
          have a distinct individual essence. Every person is a distinct and
          separate individual, in whom human nature is individualized. But in
          God there are no three individuals alongside of, and separate from,
          one another, but only personal self- distinctions within the Divine
          essence, which is not only generically, but also numerically, one.
          Consequently many preferred to speak of three hypostases in God, three
          different modes, not of manifestation, as Sabellius taught, but of
          existence or subsistence. Thus Calvin says: "By person, then, I mean a
          subsistence in the Divine essence. â€” a subsistence which, while
          related to the other two, is distinguished from them by incommunicable
          properties."41 This is perfectly permissible and may ward off
          misunderstanding, but should not cause us to lose sight of the fact
          that the self-distinctions in the Divine Being imply an "I" and "Thou"
          and "He," in the Being of God, which assume personal relations to one
          another. Mat_3:16; Mat_4:1; Joh_1:18; Joh_3:16; Joh_5:20-22;
          Joh_14:26; Joh_15:26; Joh_16:13-15.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The whole undivided essence of God belongs equally to each of the
          three persons. This means that the divine essence is not divided among
          the three persons, but is wholly with all its perfection in each one
          of the persons, so that they have a numerical unity of essence. The
          divine nature is distinguished from the human nature in that it can
          subsist wholly and indivisibly in more than one person. While three
          persons among men have only a specific unity of nature or essence,
          that is, share in the same kind of nature or essence, the persons in
          the Godhead have a numerical unity of essence, that is, possess the
          identical essence. Human nature or essence may be regarded as a
          species, of which each man has an individual part, so that there is a
          specific (from species) unity; but the divine nature is indivisible
          and therefore identical in the persons of the Godhead. It is
          numerically one and the same, and therefore the unity of the essence
          in the persons is a numerical unity. From this it follows that the
          divine essence is not an independent existence alongside of the three
          persons. It has no existence outside of and apart from the three
          persons. If it did, there would be no true unity, but a division that
          would lead into tetratheism. The personal distinction is one within
          the divine essence. This has, as it is usually termed, three modes of
          subsistence. Another conclusion which follows from the preceding, is
          that there can be no subordination as to essential being of the one
          person of the Godhead to the other, and therefore no difference in
          personal dignity. This must be maintained over against the
          subordinationism of Origen and other early Church Fathers, and the
          Arminians, and of Clarke and other Anglican theologians. The only
          subordination of which we can speak, is a subordination in respect to
          order and relationship. It is especially when we reflect on the
          relation of the three persons to the divine essence that all analogies
          fail us and we become deeply conscious of the fact that the Trinity is
          a mystery far beyond our comprehension. It is the incomprehensible
          glory of the Godhead. Just as human nature is too rich and too full to
          be embodied in a single individual, and comes to its adequate
          expression only in humanity as a whole so the divine Being unfolds
          itself in its fulness only in its three fold subsistence of Father,
          Son, and Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. The subsistence and operation of the three persons in the divine
          Being is marked by a certain definite order. There is a certain order
          in the ontological Trinity. In personal subsistence the Father is
          first, the Son second, and the Holy Spirit third. It need hardly be
          said that this order does not pertain to any priority of time or of
          essential dignity, but only to the logical order of derivation. The
          Father is neither begotten by, nor proceeds from any other person; the
          Son is eternally begotten of the Father, and the Spirit proceeds from
          the Father and the Son from all eternity. Generation and procession
          take place within the Divine Being, and imply a certain subordination
          as to the manner of personal subsistence, but no subordination as far
          as the possession of the divine essence is concerned. This ontological
          Trinity and its inherent order is the metaphysical basis of the
          economical Trinity. It is but natural, therefore, that the order
          existing in the essential Trinity should be reflected in the opera ad
          extra that are more particularly ascribed to each one of the persons.
          Scripture clearly indicates this order in the so-called praepositiones
          distinctionales, ek, dia, and en, which are used in expressing the
          idea that all things are out of the Father, through the Son, and in
          the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. There are certain personal attributes by which the three persons
          are distinguished. These are also called opera ad intra, because they
          are works within the Divine Being, which do not terminate on the
          creature. They are personal operations, which are not performed by the
          three persons jointly and which are incommunicable. Generation is an
          act of the Father only; filiation belongs to the Son exclusively; and
          procession can only be ascribed to the Holy Spirit. As opera ad intra
          these works are distinguished from the opera ad extra,or those
          activities and effects by which the Trinity is manifested outwardly.
          These are never works of one person exclusively, but always works of
          the Divine Being as a whole. At the same time it is true that in the
          economical order of God's works some of the opera ad extra are
          ascribed more particularly to one person, and some more especially to
          another. Though they are all works of the three persons jointly,
          creation is ascribed primarily to the Father, redemption to the Son,
          and sanctification to the Holy Spirit. This order in the divine
          operations points back to the essential order in God and forms the
          basis for what is generally known as the economic Trinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          f. The Church confesses the Trinity to be a mystery beyond the
          comprehension of man. The Trinity is a mystery, not merely in the
          Biblical sense that it is a truth, which was formerly hidden but is
          now revealed; but in the sense that man cannot comprehend it and make
          it intelligible. It is intelligible in some of its relations and modes
          of manifestation, but unintelligible in its essential nature. The many
          efforts that were made to explain the mystery were speculative rather
          than theological. They invariably resulted in the development of
          tritheistic or modalistic conceptions of God, in the denial of either
          the unity of the divine essence or the reality of the personal
          distinctions within the essence. The real difficulty lies in the
          relation in which the persons in the Godhead stand to the divine
          essence and to one another; and this is a difficulty which the Church
          cannot remove, but only try to reduce to its proper proportion by a
          proper definition of terms. It has never tried to explain the mystery
          of the Trinity, but only sought to formulate the doctrine of the
          Trinity in such a manner that the errors which endangered it were
          warded off.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. VARIOUS ANALOGIES SUGGESTED TO SHED LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT. From the
          very earliest time of the Christian era attempts were made to shed
          light on the trinitarian Being of God, on the trinity in unity and the
          unity in trinity, by analogies drawn from several sources. While these
          are all defective, it cannot be denied that they were of some value in
          the trinitarian discussion. This applies particularly to those derived
          from the constitutional nature, or from the psychology, of man. In
          view of the fact that man was created in the image of God, it is but
          natural to assume that, if there are some traces of the trinitarian
          life in the creature, the clearest of these will be found in man.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Some of these illustrations or analogies were taken from inanimate
          nature or from plant life, as the water of the fountain, the creek,
          and the river, or of the rising mist, the cloud, and the rain, or in
          the form of rain, snow, and ice; and as the tree with its root, trunk,
          and branches. These and all similar illustrations are very defective.
          The idea of personality is, of course, entirely wanting; and while
          they do furnish examples of a common nature or substance, they are not
          examples of a common essence which is present, not merely in part, but
          in its entirety, in each of its constituent parts or forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Others of greater importance were drawn from the life of man,
          particularly from the constitution and the processes of the human
          mind. These were considered to be of special significance, because man
          is the image-bearer of God. To this class belong the psychological
          unity of the intellect, the affections, and the will (Augustine); the
          logical unity of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis (Hegel); and the
          metaphysical unity of subject, object, and subject-object (Olshausen,
          Shedd). In all of these we do have a certain trinity in unity, but no
          tri-personality in unity of substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Attention has also been called to the nature of love, which
          presupposes a subject and an object, and calls for the union of these
          two, so that, when love has its perfect work, three elements are
          included. But it is easy to see that this analogy is faulty, since it
          co-ordinates two persons and a relationship. It does not illustrate a
          tri-personality at all. Moreover, it only refers to a quality and not
          at all to a substance possessed in common by the subject and the
          object.
        </p>
        <p>C.THE THREE PERSONS CONSIDERED SEPARATELY</p>
        <p>1. THE FATHER OR THE FIRST PERSON IN THE TRINITY.</p>
        <p>
          a. The name "Father" as applied to God. This name is not always used
          of God in the same sense in Scripture. (1) Sometimes it is applied to
          the Triune God as the origin of all created things, 1Co_8:6; Eph_3:15;
          Heb_12:9; Jas_1:17. While in these cases the name applies to the
          triune God, it does refer more particularly to the first person, to
          whom the work of creation is more especially ascribed in Scripture.
          (2) The name is also ascribed to the triune God to express the
          theocratic relation in which He stands to Israel as His Old Testament
          people, Deu_32:6; Isa_63:16; Isa_64:8; Jer_3:4; Mal_1:6; Mal_2:10; (3)
          In the New Testament the name is generally used to designate the
          triune God as the Father in an ethical sense of all His spiritual
          children, Mat_5:45; Mat_6:6-15; Rom_8:16; 1Jn_3:1. (4) In an entirely
          different sense, however, the name is applied to the first person of
          the Trinity in His relation to the second person, Joh_1:14; Joh_1:18;
          Joh_5:17-26; Joh_8:54; Joh_14:12-13. The first person is the Father of
          the second in a metaphysical sense. This is the original fatherhood of
          God, of which all earthly fatherhood is but a faint reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The distinctive property of the Father. The personal property of
          the Father is, negatively speaking, that He is not begotten or
          unbegotten, and positively speaking, the generation of the Son and the
          spiration of the Holy Spirit. It is true that spiration is also a work
          of the Son, but in Him it is not combined with generation. Strictly
          speaking, the only work that is peculiar to the Father exclusively is
          that of active generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          c.The opera ad extra ascribed more particularly to the Father. All the
          opera ad extra of God are works of the triune God, but in some of
          these works the Father is evidently in the foreground, such as: (1)
          Designing the work of redemption, including election, of which the Son
          was Himself an object, Psa_2:7-9; Psa_40:6-9; Isa_53:10; Mat_12:32;
          Eph_1:3-6. (2) The works of creation and providence, especially in
          their initial stages, 1Co_8:6; Eph_2:9. (3) The work of representing
          the Trinity in the Counsel of Redemption, as the holy and righteous
          Being, whose right was violated, Psa_2:7-9; Psa_40:6-9; Joh_6:37-38;
          Joh_17:4-7.
        </p>
        <p>2. THE SON OR THE SECOND PERSON IN THE TRINITY.</p>
        <p>
          a. The name "Son" as applied to the second person. The second person
          in the Trinity is called "Son" or "Son of God" in more than one sense
          of the word. (1) In a metaphysical sense. This must be maintained over
          against Socinians and Unitarians, who reject the idea of a
          tri-personal Godhead, see in Jesus a mere man, and regard the name
          "Son of God" as applied to Him primarily as an honorary title
          conferred upon Him. It is quite evident that Jesus Christ is
          represented as the Son of God in Scripture, irrespective of His
          position and work as Mediator. (a) He is spoken of as the Son of God
          from a pre- incarnation standpoint, for instance in Joh_1:14;
          Joh_1:18; Gal_4:4. (b) He is called the "only-begotten" Son of God or
          of the Father, a term that would not apply to Him, if He were the Son
          of God only in an official or in an ethical sense, Joh_1:14; Joh_1:18;
          Joh_3:16; Joh_3:18; 1Jn_4:9. Compare 2Sa_7:14; Job_2:1; Psa_2:7;
          Luk_3:38; Joh_1:12. (c) In some passages it is abundantly evident from
          the context that the name is indicative of the deity of Christ,
          Joh_5:18-25; Heb_1:1-14. (d) While Jesus teaches His disciples to
          speak of God, and to address Him as "our Father," He Himself speaks of
          Him, and addresses Him, simply as "Father" or "my Father," and thereby
          shows that He was conscious of a unique relationship to the Father,
          Mat_6:9; Mat_7:21; Joh_20:17. (e) According to Mat_11:27, Jesus as the
          Son of God claims a unique knowledge of God, a knowledge such as no
          one else can possess. (f) The Jews certainly understood Jesus to claim
          that He was the Son of God in a metaphysical sense, for they regarded
          the manner in which He spoke of Himself as the Son of God as
          blasphemy, Mat_26:63; Joh_5:18; Joh_10:36. â€”â€” (2) In an official
          or Messianic sense. In some passages this meaning of the name is
          combined with the one previously mentioned. The following passages
          apply the name "Son of God" to Christ as Mediator, Mat_8:29; Mat_26:63
          (where this meaning is combined with the other); Mat_27:40; Joh_1:49;
          Joh_11:27. This Messiah-Sonship is, of course, related to the original
          Sonship of Christ. It was only because He was the essential and
          eternal Son of God, that He could be called the Son of God as Messiah.
          Moreover, the Messiah-Sonship reflects the eternal Sonship of Christ.
          It is from the point of view of this Messiah-Sonship that God is even
          called the God of the Son, 2Co_11:31; Eph_1:3, and is sometimes
          mentioned as God in distinction from the Lord, Joh_17:3; 1Co_8:6;
          Eph_4:5-6. â€”â€” (3) In a nativistic sense. The name "Son of God" is
          given to Jesus also in view of the fact that He owed His birth to the
          paternity of God. He was begotten, according to His human nature, by
          the supernatural operation of the Holy Spirit, and is in that sense
          the Son of God. This is clearly indicated in Luk_1:32; Luk_1:35, and
          may probably be inferred also from Joh_1:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The personal subsistence of the Son. The personal subsistence of
          the Son must be maintained over against all Modalists, who in one way
          or another deny the personal distinctions in the Godhead. The
          personality of the Son may be substantiated as follows: (1) The way in
          which the Bible speaks of the Father and the Son alongside of each
          other implies that the one is just as personal as the other, and is
          also indicative of a personal relationship existing between the two.
          (2) The use of the appelatives "only-begotten" and "firstborn" imply
          that the relation between the Father and the Son, while unique, can
          nevertheless be represented approximately as one of generation and
          birth. The name "firstborn" is found in Col_1:15; Heb_1:6, and
          emphasizes the fact of the eternal generation of the Son. It simply
          means that He was before all creation. (3) The distinctive use of the
          term "Logos" in Scripture points in the same direction. This term is
          applied to the Son, not in the first place to express His relation to
          the world (which is quite secondary), but to indicate the intimate
          relation in which He stands to the Father, the relation like that of a
          word to the speaker. In distinction from philosophy, the Bible
          represents the Logos as personal and identifies Him with the Son of
          God, Joh_1:1-14; 1Jn_1:1-3. (4) The description of the Son as the
          image, or even as the very image of God in 2Co_4:4; Col_1:15; Heb_1:3.
          God clearly stands out in Scripture as a personal Being. If the Son of
          God is the very image of God, He too must be a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The eternal generation of the Son. The personal property of the Son
          is that He is eternally begotten of the Father (briefly called
          "filiation"), and shares with the Father in the spiration of the
          Spirit. The doctrine of the generation of the Son is suggested by the
          Biblical representation of the first and second persons of the Trinity
          as standing in the relation of Father and Son to each other. Not only
          do the names "Father" and "Son" suggest the generation of the latter
          by the former, but the Son is also repeatedly called "the
          only-begotten," Joh_1:14; Joh_1:18; Joh_3:16; Joh_3:18; Heb_11:17;
          1Jn_4:9. Several particulars deserve emphasis in connection with the
          generation of the Son: (1) It is a neceesary act of God. Origen, one
          of the very first to speak of the generation of the Son, regarded it
          as an act dependent on the Father's will and therefore free. Others at
          various times expressed the same opinion. But it was clearly seen by
          Athanasius and others that a generation dependent on the optional will
          of the Father would make the existence of the Son contingent and thus
          rob Him of His deity. Then the Son would not be equal to and
          homoousios with the Father, for the Father exists necessarily, and
          cannot be conceived of as non-existent. The generation of the Son must
          be regarded as a necessary and perfectly natural act of God. This does
          not mean that it is not related to the Father's will in any sense of
          the word. It is an act of the Father's necessary will, which merely
          means that His concomitant will takes perfect delight in it. (2) It is
          an eternal act of the Father. This naturally follows from the
          preceding. If the generation of the Son is a necessary act of the
          Father, so that it is impossible to conceive of Him as not generating,
          it naturally shares in the eternity of the Father. This does not mean,
          however, that it is an act that was completed in the far distant past,
          but rather that it is a timeless act, the act of an eternal present,
          an act always continuing and yet ever completed. Its eternity follows
          not only from the eternity of God, but also from the divine
          immutability and from the true deity of the Son. In addition to this
          it can be inferred from all those passages of Scripture which teach
          either the pre-existence of the Son or His equality with the Father,
          Mic_5:2; Joh_1:18; Joh_3:16; Joh_5:17-18; Joh_5:30; Joh_5:36;
          Act_13:33; Joh_17:5; Col_1:16; Heb_1:3. The statement of Psa_2:7,
          "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee," is generally quoted
          to prove the generation of the Son, but, according to some, with
          rather doubtful propriety, cf. Act_13:33; Heb_1:5. They surmise that
          these words refer to the raising up of Jesus as Messianic King, and to
          the recognition of Him as Son of God in an official sense, and should
          probably be linked up with the promise found in 2Sa_7:14, just as they
          are in Heb_1:5. (3) It is a generation of the personal subsistence
          rather than of the divine essence of the Son. Some have spoken as if
          the Father generated the essence of the Son, but this is equivalent to
          saying that He generated His own essence, for the essence of both the
          Father and the Son is exactly the same. It is better to say that the
          Father generates the personal subsistence of the Son, but thereby also
          communicates to Him the divine essence in its entirety. But in doing
          this we should guard against the idea that the Father first generated
          a second person, and then communicated the divine essence to this
          person, for that would lead to the conclusion that the Son was not
          generated out of the divine essence, but created out of nothing. In
          the work of generation there was a communication of essence; it was
          one indivisible act. And in virtue of this communication the Son also
          has life in Himself. This is in agreement with the statement of Jesus,
          "For as the Father hath life in Himself, even so gave He to the Son
          also to have -life in Himself," Joh_5:26. (4) It is a generation that
          must be conceived of as spiritual and divine. In opposition to the
          Arians, who insisted that the generation of the Son necessarily
          implied separation or division in the divine Being, the Church Fathers
          stressed the fact that this generation must not be conceived in a
          physical and creaturely way, but should be regarded as spiritual and
          divine, excluding all idea of division or change. It brings distinctio
          and distributio, but no diversitas and divisio in the divine Being.
          (Bavinck) The most striking analogy of it is found in man's thinking
          and speaking, and the Bible itself seems to point to this, when it
          speaks of the Son as the Logos. (5) The following definition may be
          given of the generation of the Son: It is that eternal and necessary
          act of the first person in the Trinity, whereby He, within the divine
          Being, is the ground of a second personal subsistence like His own,
          and puts this second person in possession of the whole divine essence,
          without any division, alienation, or change.

          d. The deity of the Son. The deity of the Son was denied in the early
          Church by the Ebionites and the Alogi, and also by the dynamic
          Monarchians and the Arians. In the days of the Reformation the
          Socinians followed their example, and spoke of Jesus as a mere man.
          The same position is taken by Schleiermacher and Ritschl, by a host of
          liberal scholars, particularly in Germany, by the Unitarians, and by
          the Modernists and Humanists of the present day. This denial is
          possible only for those who disregard the teachings of Scripture, for
          the Bible contains an abundance of evidence for the deity of Christ.42
          We find that Scripture (1) explicitly asserts the deity of the Son in
          such passages as Joh_1:1; Joh_20:28; Rom_9:5; Php_2:6; Tit_2:13;
          1Jn_5:20; (2) applies divine names to Him, Isa_9:6; Isa_40:3;
          Jer_23:5-6; Joe_2:32 (comp. Act_2:21); 1Ti_3:16; (3) ascribes to Him
          divine attributes, such as eternal existence, Isa_9:6; Joh_1:1-2;
          Rev_1:8; Rev_22:13, omnipresence, Mat_18:20; Mat_28:20; Joh_3:13,
          omniscience, Joh_2:24-25; Joh_21:17; Rev_2:23, omnipotence. Isa_9:6;
          Php_3:21; Rev_1:8, immutability, Heb_1:10-12; Heb_13:8, and in general
          every attribute belonging to the Father, Col_2:9; (4)speaks of Him as
          doing divine works, as creation, Joh_1:3; Joh_1:10; Col_1:16; Heb_1:2;
          Heb_1:10, providence, Luk_10:22; Joh_3:35; Eph_1:22; Col_1:17;
          Heb_1:3, the forgiveness of sins, Mat_9:2-7; Mar_2:7-10; Col_3:13,
          resurrection and judgment, Mat_25:31-32; Joh_5:19-29; Act_10:42;
          Act_17:31; Php_3:21; 2Ti_4:1, the final dissolution and renewal of all
          things, Heb_1:10-12; Php_3:21; Rev_21:5, and (5) accords Him divine
          honour, Joh_5:22-23; Joh_14:1; 1Co_15:19; 2Co_13:13; Heb_1:6;
          Mat_28:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. The place of the Son in the economic Trinity. It should be noted
          that the order of existence in the essential or ontological Trinity is
          reflected in the economic Trinity. The Son occupies the second place
          in the opera ad extra. If all things are out of the Father, they are
          through the Son, 1Co_8:6. If the former is represented as the absolute
          cause of all things, the latter stands out clearly as the mediating
          cause. This applies in the natural sphere, where all things are
          created and maintained through the Son, Joh_1:3; Joh_1:10; Heb_1:2-3.
          He is the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world,
          Joh_1:9. It applies also to the work of redemption. In the Counsel of
          Redemption He takes upon Himself to be Surety for His people, and to
          execute the Father's plan of redemption, Psa_40:7-8. He works this out
          more particularly in His incarnation, sufferings, and death,
          Eph_1:3-14. In connection with His function the attributes of wisdom
          and power, 1Co_1:24; Heb_1:3, and of mercy and grace, are especially
          ascribed to Him, 2Co_13:13; Eph_5:2; Eph_5:25.
        </p>
        <p>3. THE HOLY SPIRIT OR THE THIRD PERSON IN THE TRINITY.</p>
        <p>
          a. The name applied to the third person of the Trinity. While we are
          told in Joh_4:24 that God is Spirit, the name is applied more
          particularly to the third person in the Trinity. The Hebrew term by
          which He is designated is ruach, and the Greek pneuma, both of which
          are, like the Latin spiritus derived from roots which mean "to
          breathe." Hence they can also be rendered "breath," Gen_2:7; Gen_6:17;
          Eze_37:5-6, or "wind," Gen_8:1; 1Ki_19:11; Joh_3:8. The Old Testament
          generally uses the term "spirit" without any qualification, or speaks
          of "the Spirit of God" or "the Spirit of the Lord," and employs the
          term "Holy Spirit" only in Psa_51:11; Isa_63:10-11, while in the New
          Testament this has become a far more common designation of the third
          person in the Trinity. It is a striking fact that, while the Old
          Testament repeatedly calls God "the Holy One of Israel," Psa_71:22;
          Psa_89:18; Isa_10:20; Isa_41:14; Isa_43:3; Isa_48:17, the New
          Testament seldom applies the adjective "holy" to God in general, but
          uses it frequently to characterize the Spirit. This is in all
          probability due to the fact that it was especially in the Spirit and
          His sanctifying work that God revealed Himself as the Holy One. It is
          the Holy Spirit that takes up His abode in the hearts of believers,
          that separates them unto God, and that cleanses them from sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The personality of the Holy Spirit. The terms "Spirit of God" or
          "Holy Spirit" do not suggest personality as much as the term "Son"
          does. Moreover, the person of the Holy Spirit did not appear in a
          clearly discernible personal form among men, as the person of the Son
          of God did. As a result the personality of the Holy Spirit was often
          called in question, and therefore deserves special attention. The
          personality of the Spirit was denied in the early Church by the
          Monarchians and the Pneumatomachians. In this denial they were
          followed by the Socinians in the days of the Reformation. Still later
          Schleiermacher, Ritschl, the Unitarians, present-day Modernists, and
          all modern Sabellians reject the personality of the Holy Spirit. It is
          often said in the present day that those passages which seem to imply
          the personality of the Holy Spirit simply contain personifications.
          But personifications are certainly rare in the prose writings of the
          New Testament and can easily be recognized. Moreover, such an
          explanation clearly destroys the sense of some of these passages, e.g.
          Joh_14:26; Joh_16:7-11; Rom_8:26. Scripture proof for the personality
          of the Holy Spirit is quite sufficient: (1) Designations that are
          proper to personality are given to Him. Though pneuma is neuter, yet
          the masculine pronoun ekeinos is used of the Spirit in Joh_16:14; and
          in Eph_1:14 some of the best authorities have the masculine relative
          pronoun hos. Moreover, the name Parakletos is applied to Him,
          Joh_14:26; Joh_15:26; Joh_16:7, which cannot be translated by
          "comfort," or be regarded as the name of any abstract influence. That
          a person is meant is indicated by the fact that the Holy Spirit as
          Comforter is placed in juxtaposition with Christ as the Comforter
          about to depart, to whom the same term is applied in 1Jn_2:1. It is
          true that this term is followed by the neuters ho and auto in
          Joh_14:16-18, but this is due to the fact that pneuma intervenes. (2)
          The characteristics of a person are ascribed to Him, such as
          intelligence, Joh_14:26; Joh_15:26; Rom_8:16, will, Act_16:7;
          1Co_12:11, and affections, Isa_63:10; Eph_4:30. Moreover, He performs
          acts proper to personality. He searches, speaks, testifies, commands,
          reveals, strives, creates, makes intercession, raises the dead, etc.,
          Gen_1:2; Gen_6:3; Luk_12:12; Joh_14:26; Joh_15:26; Joh_16:8; Act_8:29;
          Act_13:2; Rom_8:11; 1Co_2:10-11. What does all these things cannot be
          a mere power or influence, but must be a person. (3) He is represented
          as standing in such relations to other persons as imply His own
          personality. He is placed in juxtaposition with the apostles in
          Act_15:28, with Christ in Joh_16:14, and with the Father and the Son
          in Mat_28:19; 2Co_13:13; 1Pe_1:1-2; Jud_1:20-21. Sound exegesis
          requires that in these passages the Holy Spirit be regarded as a
          -person. (4) There are also passages in which the Holy Spirit is
          distinguished from His own power, Luk_1:35; Luk_4:14; Act_10:38;
          Rom_15:13; 1Co_2:4. Such passages would become tautological,
          meaningless, and even absurd, if they were interpreted on the
          principle that the Holy Spirit is merely a power. This can be shown by
          substituting for the name "Holy Spirit" such a word as "power" or
          "influence."
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The relation of the Holy Spirit to the other persons in the
          trinity. The early trinitarian controversies led to the conclusion
          that the Holy Spirit, as well as the Son, is of the same essence as
          the Father, and is therefore consubstantial with Him. And the long
          drawn dispute about the question, whether the Holy Spirit proceeded
          from the Father alone or also from the Son, was finally settled by the
          Synod of Toledo in 589 by adding the word "Filioque" to the Latin
          version of the Constantinopolitan Creed: " Credimus in Spiritum
          Sanctum qui a Patre Filioque procedit " ("We believe in the Holy
          Spirit, who proceeds from the Father and the Son"). This procession of
          the Holy Spirit, briefly called spiration, is his personal property.
          Much of what was said respecting the generation of the Son also
          applies to the spiration of the Holy Spirit, and need not be repeated.
          The following points of distinction between the two may be noted,
          however: (1) Generation is the work of the Father only; spiration is
          the work of both the Father and the Son. (2) By generation the Son is
          enabled to take part in the work of spiration, but the Holy Spirit
          acquires no such power. (3) In logical order generation precedes
          spiration. It should be remembered, however, that all this implies no
          essential subordination of the Holy Spirit to the Son. In spiration as
          well as in generation there is a communication of the whole of the
          divine essence, so that the Holy Spirit is on an equality with the
          Father and the Son. The doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit
          from the Father and the Son is based on Joh_15:26, and on the fact
          that the Spirit is also called the Spirit of Christ and of the Son,
          Rom_8:9; Gal_4:6, and is sent by Christ into the world. Spiration may
          be defined as that eternal and necessary act of the first and second
          persons in the Trinity whereby they, within the divine Being, become
          the ground of the personal subsistence of the Holy Spirit, and put the
          third person in possession of the whole divine essence, without any
          division, alienation or change.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Holy Spirit stands in the closest possible relation to the other
          persons. In virtue of His procession from the Father and the Son the
          Spirit is represented as standing in the closest possible relation to
          both of the other persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 1Co_2:10-11, we may infer, not that the Spirit is the same as the
          self- consciousness of God, but that He is as closely connected with
          God the Father as the soul of man is with man. In 2Co_3:17, we read,
          "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
          there is liberty." Here the Lord (Christ) is identified with the
          Spirit, not with respect to personality, but as to manner of working.
          In the same passage the Spirit is called "the Spirit of the Lord." The
          work for which the Holy Spirit was sent into the Church on the day of
          Pentecost was based on His unity with the Father and the Son. He came
          as the Parakletos to take the place of Christ and to do His work on
          earth, that is, to teach, proclaim, testify, bear witness, etc., as
          the Son had done. Now in the case of the Son this revelational work
          rested on His unity with the Father. Just so the work of the Spirit is
          based on His unity with the Father and the Son, Joh_16:14-15. Notice
          the words of Jesus in this passage: "He shall glorify me; for He shall
          take of mine, and shall declare it unto you. All things whatsoever the
          Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that He taketh of mine, and
          shall declare it unto you."
        </p>
        <p>
          d. The deity of the Holy Spirit. The deity of the Holy Spirit may be
          established from Scripture by a line of proof quite similar to that
          employed in connection with the Son: (1) Divine names are given to
          Him, Exo_17:7 (comp. Heb_3:7-9); Act_5:3-4; Act_5:3-4; 1Co_3:16;
          2Ti_3:16 (comp. 2Pe_1:21). (2) Divine perfections are ascribed to Him,
          such as omnipresence, Psa_139:7-10, omniscience, Isa_40:13-14 (comp.
          Rom_11:34); 1Co_2:10-11, omnipotence, 1Co_12:11; Rom_15:19, and
          eternity, Heb_9:14 (?). (3) Divine works are performed by Him, such as
          creation, Gen_1:2; Job_26:13; Job_33:4, providential renovation,
          Psa_104:30, regeneration, Joh_3:5-6; Tit_3:5, and the resurrection of
          the dead, Rom_8:11. (4) Divine honour is also paid to Him, Mat_28:19;
          Rom_9:1; 2Co_13:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. The work of the Holy Spirit in the divine economy. There are
          certain works which are more particularly ascribed to the Holy Spirit,
          not only in the general economy of God, but also in the special
          economy of redemption. In general it may be said that it is the
          special task of the Holy Spirit to bring things to completion by
          acting immediately upon and in the creature. Just as He Himself is the
          person who completes the Trinity, so His work is the completion of
          God's contact with His creatures and the consummation of the work of
          God in every sphere. It follows the work of the Son, just as the work
          of the Son follows that of the Father. It is important to bear this in
          mind, for if the work of the Holy Spirit is divorced from the
          objective work of the Son, false mysticism is bound to result. The
          work of the Holy Spirit includes the following in the natural sphere:
          (1) The generation of life. As being is out of the Father, and thought
          through the Son, so life is mediated by the Spirit, Gen_1:3;
          Job_26:13; Psa_33:6 (?); Psa_104:30. In that respect He puts the
          finishing touch to the work of creation. (2) The general inspiration
          and qualification of men. The Holy Spirit inspires and qualifies men
          for their official tasks, for work in science and art, etc., Exo_28:3;
          Exo_31:2-3; Exo_31:6; Exo_35:35; 1Sa_11:6; 1Sa_16:13-14. Of even
          greater importance is the work of the Holy Spirit in the sphere of
          redemption. Here the following points may be mentioned: (1) The
          preparation and qualification of Christ for His mediatorial work. He
          prepared Christ a body and thus enabled Him to become a sacrifice for
          sin, Luk_1:35; Heb_10:5-7. In the words "a body thou didst prepare for
          me," the writer of Hebrews follows the Septuagint. The meaning is:
          Thou hast enabled me by the preparation of a holy body to become a
          real sacrifice. At His baptism Christ was anointed with the Holy
          Spirit, Luk_3:22, and received the qualifying gifts of the Holy Spirit
          without measure, Joh_3:24. (2) The inspiration of Scripture. The Holy
          Spirit inspired Scripture, and thus brought to men the special
          revelation of God, 1Co_2:13; 2Pe_1:21, the knowledge of the work of
          redemption which is in Christ Jesus. (3) The formation and
          augmentation of the Church. The Holy Spirit forms and increases the
          Church, the mystical body of Jesus Christ, by regeneration and
          sanctification, and dwells in it as the principle of the new life,
          Eph_1:22-23; Eph_2:22; 1Co_3:16; 1Co_12:4 ff. (4) Teaching and guiding
          the Church. The Holy Spirit testifies to Christ and leads the Church
          in all the truth. By doing this He manifests the glory of God and of
          Christ, increases the knowledge of the Saviour, keeps the Church from
          error, and prepares her for her eternal destiny, Joh_14:26; Joh_15:26;
          Joh_16:13-14; Act_5:32; Heb_10:15; 1Jn_2:27.

        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY. Does pagan literature contain any
          analogies of the doctrine of the Trinity? Does the development of the
          doctrine of the Trinity start from the ontological or from the
          economical Trinity? Can the economical Trinity be understood apart
          from the ontological? Why is the doctrine of the Trinity discussed by
          some as introductory to the doctrine of redemption? What is the
          Hegelian conception of the Trinity? How did Swedenborg conceive of it?
          Where do we find Sabellianism in modern theology? Why is it
          objectionable to hold that the Trinity is purely economical? What
          objections are there to the modern Humanitarian conception of the
          Trinity? Why does Barth treat of the Trinity in the Prolegomena to
          theology? What is the practical significance of the doctrine of the
          Trinity?
