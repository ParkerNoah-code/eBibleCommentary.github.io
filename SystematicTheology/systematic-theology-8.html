        <p>I. The Divine Decrees in General</p>
        <p>THE DOCTRINE OF THE DECREES IN THEOLOGY</p>
        <p>
          Reformed theology stresses the sovereignty of God in virtue of which
          He has sovereignly determined from all eternity whatsoever will come
          to pass, and works His sovereign will in His entire creation, both
          natural and spiritual, according to His pre- determined plan. It is in
          full agreement with Paul when he says that God "worketh all things
          after the counsel of His will," Eph_1:11. For that reason it is but
          natural that, in passing from the discussion of the Being of God to
          that of the works of God, it should begin with a study of the divine
          decrees. This is the only proper theological method. A theological
          discussion of the works of God should take its starting point in God,
          both in the work of creation and in that of redemption or recreation.
          It is only as issuing from, and as related to, God that the works of
          God come into consideration as a part of theology.
        </p>
        <p>
          In spite of this fact, however, Reformed theology stands practically
          alone in its emphasis on the doctrine of the decrees. Lutheran
          theology is less theological and more anthropological. It does not
          consistently take its starting point in God and consider all things as
          divinely pre-determined, but reveals a tendency to consider things
          from below rather than from above. And in so far as it does believe in
          pre-determination, it is inclined to limit this to the good that is in
          the world, and more particularly to the blessings of salvation. It is
          a striking fact that many Lutheran theologians are silent, or all but
          silent, respecting the doctrine of the decrees of God in general and
          discuss only the doctrine of pre-destination, and regard this as
          conditional rather than absolute. In the doctrine of predestination
          Lutheran theology shows strong affinity with Arminianism. Krauth (an
          influential leader of the Lutheran Church in our country) even says:
          "The views of Arminius himself, in regard to the five points, were
          formed under Lutheran influences, and do not differ essentially from
          those of the Lutheran Church; but on many points in the developed
          system now known as Arminianism, the Lutheran Church has no affinity
          whatever with it, and on these points would sympathize far more with
          Calvinism, though she has never believed that in order to escape from
          Pelagianism, it is necessary to run into the doctrine of absolute
          predestination. The 'Formula of Concord' touches the five points
          almost purely on their practical sides, and on them arrays itself
          against Calvinism, rather by the negation of the inferences which
          result logically from that system, than by express condemnation of its
          fundamental theory in its abstract form."43 In so far as Lutheran
          theologians include the doctrine of predestination in their system,
          they generally consider it in connection with Soteriology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, Arminian theology does not place the doctrine of the
          decrees in the foreground. That of the decrees in general is usually
          conspicuous by its absence. Pope brings in the doctrine of
          predestination only in passing, and Miley introduces it as an issue
          for discussion. Raymond discusses only the doctrine of election, and
          Watson devotes considerable space to this in considering the extent of
          the atonement. One and all reject the doctrine of absolute
          predestination, and substitute for it a conditional predestination.
          Modern liberal theology does not concern itself with the doctrine of
          predestination, since it is fundamentally anthropological. In the
          "theology of crisis" it is again recognized, but in a form that is
          neither Scriptural nor historical. In spite of its appeal to the
          Reformers, it departs widely from the doctrine of predestination, as
          it was taught by Luther and Calvin.
        </p>
        <p>B. SCRIPTURAL NAMES FOR THE DIVINE DECREES</p>
        <p>
          From the purely immanent works of God (opera ad intra) we must
          distinguish those which bear directly on the creatures (opera ad
          extra). Some theologians, in order to avoid misunderstanding, prefer
          to speak of opera immanentia and opera exeuntia, and subdivide the
          former into two classes, opera immanentia per se, which are the opera
          personalia (generation, filiation, spiration), and opera immanentia
          donec exeunt, which are opera essentialia, that is, works of the
          triune God, in distinction from works of any one of the persons of the
          Godhead, but are immanent in God, until they are realized in the works
          of creation, providence, and redemption. The divine decrees constitute
          this class of divine works. They are not described in the abstract in
          Scripture, but are placed before us in their historical realization.
          Scripture uses several terms for the eternal decree of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. OLD TESTAMENT TERMS. There are some terms which stress the
          intellectual element in the decree, such as 'etsah from ya'ats, to
          counsel, to give advice, Job_38:2; Isa_14:26; Isa_46:11; sod from
          yasad, to sit together in deliberation (niphal), Jer_23:18; Jer_23:22;
          and mezimmah from zamam, to meditate, to have in mind, to purpose,
          Jer_4:28; Jer_51:12; Pro_30:32. Besides these there are terms which
          emphasize the volitional element, such as chaphets, inclination, will,
          good pleasure, Isa_53:10; and ratson, to please, to be delighted, and
          thus denoting delight, good pleasure, or sovereign will, Psa_51:19;
          Isa_49:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. NEW TESTAMENT TERMS. The New Testament also contains a number of
          significant terms. The most general word is boule designating the
          decree in general, but also pointing to the fact that the purpose of
          God is based on counsel and deliberation, Act_2:23; Act_4:28;
          Heb_6:17. Another rather general word is thelema, which, as applied to
          the counsel of God, stresses the volitional rather than the
          deliberative element, Eph_1:11. The word eudokia emphasizes more
          particularly the freedom of the purpose of God, and the delight with
          which it is accompanied, though this idea is not always present,
          Mat_11:26; Luk_2:14; Eph_1:5; Eph_1:9. Other words are used more
          especially to designate that part of the divine decree that pertains
          in a very special sense to God's moral creatures, and is known as
          predestination. These terms will be considered in connection with the
          discussion of that subject.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE NATURE OF THE DIVINE DECREES</p>
        <p>
          The decree of God may be defined with the Westminster Shorter
          Catechism as " His eternal purpose according to the counsel of His
          will, whereby, for His own glory, He hath foreordained whatsoever
          comes to pass."
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE DIVINE DECREE IS ONE. Though we often speak of the decrees of
          God in the plural, yet in its own nature the divine decree is but a
          single act of God. This is already suggested by the fact that the
          Bible speaks of it as a prothesis, a purpose or counsel. It follows
          also from the very nature of God. His knowledge is all immediate and
          simultaneous rather than successive like ours, and His comprehension
          of it is always complete. And the decree that is founded on it is also
          a single, all-comprehensive, and simultaneous act. As an eternal and
          immutable decree it could not be otherwise. There is, therefore, no
          series of decrees in God, but simply one comprehensive plan, embracing
          all that comes to pass. Our finite comprehension, however, constrains
          us to make distinctions, and this accounts for the fact that we often
          speak of the decrees of God in the plural. This manner of speaking is
          perfectly legitimate, provided we do not lose sight of the unity of
          the divine decree, and of the inseparable connection of the various
          decrees as we conceive of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE RELATION OF THE DECREE TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD. The decree of
          God bears the closest relation to the divine knowledge. There is in
          God, as we have seen, a necessary knowledge, including all possible
          causes and results. This knowledge furnishes the material for the
          decree; it is the perfect fountain out of which God drew the thoughts
          which He desired to objectify. Out of this knowledge of all things
          possible He chose, by an act of His perfect will, led by wise
          considerations, what He wanted to bring to realization, and thus
          formed His eternal purpose. The decree of God is, in turn, the
          foundation of His free knowledge or scientia libera. It is the
          knowledge of things as they are realized in the course of history.
          While the necessary knowledge of God logically precedes the decree,
          His free knowledge logically follows it. This must be maintained over
          against all those who believe in a conditional predestination (such as
          Semi-Pelagians and Arminians), since they make the pre-determinations
          of God dependent on His foreknowledge. Some of the words used to
          denote the divine decree point to an element of deliberation in the
          purpose of God. It would be a mistake, however, to infer from this
          that the plan of God is the result of any deliberation which implies
          short-sightedness or hesitation, for it is simply an indication of the
          fact that there is no blind decree in God, but only an intelligent and
          deliberate purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE DECREE RELATES TO BOTH GOD AND MAN. The decree has reference,
          first of all, to the works of God. It is limited, however, to God's
          opera ad extra or transitive acts, and does not pertain to the
          essential Being of God, nor to the immanent activities within the
          Divine Being which result in the trinitarian distinctions. God did not
          decree to be holy and righteous, nor to exist as three persons in one
          essence or to generate the Son. These things are as they are
          necessarily and are not dependent on the optional will of God. That
          which is essential to the inner Being of God can form no part of the
          contents of the decree. This includes only the opera ad extra or
          exeuntia. But while the decree pertains primarily to the acts of God
          Himself, it is not limited to these, but also embraces the actions of
          His free creatures. And the fact that they are included in the decree
          renders them absolutely certain, though they are not all effectuated
          in the same manner. In the case of some things God decided, not merely
          that they would come to pass, but that He Himself would bring them to
          pass, either immediately, as in the work of creation, or through the
          mediation of secondary causes, which are continually energized by His
          power. He Himself assumes the responsibility for their coming to pass.
          There are other things, however, which God included in His decree and
          thereby rendered certain, but which He did not decide to effectuate
          Himself, as the sinful acts of His rational creatures. The decree, in
          so far as it pertains to these acts, is generally called God's
          permissive decree. This name does not imply that the futurition of
          these acts is not certain to God, but simply that He permits them to
          come to pass by the free agency of His rational creatures. God assumes
          no responsibility for these sinful acts whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE DECREE TO ACT IS NOT THE ACT ITSELF. The decrees are an
          internal manifestation and exercise of the divine attributes,
          rendering the futurition of things certain but this exercise of the
          intelligent volition of God should not be confounded with the
          realization of its objects in creation, providence, and redemption.
          The decree to create is not creation itself, nor is the decree to
          justify justification itself. A distinction must be made between the
          decree and its execution. God's so ordering the universe that man will
          pursue a certain course of action, is also quite a different thing
          from His commanding him to do so. The decrees are not addressed to
          man, and are not of the nature of a statute law; neither do they
          impose compulsion or obligation on the wills of men.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DIVINE DECREE</p>
        <p>
          1. IT IS FOUNDED IN DIVINE WISDOM. The word "counsel," which is one of
          the terms by which the decree is designated, suggests careful
          deliberation and consultation. It may contain a suggestion of an
          intercommunion between the three persons of the Godhead. In speaking
          of God's revelation of the mystery that was formerly hid in Him, Paul
          says that this was "to the intent that now unto the principalities and
          the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the
          Church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose
          which He purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord," Eph_3:10-11. The wisdom
          of the decree also follows from the wisdom displayed in the
          realization of the eternal purpose of God. The poet sings in
          Psa_104:24, "O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast
          thou made them all." The same idea is expressed in Pro_3:19, "Jehovah
          by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding He established the
          heavens." Cf. also Jer_10:12; Jer_51:15. The wisdom of the counsel of
          the Lord can also be inferred from the fact that it stands fast
          forever, Psa_33:11; Pro_19:21. There may be a great deal in the decree
          that passes human understanding and is inexplicable to the finite
          mind, but it contains nothing that is irrational or arbitrary. God
          formed his determination with wise insight and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. IT IS ETERNAL. The divine decree is eternal in the sense that it
          lies entirely in eternity. In a certain sense it can be said that all
          the acts of God are eternal, since there is no succession of moments
          in the Divine Being. But some of them terminate in time, as, for
          instance, creation and justification. Hence we do not call them
          eternal but temporal acts of God. The decree, however, while it
          relates to things outside of God, remains in itself an act within the
          Divine Being, and is therefore eternal in the strictest sense of the
          word. Therefore it also partakes of the simultaneousness and the
          successionlessness of the eternal, Act_1:18; Eph_1:4; 2Ti_1:9. The
          eternity of the decree also implies that the order in which the
          different elements in it stand to each other may not be regarded as
          temporal, but only as logical. There is a real chronological order in
          the events as effectuated, but not in the decree respecting them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. IT IS EFFICACIOUS. This does not mean that God has determined to
          bring to pass Himself by a direct application of His power all things
          which are included in His decree, but only that what He has decreed
          will certainly come to pass; that nothing can thwart His purpose. Says
          Dr. A. A. Hodge: "The decree itself provides in every case that the
          event shall be effected by causes acting in a manner perfectly
          consistent with the nature of the event in question. Thus in the case
          of every free act of a moral agent the decree provides at the same
          time â€” (a) That the agent shall be a free agent. (b) That his
          antecedents and all the antecedents of the act in question shall be
          what they are. (c) That all the present conditions of the act shall be
          what they are. (d) That the act shall be perfectly spontaneous and
          free on the part of the agent. (e) That it shall be certainly future.
          Psa_33:11; Pro_19:21; Isa_46:10."44
        </p>
        <p>
          4. IT IS IMMUTABLE. Man may and often does alter his plans for various
          reasons. It may be that in making his plan he lacked seriousness of
          purpose, that he did not fully realize what the plan involved, or that
          he is wanting the power to carry it out. But in God nothing of the
          kind is conceivable. He is not deficient in knowledge, veracity, or
          power. Therefore He need not change His decree because of a mistake of
          ignorance, nor because of inability to carry it out. And He will not
          change it, because He is the immutable God and because He is faithful
          and true. Job_23:13-14; Psa_33:11; Isa_46:10; Luk_22:22; Act_2:23.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. IT IS UNCONDITIONAL OR ABSOLUTE. This means that it is not
          dependent in any of its particulars on anything that is not part and
          parcel of the decree itself. The various elements in the decree are
          indeed mutually dependent but nothing in the plan is conditioned by
          anything that is not in the decree. The execution of the plan may
          require means or be dependent on certain conditions, but then these
          means or conditions have also been determined in the decree. God did
          not simply decree to save sinners without determining the means to
          effectuate the decree. The means leading to the pre- determined end
          were also decreed, Act_2:23; Eph_2:8; 1Pe_1:2. The absolute character
          of the decree follows from its eternity, its immutability, and its
          exclusive dependence on the good pleasure of God. It is denied by all
          Semi-Pelagians and Arminians.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. IT IS UNIVERSAL OR ALL-COMPREHENSIVE. The decree includes
          whatsoever comes to pass in the world, whether it be in the physical
          or in the moral realm, whether it be good or evil, Eph_1:11. It
          includes: (a) the good actions of men, Eph_2:10; (b) their wicked
          acts, Pro_16:4; Act_2:23; Act_4:27-28; (c) contingent events,
          Gen_45:8; Gen_50:20; Pro_16:33; (d) the means as well as the end,
          Psa_119:89-91; 2Th_2:13; Eph_1:4; (e) the duration of man's life,
          Job_14:5; Psa_39:4, and the place of his habitation, Act_17:26.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. WITH REFERENCE TO SIN IT IS PERMISSIVE. It is customary to speak of
          the decree of God respecting moral evil as permissive. By His decree
          God rendered the sinful actions of man infallibly certain without
          deciding to effectuate them by acting immediately upon and in the
          finite will. This means that God does not positively work in man "both
          to will and to do," when man goes contrary to His revealed will. It
          should be carefully noted, however, that this permissive decree does
          not imply a passive permission of something which is not under the
          control of the divine will. It is a decree which renders the future
          sinful act absolutely certain, but in which God determines (a) not to
          hinder the sinful self-determination of the finite will; and (b) to
          regulate and control the result of this sinful self-determination.
          Psa_78:29; Psa_106:15; Act_14:16; Act_17:30.
        </p>
        <p>E. OBJECTIONS TO THE DOCTRINE OF THE DECREES</p>
        <p>
          As was said in the preceding, only Reformed theology does full justice
          to the doctrine of the decrees. Lutheran theologians do not, as a
          rule, construe it theologically but soteriologically, for the purpose
          of showing how believers can derive comfort from it. Pelagians and
          Socinians reject it as unscriptural; and Semi-Pelagians and Arminians
          show it scant favor: some ignoring it altogether; others stating it
          only to combat it; and still others maintaining only a decree
          conditioned by the foreknowledge of God. The objections raised to it
          are, in the main, always the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. IT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE MORAL FREEDOM OF MAN. Man is a free
          agent with the power of rational self-determination. He can reflect
          upon, and in an intelligent way choose, certain ends, and can also
          determine his action with respect to them. The decree of God however,
          carries with it necessity. God has decreed to effectuate all things
          or, if He has not decreed that, He has at least determined that they
          must come to pass. He has decided the course of man's life for him.45
          In answer to this objection it may be said that the Bible certainly
          does not proceed on the assumption that the divine decree is
          inconsistent with the free agency of man. It clearly reveals that God
          has decreed the free acts of man, but also that the actors are none
          the less free and therefore responsible for their acts, Gen_50:19-20;
          Act_2:23; Act_4:27-28. It was determined that the Jews should bring
          about the crucifixion of Jesus; yet they were perfectly free in their
          wicked course of action, and were held responsible for this crime.
          There is not a single indication in Scripture that the inspired
          writers are conscious of a contradiction in connection with these
          matters. They never make an attempt to harmonize the two. This may
          well restrain us from assuming a contradiction here, even if we cannot
          reconcile both truths.

          Moreover, it should be borne in mind that God has not decreed to
          effectuate by His own direct action whatsoever must come to pass. The
          divine decree only brings certainty into the events, but does not
          imply that God will actively effectuate them, so that the question
          really resolves itself into this, whether previous certainty is
          consistent with free agency. Now experience teaches us that we can be
          reasonably certain as to the course a man of character will pursue
          under certain circumstances, without infringing in the least on his
          freedom. The prophet Jeremiah predicted that the Chaldeans would take
          Jerusalem. He knew the coming event as a certainty, and yet the
          Chaldeans freely followed their own desires in fulfilling the
          prediction. Such certainty is indeed inconsistent with the Pelagian
          liberty of indifference, according to which the will of man is not
          determined in any way, but is entirely indeterminate, so that in every
          volition it can decide in opposition, not only to all outward
          inducements, but also to all inward considerations and judgments,
          inclinations and desires, and even to the whole character and inner
          state of man. But it is now generally recognized that such freedom of
          the will is a psychological fiction. However, the decree is not
          necessarily inconsistent with human freedom in the sense of rational
          self-determination, according to which man freely acts in harmony with
          his previous thoughts and judgments, his inclinations and desires, and
          his whole character. This freedom also has its laws, and the better we
          are acquainted with them, the more sure we can be of what a free agent
          will do under certain circumstances. God Himself has established these
          laws. Naturally, we must guard against all determinism, materialistic,
          pantheistic, and rationalistic, in our conception of freedom in the
          sense of rational self-determination.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decree is no more inconsistent with free agency than foreknowledge
          is, and yet the objectors, who are generally of the Semi-Pelagian or
          Arminian type, profess to believe in divine foreknowledge. By His
          foreknowledge God knows from all eternity the certain futurition of
          all events. It is based on His foreordination, by which He determined
          their future certainty. The Arminian will of course, say that he does
          not believe in a foreknowledge based on a decree which renders things
          certain, but in a foreknowledge of facts and events which are
          contingent on the free will of man, and therefore indeterminate. Now
          such a foreknowledge of the free actions of man may be possible, if
          man even in his freedom acts in harmony with divinely established
          laws, which again bring in the element of certainty; but it would seem
          to be impossible to foreknow events which are entirely dependent on
          the chance decision of an unprincipled will, which can at any time,
          irrespective of the state of the soul, of existing conditions, and of
          the motives that present themselves to the mind, turn in different
          directions. Such events can only be foreknown as bare possibilities.

          2. IT TAKES AWAY ALL MOTIVES FOR HUMAN EXERTION. This objection is to
          the effect that people will naturally say that, if all things are
          bound to happen as God has determined them, they need not concern
          themselves about the future and need not make any efforts to obtain
          salvation. But this is hardly correct. In the case of people who speak
          after that fashion this is generally the mere excuse of indolence and
          disobedience. The divine decrees are not addressed to men as a rule of
          action, and cannot be such a rule, since their contents become known
          only through, and therefore after, their realization. There is a rule
          of action, however, embodied in the law and in the gospel, and this
          puts men under obligation to employ the means which God has ordained.
          This objection also ignores the logical relation, determined by God's
          decree, between the means and the end to be obtained. The decree
          includes not only the various issues of human life, but also the free
          human actions which are logically prior to, and are destined to bring
          about, the results. It was absolutely certain that all those who were
          in the vessel with Paul (Act_27:1-44) were to be saved, but it was
          equally certain that, in order to secure this end, the sailors had to
          remain aboard. And since the decree establishes an interrelation
          between means and ends, and ends are decreed only as the result of
          means, they encourage effort instead of discouraging it. Firm belief
          in the fact that, according to the divine decrees, success will be the
          reward of toil, is an inducement to courageous and persevering
          efforts. On the very basis of the decree Scripture urges us to be
          diligent in using the appointed means, Php_2:13; Eph_2:10.

          3. IT MAKES GOD THE AUTHOR OF SIN. This, if true, would naturally be
          an insuperable objection, for God cannot be the author of sin. This
          follows equally from Scripture, Psa_92:15; Ecc_7:29; Jas_1:13;
          1Jn_1:5, from the law of God which prohibits all sin, and from the
          holiness of God. But the charge is not true; the decree merely makes
          God the author of free moral beings, who are themselves the authors of
          sin. God decrees to sustain their free agency, to regulate the
          circumstances of their life, and to permit that free agency to exert
          itself in a multitude of acts, of which some are sinful. For good and
          holy reasons He renders these sinful acts certain, but He does not
          decree to work evil desires or choices efficiently in man. The decree
          respecting sin is not an efficient but a permissive decree, or a
          decree to permit, in distinction from a decree to produce, sin by
          divine efficiency. No difficulty attaches to such a decree which does
          not also attach to a mere passive permission of what He could very
          well prevent, such as the Arminians, who generally raise this
          objection, assume. The problem of God's relation to sin remains a
          mystery for us, which we are not able to solve. It may be said,
          however, that His decree to permit sin, while it renders the entrance
          of sin into the world certain, does not mean that He takes delight in
          it; but only that He deemed it wise, for the purpose of His
          self-revelation, to permit moral evil, however abhorrent it may be to
          His nature.
