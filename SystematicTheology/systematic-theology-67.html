        <p>II. Millennial Views</p>
        <p>
          There are some who connect with the advent of Christ the idea of a
          millennium, either immediately before or immediately following the
          second coming. While this idea is not an integral part of Reformed
          theology, it nevertheless deserves consideration here, since it has
          become rather popular in many circles. Reformed theology cannot afford
          to ignore the wide-spread millenarian views of the present day, but
          should define its position with respect to these. Some of those who
          expect a millennium in the future hold that the Lord will return
          before the millennium, and are therefore called Premillennialists;
          while others believe that His second coming will follow after the
          millennium, and are therefore known as Postmillennialists. There are
          large numbers, however, who do not believe that the Bible warrants the
          expectation of a millennium, and it has become customary of late to
          speak of them as Amillennialists. The Amillennial view is, as the name
          indicates, purely negative. It holds that there is no sufficient
          Scriptural ground for the expectation of a millennium, and is firmly
          convinced that the Bible favors the idea that the present dispensation
          of the Kingdom of God will be followed immediately by the Kingdom of
          God in its consummate and eternal form. It is mindful of the fact that
          the Kingdom of Jesus Christ is represented as an eternal and not as a
          temporal kingdom, Isa_9:7; Dan_7:14; Luk_1:33; Heb_1:8; Heb_12:28;
          2Pe_1:11; Rev_11:15; and that to enter the Kingdom of the future is to
          enter upon one's eternal state, Mat_7:21-22, to enter life, Mat_18:8-9
          (cf. the preceding context), and to be saved, Mar_10:25-26. Some
          Premillenarians have spoken of Amillennialism as a new view and as one
          of the most recent novelties, but this is certainly not in accord with
          the testimony of history. The name is new indeed, but the view to
          which it is applied is as old as Christianity. It had at least as many
          advocates as Chiliasm among the Church Fathers of the second and third
          centuries, supposed to have been the heyday of Chiliasm. It has ever
          since been the view most widely accepted, is the only view that is
          either expressed or implied in the great historical Confessions of the
          Church, and has always been the prevalent view in Reformed circles.
        </p>
        <p>A. PREMILLENNIALISM.</p>
        <p>
          Since Premillennialism has not always assumed the same form, it may be
          well to indicate briefly the form which it generally assumed in the
          past (without noting all kinds of aberrations), and then to follow
          this up with a more detailed description of the most dominant
          premillennial theory of the present day.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE PREMILLENNIALISM OF THE PAST. The view of IrenÃ¦us may be given
          as that which best reflects that of the early Christian centuries. The
          present world will endure six thousand years, corresponding to the six
          days of creation. Towards the end of this period the sufferings and
          persecutions of the pious will greatly increase, until finally the
          incarnation of all wickedness appears in the person of Antichrist.
          After he has completed his destructive work and has boldly seated
          himself in the temple of God, Christ will appear in heavenly glory and
          triumph over all His enemies. This will be accompanied by the physical
          resurrection of the saints and the establishment of the Kingdom of God
          on earth. The period of millennial bliss, lasting a thousand years,
          will correspond to the seventh day of creation, â€” the day of rest.
          Jerusalem will be rebuilt; the earth will yield its fruit in rich
          abundance; and peace and righteousness will prevail. At the end of the
          thousand years the final judgment will ensue, and a new creation will
          appear, in which the redeemed will live forever in the presence of
          God. In general outline this representation is typical of the
          eschatological views of the early Christian centuries, however these
          may differ in some details. During all the following centuries and
          into the nineteenth century, millennial thought remained essentially
          the same, though there were strange aberrations in some of the sects.
          Continued study, however, led to further development and to greater
          clarity in the presentation of some of its particulars. The main
          features of the common view may be stated somewhat as follows: The
          coming advent of Christ to the world is near, and will be visible,
          personal, and glorious. It will be preceded, however, by certain
          events, such as the evangelization of all nations, the conversion of
          Israel, the great apostasy and the great tribulation, and the
          revelation of the man of sin. Dark and trying times are therefore
          still in store for the Church, since she will have to pass through the
          great tribulation. The second coming will be a great, single,
          outstanding, and glorious event, but will be accompanied by several
          others bearing on the Church, on Israel, and on the world. The dead
          saints will be raised and the living transfigured, and together they
          will be translated to meet the coming Lord. Antichrist and his wicked
          allies will be slain; and Israel, the ancient people of God will
          repent, be saved, and restored to the Holy Land. Then the Kingdom of
          God, predicted by the prophets, will be established in a transformed
          world. The Gentiles will turn to God in great abundance and be
          incorporated in the Kingdom. A condition of peace and righteousness
          will prevail in all the earth. After the expiration of the earthly
          rule of Christ the rest of the dead will be raised up; and this
          resurrection will be followed by the last judgment and the creation of
          a new heaven and a new earth. Generally speaking, it may be said that
          this is the type of Premillennialism advocated by such men as Mede,
          Bengel, Auberlen, Christlieb, Ebrard, Godet, Hofmann, Lange, Stier,
          Van Oosterzee, Van Andel, Alford, Andrews, Ellicott, Guinness,
          Kellogg, Zahn, Moorehead, Newton, Trench, and others. It goes without
          saying that these men differed in some details.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE PREMILLENNIALISM OF THE PRESENT. In the second quarter of the
          nineteenth century a new form of Premillennialism was introduced under
          the influence of Darby, Kelly, Trotter, and their followers in England
          and America, a Premillennialism wedded to Dispensationalism. The new
          views were popularized in our country especially through the Scofield
          Bible, and are widely disseminated through the works of such men as
          Bullinger, F. W. Grant, Blackstone, Gray, Silver, Haldeman, the two
          Gaebeleins, Brookes, Riley, Rogers, and a host of others. They really
          present a new philosophy of the history of redemption, in which Israel
          plays a leading role and the Church is but an interlude. Their guiding
          principle prompts them to divide the Bible into two books, the book of
          the Kingdom and the book of the Church. In reading their descriptions
          of God's dealings with men one is lost in a bewildering maze of
          covenants and dispensations, without an Ariadne thread to give safe
          guidance. Their divisive tendency also reveals itself in their
          eschatological program. There will be two second comings, two or three
          (if not four) resurrections, and also three judgments. Moreover, there
          will also be two peoples of God, which according to some will be
          eternally separate, Israel dwelling on earth, and the Church in
          heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following will give some idea of the Premillennial scheme that
          enjoys the greatest popularity to-day:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Its view of history. God deals with the world of humanity in the
          course of history on the basis of several covenants and according to
          the principles of seven different dispensations. Each dispensation is
          distinct, and each one of them represents a different test of the
          natural man; and since man fails to meet the successive tests, each
          dispensation ends in a judgment. The theocracy of Israel, founded on
          Mount Sinai, occupies a special place in the divine economy. It was
          the initiatory form of the Kingdom of God or the Kingdom of the
          Messiah, and had its golden age in the days of David and Solomon. In
          the way of obedience it might have increased in strength and glory,
          but as the result of the unfaithfulness of the people, it was finally
          overthrown, and the people were carried away into exile. The prophets
          predicted this overthrow, but also brought messages of hope and raised
          the expectation that in the days of the Messiah Israel would turn to
          the Lord in true repentance, the throne of David would be
          re-established in unsurpassed glory, and even the Gentiles would share
          in the blessings of the future Kingdom. But when the Messiah came and
          offered to establish the Kingdom, the Jews failed to show the
          requisite repentance. The result was that the King did not establish
          the Kingdom, but withdrew from Israel and went into a far country,
          postponing the establishment of the Kingdom until His return. Before
          He left the earth, however, He founded the Church, which has nothing
          in common with the Kingdom, and of which the prophets never spoke. The
          dispensation of the law made way for the dispensation of the grace of
          God. During this dispensation the Church is gathered out of Jews and
          Gentiles, and forms the body of Christ, which now shares in His
          sufferings, but will once, as the bride of the Lamb, share in His
          glory. Of this Church Christ is not the King, but the divine Head. She
          has the glorious task of preaching, not the gospel of the Kingdom, but
          the gospel of the free grace of God, among all the nations of the
          world, to gather out of them the elect and further to be a testimony
          unto them. This method will prove to be a failure; it will not effect
          conversions on any large scale. At the end of this dispensation Christ
          will suddenly return and effect a far more universal conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Its eschatology. The return of Christ is imminent now, that is, He
          may come at any time, for there are no predicted events that must
          still precede it. However, His coming consists of two separate events,
          separated from each other by a period of seven years. The first of
          these events will be the parousia when Christ will appear in the air
          to meet His saints. All the righteous dead will then be raised up, and
          the living saints will be transfigured. Together they will be caught
          up into the air, will celebrate the wedding of the Lamb, and will then
          be forever with the Lord. The translation of the living saints is
          called " the rapture ," sometimes " the secret rapture. " While Christ
          and His Church are absent from the earth, and even the indwelling Holy
          Spirit has gone with the Church, there will be a period of seven years
          or more, often divided into two parts, in which several things will
          happen. The gospel of the Kingdom will again be preached, primarily,
          it would seem, by the believing remnant of the Jews, and conversions
          on a large scale will result, though many will still continue to
          blaspheme God. The Lord will again begin to deal with Israel and it
          will probably at this time (though some say it will be later) be
          converted. In the second half of this period of seven years there will
          be a time of unequalled tribulation, the length of which is still a
          subject of debate. Antichrist will be revealed and the vials of God's
          wrath will be poured out upon the human race. At the end of the
          seven-year period the " revelation " will follow, that is, the coming
          of the Lord down to earth, now not for but with His saints. The living
          nations are now judged (Mat_25:31 ff.), and the sheep separated from
          the goats; the saints that died during the great tribulation are
          raised up; Antichrist is destroyed; and Satan is bound for a thousand
          years. The millennial kingdom will now be established, a real visible,
          terrestrial, and material kingdom of the Jews, the restoration of the
          theocratic kingdom, including the re-establishment of the Davidic
          kingship. In it the saints will reign with Christ, the Jews will be
          the natural citizens and many Gentiles adopted citizens. The throne of
          Christ will be established at Jerusalem, which will also again become
          the central place of worship. The temple will be rebuilt on Mount
          Zion, and the altar will again reek with the blood of sacrifices, even
          of sin- and trespass-offerings. And though sin and death will still
          claim their victims, it will be a time of great fruitfulness and
          prosperity, in which men's lives will be prolonged and the wilderness
          will blossom as the rose. In this time the world will speedily be
          converted, according to some by the gospel, but according to the
          majority by totally different means, such as the personal appearance
          of Christ, the envy aroused by the blessedness of the saints, and
          above all great and terrible judgments. After the millennium Satan
          will be loosed for a little season, and the hordes of Gog and Magog
          assemble against the holy city. The enemies are devoured, however, by
          fire from heaven, and Satan is cast into the bottomless pit, whither
          the beast and the false prophet have preceded him. After this little
          season the wicked dead are raised up and appear in judgment before the
          great white throne, Rev_20:11-15. And then there will be a new heaven
          and a new earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Some of the variations of this theory. Premillenarians are by no
          means all agreed as to the particulars of their eschatological scheme.
          A study of their literature reveals a great variety of opinions. There
          is indefiniteness and uncertainty on many points, which proves that
          their detailed construction is of rather doubtful value. While the
          majority of present day Premillenarians believe in a coming visible
          rule of Jesus Christ, even now some anticipate only a spiritual rule,
          and do not look for a physical presence of Christ on earth. Though the
          thousand years of Rev_20:1-15 are generally interpreted literally,
          there is a tendency on the part of some to regard them as an
          indefinite period of shorter or longer duration. Some think that the
          Jews will be converted first, and then brought back to Palestine,
          while others are of the opinion that this order will be reversed.
          There are those who believe that the means used for the conversion of
          the world will be identical with those now employed, but the
          prevailing opinion is that other means will be substituted. There is a
          difference of opinion also as to the place where the risen saints will
          dwell during their millennial reign with Christ, on earth or in
          heaven, or in both places. Opinions differ very much, too, with
          respect to the continuance of the propagation of the human race during
          the millennium, the degree of sin that will prevail at that time, and
          the continued sway of death, and many other points.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. OBJECTIONS TO PREMILLENNIALISM. In the discussion of the second
          advent the premillennial view of it was already subjected to special
          scrutiny and criticism, and the succeeding chapters on the
          resurrection and the final judgment will offer further occasion for a
          critical consideration of the premillennial construction of these
          events. Hence the objections raised at this point will be of a more
          general nature, and even so we can only pay attention to some of the
          most important ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The theory is based on a literal interpretation of the prophetic
          delineations of the future of Israel and of the Kingdom of God, which
          is entirely untenable. This has been pointed out repeatedly in such
          works on prophecy as those of Fairbairn, Riehm, and Davidson, in the
          splendid work of David Brown on The Second Advent, in Waldegrave's
          important volume on New Testament Millennarianism, and in the more
          recent works of Dr. Aalders on De Profeten des Ouden Verbonds, and Het
          Herstel van Israel Volgens het Oude Testament. The last volume is
          devoted entirely to a detailed exegetical study of all the Old
          Testament passages that might bear in any way on the future
          restoration of Israel. It is a thorough work that deserves careful
          study. Premillenarians maintain that nothing short of a literal
          interpretation and fulfilment will satisfy the requirements of these
          prophetic forecasts; but the books of the prophets themselves already
          contain indications that point to a spiritual fulfilment, Isa_54:13;
          Isa_61:6; Jer_3:16; Jer_31:31-34; Hos_14:2; Mic_6:6-8. The contention
          that the names "Zion" and "Jerusalem" are never used by the prophets
          in any other than a literal sense, that the former always denotes a
          mountain, and the latter, a city, is clearly contrary to fact. There
          are passages in which both names are employed to designate Israel, the
          Old Testament Church of God, Isa_49:14; Isa_51:3; Isa_52:1-2. And this
          use of the terms passes right over into the New Testament, Gal_4:26;
          Heb_12:22; Rev_3:12; Rev_21:9. It is remarkable that the New
          Testament, which is the fulfilment of the Old, contains no indication
          whatsoever of the re-establishment of the Old Testament theocracy by
          Jesus, nor a single undisputed positive prediction of its restoration,
          while it does contain abundant indications of the spiritual fulfilment
          of the promises given to Israel, Mat_21:43; Act_2:29-36; Act_15:14-18;
          Rom_9:25-26; Heb_8:8-13; 1Pe_2:9; Rev_1:6; Rev_5:10. For further
          details on the spiritualization found in Scripture the work of Dr.
          Wijngaarden on The Future of the Kingdom may be consulted. The New
          Testament certainly does not favor the literalism of the
          Premillenarians. Moreover this literalism lands them in all kinds of
          absurdities, for it involves the future restoration of all the former
          historical conditions of Israel's life: the great world powers of the
          Old Testament (Egyptians, Assyrians, and Babylonians), and the
          neighboring nations of Israel (Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, and
          Philistines) must again appear on the scene, Isa_11:14; Amo_9:12;
          Joe_3:19; Mic_5:5-6; Rev_18:1-24. The temple will have to be rebuilt,
          Isa_2:2-3; Mic_4:1-2; Zec_14:16-21; Eze_40:1-49; Eze_41:1-26;
          Eze_42:1-20; Eze_43:1-27; Eze_44:1-31; Eze_45:1-25.; Eze_46:1-24;
          Eze_47:1-23; Eze_48:1-35, the sons of Zadok will again have to serve
          as priests, Eze_44:15-31; Eze_48:11-14, and even sin and trespass
          offerings will again have to be brought upon the altar, not for
          commemoration (as some Premillenarians would have it), but for
          atonement, Eze_42:13; Eze_43:18-27. And in addition to all that, the
          altered situation would make it necessary for all the nations to visit
          Jerusalem from year to year, in order to celebrate the feast of
          tabernacles, Zec_14:16, and even from week to week, to worship before
          Jehovah, Isa_66:23.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The so-called postponement theory, which is a necessary link in the
          premillennial scheme, is devoid of all Scriptural basis. According to
          it John and Jesus proclaimed that the Kingdom, that is, the Jewish
          theocracy, was at hand. But because the Jews did not repent and
          believe, Jesus postponed its establishment until His second coming.
          The pivotal point marking the change is placed by Scofield in
          Mat_11:20, by others in Mat_12:1-50, and by others still later. Before
          that turning point Jesus did not concern Himself with the Gentiles,
          but preached the gospel of the kingdom to Israel; and after that He
          did not preach the kingdom any more, but only predicted its future
          coming and offered rest to the weary of both Israel and the Gentiles.
          But it cannot be maintained that Jesus did not concern Himself with
          the Gentiles before the supposed turning point, cf. Mat_8:5-13;
          Joh_4:1-42, nor that after it He ceased to preach the kingdom,
          Mat_13:1-58; Luk_10:1-11. There is absolutely no proof that Jesus
          preached two different gospels, first the gospel of the kingdom and
          then the gospel of the grace of God; in the light of Scripture this
          distinction is untenable. Jesus never had in mind the re-establishment
          of the Old Testament theocracy, but the introduction of the spiritual
          reality, of which the Old Testament kingdom was but a type,
          Mat_8:11-12; Mat_13:31-33; Mat_21:43; Luk_17:21; Joh_3:3; Joh_18:36-37
          (comp. Rom_14:17). He did not postpone the task for which He had come
          into the world, but actually established the Kingdom and referred to
          it more than once as a present reality, Mat_11:12; Mat_12:28;
          Luk_17:21; Joh_18:36-37; (comp. Col_1:13). This whole postponement
          theory is a comparatively recent fiction, and is very objectionable,
          because it breaks up the unity of Scripture and of the people of God
          in an unwarranted way. The Bible represents the relation between the
          Old Testament and the New as that of type and antitype, of prophecy
          and fulfilment; but this theory holds that, while the New Testament
          was originally meant to be a fulfilment of the Old, it really became
          something quite different. The kingdom, that is, the Old Testament
          theocracy, was predicted and was not restored, and the Church was not
          predicted but was established. Thus the two fall apart, and the one
          becomes the book of the kingdom, and the other, with the exception of
          the Gospels, the book of the Church. Besides, we get two peoples of
          God, the one natural and the other spiritual, the one earthly and the
          other heavenly, as if Jesus did not speak of "one flock and one
          shepherd," Joh_10:16, and as if Paul did not say that the Gentiles
          were grafted into the old olive tree, Rom_11:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. This theory is also in flagrant opposition to the Scriptural
          representation of the great events of the future, namely, the
          resurrection, the final judgment, and the end of the world. As was
          shown in the preceding, the Bible represents these great events as
          synchronizing. There is not the slightest indication that they are
          separated by a thousand years, except this be found in Rev_20:4-6.
          They clearly coincide, Mat_13:37-43; Mat_13:47-50 (separation of the
          good and the evil at "the end," not a thousand years before);
          Mat_24:29-31; Mat_25:31-46; Joh_5:25-19; 1Co_15:22-26; Php_3:20-21;
          1Th_4:15-16; Rev_20:11-15. They all occur at the coming of the Lord,
          which is also the day of the Lord. In answer to this objection
          Premillenarians often suggest that the day of the Lord may be a
          thousand years long, so that the resurrection of the saints and the
          judgment of the nations takes place in the morning of that long day,
          and the resurrection of the wicked and the judgment at the great white
          throne occurs in the evening of that same day. They appeal to
          2Pe_3:8... "one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a
          thousand years as one day." But this can hardly prove the point, for
          the tables might easily be turned here. The same passage might also be
          used to prove that the thousand years of Rev_20:1-15 are but a single
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. There is no positive Scriptural foundation whatsoever for the
          Premillennial view of a double, or even a three- or fourfold
          resurrection, as their theory requires, nor for spreading the last
          judgment over a period of a thousand years by dividing it into three
          judgments. It is, to say the least, very dubious that the words, "This
          is the first resurrection" in Rev_20:5, refer to a physical
          resurrection. The context does not necessitate, nor even favor this
          view. What might seem to favor the theory of a double resurrection, is
          the fact that the apostles often speak of the resurrection of
          believers only, and do not refer to that of the wicked at all. But
          this is due to the fact that they are writing to the churches of Jesus
          Christ, to the connections in which they bring up the subject of the
          resurrection, and to the fact that they desire to stress the
          soteriological aspect of it, 1Co_15:1-58; 1Th_4:13-15. Other passages
          clearly speak of the resurrection of the righteous and that of the
          wicked in a single breath, Dan_12:2; Joh_5:28-29; Act_24:15. We shall
          consider this matter further in the following chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. The Premillennial theory entangles itself in all kinds of
          insuperable difficulties with its doctrine of the millennium. It is
          impossible to understand how a part of the old earth and of sinful
          humanity can exist alongside of a part of the new earth and of a
          humanity that is glorified. How can perfect saints in glorified bodies
          have communion with sinners in the flesh. How can glorified saints
          live in this sin-laden atmosphere and amid scenes of death and decay?
          How can the Lord of glory, the glorified Christ, establish His throne
          on earth as long as it has not yet been renewed. The twenty-first
          chapter of Revelation informs us that God and the Church of the
          redeemed will take up their dwellingplace on earth after heaven and
          earth have been renewed; how then can it be maintained that Christ and
          the saints will dwell there a thousand years before this renewal. How
          will sinners and saints in the flesh be able to stand in the presence
          of the glorified Christ, seeing that even Paul and John were
          completely overwhelmed by the vision of Him, Act_26:12-14; Rev_1:17?
          Beet truly says: "We cannot conceive mingled together on the same
          planet some who have yet to die and others who have passed through
          death and will die no more. Such confusion of the present age with the
          age to come is in the last degree unlikely."22 And Brown calls out:
          "What a mongrel state of things is this! What an abhorred mixture of
          things totally inconsistent with each -other!"23
        </p>
        <p>
          f. The only Scriptural basis for this theory is Rev_20:1-6, after an
          Old Testament content has been poured into it. This is a very
          precarious basis for various reasons. (1) This passage occurs in a
          highly symbolical book and is admittedly very obscure, as may be
          inferred from the different interpretations of it. (2) The literal
          interpretation of this passage, as given by the Premillenarians, leads
          to a view that finds no support elsewhere in Scripture, but is even
          contradicted by the rest of the New Testament. This is a fatal
          objection. Sound exegesis requires that the obscure passages of
          Scripture be read in the light of the clearer ones, and not vice
          versa. (3) Even the literal interpretation of the Premillenarians is
          not consistently literal, for it makes the chain in verse 1 and
          consequently also the binding of verse 2 figurative, often conceives
          of the thousand years as a long but undefined period, and changes the
          souls of verse 4 into resurrection saints. (4) The passage, strictly
          speaking, does not say that the classes referred to (the martyr saints
          and those who did not worship the beast) were raised up from the dead,
          but simply that they lived and reigned with Christ. And this living
          and reigning with Christ is said to constitute the first resurrection.
          (5) There is absolutely no indication in these verses that Christ and
          His saints are seen ruling on the earth. In the light of such passages
          as Rev_4:4; Rev_6:9, it is far more likely that the scene is laid in
          heaven. (6) It also deserves notice that the passage makes no mention
          whatsoever of Palestine, of Jerusalem, of the temple, and of the Jews,
          the natural citizens of the millennial kingdom. There is not a single
          hint that these are in any way concerned with this reign of a thousand
          years. For a detailed interpretation of this passage from the
          Amillennial point of view we refer to Kuyper, Bavinck, De Moor, Dijk,
          Greydanus, Vos, and Hendriksen.
        </p>
        <p>B. POSTMILLENNIALISM.</p>
        <p>
          The position of Postmillennialism is quite the opposite of that taken
          by Premillennialism respecting the time of the second coming of
          Christ. It holds that the return of Christ will follow the millennium,
          which may be expected during and at the close of the gospel
          dispensation. Immediately after it Christ will come to usher in the
          eternal order of things. In the discussion of Postmillennialism it
          will be necessary to distinguish two different forms of the theory, of
          which the one expects the millennium to be realized through the
          supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit, and the other expects it to
          come by a natural process of evolution.
        </p>
        <p>1. DIFFERENT FORMS OF POSTMILLENNIALISM.</p>
        <p>
          a. The earlier form. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
          several Reformed theologians in the Netherlands taught a form of
          Chiliasm, which would now be called Postmillennialism. Among them were
          such well-known men as Coccejus, Alting, the two Vitringas, d'Outrein,
          Witsius, Hoornbeek, Koelman, and Brakel, of which some regarded the
          millennium as belonging to the past, others thought of it as present,
          and still others looked for it in the future. The majority expected it
          toward the end of the world, just before the second coming of Christ.
          These men rejected the two leading ideas of the Premillenarians,
          namely, that Christ will return physically to reign on earth for a
          thousand years, and that the saints will be raised up at His coming,
          and will then reign with him in the millennial kingdom. While their
          representations differed in some details, the prevailing view was that
          the gospel, which will gradually spread through the whole world, will
          in the end become immeasurably more effective than it is at present,
          and will usher in a period of rich spiritual blessings for the Church
          of Jesus Christ, a golden age, in which the Jews will also share in
          the blessings of the gospel in an unprecedented manner. In more recent
          years some such Postmillennialism was advocated by D. Brown, J. Berg,
          J. H. Snowden, T. P. Stafford, and A. H. Strong. The last named
          theologian says that the millennium will be "a period in the later
          days of the Church militant, when, under the special influence of the
          Holy Spirit, the spirit of the martyrs shall appear again, true
          religion be greatly quickened and revived, and the members of Christ's
          churches become so conscious of their strength in Christ that they
          shall, to an extent unknown before, triumph over the power of evil
          both within and without."24 The golden age of the Church will, it is
          held, be followed by a brief apostasy, a terrible conflict between the
          forces of good and evil, and by the simultaneous occurrence of the
          advent of Christ, the general resurrection, and the final judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The later form. A great deal of present day Postmillennialism is of
          an entirely different type, and concerns itself very little about the
          teachings of Scripture, except as a historical indication of what
          people once believed. The modern man has little patience with the
          millennial hopes of the past with their utter dependence on God. He
          does not believe that the new age will be ushered in by the preaching
          of the gospel and the accompanying work of the Holy Spirit; nor that
          it will be the result of a cataclysmic change. On the one hand it is
          believed that evolution will gradually bring the millennium, and on
          the other hand, that man himself must usher in the new age by adopting
          a constructive policy of world-betterment. Says Walter Rauschenbusch:
          "Our chief interest in any millennium is the desire for a social order
          in which the worth and freedom of every least human being will be
          honored and protected; in which the brotherhood of man will be
          expressed in the common possession of the economic resources of
          society; and in which the spiritual good of humanity will be set high
          above the private profit interests of all materialistic groups.... As
          to the way in which the Christian ideal of society is to come, â€” we
          must shift from catastrophe to development."25
        </p>
        <p>
          Shirley Jackson Case asks: "Shall we still look for God to introduce a
          new order by catastrophic means or shall we assume the responsibility
          of bringing about our own millennium, believing that God is working in
          us and in our world to will and to work for His good pleasure?" And he
          himself gives the answer in the following paragraphs: "The course of
          history exhibits one long process of evolving struggle by which
          humanity as a whole rises constantly higher in the scale of
          civilization and attainment, bettering its condition from time to time
          through its greater skill and industry. Viewed in the long perspective
          of the ages, man's career has been one of actual ascent. Instead of
          growing worse, the world is found to be constantly growing better . .
          . Since history and science show that betterment is always the result
          of achievement, man learns to surmise that evils still unconquered are
          to be eliminated by strenuous effort and gradual reform rather than by
          the catastrophic intervention of Deity.... Disease is to be cured or
          prevented by the physician's skill, society's ills are to be remedied
          by education and legislation, and international disasters are to be
          averted by establishing new standards and new methods for dealing with
          the problems involved. In short, the ills of life are to be cured by a
          gradual process of remedial treatment rather than by a sudden
          annihilation."26 These quotations are quite characteristic of a great
          deal of present day Postmillennialism, and it is no wonder that the
          Premillenarians react against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. OBJECTIONS TO POSTMILLENNIALISM. There are some very serious
          objections to the Postmillennial theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The fundamental idea of the doctrine, that the whole world will
          gradually be won for Christ, that the life of all nations will in
          course of time be transformed by the gospel, that righteousness and
          peace will reign supreme, and that the blessings of the Spirit will be
          poured out in richer abundance than before, so that the Church will
          experience a season of unexampled prosperity just before the coming of
          the Lord, â€” is not in harmony with the picture of the end of the
          ages found in Scripture. The Bible teaches indeed that the gospel will
          spread throughout the world and will exercise a beneficent influence,
          but does not lead us to expect the conversion of the world, either in
          this or in a coming age. It stresses the fact that the time
          immediately preceding the end will be a time of great apostasy, of
          tribulation and persecution, a time when the faith of many will wax
          cold, and when they who are loyal to Christ will be subjected to
          bitter sufferings, and will in some cases even seal their confession
          with their blood, Mat_24:6-14; Mat_24:21-22; Luk_18:8; Luk_21:25-28;
          2Th_2:3-12; 2Ti_3:1-6; Rev_13:1-18. Postmillennialists, of course,
          cannot very well ignore entirely what is said about the apostasy and
          the tribulation that will mark the end of history, but they minimize
          it and represent it as predicting an apostasy and a tribulation on a
          small scale, which will not affect the main course of the religious
          life. Their expectation of a glorious condition of the Church in the
          end, is based on passages which contain a figurative description,
          either of the gospel dispensation as a whole, or of the perfect bliss
          of the external Kingdom of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The related idea, that the present age will not end in a great
          cataclysmic change, but will pass almost imperceptibly into the coming
          age, is equally un-Scriptural. The Bible teaches us very explicitly
          that a catastrophe, a special intervention of God, will bring the rule
          of Satan on earth to an end, and will usher in the Kingdom that cannot
          be shaken, Mat_24:29-31; Mat_24:35-44; Heb_12:26-27; 2Pe_3:10-13.
          There will be a crisis, a change so great that it can be called "the
          regeneration," Mat_19:28. No more than believers are progressively
          sanctified in this life until they are practically ready to pass,
          without much more change, into heaven, will the world gradually be
          purified and thus made ready to enter upon the next stage. Just as
          believers must still undergo a great change at death, so must the
          world suffer a tremendous change when the end comes. There will be a
          new heaven and a new earth. Rev_21:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The modern idea that natural evolution and the efforts of man in
          the field of education, of social reform, and of legislation, will
          gradually bring in the perfect reign of the Christian spirit,
          conflicts with everything that the Word of God teaches on this point.
          It is not the work of man, but the work of God to bring in the
          glorious Kingdom of God. This Kingdom cannot be established by natural
          but only by supernatural means. It is the reign of God, established
          and acknowledged in the hearts of His people, and this reign can never
          be made effective by purely natural means. Civilization without
          regeneration, without a supernatural change of the heart, will never
          bring in a millennium, an effective and glorious rule of Jesus Christ.
          It would seem that the experiences of the last quarter of a century
          should have forced this truth upon the modern man. The highly vaunted
          development of man has not yet brought us in sight of the millennium.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: What is the historic origin of
          Premillennialism? Was it actually the prevailing view in the second
          and third centuries? What was Augustine's view of the Kingdom of God
          and the millennium? Are the Kingdom of God and the Church distinct or
          identical in Scripture? Is the one natural and national, and the other
          spiritual and universal? Do Luk_14:14; Luk_20:35 teach a partial
          resurrection? Will any part of Israel constitute a part of the bride
          of Christ? Will the bride be complete when Christ returns? Are the
          Postmillennialists necessarily evolutionists? Is the optimism of the
          Postmillennialists, that the world is gradually getting better,
          justified by experience? Does the Bible predict continuous progress
          for the Kingdom of God right up to the end of the world? Is it
          necessary to assume a cataclysmic change at the end?
