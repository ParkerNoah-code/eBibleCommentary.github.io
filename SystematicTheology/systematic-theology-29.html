        <p>II. The Names and Natures of Christ</p>
        <p>A. THE NAMES OF CHRIST.</p>
        <p>
          There are especially five names that call for a brief discussion at
          this point. They are partly descriptive of His natures, partly of His
          official position, and partly of the work for which He came into the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE NAME JESUS. The name Jesus is the Greek form of the Hebrew
          Jehoshua, Joshua, Jos_1:1; Zec_3:1, or Jeshua (regular form in the
          post exilic historical books), Ezr_2:2. The derivation of this common
          name of the Saviour is veiled in obscurity. The generally accepted
          opinion is that it is derived from the root yasha', hiph., hoshia', to
          save, but it is not easy to explain how Jehoshua' became Jeshua'.
          Probably Hoshea', derived from the infinitive, was the original form
          (cf. Num_13:8; Num_13:16; Deu_32:44), expressing merely the idea of
          redemption. The yod which is the sign of the imperfect, may have been
          added to express the certainty of redemption. This would best agree
          with the interpretation of the name given in Mat_1:21. For another
          derivation from Jeho (Jehovah) and shua, that is help (Gotthilf) cf.
          Kuyper, Dict. Dogm.4 The name was borne by two well known types of
          Jesus in the Old Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE NAME CHRIST. If Jesus is the personal, Christ is the official,
          name of the Messiah. It is the equivalent of the Old Testament
          Mashiach (from mashach, to anoint), and thus means "the anointed one."
          Kings and priests were regularly anointed during the old dispensation,
          Exo_29:7; Lev_4:3; Jdg_9:8; 1Sa_9:16; 1Sa_10:1; 2Sa_19:10. The King
          was called "the anointed of Jehovah," 1Sa_24:10. Only a single
          instance of the anointing of a prophet is recorded, 1Ki_19:16, but
          there are probably references to it in Psa_105:15 and Isa_61:1. The
          oil used in anointing these officers symbolized the Spirit of God,
          Isa_61:1; Zec_4:1-6, and the anointing represented the transfer of the
          Spirit to the consecrated person, 1Sa_10:1; 1Sa_10:6; 1Sa_10:10;
          1Sa_16:13-14. The anointing was a visible sign of (a) an appointment
          to office; (b) the establishment of a sacred relationship and the
          consequent sacrosanctness of the person anointed, 1Sa_24:6; 1Sa_26:9;
          2Sa_1:14; and (c) a communication of the Spirit to the anointed one,
          1Sa_16:13, cf. also 2Co_1:21-22. The Old Testament refers to the
          anointing of the Lord in Psa_2:2; Psa_45:7, and the New Testament, in
          Act_4:27; Act_10:38. Formerly references to it were also found in
          Psa_2:6 and Pro_8:23, but to-day Hebraists assert that the word nasak,
          used in these passages, means "to set up" rather than "to anoint." But
          even cf. also Isa_11:2; Isa_42:1. Christ was set up or appointed to
          His offices from so the word points to the reality of the first thing
          symbolized in the anointing, eternity, but historically His anointing
          took place when He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, Luk_1:35, and
          when he received the Holy Spirit, especially at the time of His
          baptism, Mat_3:16; Mar_1:10; Luk_3:22; Joh_1:32; Joh_3:34. It served
          to qualify Him for His great task. The name "Christ" was first applied
          to the Lord as a common noun with the article, but gradually developed
          into a proper noun, and was used without the article.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE NAME SON OF MAN. In the Old Testament this name is found in
          Psa_8:4; Dan_7:13, and frequently in the Prophecy of Ezekiel. It is
          also found in the Apochrypha, Enoch 46 and 62, and 2Es_13:1-58. The
          dependence of the New Testament usage of it on the passage in Daniel
          is now quite generally admitted, though in that prophecy it is merely
          a descriptive phrase, and not yet a title. The transition from the one
          to the other was made later on, and was apparently already an
          accomplished fact when the book of Enoch was written. It was the most
          common self-designation of Jesus. He applied the name to Himself on
          more than forty occasions, while others all but refrained from
          employing it. The only exception in the Gospels is in Joh_12:34, where
          it appears in an indirect quotation of a word of Jesus; and in the
          rest of the New Testament only Stephen and John employ it, Act_7:56;
          Rev_1:13; Rev_14:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Vos in his work on The Self-Disclosure of Jesus divides the
          passages in which the name occurs into four classes: (a) Passages
          which clearly refer to the eschatological coming of the Son of Man, as
          for instance, Mat_16:27-28; Mar_8:38; Mar_13:26, etc. and parallels.
          (b) Passages which speak particularly of Jesus' sufferings, death, and
          (sometimes) resurrection, as, for instance, Mat_17:22; Mat_20:18-19;
          Mat_20:28; Mat_12:40, etc. and parallels. (c) Passages in the Fourth
          Gospel, in which the heavenly superhuman side and the pre-existence of
          Jesus is stressed, as for instance, Joh_1:51; Joh_3:13-14; Joh_6:27;
          Joh_6:53; Joh_6:62; Joh_8:28, and so on. (d) A small group of
          passages, in which Jesus reflects upon His human nature, Mar_2:27-28;
          Joh_5:27; Joh_6:27; Joh_6:51; Joh_6:62. It is hard to determine why
          Jesus preferred this name as a self-designation. Formerly the name was
          generally regarded as a cryptic title, by the use of which Jesus
          intended to veil rather than to reveal His Messiahship. This
          explanation was discarded when more attention was paid to the
          eschatological element in the Gospels, and to the use of the name in
          the apocalyptic literature of the Jews. Dalman revived the idea and
          regarded the title once more as "an intentional veiling of the
          Messianic character under a title which affirms the humanity of Him
          who bore it."5 The supposed proof for this is found in Mat_16:13;
          Joh_12:34. But the proof is doubtful; the latter passage even shows
          that the people understood the name Messianically. Dr. Vos is of the
          opinion that Jesus probably preferred the name, because it stood
          farthest removed from every possible Jewish prostitution of the
          Messianic office. By calling Himself the Son of Man, Jesus imparted to
          the Messiahship His own heaven-centered spirit. And the height to
          which He thus lifted His person and work may well have had something
          to do with the hesitancy of His early followers to name Him with the
          most celestial of all titles.6
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE NAME SON OF GOD. The name "Son of God" was variously applied in
          the Old Testament: (a) to the people of Israel, Exo_4:22; Jer_31:9;
          Hos_11:1; (b) to officials among Israel, especially to the promised
          king of the house of David, 2Sa_7:14; Psa_89:27; (c) to angels,
          Job_1:6; Job_2:1; Job_38:7; Psa_29:1; Psa_89:6; and (d) to pious
          people in general, Gen_6:2; Psa_73:15; Pro_14:26. Among Israel the
          name acquired theocratic significance. In the New Testament we find
          Jesus appropriating the name, and others also ascribing it to Him. The
          name is applied to Jesus in four different senses, which are not
          always kept distinct in Scripture but are sometimes combined. The name
          is applied to Him:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. In the official or Messianic sense, as a description of the office
          rather than of the nature of Christ. The Messiah could be called Son
          of God as God's heir and representative. The demons evidently
          understood the name Messianically, when they applied it to Jesus. It
          seems to have this meaning also in Mat_24:36; Mar_13:32. Even the
          name, as uttered by the voice at the baptism of Jesus and at His
          transfiguration, Mat_3:17; Mat_17:5; Mar_1:11; Mar_9:7; Luk_3:22;
          Luk_9:35, can be so interpreted, but in all probability has a deeper
          meaning. There are several passages in which the Messianic sense is
          combined with the trinitarian sense, cf. under (b).
        </p>
        <p>
          b. In the trinitarian sense. The name is sometimes used to denote the
          essential deity of Christ. As such it points to a pre-existent
          sonship, which absolutely transcends the human life of Christ and His
          official calling as Messiah. Instances of this use are found in
          Mat_11:27; Mat_14:28-33; Mat_16:16, and parallels; Mat_21:33-46, and
          parallels; Mat_22:41-46; Mat_26:63, and parallels. In some of these
          cases the idea of the Messianic sonship also enters more or less. We
          find the ontological and the Messianic sonship interwoven also in
          several Johannine passages, in which Jesus clearly intimates that He
          is the Son of God, though He does not use the name, as in Joh_6:69;
          Joh_8:16, Joh_8:18, Joh_8:23; Joh_10:15, Joh_10:30; Joh_14:20, and so
          on. In the Epistles Christ is frequently designated as the Son of God
          in the metaphysical sense, Rom_1:3; Rom_8:3; Gal_4:4; Heb_1:1, and
          many other passages. In modern liberal theology it is customary to
          deny the metaphysical sonship of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. In the nativistic sense. Christ is also called the Son of God in
          virtue of His supernatural birth. The name is so applied to Him in the
          well known passage in the Gospel of Luke, in which the origin of His
          human nature is ascribed to the direct, supernatural paternity of God,
          namely, Luk_1:35. Dr. Vos also finds indications of this sense of the
          name in Mat_1:18-24; Joh_1:13. Naturally, this meaning of the name is
          also denied by modern liberal theology, which does not believe in the
          virgin birth, nor in the supernatural conception of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. In the ethico-religious sense. It is in this sense that the name
          "sons" or "children of God" is applied to believers in the New
          Testament. It is possible that we have an example of the application
          of the name "Son of God" to Jesus in that ethico-religious sense in
          Mat_27:24-27. This depends on the question, whether Peter is here
          represented as also exempt from the templetax. It is especially in
          this sense that modern liberal theology ascribes the name to Jesus. It
          finds that the sonship of Jesus is only an ethico- religious sonship,
          somewhat heightened indeed, but not essentially different from that of
          His disciples.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. THE NAME LORD (Kurios). The name "Lord" is applied to God in the
          Septuagint, (a) as the equivalent of Jehovah; (b) as the rendering of
          Adonai; and (c) as the translation of a human honorific title applied
          to God (chiefly Adon), Jos_3:11; Psa_97:5. In the New Testament we
          find a somewhat similar threefold application of the name to Christ,
          (a) as a polite and respectful form of address, Mat_8:2; Mat_20:33;
          (b) as expressive of ownership and authority, without implying
          anything as to Christ's divine character and authority, Mat_21:3;
          Mat_24:42; and (c) with the highest connotation of authority,
          expressive of an exalted character, and in fact practically equivalent
          to the name "God," Mar_12:36-37; Luk_2:11; Luk_3:4; Act_2:36;
          1Co_12:3; Php_2:11. In some cases it is hard to determine the exact
          connotation of the title. Undoubtedly, after the exaltation of Christ,
          the name was generally applied to Him in the most exalted sense. But
          there are instances of its use even before the resurrection, where the
          specifically divine import of the title has evidently already been
          reached, as in Mat_7:22; Luk_5:8; Joh_20:28. There is a great
          difference of opinion among scholars respecting the origin and
          development of this title as applied to Jesus. In spite of all that
          has been advanced to the contrary, there is no reason to doubt that
          the use of the name, as applied to Jesus, is rooted in the Old
          Testament. There is one constant element in the history of the
          conception, and that is the element of authoritative ownership. The
          Epistles of Paul suggest the additional idea that it is an authority
          and ownership resting on antecedently acquired rights. It is doubtful,
          whether this element is already present in the Gospels.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE NATURES OF CHRIST.</p>
        <p>
          From the earliest times, and more particularly since the Council of
          Chalcedon, the Church confessed the doctrine of the two natures of
          Christ. The Council did not solve the problem presented by a person
          who was at once human and divine, but only sought to ward off some of
          the solutions which were offered and were clearly recognized as
          erroneous. And the Church accepted the doctrine of the two natures in
          one person, not because it had a complete understanding of the
          mystery, but because it clearly saw in it a mystery revealed by the
          Word of God. It was and remained ever since for the Church an article
          of faith, far beyond human comprehension. Rationalistic attacks on the
          doctrine were not entirely wanting, but the Church remained firm in
          the confession of this truth, in spite of the fact that it was once
          and again declared to be contrary to reason. In this confession Roman
          Catholics and Protestants stand shoulder to shoulder. But from the
          last part of the eighteenth century on this doctrine was made the butt
          of persistent attacks. The Age of Reason set in, and it was declared
          to be unworthy of man to accept on the authority of Scripture what was
          clearly contrary to human reason. That which did not commend itself to
          this new arbiter was simply declared to be erroneous. Individual
          philosophers and theologians now tried their hand at solving the
          problem presented by Christ, in order that they might offer the Church
          a substitute for the two- nature doctrine. They took their starting
          point in the human Jesus, and even after a century of painstaking
          research found in Jesus no more than a man with a divine element in
          Him. They could not rise to the recognition of Him as their Lord and
          their God. Schleiermacher spoke of a man with a supreme
          God-consciousness, Ritschl, of a man having the value of a God, Wendt,
          of a man standing in a continual inward fellowship of love with God,
          Beyschlag, of a God-filled man, and Sanday, of a man with an inrush of
          the divine in the sub-consciousness; â€” but Christ is and remains
          merely a man. To-day the liberal school represented by Harnack, the
          eschatological school of Weiss and Schweitzer, and the more recent
          school of comparative religion, headed by Bousset and Kirsopp Lake,
          all agree in denuding Christ of His true deity, and in reducing Him to
          human dimensions. To the first our Lord is merely a great ethical
          teacher; to the second, an apocalyptic seer; and to the third a
          peerless leader to an exalted destiny. They regard the Christ of the
          Church as the creation of Hellenism, or of Judaism, or of the two
          combined. To-day, however, the whole epistemology of the previous
          century is called in question, and the sufficiency of human reason for
          the interpretation of ultimate truth is seriously questioned. There is
          a new emphasis on revelation. And influential theologians, such as
          Barth and Brunner, Edwin Lewis and Nathaniel Micklem, do not hesitate
          to confess faith once more in the doctrine of the two natures. It is
          of the utmost importance to maintain this doctrine, as it was
          formulated by the Council of Chalcedon and is contained in our
          Confessional Standards.7
        </p>
        <p>
          1. SCRIPTURE PROOFS FOR THE DEITY OF CHRIST. In view of the widespread
          denial of the deity of Christ, it is of the utmost importance to be
          thoroughly conversant with the Scripture proof for it. The proof is so
          abundant that no one who accepts the Bible as the infallible Word of
          God can entertain any doubt on this point. For the ordinary
          classification of the Biblical proofs, as derived from the divine
          names, the divine attributes, the divine works, and the divine honor
          ascribed to Him, we would refer to the chapter on the Trinity. A
          somewhat different arrangement is followed here in view of the recent
          trend of historical criticism.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. In the Old Testament. Some have shown an inclination to deny that
          the Old Testament contains predictions of a divine Messiah, but this
          denial is quite untenable in view of such passages as Psa_2:6-12
          (Heb_1:5); Psa_45:6-7 (Heb_1:8-9); Psa_110:1 (Heb_1:13); Isa_9:6;
          Jer_23:6; Dan_7:13; Mic_5:2; Zec_13:7; Mal_3:1. Several of the latest
          historical scholars strongly insist on the fact that the doctrine of a
          superhuman Messiah was native to pre-Christian Judaism. Some even find
          in it the explanation for the supernatural Christology of parts of the
          New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. In the writings of John and Paul. It has been found quite
          impossible to deny that both John and Paul teach the deity of Christ.
          In the Gospel of John the most exalted view of the person of Christ is
          found, as appears from the following passages: Joh_1:1-3; Joh_1:14;
          Joh_1:18; Joh_2:24-25; Joh_3:16-18; Joh_3:35-36; Joh_4:14-15;
          Joh_5:18; Joh_5:20-22; Joh_5:25-27; Joh_11:41-44; Joh_20:28; 1Jn_1:3;
          1Jn_2:23; 1Jn_4:14-15; 1Jn_5:5; 1Jn_5:10-13; 1Jn_5:20. A similar view
          is found in the Pauline Epistles and in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
          Rom_1:7; Rom_9:5; 1Co_1:1-3; 1Co_2:8; 2Co_5:10; Gal_2:20; Gal_4:4;
          Php_2:6; Col_2:9; 2Ti_3:16; Heb_1:1-3; Heb_1:5; Heb_1:8; Heb_4:14;
          Heb_5:8, and so on. Critical scholars sought escape from the doctrine
          clearly taught in these writings in various ways as, for instance, by
          denying the historicity of the Gospel of John and the authenticity of
          many of the Epistles of Paul; by regarding the representations of
          John, Paul, and Hebrews as unwarranted interpretations, in the case of
          John and Hebrews especially under the influence of the Philonic Logos
          doctrine, and in the case of Paul under the same influence, or under
          that of his pre-Christian, Jewish views; or by ascribing to Paul a
          lower view than is found in John, namely, that of Christ as a
          pre-existent, heavenly man.
        </p>

          c. In the Synoptics. Some maintain that the Synoptics only furnish us
          with a true picture of Christ. They, it is said, portray the human,
          the truly historical Jesus, as contrasted with the idealized picture
          of the Fourth Gospel. But it is perfectly evident that the Christ of
          the Synoptics is just as truly divine as the Christ of John. He stands
          out as a supernatural person throughout, the Son of Man and the Son of
          God. His character and works justify His claim. Notice particularly
          the following passages: Mat_5:17; Mat_9:6; Mat_11:1-6; Mat_11:27;
          Mat_14:33; Mat_16:16-17; Mat_28:18; Mat_24:31 ff.; Mar_8:38, and many
          similar and parallel passages. Dr. Warfield's The Lord of Glory is
          very illuminating on this point.

          d. In the self-consciousness of Jesus. In recent years there has been
          a tendency to go back to the self-consciousness of Jesus and to deny
          that He was conscious of being the Messiah or the Son of God.
          Naturally, it is not possible to have any knowledge of the
          consciousness of Jesus, except through His words, as these are
          recorded in the Gospels; and it is always possible to deny that they
          correctly express the mind of Jesus. For those who accept the Gospel
          testimony there can be no doubt as to the fact that Jesus was
          conscious of being the very Son of God. The following passages bear
          witness to this: Mat_11:27 (Luk_10:22); Mat_21:37-38 (Mar_12:6;
          Luk_20:13); Mat_22:41-46 (Mar_13:35-37; Luk_20:41-44); Mat_24:36
          (Mar_13:32); Mat_28:19. Some of these passages testify to Jesus'
          Messianic consciousness; others to the fact that He was conscious of
          being the Son of God in the most exalted sense. There are several
          passages in Matthew and Luke, in which He speaks of the first person
          of the Trinity as "my Father," Mat_7:21; Mat_10:32-33; Mat_11:27;
          Mat_12:50; Mat_15:13; Mat_16:17; Mat_18:10; Mat_18:19; Mat_18:35;
          Mat_20:23; Mat_25:34; Mat_26:29; Mat_26:53; Luk_2:49; Luk_22:29;
          Luk_24:49. In the Gospel of John the consciousness of being the very
          Son of God is even more apparent in such passages as Joh_3:13;
          Joh_5:17-27; Joh_6:37-40; Joh_6:58; Joh_8:34-36; Joh_10:17-18;
          Joh_10:30; Joh_10:35-36, and other passages.

          2. SCRIPTURE PROOF FOR THE REAL HUMANITY OF CHRIST. There has been a
          time, when the reality (Gnosticism) and the natural integrity
          (Docetism, Apollinarianism) of the human nature of Christ was denied,
          but at present no one seriously questions the real humanity of Jesus
          Christ. In fact, there is at present an extreme emphasis on His
          veritable humanity, an ever-growing humanitarianism. The only divinity
          many still ascribe to Christ, is simply that of His perfect humanity.
          This modern tendency is, no doubt, in part a protest against a
          one-sided emphasis on the deity of Christ. Men have sometimes
          forgotten the human Christ in their reverence for the divine. It is
          very important to maintain the reality and integrity of the humanity
          of Jesus by admitting his human development and human limitations. The
          splendor of His deity should not be stressed to the extent of
          obscuring His real humanity. Jesus called Himself man, and is so
          called by others, Joh_8:40; Act_2:22; Rom_5:15; 1Co_15:21. The most
          common self-designation of Jesus, "the Son of Man," whatever
          connotation it may have, certainly also indicates the veritable
          humanity of Jesus. Moreover, it is said that the Lord came or was
          manifested in the flesh, Joh_1:14; 1Ti_3:16; 1Jn_4:2. In these
          passages the term "flesh" denotes human nature. The Bible clearly
          indicates that Jesus possessed the essential elements of human nature,
          that is, a material body and a rational soul, Mat_26:26; Mat_26:28;
          Mat_26:38; Luk_23:46; Luk_24:39; Joh_11:33; Heb_2:14. There are also
          passages which show that Jesus was subject to the ordinary laws of
          human development, and to human wants and sufferings, Luk_2:40;
          Luk_2:52; Heb_2:10; Heb_2:18; Heb_5:8. It is brought out in detail
          that the normal experiences of man's life were His, Mat_4:2; Mat_8:24;
          Mat_9:36; Mar_3:5; Luk_22:44; Joh_4:6; Joh_11:35; Joh_12:27;
          Joh_19:28; Joh_19:30; Heb_5:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.SCRIPTURE PROOF FOR THE SINLESS HUMANITY OF CHRIST. We ascribe to
          Christ not only natural, but also moral, integrity or moral
          perfection, that is sinlessness. This means not merely that Christ
          could avoid sinning (potuit non peccare), and did actually avoid it,
          but also that it was impossible for Him to sin (non potuit peccare)
          because of the essential bond between the human and the divine
          natures. The sinlessness of Christ has been denied by Martineau,
          Irving, Menken, Holsten, and Pfleiderer, but the Bible clearly
          testifies to it in the following passages: Luk_1:35; Joh_8:46;
          Joh_14:30; 2Co_5:21; Heb_4:15; Heb_9:14; 1Pe_2:22; 1Jn_3:5. While
          Christ was made to be sin judicially, yet ethically He was free from
          both hereditary depravity and actual sin. He never makes a confession
          of moral error; nor does He join His disciples in praying, "Forgive us
          our sins." He is able to challenge His enemies to convince Him of sin.
          Scripture even represents Him as the one in whom the ideal man is
          realized, Heb_2:8-9; 1Co_15:45; 2Co_3:18; Php_3:21. Moreover, the name
          "Son of Man," appropriated by Jesus, seems to intimate that He
          answered to the perfect ideal of humanity.

          4. THE NECESSITY OF THE TWO NATURES IN CHRIST. It appears from the
          preceding that, in the present day, many do not recognize the
          necessity of assuming two natures in Christ. To them Jesus is but a
          man; yet at the same time they feel constrained to ascribe to Him the
          value of a God, or to claim divinity for Him in virtue of the
          immanence of God in Him, or of the indwelling Spirit. The necessity of
          the two natures in Christ follows from what is essential to the
          Scriptural doctrine of the atonement.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The necessity of His manhood. Since man sinned, it was necessary
          that the penalty should be borne by man. Moreover, the paying of the
          penalty involved suffering of body and soul, such as only man is
          capable of bearing, Joh_12:27; Act_3:18; Heb_2:14; Heb_9:22. It was
          necessary that Christ should assume human nature, not only with all
          its essential properties, but also with all the infirmities to which
          it is liable after the fall, and should thus descend to the depths of
          degradation to which man had fallen, Heb_2:17-18. At the same time, He
          had to be a sinless man, for a man who was himself a sinner and who
          had forfeited his own life, certainly could not atone for others,
          Heb_7:26. Only such a truly human Mediator, who had experimental
          knowledge of the woes of mankind and rose superior to all temptations,
          could enter sympathetically into all the experiences, the trials, and
          the temptations of man, Heb_2:17-18; Heb_4:15 to Heb_5:2, and be a
          perfect human example for His followers, Mat_11:29; Mar_10:39;
          Joh_13:13-15; Php_2:5-8; Heb_12:2-4; 1Pe_2:21.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The necessity of His Godhead. In the divine plan of that the
          Mediator should also be very God. This was necessary, in order that
          (1) He might bring a sacrifice of infinite value and render perfect
          obedience to the law of God; (2) He might bear the wrath of God
          redemptively, that is, so as to free others from the curse of the law;
          and (3) He might be able to apply the fruits of His accomplished work
          to those who accepted Him by faith. Man with his bankrupt life can
          neither pay the penalty of sin, nor render perfect obedience to God.
          He can bear the wrath of God and, except for the redeeming grace of
          God, will have to bear it eternally, but he cannot bear it so as to
          open a way of escape, Psa_49:7-10; Psa_130:3.

          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY. What Old Testament persons bore the name
          'Jesus,' and in what respect did they typify the Saviour? Is the bare
          title 'the Messiah,' without a genitive or a pronominal suffix, ever
          found in the Old Testament? How does Dalman account for its occurence
          in Jewish apocalyptic literature? Do the terms 'the anointed of
          Jehovah,' 'His anointed,' and 'my anointed' always have the same
          meaning in the Old Testament? Whence comes the idea that believers
          share the anointing of Christ? What about the idea that the name 'Son
          of Man,' reduced to its probable Aramaic original, simply means 'man'?
          How about the idea of Weiss and Schweitzer that Jesus employed the
          name only in a futuristic sense? Did He use it before Peter's
          confession at CÃ¦sarea-Philippi? How do the liberals square their
          conception of Jesus as the Son of God only in a religious and ethical
          sense with the data of Scripture? What is the usual view of the origin
          of the Kurios-title? What theory was broached by Bousset and other
          liberal scholars? What accounts for the opposition to the two-natures
          doctrine? Is it a necessary doctrine, or is there some other doctrine
          that might take its place? What objections are there to the
          adoptionist doctrine;â€”to the Kenotic theories;â€”to the idea of a
          gradual incarnation;â€”to the Ritschlian view;â€”to Sanday's theory?
