        <h2>Chapter III. The Samaritan And Alexandrian Canons.</h2>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The Samaritan canon consists of the Pentateuch alone. This restricted
          collection is owing to the fact, that when the Samaritans separated
          from the Jews and began their worship on Gerizim, no more than the
          Mosaic writings had been invested by Ezra with canonical dignity. The
          hostile feeling between the rivals hindered the reception of books
          subsequently canonized. The idea of their having the oldest and most
          sacred part in its entirety satisfied their spiritual wants. Some have
          thought that the Sadducees, who already existed as a party before the
          Maccabean period, agreed with the Samaritans in rejecting all but the
          Pentateuch; yet this is doubtful. It is true that the Samaritans
          themselves say so;<a
            href="#note_79"
            id="noteref_79"
            class="pginternal"
            ><span class="tei tei-noteref"
              ><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super"
                >79</span

          >
          and that some of the church fathers, Origen, Jerome, and others agree;
          but little reliance can be put on the statement. The latter, perhaps,
          confounded the Samaritans and Sadducces. It is also noteworthy that
          Christ in refuting the Sadducees appeals to the Pentateuch alone; yet
          the conclusion, that he did so because of their admitting no more than
          that portion does not follow.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The Alexandrian canon differed from the Palestinian. The Greek
          translation commonly called the Septuagint contains some later
          productions which the Palestinian Jews did not adopt, not only from
          their aversion to Greek literature generally, but also from the recent
          origin of the books, perhaps also their want of prophetic sanction.
          The closing line of the third part in the Alexandrian canon was more
          or less fluctuating—capable of admitting recent writings appearing
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg047"></a>
          under the garb of old names and histories, of embracing religious
          subjects; while the Palestinian collection was pretty well determined,
          and all but finally settled. The judgment of the Alexandrians was
          freer than that of their brethren in the mother country. They had even
          separated in a measure from the latter, by erecting a temple at
          Leontopolis; and their enlargement of the canon was another step of
          divergence. Nor had they the criterion of language for the separation
          of canonical and uncanonical; both classes were before them in the
          same tongue. The enlarged canon was not formally sanctioned; it had
          not the approval of the Sanhedrim; yet it was to the Alexandrians what
          the Palestinian one was to the Palestinians. If Jews who were not well
          acquainted with Hebrew, used the apocryphal and canonical books alike,
          it was a matter of feeling and custom; and if those who knew the old
          language better, adhered to the canonical more closely, it was a
          matter of tradition and language. The former set little value on the
          prevalent consciousness of the race that the spirit of prophecy was
          extinct; their view of the Spirit's operation was larger. The latter
          clung to the past with all the more tenacity that the old life of the
          nation had degenerated.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The Alexandrian Jews opened their minds to Greek culture and
          philosophy, appropriating new ideas, and explaining their Scriptures
          in accordance with wider conceptions of the divine presence; though
          such adaptation turned aside the original sense. Consciously or
          unconsciously they were preparing Judaism in some degree to be the
          religion of humanity. But the Rabbins shut out those enlarging
          influences, confining their religion within the narrow traditions of
          one people. The process by which they conserved the old belief helped
          to quench its spirit, so that it became an antique skeleton, powerless
          beside the new civilization which had followed the wake of Alexander's
          conquests. Rabbinical Judaism proved its incapacity for regenerating
          the world; having no affinity for the philosophy of second
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg048"></a> causes, or for the exercise
          of reason beneath the love of a Father who sees with equal eye as God
          of all. Its isolation nourished a sectarian tendency. Tradition,
          having no creative power like revelation, had taken the place of it;
          and it could not ward off the senility of Judaism; for its creations
          are but feeble echoes of prophetic utterances, weak imitations of
          poetic inspiration or of fresh wisdom. They are of the understanding
          rather than the reason. The tradition which Geiger describes as the
          life-giving soul of Judaism—the daughter of revelation, enjoying the
          same rights with her mother—a spiritual power that continues ever to
          work—an emanation from the divine Spirit—is not, indeed, the thing
          which has stiffened Judaism into Rabbinism; but neither is it
          tradition proper; it is reason working upon revelation, and moulding
          it into a new system.
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">Such tradition</span></em
          >
          serves but to show the inability of genuine Judaism to assimilate
          philosophic thought.
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">Rationalizing</span></em

          should not be styled the operation of tradition.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The truth of these remarks is evident from a comparison of two books,
          exemplifying Alexandrian and Palestinian Judaism respectively. The
          Wisdom of Solomon shows the enlarging effect of Greek philosophy.
          Overpassing Jewish particularism, it often approaches Christianity in
          doctrine and spirit, so that some<a
            href="#note_80"
            id="noteref_80"
            class="pginternal"
            ><span class="tei tei-noteref"
              ><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super"

              ></span
            ></a
          >
          have even assumed a Christian origin for it. The Wisdom of Jesus, son
          of Sirach has not the doctrine of immortality. Death is there an
          eternal sleep, and retribution takes place in this life. The Jewish
          theocracy is the centre of history; Israel the elect people; and all
          wisdom is embodied in the law. The writer is shut up within the old
          national ideas, and leans upon the writings in which they are
          expressed. Thus the Hagiographical canon of Judea, conservative as it
          is, and purer in a sense, presents a narrower type than the best
          specimens of the Alexandrian one. The genial breath of Aryan culture
          had not expanded its Semitism.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The identity of the Palestinian and Alexandrian canons must be
          abandoned, notwithstanding the contrary arguments of Eichhorn and
          Movers. It is said, indeed, that Philo neither mentions nor quotes the
          Greek additions; but neither does he quote several canonical books.
          According to Eichhorn, no fewer than eight of the latter are unnoticed
          by him.<a href="#note_81" id="noteref_81" class="pginternal"
            ><span class="tei tei-noteref"

          Besides, he had peculiar views of inspiration, and quoted loosely from
          memory. Believing as he did in the inspiration of the Greek version as
          a whole, it is difficult to think that he made a distinction between
          the different parts of it. In one passage he refers to the sacred
          books of the Therapeutae, a fanatical sect of Jews in Egypt, as
          <span class="tei tei-q"

          but this presents little information as to the canon of the Egyptian
          Jews generally; for it is precarious argumentation to say with Herbst
          that they prove a twofold canon. Even if the Alexandrian and
          Palestinian canons be identical, we cannot be sure that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">the other books</span></em
          >
          which the Therapeutae read as holy besides the law,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">the prophets and hymns</span></em
          >, differed from the hagiographa, and so constituted another canon
          than the general Egyptian one. It is quite possible that the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">hymns</span></em
          >
          mean the Psalms; and
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">the other books</span></em
          >, the rest of the hagiographa. The argument for the identity of the
          two canons deduced from 4 Esdras xiv. 44, &amp;c., as if the
          twenty-four open books were distinguished from the other writings
          dictated to Ezra, is of no force, because verisimilitude required that
          an Egyptian Jew himself must make Ezra conform to the old Palestinian
          canon. It is also alleged that the grandson of Jesus Sirach, who
          translated his grandfather's work during his abode in Egypt, knew no
          difference between the Hebrew and Greek canon, though he speaks of the
          Greek version; but he speaks as a Palestinian, without having occasion
          to allude to the difference between the canonical
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg050"></a> books of the Palestinian
          and Egyptian Jews. The latter may have reckoned the apocryphal
          writings in the third division; and therefore the translator of Jesus
          Sirach could recognize them in the ordinary classification. The
          mention of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em
          >
          classes is not opposed to their presence in the third. The general use
          of an enlarged canon in Egypt cannot be denied, though it was somewhat
          loose, not regarded as a completed collection, and without express
          rabbinical sanction. If they did not
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">formally</span></em
          >
          recognize a canon of their own, as De Wette says of them, they had and
          used one larger than the Palestinian, without troubling themselves
          about a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></em
          >
          sanction for it by a body of Rabbis at Jerusalem or elsewhere. Their
          canon was not identical with that of the Palestinians, and all the
          argumentation founded upon Philo's non-quotation of the apocryphal
          books, fails to prove the contrary. The very way in which apocryphal
          are inserted among canonical books in the Alexandrian canon, shows the
          equal rank assigned to both. Esdras first and second succeed the
          Chronicles; Tobit and Judith are between Nehemiah and Esther; the
          Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach follow Canticles; Baruch succeeds
          Jeremiah; Daniel is followed by Susanna and other productions of the
          same class; and the whole closes with the three books of Maccabees.
          Such is the order in the Vatican MS.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The threefold division of the canon, indicating three stages in its
          formation, has continued. Josephus, indeed, gives another, based on
          the nature of the separate books, not on MSS. We learn nothing from
          him of its history, which is somewhat remarkable, considering that he
          did not live two centuries after the last work had been added. The
          account of the canon's final arrangement was evidently unknown to him.
