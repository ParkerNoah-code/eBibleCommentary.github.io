          of Sirach; while the Zurich codex of the New Testament has marginal

          Œcolampadius. The articles of that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Union”</span> are copied from Morel's account
          of his transactions with Œcolampadius and Bucer in 1530. The
          literature of this people was altered by Hussite influences and the
          Reformation; so that though differing little from the Romanists at
          first except in ecclesiastical discipline, they diverged widely
          afterwards by adopting the Protestant canon and doctrines.<a

          The canon of the Anglican Church (1562), given in the sixth article of
          religion, defines holy Scripture to be
          <span class="tei tei-q"
            >“those canonical books of the Old and New Testament, of whose
            authority was never any doubt in the Church.”</span

          After giving the names and number of the canonical books, the article
          prefaces the apocryphal ones with,
          <span class="tei tei-q"

            following,”</span

          &amp;c., &amp;c. At the end it is stated that
          <span class="tei tei-q"
            >“all the books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received,
            we do receive and account them canonical.”</span

          The article is ambiguous. If the canonical books enumerated are those
          meant in the phrase
          <span class="tei tei-q"
            >“of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church,”</span
          >
          the statement is incorrect. If a distinction is implied between the
          canonical books and such canonical ones as have never been doubted in
          the Church, the meaning is obscure. In either case the language is not
          explicit.

          The Scottish or Westminster Confession of Faith gives a list of all
          the books of the Old and New Testaments as the Word of God written;
          adding that those called the apocrypha are not of divine inspiration,

          The Roman Catholic canon was finally determined at the Council of
          Trent (1546), which adopted all the books in the Vulgate as sacred and
          canonical, without distinction. Third and fourth Esdras, third
          Maccabees, and the prayer of Manasseh were not included; though the
          first and last appeared in the original Clementine edition of 1592,
          but apart from the canonical books. They are not in the Sixtine
          edition of 1590.<a

          A council at Florence in 1441 had set the example which was followed
          at Trent. But this stringent decree did not prevent individual
          Catholics from making a distinction between the books, in assuming a
          first and second canon or proto-canonical and deutero-canonical books;
          as did Sixtis Senensis, B. Lamy, Anton a matre Dei, Jahn, and others;
          though it is hardly consistent with orthodox Catholicism or the view
          of those who passed the decree. When the writings are said to be of
          different authority—some more, others less—the intent of the council
          is violated. The Vatican council (1870) confirmed the Tridentine
          decree respecting the canon.
