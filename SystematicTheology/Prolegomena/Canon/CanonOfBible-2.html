          Chapter II. The Old Testament Canon From Its Beginning To Its Close.
        </h2>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The first important part of the Old Testament put together as a whole
          was the Pentateuch, or rather, the five books of Moses and Joshua.
          This was preceded by smaller documents, which one or more redactors
          embodied in it. The earliest things committed to writing were probably
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">the ten words</span></span
          >
          proceeding from Moses himself, afterwards enlarged into the ten
          commandments which exist at present in two recensions (Exod. xx.,
          Deut. v.) It is true that we have the oldest form of the decalogue
          from the Jehovist not the Elohist; but that is no valid objection
          against the antiquity of the nucleus, out of which it arose. It is
          also probable that several legal and ceremonial enactments belong, if
          not to Moses himself, at least to his time; as also the Elohistic list
          of stations in Numbers xxxiii. To the same time belongs the song of
          Miriam in Exodus xv., probably consisting of a few lines at first, and
          subsequently enlarged; with a triumphal ode over the fall of Heshbon
          (Numbers xxi. 27-30). The little poetical piece in Numbers xxi. 17,
          18, afterwards misunderstood and so taken literally, is post-Mosaic.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          During the unsettled times of Joshua and the Judges there could have
          been comparatively little writing. The song of Deborah appeared, full
          of poetic force and fire. The period of the early kings was
          characterized not only by a remarkable development of the Hebrew
          people and their consolidation into a national state, but by fresh
          literary activity.

          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg014"></a>
          Laws were written out for the guidance of priests and people; and the
          political organization of the rapidly growing nation was promoted by
          poetical productions in which spiritual life expressed its
          aspirations. Schools of prophets were instituted by Samuel, whose
          literary efforts tended to purify the worship. David was an
          accomplished poet, whose psalms are composed in lofty strains; and
          Solomon may have written a few odes. The building of the temple, and
          the arrangements connected with its worship, contributed materially to
          a written legislation.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          During this early and flourishing period appeared the book of the Wars
          of Jehovah,<a href="#note_31" id="noteref_31" class="pginternal"

          Above all, the Elohists now appeared, the first of whom, in the reign
          of Saul, was author of annals, beginning at the earliest time which
          were distinguished by genealogical and chronological details as well
          as systematic minuteness, by archaic simplicity, and by legal
          prescriptions more theoretical than practical. The long genealogical
          registers with an artificial chronology and a statement of the years
          of men's lives, the dry narratives, the precise accounts of the
          gradual enlargement of divine laws, the copious description of the
          tabernacle and the institution of divine worship, are wearisome,
          though pervaded by a theoretic interest which looks at everything from
          a legal point of view. A second or junior Elohist was less methodical
          and more fragmentary, supplying additional information, furnishing new
          theocratic details, and setting forth the relation of Israel to
          heathen nations and to God. In contrast with his predecessor, he has
          great beauty of description, which is exemplified in the account of
          Isaac's sacrifice and the history of Joseph; in picturesque and
          graphic narratives interspersed with few reflections. His parallels to
          the later writer
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg015"></a>
          commonly called the Jehovist, are numerous. The third author, who
          lived in the time of Uzziah, though more mythological than the
          Elohists, was less formal. His stand-point is prophetic. The third
          document incorporated with the Elohistic ones formed an important part
          of the whole, exhibiting a vividness which the first lacked; with
          descriptions of persons and things from another stand-point. The
          Jehovist belonged to the northern kingdom; the Elohists were of Judah.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The state of the nation after Rehoboam was unfavorable to literature.
          When the people were threatened and attacked by other nations, divided
          among themselves in worship and all higher interests, rent by
          conflicting parties, the theocratic principle which was the true bond
          of union could not assert itself with effect. The people were corrupt;
          their religious life debased. The example of the kings was usually
          prejudicial to political healthiness. Contact with foreigners as well
          as with the older inhabitants of the land, hindered progress. In these
          circumstances the prophets were the true reformers, the advocates of
          political liberty, expositors of the principles that give life and
          stability to a nation. In Judah, Joel wrote prophetic discourses; in
          Israel, Amos and Hosea. Now, too, a redactor put together the
          Elohistic and Jehovistic documents, making various changes in them,
          adding throughout sentences or words that seemed desirable, and
          suppressing what was unsuited to his taste. Several psalm-writers
          enriched the national literature after David. Learned men at the court
          of Hezekiah recast and enlarged (Proverbs xxv.-xxix.) the national
          proverbs, which bore Solomon's name because the nucleus of an older
          collection belonged to that monarch. These literary courtiers were not
          prophets, but rather scribes. The book of Job was written, with the
          exception of Elihu's later discourses, which were not inserted in it
          till after the return from Babylon; and Deuteronomy, with Joshua, was
          added to the preceding collection in the reign of Manasseh.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg016"></a>
          The gifted author of Deuteronomy, who was evidently imbued with the
          prophetic spirit, completed the Pentateuch,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span
          >, the five books of Moses and Joshua, revising the Elohist-Jehovistic
          work, and making various additions and alterations. He did the same
          thing to the historical books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings; which
          received from him their present form. Immediately before and during
          the exile there were numerous authors and compilers. New psalms
          appeared, more or less national in spirit. Ezekiel, Jeremiah and
          others prophesied; especially an unknown seer who described the
          present condition of the people, predicting their coming glories and
          renovated worship in strains of far-reaching import.<a

          This great prophet expected the regeneration of the nation from the
          pious portion of it, the prophets in particular, not from a kingly
          Messiah as Isaiah did; for the hopes resting on rulers out of David's
          house had been disappointed. His aspirations turned to spiritual
          means. He was not merely an enthusiastic seer with comprehensive
          glance, but also a practical philosopher who set forth the doctrine of
          the innocent suffering for the guilty; differing therein from
          Ezekiel's theory of individual reward and punishment in the present
          world—a theory out of harmony with the circumstances of actual life.
          The very misfortunes of the nation, and the signs of their return,
          excited within the nobler spirits hopes of a brighter future, in which
          the flourishing reign of David should be surpassed by the universal
          worship of Jehovah. In consequence of their outward condition, the
          prophets of the exile were usually writers, like Ezekiel, not public
          speakers; and their announcement of glad tidings could only be
          transmitted privately from person to person. This explains in part the
          oblivion into which their names fell; so that the author or redactor
          of Jeremiah l., li.; the author of chapters xiii.-xiv. 23, xxi. 1-10,
          xxiv.-xxvii., xxxiv., xxxv., inserted in Isaiah; and, above all, the
          Babylonian Isaiah, whom Hitzig improbably
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg017"></a>
          identifies with the high-priest Joshua, are unknown. After the return
          from Babylon the literary spirit manifested itself in the prophets of
          the restoration—Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi—who wrote to recall
          their countrymen to a sense of religious duties; though their ideas
          were borrowed in part from older prophets of more original genius. The
          book of Esther appeared, to make the observance of the purim feast,
          which was of Persian origin, more general in Palestine. The large
          historical work comprising the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, and
          Chronicles, was compiled partly out of materials written by Ezra and
          Nehemiah, partly out of older historical records which formed a
          portion of the national literature. Several temple-psalms were also
          composed; a part of the present book of Proverbs; Ecclesiastes, whose
          tone and language betray its late origin; and Jonah, whose diction
          puts its date after the Babylonian captivity. The Maccabean age called
          forth the book of Daniel and various psalms. In addition to new
          productions there was an inclination to collect former documents. To
          Zechariah's authentic prophecies were added the earlier ones contained
          in chapters ix.-xiv.; and the Psalms were gradually brought together,
          being made up into divisions at different times; the first and second
          divisions proceeding from one redactor, the third from another, the
          fourth and fifth from a still later. Various writings besides their
          own were grouped around the names of earlier prophets, as was the case
          with Isaiah and Jeremiah.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The literature is more indebted for its best constituents to the
          prophetic than to the priestly order, because the prophets were
          preachers of repentance and righteousness whose great aim was to make
          Israel a Jehovah-worshipping nation to the exclusion of other gods.
          Their utterances were essentially ethical and religious; their
          pictures of the future subjective and ideal. There was silently
          elaborated in their schools a spiritual monotheism, over against the
          crude polytheism of the people generally—a theocratic ideal
          inadequately
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg018"></a> apprehended by gross and
          sensuous Israel—Jehovism simple and sublime amid a sacerdotal worship
          which left the heart impure while cleansing the hands. Instead of
          taking their stand upon the law, with its rules of worship, its
          ceremonial precepts and penalties against transgressors, the prophets
          set themselves above it, speaking slightingly of the forms and customs
          which the people took for the whole of religion. To the view of such
          as were prepared to receive a faith that looked for its realization to
          the future, they helped to create a millennium, in which the worship
          of Jehovah alone should become the basis of a universal religion for
          humanity. In addition to the prophetic literature proper, they wrote
          historical works also. How superior this literature is to the
          priestly, appears from a comparison of the Kings and Chronicles. The
          subjective underlies the one; the objective distinguishes the other.
          Faith in Jehovah, clothed, it may be in sensible or historical forms,
          characterizes the one; reference of an outward order to a divine
          source, the other. The sanctity of a people under the government of a
          righteous God, is the object of the one; the sanctity of institutions,
          that of the other. Even when the prophets wrote history,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">the facts</span></em
          >
          are subordinate to
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">the belief</span></em
          >. Subjective purposes colored their representation of real events.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          To them we are indebted for the Messianic idea, the hope of a better
          time in which their high ideal of the theocracy should be realized.
          With such belief in the future, with pious aspirations enlivening
          their patriotism, did they comfort and encourage their countrymen. The
          hope, general or indefinite at first, was afterwards attached to the
          house of David, out of which a restorer of the theocracy was expected,
          a king pre-eminent in righteousness, and marvelously gifted. It was
          not merely a political but a religious hope, implying the thorough
          purification of the nation, the extinction of idolatry, the general
          spread and triumph of true religion. The pious wishes of the prophets,
          often repeated,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg019"></a>
          became a sort of doctrine, and contributed to sustain the failing
          spirit of the people. The indefinite idea of a golden age was commoner
          than that of a personal prince who should reign in equity and peace.
          Neither was part of the national faith, like the law, or the doctrine
          of sacrifice; and but a few of the prophets portrayed a king, in their
          description of the period of ideal prosperity.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The man who first gave public sanction to a portion of the national
          literature was Ezra, who laid the foundation of a canon. He was the
          leader in restoring the theocracy after the exile,
          <span class="tei tei-q"
            >“a ready scribe in the law of Moses, who had prepared his heart to
            seek the law of the Lord and to teach in Israel statutes and
            judgments.”</span
          >
          As we are told that he brought the book of the law of Moses before the
          congregation and read it publicly, the idea naturally arises that he
          was the final redactor of the Pentateuch, separating it from the
          historical work consisting of Joshua and the subsequent writings, of
          which it formed the commencement. Such was the first canon given to
          the Jewish Church after its reconstruction—ready for temple service as
          well as synagogue use. Henceforward the Mosaic book became an
          authoritative guide in spiritual, ecclesiastical, and civil matters,
          as we infer from various passages in Ezra and Nehemiah and from the
          chronicler's own statements in the book bearing his name. The doings
          of Ezra with regard to the Scriptures are deduced not only from what
          we read of him in the Biblical book that bears his name, but also from
          the legend in the fourth book of Ezdras,<a
            href="#note_35"

          where it is related that he dictated by inspiration to five ready
          writers ninety-four books; the first twenty-four of which he was
          ordered to publish openly that the worthy and unworthy might read, but
          reserved the last seventy for the wise. Though the twenty-four books
          of the Old Testament cannot be attributed to him, the fact that he
          copied and wrote portions need not be questioned. He edited
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">the law</span></em

          collection of books, and giving it an authority which it had not
          before. Talmudic accounts associate with him the men of the great
          synagogue. It is true that they are legendary, but there is a
          foundation of fact beneath the fanciful superstructure. As to Ezra's
          treatment of the Pentateuch, or his specific mode of redaction, we are
          left for the most part to conjecture. Yet it is safe to affirm that he
          added;—making new precepts and practices either in place of or beside
          older ones. Some things he removed as unsuited to the altered
          circumstances of the people; others he modified. He threw back later
          enactments into earlier times. It is difficult to discover all the
          parts that betray his hand. Some elaborate priestly details show his
          authorship most clearly. If his hand be not visible in Leviticus,
          chap. xvii.-xxvi.; a writer not far removed from his time is
          observable; Ezekiel or some other. It is clear that some of the
          portion (xxv. 19-22; xxvi. 3-45) is much later than the Elohists, and
          belongs to the exile or post-exile period. But great difficulty
          attaches to the separation of the sources here used; even after
          Kayser's acute handling of them. It is also perceptible from Ezekiel
          xx. 25, 26, that the clause in Exodus xiii. 15,
          <span class="tei tei-q"
            >“but all the first-born of my children I redeem,”</span
          >
          was added after the exile, since the prophet shows his unacquaintance
          with it. The statute that all which openeth the womb should be burnt
          in sacrifice to Jehovah, appeared inhuman not only to Ezekiel, but to
          Ezra or his associates in re-editing the law; and therefore the clause
          about the redemption of every first-born male was subjoined. Ezra, a
          second Moses in the eyes of the later Jews, did not scruple to refer
          to Moses what was of recent origin, and to deal freely with the
          national literature. Such was the first canon—that of Ezra the priest
          and scribe.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The origin of the great synagogue is noticed in Ezra x. 16, and
          described more particularly in Nehemiah viii.-x., the members being
          apparently enumerated in x. 1-27; at least the Megila Jer. (i. 5) and
          Midrash Ruth (§ 3) speak
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg021"></a> of an assembly of
          eighty-five elders, who are probably found in the last passage. One
          name, however, is wanting, for only eighty-four are given; and as Ezra
          is not mentioned among them, the conjecture of Krochmal that it has
          dropped out of x. 9, may be allowed. Another tradition gives the
          number as one hundred and twenty, which may be got by adding the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“chief of the fathers”</span> enumerated in
          Ezra viii. 1-14 to the hundred and two heads of families in Ezra ii.
          2-58. Whether the number was the same at the commencement as
          afterwards is uncertain. Late Jewish writers, however, such as
          Abarbanel, Abraham ben David, Ben Maimun, &amp;c., speak as if it
          consisted of the larger number at the beginning; and have no scruple
          in pronouncing Ezra president, rather than Nehemiah.<a

          <span class="tei tei-q">“a ready scribe,”</span> and his labors in
          connection with the law were important, he may have organized a body
          of literary men who should work in harmony, attending, among other
          things, to the collection and preservation of the national literature;
          or they may have been an association of patriotic men who voluntarily
          rallied round the heads of the new state, to support them in their
          fundamental reforms. The company of scribes mentioned in 1 Maccabees

          was not completed prior to 300

          called a historical parable composed for a didactic purpose, giving a
          milder, larger view of Jehovah's favor than the orthodox one, that
          excluded the Gentiles. Ruth, containing an idyllic story with an
          unfinished genealogy attached, meant to glorify the house of David,
          and presenting a kindred spirit towards a people uniformly hated, was
          appended to Judges; but was subsequently transferred to the third
          canon. It was written immediately after the return from the Babylonian
          captivity; for the Chaldaising language points to this date,
          notwithstanding the supposed archaisms discovered in it by some. In
          like manner, the Lamentations, originally added to Jeremiah, were
          afterwards put into the later or third canon. Joshua, which had been
          separated from the five books of Moses with which it was closely
          joined at first, formed, with the other historical portion (Judges,
          Samuel, Kings), the proper continuation of Ezra's canon. The prophets
          included the three greater and twelve minor. With Isaiah's authentic
          oracles were incorporated the last twenty-seven chapters, belonging
          for the most part to an anonymous prophet of the exile, besides
          several late pieces inserted in the first thirty-nine chapters. Men of
          prophetic gifts wrote in the name of distinguished prophets, and put
          their productions with those of the latter, or adapted and wrote them
          over after their own <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg024"></a>
          fashion. The fiftieth and fifty-first chapters of Jeremiah show such
          over-writing. To Zechariah's authentic oracles were attached chapters
          ix.-xiv., themselves made up of two parts (ix.-xi., xii.-xiv.)
          belonging to different times and authors prior to the destruction of
          the Jewish state by the Babylonians.

          The character of the synagogue's proceedings in regard to the books of
          Scripture can only be deduced from the conduct of Ezra himself, as
          well as the prevailing views and wants of the times. The scribes who
          began with Ezra, seeing how he acted, would naturally follow his
          example, not hesitating to revise the text

          They did not refrain from changing what had been written, or from
          inserting fresh matter. Some of their novelties can be discerned even
          in the Pentateuch. Their chief work, however, related to the

            ><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em

          The prophetic canon ended with Malachi's oracles. And it was made
          sometime after he prophesied, because the general consciousness that
          the function ceased with him required a considerable period for its
          growth. The fact that it included Jonah and Ruth brings the completion

          and the prologue of Jesus Sirach presupposes its formation. Such was
          the second canon, which had been made up gradually (444-290

          Another view of the collection in question has been taken by various
          scholars. According to a passage in the second book of Maccabees, the
          second canon originated with Nehemiah, who
          <span class="tei tei-q"
            >“gathered together the acts of the kings and the prophets and

          These words are obscure. They occur in a letter purporting to be sent
          by the Sanhedrim at Jerusalem to the Jews in Egypt, which contains
          apocryphal things; a letter which assigns to Nehemiah the merit of
          various arrangements rather belonging to Ezra. It is difficult to
          understand the meaning of
          <span class="tei tei-q"
            >“the epistles of the kings concerning the offerings.”</span

          If they were the documents of heathen or Persian kings favorable to
          the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its temple, would they not have been
          rejected from a collection of sacred books belonging to the chosen
          people? They might perhaps have been adopted had they been interwoven
          with the holy books themselves, like portions of Ezra and Nehemiah;
          but they could not have formed a distinct part of the national
          literature, because they were foreign and heathen. Again,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the psalms of David”</span> cannot have
          existed in the time of Nehemiah, if the phrase includes the whole
          collection. It may perhaps refer to the first three divisions of the
          book, as Herzfeld thinks; but these contain many odes which are not
          David's; while earlier ones belong to the last two divisions of the
          Psalm-book. In like manner,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the prophets”</span> could not all have
          belonged to this canon; neither Malachi, who was later, nor Jonah. The
          account will not bear strict examination, and must be pronounced
          apocryphal. Nehemiah was a statesman, not a priest or scribe; a
          politician, not a literary man. It is true that he may have had
          assistants, or committed the work to competent hands; but this is
          conjectural. The account of his supposed canon hardly commends itself
          by inherent truthfulness or probability, though it is accepted by
          Ewald and Bleek.

          When the great synagogue ceased, there was an interval during which it
          is not clear whether the sacred books were neglected, except by
          private individuals; or whether they were studied, copied, and
          collected by a body of scribes. Perhaps the scribes and elders of the
          Hasmonæan time were active at intervals in this department. The
          institution of a senate by Judas Maccabaeus is supposed to be favored
          by 2 Maccabees (chapter i. 10-ii. 18); but the passage furnishes poor
          evidence of the thing. Judas is there made to write to Egypt in the
          year of the Seleucidae 188, though he died thirty-six years before,

          Midrash in Bereshith Rabba (§ 65) makes him one of the sixty Hassidim

          After Jonathan and Simon, it may have been suspended for a while, in
          consequence of the persecution and anarchy prevailing in Judea; till
          the great Sanhedrim at Jerusalem succeeded it, under Hyrcanus I.

          We believe that it was earlier than Judas Maccabaeus. Of its

          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027"></span

          Like their predecessors of the great synagogue, the Hasmonæan elders
          revised the text freely, putting into it explanatory or corrective
          additions, which were not always improvements. The way in which they
          used the book of Esther, employing it as a medium of Halachite
          prescription, shows a treatment involving little idea of sacredness
          attaching to the Hagiographa.

          is difficult to explain all on that hypothesis, without attributing
          confusion to the places where they occur. If the body in question be
          not allowed, an interval of about sixty years elapsed between the
          great synagogue and the Sanhedrim, during which the hagiographical
          writings were comparatively neglected, though literary activity did
          not cease. No authoritative association, at least, dealt with them.
          This is improbable. It is true that we read of no distinguished
          teachers in the interval, except Antigonus of Socho, disciple of Simon
          the Just; but the silence can hardly weigh against a reasonable
          presumption. One thing is clear, viz., that Antigonus did not reach
          down to the time of the first pair that presided over the Sanhedrim.

          The contents of the third canon,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span
          >, Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Canticles, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel,
          Ezra, Nehemiah, Chronicles, the formation of which we assign to the
          Hasmonæan gerusia, were multifarious, differing widely from one
          another in age, character, and value—poetical, prophetic, didactic,
          historical. Such as seemed worthy of preservation, though they had not
          been included in the second canon,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg028"></a> were gathered together
          during the space of an hundred and fifty years. The oldest part
          consisted of psalms supposed to belong to David. The first psalm,
          which contains within itself traces of late authorship, was prefixed
          as an introduction to the whole collection now put into the third
          canon. Next to the Psalms were Proverbs, Job, Canticles, which, though
          non-prophetic and probably excluded on that account from the second
          canon, must have existed before the exile. Enriched with the latest
          additions, they survived the national disasters, and claimed a place
          next to the Psalms. They were but a portion of the literature current
          in and after the 5th century
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span
          >, as may be inferred from the epilogue to Ecclesiastes, and the
          Wisdom of Sirach. The historical work compiled by the chronicle-writer
          was separated, Ezra being put first as the most important part, and
          referring also to the church of the 6th and 5th centuries whose
          history had not been written. The Chronicles themselves were placed
          last, being considered of less value than the first part, as they
          contained the summary of a period already described, though with
          numerous adaptations to post-exile times. The youngest portion
          consisted of the book of Daniel, not written till the Maccabean period
          (between 170 and 160

          collection to make the whole number 150. These late odes savor of the
          Maccabean time; and are fitly illustrated by the history given in the
          first book of Maccabees. The list continued open; dominated by no
          stringent principle of selection, and with a character somewhat
          indefinite. It was called

          Several books put into the third canon,—as Job, Proverbs, the greater
          number of the Psalms, &amp;c.,—existed when the second was made. But
          the latter collection was pre-eminently
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">prophetic</span></em
          >; and it was that idea of the origin and contents of the books in it
          which regulated its extent. Bloch's supposition that the parts of the
          third collection then existing were not looked upon as holy, but
          merely as productions embodying human wisdom, and were therefore
          excluded, is improbable. We do not think that an alteration of opinion
          about them in the course of a century or more, by which they became
          divine and holy instead of human, is a satisfactory explanation. The
          Psalms of David and the book of Job must have been as highly esteemed
          in the period of the great synagogue's existence as they were at a
          later time. Other considerations besides the divinity and holiness of
          books contributed to their introduction into a canon. Ecclesiastes was
          taken into the third collection because it was attributed to Solomon.
          The Song of Songs was understood allegorically,—a fact which, in
          addition to its supposed Solomonic authorship, determined its
          adoption. And even after their canonical reception, whether by the
          great synagogue or another body, the character of books
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg030"></a>
          was canvassed. It was so with Ecclesiastes, in spite of the

          While the third canon was being made, the soferim, as the successors
          of the prophets, were active as before; and though interpretation was
          their chief duty, they must have revised and corrected the sacred
          books to some extent. We need not hesitate to allow that they
          sometimes arranged parts, and even added matter of their own. In the
          time of the canon's entire preparation, they and the priests, with
          writers and scholars generally, redacted the national literature,

          preceded as it had been by other divisions, the last of which was very
          similar to the one that became final. Several inscriptions and
          historical notices were prefixed. The inscriptions, however, belong to
          very different times, their historical parts being usually older than
          the musical; and date from the first collection to the period of the
          Hasmonean college, when the final redaction of the entire Psalter took
          place. Those in the first three books existed at the time when the
          latter were made up; those in the last two were prefixed partly at the
          time when the collections themselves were made, and partly in the
          Maccabean age. How often they are out of harmony with the poems

          Ecclesiastes, are unnoticed in the latter. The argument drawn from
          Matthew xxiii. 35, that the Chronicles were then the last book of the
          canon, is inconclusive; as the Zechariah there named was probably
          different from the Zechariah in 2 Chronicles xxiv. None of these

          The closing of the third canon cannot be assigned, with Bloch, to the

          In like manner, Maccabean psalms are adverse to the hypothesis that
          the great synagogue completed the third canon. In consequence of these
          late productions, it is impossible to assert that the men of the
          synagogue were the redactors of the Psalter as it is. It is true that
          the collection was made before the Chronicles and many other books of
          the hagiographical canon; but the

          Psalter did not appear till the Maccabean period. The canon, however,
          was not considered to be finally closed in the first century before
          and the next after Christ. There were doubts about some portions. The
          book of Ezekiel gave offence, because some of its statements seemed to
          contradict the law. Doubts about others were of a more serious nature;
          about Ecclesiastes, the Canticles, Esther, and the Proverbs. The first

          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg034"></a>
          was impugned because it had contradictory passages and a heretical
          tendency; the second, because of its worldly and sensual tone; Esther
          for its want of religiousness; and Proverbs on account of
          inconsistencies. This scepticism went far to procure the exclusion of
          the suspected works from the canon, and their relegation to the class
          of the

          R. Eleasar ben Asaria was chosen patriarch, and Gamaliel the second,
          deposed. Here it was decided, not unanimously however, but by a

          The matter was debated hastily, and determined for the time by a
          majority. But the synod at Jamnia consisted of 72 persons; and a
          passage in the treatise Yadayim refers to it.<a

          <span class="tei tei-q"

          As the Hagiographa were not read in public, with the exception of
          Esther, opinions of the Jewish rabbins might still differ about
          Canticles and Ecclesiastes, even after the synod of Jamnia.

          In opposition to these remarks, it is strenuously argued by Bloch that
          neither the passage in the Mishnic treatise Yadayim, nor any other,
          refers to the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">canonical character</span></em

          of the books to which Jewish elders raised several objections. But his
          arguments are more vehement than valid. Anxious to assign the final
          settlement of the entire canon to an
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg036"></a> authoritative body like the
          great synagogue, he affirms that all parties were united in opinion
          about the time of Christ,—Assiim, Perushim, and Zeddukim; Shammaites
          and Hillelites. But it requires more than his ingenuity to explain
          away the meaning of Yadayim 3, 5, Adoyot v. 3, Sabbat 1. To what did
          such diversity of opinion relate, if not to the canonical character of
          the books? A specific answer to the question is not given by the
          learned writer,<a href="#note_69" id="noteref_69" class="pginternal"

          who is too eager in his endeavor to attribute the settlement of the
          third canon to the great synagogue, and to smooth away all diversities
          of opinion about several books, after that time, as if none could
          afterwards question the authoritative settlement by that body. He will
          not even allow a wider canon to the Alexandrian Jews than that of
          their Palestinian brethren, though he cannot but admit that the former
          read and highly esteemed various apocryphal books because of their

          their canonicity as strong as theoretical opinions.

          The doubts about several books to which we have alluded, some of which
          Hananiah is said to have resolved in his old age, imply a diligent
          study of the national literature, if not a revision of the text; and
          the Tannaite college at Jabneh must have cared for the same things, as
          it had to deal with similar objections. After the last canon was made
          more than a century anterior to the Christian era, the text was not
          considered inviolate by the learned Jews; it received subsequent
          modifications and interpolations. The process of redaction had not
          ceased before the time of Christ. This was owing, among other causes,
          to the state of parties among the Jews, as well as the intrusion of
          Greek literature and culture, whose influence the Palestinian Jews
          themselves were not able altogether to withstand. When Jeremiah
          accused the Scribes of falsifying the law by their lying pen (viii.
          8), it may be inferred that the same process took place afterwards;
          that offensive things were removed,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg037"></a> and alterations made
          continuously down to the close of the canon, and even after. The
          corrections consisted of additions and changes of letters, being
          indicated in part by the most ancient versions and the traditions of
          the Jews themselves who often knew what stood in the text at first,
          and why it was altered. They are also indicated by the nature of the
          passage itself viewed in the light of the state of religion at the
          time. Here, sober judgment must guard against unnecessary conjectures.

          Jewish literature began to degenerate after the captivity, and it
          continued to do so. It leaned upon the past more and more, having an
          external and formal character with little of the living soul. The
          independence of their religious literature disappeared with the
          national independence of the Jews; and the genius of the people was
          too exclusive to receive much expansion from the spirit of nations
          with whom they came in contact. In such circumstances, amid the
          general consciousness of present misfortune which the hope of a
          brighter future could not dispel, and regretful retrospects of the
          past tinged with ideal splendor, the exact time of drawing a line
          between books that might be included in the third division of the
          canon must have been arbitrary. In the absence of a normal principle
          to determine selection, the productions were arbitrarily separated.
          Not that they were badly adjusted. On the contrary, the canon as a

          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038"></span

          critical spirit of learned Jews in the future could not be
          extinguished by anticipation. The canon was not really settled for all
          time by a synodical gathering at Jamnia; for Sirach was added to the

          These two books were in high repute for a considerable time,
          possessing a kind of canonical credit even among the learned Jews of
          Palestine. Rab, Jochanan, Elasar, Rabba bar Mare, occasionally refer
          to Sirach in the way in which the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="he"

          If it be asked on what principle books were admitted into the canon, a
          single answer does not suffice. One and the same criterion did not
          determine the process at all times. The leading principle with which
          the first canon-makers set out was to collect all the documents of
          Hebrew antiquity. This seems to have guided Ezra, if not the great
          synagogue after him. The nation, early imbued with the theocratic
          spirit and believing itself the chosen of God, was favorably inclined
          towards documents in which that standpoint was assumed. The legal and
          ethical were specially valued. The prophetic claimed a divine origin;
          the lyric or poetic touched and elevated the ideal faculty on which
          religion acts. But the leading principle which actuated Ezra and the
          great synagogue was gradually modified, amid the growing compass of
          the national literature and the consciousness that prophecy ceased
          with Malachi. When the latest part of the canon had to be selected
          from a literature almost contemporaneous, regard was had to such
          productions as resembled the old in spirit. Orthodoxy of contents was
          the dominant criterion. But this was a difficult thing, for various
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg039"></a>
          works really anonymous, though wearing the garb of old names and
          histories, were in existence, so that the boundary of the third part
          became uncertain and fluctuating.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The principle that actuated Ezra in making the first canon was a
          religious and patriotic one. From his treatment of the oldest law
          books we infer that he did not look upon them as inviolable. Venerable
          they were, and so far sacred; but neither perfect nor complete for all
          time. In his view they were not unconditionally authoritative.
          Doubtless they had a high value as the productions of inspired
          lawgivers and men of a prophetic spirit; but the redaction to which he
          submitted them shows no superstitious reverence. With him

          >
          authority appear to have dominated the mind of the great synagogue in
          the selection of books. Like Ezra, these scholars reverenced the
          productions of the prophets, poets, and historians to whom their
          countrymen were indebted in the past for religious or political
          progress; but they did not look upon them as the offspring of unerring
          wisdom. How could they, while witnessing repetitions and minor
          contradictions in the books collected?

          of origin was not the criterion which determined the reception of a
          book into it; but the character and authorship of the book. Did it
          breathe the old spirit, or proceed from one venerated for his wisdom?
          Was it like the old orthodox productions; or did it bear the name of
          one renowned for his piety and knowledge of divine things? The stamp
          of antiquity was necessary in a certain sense; but the theocratic
          spirit was the leading consideration. Ecclesiastes was admitted
          because it bore the name of Solomon; and Daniel's apocalyptic
          writings, because veiled under the name of an old prophet. New psalms
          were taken in because of their association with much older ones in the
          temple service. Yet the first book of Maccabees was excluded, though
          written
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg040"></a>
          in Hebrew. It is still more remarkable that Sirach was put among the
          external productions; but this was owing not so much to its recent
          origin, for it is older than the book of Daniel, as to its being an
          apparent echo of the Proverbs, and therefore unnecessary. Yet it was
          long after assigned to the Hagiographa, and quoted as such by several
          rabbis. Baruch was also left out, though it is as old as Daniel, if
          not older; and professes to have been written by Jeremiah's friend, in
          Babylon.

          That redactors dealt freely with the text of the second and third
          canons especially, without a superstitious belief in its sacredness,
          is apparent from the double recension which existed when the Egyptian
          Jews translated the books into Greek. If the one that formed the basis
          of the Alexandrian version be less correct than the Palestinian in the
          majority of instances, it is still superior in many. The differences
          between them, often remarkable, prove that those who had most to do
          with the books did not guard them as they would have done had they
          thought them infallibly inspired. Palestinians and Alexandrians
          subjected the text to redaction; or had suffered it to fall into a
          state inconsistent with the assumption of its supernatural origin. At
          a much later period, the Masoretes reduced to one type all existing
          copies of their Scriptures, introducing an uniformity imperatively
          demanded in their opinion by multiplied discrepancies.

          Whatever divine character the reflecting attributed to the canonical
          books, it must have amounted to the same thing as that assigned to
          human attributes and physical phenomena—a divinity resulting from the
          over-leaping of second causes, in the absence of inductive philosophy.
          Here the imperfection conditioned by the nature of the created cannot
          be hid. Yet the books may be truly said to have contained the word of
          God.

          of the collection present the three gradations of sanctity which the
          books assumed successively in Israelite estimation. A certain

          The consciousness of prophetism being extinct soon after the return
          from Babylon, was a genuine instinct. With the extinction of the
          Jewish state the religious spirit almost evaporated. The idealism
          which the old prophets proclaimed in contrast with the symbolic
          religion of the state gave place to the forms and an attachment to the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">written</span></em

          law. Religion came to be a thing of the understanding, the subject of
          learned treatment; and its essence was reduced to dogmas or precepts.
          Thus it ceased to be a spiritual element in which the heart had free
          scope for its highest aspirations. In addition to all, a foreign
          metaphysical theology, the Persian doctrine of spirits, was
          introduced, which seemed to enlarge the sphere of speculation, but
          really retarded the free exercise of the mind. As the external side of
          religion had been previously directed to the performance of good
          works, this externality was now determined by a written law. Even the
          prophetism that appeared after the restoration was little more than an
          echo of the past, falling in with an outward and written legalism. The
          literature of the people deteriorated in quality, and prophecy became

          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg042"></a> in the fullness of time to

          relying upon the native power of the spirit itself, he showed how man

          intervention of temple, sacrifice, or ceremony.

          The books were divine, so that none dared to add to, subtract from, or
          alter them. To him the canon was something belonging to the venerable
          past, and inviolable. In other words, all the books were peculiarly
          sacred. Although we call scarcely think this to be his private opinion
          merely, it is probably expressed in exaggerated terms, and hardly

          His authority, however, is small. Bloch's estimate of it is too high.
          It is utterly improbable that Josephus's opinion was universally held
          by the Jews in his day. His division of the books is peculiar: five
          Mosaic, thirteen historical, four containing religious songs and rules
          of life. It appears, indeed, that as he had the same twenty-two books
          we now have, Ruth was still attached to Judges,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg043"></a>
          and Lamentations to Jeremiah; but his credit is not on a par with that
          of a Jew who adhered to his countrymen in the time of their calamity.
          He wrote for the Romans. One who believed that Esther was the youngest
          book in the canon, who looked upon Ecclesiastes as Solomon's, and
          Daniel as an exile production, cannot be a competent judge. In his
          time the historical sense of the book of Daniel was misapprehended;
          for after the Grecian dynasty had fallen without the fulfillment of
          the Messianic prophecy connected with it, the Roman empire was put
          into its place. Hence various allusions in

          is apocryphal. In any case, Josephus does not furnish a genuine list
          of the canonical books any more than Philo. The Pharisaic view of his
          time is undoubtedly given, that the canon was then complete and
          sacred. The decision proceeded from that part of the nation who ruled
          both over school and people, and regained supremacy after the
          destruction of the temple;
          <span class="tei tei-hi"

          conclusion of orthodox Judaism. With true critical instinct, Spinoza
          says that the canon was the work of the Pharisees. The third

          writings, not excepting the book of Jonah itself; and the attempt to
          account for its place in the third division on the ground of its
          predominant subjectivity is based on the unfounded assumption that the
          objective state of religion is represented in the second division and
          the subjective in the third. Had the book existed before 400
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span
          >, it would doubtless have stood in the second division. But the
          contents themselves demonstrate its date; contemporary history being
          wrapped in a prophetic form. Having some affinity to Esther as regards
          heathenism and Greek life, the book was put next to the latter. To
          Ezra and Nehemiah, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg045"></a> which were adopted before
          the other part of the Chronicle book and separated from it, were added
          the so-called Chronicles. Such was the original succession of the
          third division or
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="he"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">c'tubim</span></span
          >; but it did not remain unaltered. For the use of the synagogue, the
          five Megiloth were put together; so that Ruth, which was originally
          appended to Judges, and the Lamentations affixed at first to
          Jeremiah's prophecies, were taken out of the second and put into the
          third canon. This caused a separation of Canticles and Ecclesiastes.
          The new arrangement was made for liturgical purposes.

          That the Scribes always adhered to the prohibition to write no
          religious laws and ordinances cannot be held, even in the face of the
          Talmudic saying, כוחכ הילכוה כשורף חורה (writers of Halacoth are like
          a burner of the law). This may apply to the late scribes or bookmen,
          not to the earlier. The greater part of Geiger's

          Talmudic tradition, which attributes the redaction of the book to the
          men of the great synagogue who are said to have acted under the
          influence of the divine spirit, separates the three apocryphal pieces
          from the rest; but this arose from the desire of discountenancing the
          idea that the work consists of romance and legend. Such later
          tradition took curious ways of justifying the canonicity of Daniel and
          the redaction of it by the great synagogue,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">ex gr.</span></span
          >, the assumption that the second part arose out of a series of
          unconnected
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="he"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">Megiloth</span></span
          >
          which were not reduced to chronological order. Still the Midrash
          maintains that Daniel, or the person writing in his name, was no
          prophet, like Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, but a man of visions, an
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">apocalyptist</span></em
          >. It was a general belief, that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">visions</span></em
          >
          had come into the place of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">prophecy</span></em
          >
          when the book appeared. The Greek translation could not have been long
          after the original, because it is used in the First Book of Maccabees.
          The interval between the Hebrew and the Greek was inconsiderable. The
          translator not only departed from, but added to, the original,
          inserting such important pieces as the Prayer of Azarias, the Song of
          the Three Children, the history of Susanna, and that of Bel and the
          Dragon. Whether any of these had been written before is uncertain.
          Most of the traditions they embody were probably reduced to writing by
          the translator, and presented in his peculiar style. The assertion,
          that Josephus was unacquainted with these additions is hazardous,
          since the way in which he speaks of Daniel's fame (Antiq. x. 11, 7),
          and especially of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">the books</span></em
          >
          he wrote (τὰ βιβλία), supposes some relation to them. Elsewhere he
          speaks of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">one book</span></em
          >
          (x. 10, 4; xi. 8, 5), where he may have thought of the canonical part.

          It has been thought that the phrase פעלי אמפות in the ninth verse
          alludes to the great council or synagogue. This conjecture is
          plausible on various grounds. The reasons for attributing the epilogue
          to a later time than the writer of the book appear to be stronger than
          those assigning it to the original author. The 13th and 14th verses in
          particular, are unlike Coheleth.
