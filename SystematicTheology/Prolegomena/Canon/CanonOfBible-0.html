        <h2>Preface.</h2>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The substance of the present work was written toward the close of the
          year 1875 for the new edition of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-style: italic"
              >Encyclopaedia Britannica</span
            ></span
          >. Having been abridged and mutilated, contrary to the author's
          wishes, before its publication there, he resolved to print it entire.
          With that view it has undergone repeated revision with enlargement in
          different parts, and been made as complete as the limits of an essay
          appeared to allow. As nothing of importance has been knowingly
          omitted, the writer hopes it will be found a comprehensive summary of
          all that concerns the formation and history of the Bible canon. The
          place occupied by it was vacant. No English book reflecting the
          processes of results of recent criticism, gives an account of the
          canon in both Testaments. Articles and essays upon the subject there
          are; but their standpoint is usually apologetic not scientific,
          traditional rather than impartial, unreasonably conservative without
          being critical. The topic is weighty, involving the consideration of
          great questions, such as the inspiration, authenticity, authority, and
          age of the Scriptures. The author has tried to handle it fairly,
          founding his statements on such evidence as seemed convincing, and
          condensing them into a moderate compass. If the reader wishes to know
          the evidence, he may find it in the writer's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-style: italic"
              >Introductions to the Old and New Testaments</span
            ></span
          >, where the separate books of Scripture are discussed; and in the
          late treatises of other critics. While his expositions are capable of
          expansion, it is believed that they will not be easily shaken. He
          commends the work to the attention of all who have an interest in the
          progress of theology, and are seeking a foundation for their faith
          less precarious than books however venerable.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          It has not been the writer's purpose to chronicle phases of opinion,
          or to refute what he believes to be error in the newest hypotheses
          about the age, authority, and composition of the books. His aim has
          been rather to set forth the most correct view of the questions
          involved in a history of the canon, whether it be more or less recent.
          Some may think that the latest or most current account of such
          questions is the best; but that is not his opinion. Hence, the
          fashionable belief that much of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageiv"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgiv"></a> Pentateuch, the Book of
          Leviticus wholly, with large parts of Exodus and Numbers, in a word,
          that all the laws relating to divine worship, with most of the
          chronological tables or statistics, belong to Ezra, who is
          metamorphosed in fact into the first Elohist, is unnoticed. Hence,
          also, the earliest gospel is not declared to be Mark's. Neither has
          the author ventured to place the fourth gospel at the end of the first
          century, as Ewald and Weitzs√§cker do, after the manner of the old
          critics; or with Keim so early as 110-115
          <span class="tei tei-hi"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          Many evince a restless anxiety to find something novel; and to depart
          from well-established conclusions for the sake of originality. This
          shows a morbid state of mind. Amid the feverish outlook for
          discoveries and the slight regard for what is safe, conservatism is a
          commendable thing. Some again desire to return, as far as they can, to
          orthodoxy, finding between that extreme and rationalism a middle way
          which offers a resting-place to faith. The numerous changes which
          criticism presents are not a symptom of soundness. The writer is far
          indeed from thinking that every question connected with the books of
          Scripture is finally settled; but the majority undoubtedly are, though
          several already fixed by great scholars continue to be opened up
          afresh. He does not profess to adopt the phase of criticism which is
          fashionable at the moment; it is enough to state what approves itself
          to his judgment, and to hold it fast amid the contrarieties of
          conjecture or the cravings of curiosity. Present excrescences or
          aberrations of belief will have their day and disappear. Large
          portions of the Pentateuch will cease to be consigned to a post-exile
          time, and the gospels of Matthew and Luke will again be counted the
          chief sources of Mark's. It will also be acknowledged that the first
          as it now exists, is of much later origin than the fall of Jerusalem.
          Nor will there be so great anxiety to show that Justin Martyr was
          acquainted with the fourth gospel, and owed his Logos-doctrine chiefly
          to it. The difference of ten or twenty years in the date of a gospel
          will not be considered of essential importance in estimating its
          character.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The present edition has been revised throughout and several parts
          re-written. The author hopes that it will be found still more worthy
          of the favor with which the first was received.
