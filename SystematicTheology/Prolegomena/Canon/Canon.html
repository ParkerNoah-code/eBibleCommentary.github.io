        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Old Testament:</b> Those books, and those only, which Christ and
          his Apostles recognized as the written Word of God, are entitled to be
          regarded as canonical. This recognition was afforded in a twofold
          manner:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, many of the books of the Old Testament are quoted as the Word
          of God, as being given by the Spirit; or the Spirit is said to have
          uttered what is therein recorded. Secondly, Christ and his Apostles
          refer to the sacred writings of the Jews—the volume which they
          regarded as divine—as being what it claimed to be, the Word of God.
          When we refer to the Bible as of divine authority, we refer to it as a
          volume and recognize all the writings which it contains as given by
          the inspiration of the Spirit. In like manner when Christ or his
          Apostles quote the "Scriptures," or the "law and the prophets," and
          speak of the volume then so called, they give their sanction to the
          divine authority of all the books which that volume contained.
        </p>
        <p>
          All, therefore, that is necessary to determine for Christians the
          canon of the Old Testament, is to ascertain what books were included
          in the "Scriptures" recognized by the Jews of that period. This is a
          point about which there is no reasonable doubt. The Jewish canon of
          the Old Testament included all the books and no others, which
          Protestants now recognize as constituting the Old Testament
          Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Apocrypha:</b> These were not written in Hebrew and were not
          included in the canon of the Jews. They were, therefore, not
          recognized by Christ as the Word of God. On this ground Protestants
          reject the so-called apocryphal books. This reason is of itself
          sufficient. It is however confirmed by considerations drawn from the
          character of the books themselves. They abound in errors, and in
          statements contrary to those found in the undoubtedly canonical books.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>New Testament:</b> The principle on which the canon of the New
          Testament is determined is equally simple. Those books, and those only
          which can be proved to have been written by the Apostles, or to have
          received their sanction, are to be recognized as of divine authority.
          The reason of this rule is obvious. The Apostles were the duly
          authenticated messengers of Christ, of whom He said, "The one who
          hears you hears me, and the one who rejects you rejects me" (Lk 10:16
          ESV).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Establishment:</b> In this affair, the Church is a servant and not
          a mistress; a depositary and not a judge. She exercises the office of
          a minister, not of a magistrate, ministerium non magisterium. She
          delivers a testimony, not a judicial sentence. She discerns the canon
          of the Scriptures, she does not make it; she has recognised their
          authenticity, she has not given it. And as the men of Sichem believed
          in Jesus Christ by means of the impure but penitent woman who called
          them to him, we say to the Church: "Now we believe, not because of thy
          saying; for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed
          the Christ, the Saviour of the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          We have believed, then, through her means, not on her account. We
          found her on her knees; she showed us her Master; we recognised him,
          and we knelt down along with her. Were I to mingle in the rear of an
          imperial army, and should I ask those around me to show me their
          prince, they would do with respect to him, for me, what the Church has
          done with regard to the Scriptures. They would not call their regiment
          the ecumenical army; they would not say that the emperor has no
          authority but what is derived from its testimony. The authority of the
          Scriptures is not founded, then, on the authority of the Church: it is
          the Church that is founded on the authority of the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Finality</b>: The Scripture is a full and perfect canon, containing
          in it all things necessary to salvation. ‘From a child thou hast known
          the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation’
          (2 Tim 3:15). It shows what we are to believe and what we are to
          practise. It gives us an exact model of religion, and perfectly
          instructs us in the deep things of God. By the scriptures, we receive
          'the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints' (Jude 3).
          ‘If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the
          plagues that are written in this book’ (Rev 22:18).
