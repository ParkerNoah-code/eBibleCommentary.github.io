          >) In relation to the Old Testament, the prevailing tendency in the
          Greek Church was to follow the Palestinian canon. Different lists
          appeared from time to time in which the endeavor there to exclude
          apocryphal,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span

          books was judged fit for reading in the Church,â€”a class intermediate
          between the canonical and apocryphal. The distinction between the
          canonical and ecclesiastical writings appears in Cyril of Jerusalem,
          Athanasius, Epiphanius, &amp;c. The Latin Church showed a disposition
          to elevate the ecclesiastical books of the Greek Church to the rank of
          the canonical, making the line between the two indistinct; as we see
          from the acts of the councils at Hippo and Carthage, in the end of the
          fourth and beginning of the fifth century, where Augustine's,
          influence was predominant. But notwithstanding this deviation from the
          stricter method of the Greeks, learned men like Jerome adhered to the
          Palestinian canon, and even styled the ecclesiastical books
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">apocryphal</span></em
          >, transferring the epithet from one class to another. Hilary and
          Rufinus also followed the Greek usage.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          During the sixth and following centuries, it cannot be said that the
          canon of the Greek Church was definitely closed, notwithstanding the
          decrees of councils and references to older authorities. Opinions
          still varied about certain books, such as Esther; though the
          Palestinian list was commonly followed. During the same period, the
          enlarged canon of the Alexandrian Jews, which went far to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg119"></a>
          abolish the distinction between the canonical and deutero-canonical
          books, prevailed in the West, at least in practice; though some
          followed the shorter one, sanctioned as it had been by Jerome. As both
          lists existed, no complete or final settlement of the question was
          reached in the Latin Church. Neither in the East nor in the West was
          the canon of the Old Testament really closed; for though the stricter
          principle of separation prevailed in theory, it was not carried out in
          practice consistently or universally. The two men most influential
          about the canon were Jerome and Augustine; the one representing its
          Palestinian, the other its Alexandrian type. After them no legal or
          commanding voice fixed either, to the absolute exclusion of its rival.

          >) The charge of Constantine to Eusebius to make out a list of
          writings for the use of the Church and its performance may be
          considered as that which first put the subject on a broad and
          permanent basis. Its consequences were important. If it cannot be
          called the completion or close of the New Testament canon, it
          determined it largely. Eusebius made a Greek Bible containing the
          usual books, except the Revelation. Though the historian of the church
          was not well fitted for the task, being deficient in critical ability
          and trammeled by tradition, he doubtless used his best judgment.
          Hence, about the year 337, the Constantinian Church received a Bible
          which had an influential origin. No binding authority indeed attached
          to the list of the Christian books it presented; but it had weight in
          the Greek Church. It did not prevent different opinions, nor deter
          individuals from dissent. Thus Athanasius, who disliked Eusebius and
          his party, issued a list of the sacred writings which included the
          Revelation. The canon of the Laodicean Council (<span
            class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span
          >
          363) agreed with the Constantine one.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          That variations still existed in the Eastern Church is shown by the
          lists which vied with one another in precedence. The apostolic canons
          adopted the seven general
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg120"></a> epistles, while the
          apostolic constitutions excluded them. The Alexandrian MS. added to
          the ordinary books of the New Testament, Clement's two epistles; and
          Cosmas Indicopleustes omitted the general epistles as well as the
          Apocalypse. At length the Council of Constantinople, usually called
          the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">Trullan</span></span

          692), laid down positions that fixed the canon for the Greek Church.
          The endeavor in it was to attain to a conclusion which should unite
          East and West. This council did not enumerate the separate books, but
          referred to older authorities, to the eighty-five canons of the
          apostles, the decrees of the synods of Laodicea, Ephesus, Carthage,
          and others; to Athanasius, Gregory of Nazianzus, Amphliochius of
          Iconium, Cyril of Alexandria, Gennadius, &amp;c. After the fourth
          century there was a general desire to fall back on apostolic times, to
          appeal to the Church, to ascertain the opinion of synods or
          assemblies; in a word, to rely on authority.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          Less discrepancy and activity were manifested about the canon in the
          Western Church. Here the chief doubts were directed to the epistle to
          the Hebrews and the seven general ones. The former was early excluded,
          and continued to be so even in the time of Jerome. The latter were
          adopted much sooner. The impulse given by Constantine to determine the
          books of Scripture re-acted on the West, where the Church considered
          it its own privilege. Augustine's influence contributed much to the
          settlement of the question. The synods of Hippo (<span
            class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span
          >
          393) and of Carthage (<span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span
          >
          397) received the epistle to the Hebrews and the seven general ones,
          thus fixing the New Testament canon as it now is. In 419 the African
          bishops, in the presence of a Papal delegate, repeated their former
          decision. After the West Goths joined the Catholic Church in the sixth
          century, the Romish and Spanish Churches gave prominence to the fact
          of accepting both the Apocalypse and the epistle to the Hebrews. The
          canon of the West was now virtually
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg121"></a> closed; the fourth Council
          of Toledo (<span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span
          >
          632) at which Isidore was present, agreeing with the Augustinian list,
          ratified as that list had been by Innocent the First. The reception of
          the epistle to the Hebrews was facilitated by the objections of the
          Arians and Semiarians; while opposition to the Priscillianists in
          Spain strengthened adherence to the traditional canon. Augustine and
          the Trullan Council fixed the number of the New Testament books as
          they are now.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          With regard to the Bible canon in general, we see that councils had
          weight when they enumerated the sacred books; that prominent teachers
          delivered their opinion on the subject with effect, and that tradition
          contributed to one result; but no general council closed the canon
          once for all, till that of Trent promulgated its decrees. This body,
          however, could only settle the subject for Romanists, since, while the
          right of private judgment is exercised, no corporation can declare
          some books inspired and others not, some authoritative in matters of
          faith, others not, without presumption. Though the present Bible canon
          rests upon the judgment of good and learned men of different times, it
          can never be finally or infallibly settled, because the critical
          powers of readers differ, and all do not accept church authority with
          unhesitating assent.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          It is the way of men to defer unduly to the opinions expressed by
          synods and councils, especially if they be propounded dogmatically; to
          acquiesce in their decisions with facility rather than institute
          independent inquiry. This is exemplified in the history of the canon,
          where the fallibility of such bodies in determining canonicity is
          conspicuous. It is so in the general reception of the book of Esther,
          while the old poem, the Song of Songs, was called in question at the
          synod of Jamnia; in the omission of the Revelation from the canonical
          list by many belonging to the Greek Church, while the epistles to
          Timothy and Titus were received as St. Paul's from the beginning
          almost universally.
