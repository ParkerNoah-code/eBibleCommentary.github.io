          Chapter VI. The New Testament Canon In The First Three Centuries.
        </h2>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The first Christians relied on the Old Testament as their chief
          religious book. To them it was of divine origin and authority. The New
          Testament writings came into gradual use, by the side of the older
          Jewish documents, according to the times in which they appeared and
          the names of their reputed authors. The Epistles of Paul were the
          earliest written; after which came the Apocalypse, the Epistle to the
          Hebrews, and other documents, all in the first century. After the
          first gospel had undergone a process of translation, re-writing, and
          interpolation, from the Aramaic basis,

          of which Papias of Hierapolis speaks, until the traces of another
          original than the Greek were all but effaced; it appeared in its
          present form early in the second century. Soon after, that of Luke was
          composed, whose prevailing Pauline tendency was not allowed to
          suppress various features of a Jewish Essene type. The second gospel,
          which bears evidences of its derivation from the other synoptists, was
          followed by the fourth. The last document was the so-called second
          Epistle of Peter. It is manifest that tradition assumed various forms
          after the death of Jesus; that legend and myth speedily surrounded His
          sacred person; that the unknown writers were influenced by the
          peculiar circumstances in which they stood with respect to Jewish and
          Gentile Christianity; and that their uncritical age dealt considerably
          in the marvelous. That the life of the great Founder should be
          overlaid with
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg061"></a>
          extraneous materials, is special matter for regret. However
          conscientious and truth-loving they may have been, the reporters were
          unequal to their work. It is also remarkable that so many of them
          should be unknown; productions being attached to names of repute to
          give them greater currency.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          When Marcion came from Pontus to Rome (144
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span
          >,) he brought with him a Scripture-collection consisting of ten
          Pauline epistles. With true critical instinct he did not include those
          addressed to Timothy and Titus, as also the epistle to the Hebrews.
          The gospel of Marcion was Luke's in an altered state. From this and
          other facts we conclude that external parties were the first who
          carried out the idea of collecting Christian writings, and of putting
          them either beside or over against the sacred books of the Old
          Testament, in support of their systems. As to Basilides (125
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span
          >), his supposed quotations from the New Testament in Hippolytus are
          too precarious to be trusted.<a

          Testimonies to the <span class="tei tei-q">“acknowledged”</span> books
          of the New Testament as Scripture have been transferred from his
          followers to himself; so that his early witness to the canon breaks
          down. It is inferred from statements in Origen and Jerome that he had
          a gospel of his own somewhat like St. Luke's, but extra-canonical. His
          son Isidore and succeeding disciples used Matthew's gospel. Jerome
          says that Marcion and Basilides denied the Pauline authorship of the
          epistle to the Hebrews and the pastoral ones.<a
            href="#note_142"

          It is also doubtful whether Valentinus's (140-166
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span
          >) alleged citations from the New Testament can be relied upon. The
          passages of this kind ascribed to him by the fathers belong in a great
          measure to his disciples. The fragment of a letter preserved by
          Clement of Alexandria in the second book of the Stromata, has been
          thought to contain references to the gospels of Matthew and Luke; but
          the fact is doubtful. Nor has Henrici proved
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg062"></a> that Valentinus used John's

          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span

          >
          From Hippolytus's account of the Ophites, Peratæ, and Sethians, we
          infer that the Christian writings were much employed by them. They
          rarely cite an apocryphal work. More than one hundred and sixty
          citations from the New Testament have been gathered out of their
          writings.<a href="#note_145" id="noteref_145" class="pginternal"
            ><span class="tei tei-noteref"
              ><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super"
                >145</span
              ></span
            ></a
          >
          We may admit that these Ophites and Peratæ were of early origin, the
          former being the oldest known of the Gnostic parties; but there is no
          proof that the acquaintance with the New Testament which Hippolytus
          attributes to them belongs to the first rather than the second half of
          the second century. The early existence of the sect does not show an
          early citation of the Christian books by it, especially of John's
          gospel; unless its primary were its last stage. Later and earlier
          Ophites are not distinguished in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophumena</span></span
          >. Hence there is a presumption that the author had the former in
          view, which is favored by no mention of them occurring in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Adversus omnes Hæreses”</span> usually
          appended to Tertullian's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-style: italic"
              >Præscriptiones Hæreticorum</span
            ></span
          >, and by Irenæus's derivation of their heresy from that of
          Valentinus. The latter father does not even speak of the Peratæ.
          Clement of Alexandria is the first who alludes to them. The early
          heretics were desirous of confirming their peculiar opinions by the
          writings current among Catholic Christians, so that the formation of a
          canon by them began soon after the commencement of the second century,
          and continued till the end of it; contemporaneously with the
          development of a Catholic Church and its necessary adjunct a Catholic
          canon.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          No New Testament canon, except a partial and unauthoritative
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg063"></a> one, existed till the
          latter half of the second century, that is, till the idea of a
          Catholic church began to be entertained. The living power of
          Christianity in its early stages had no need of books for its nurture.
          But in the development of a church organization the internal rule of
          consciousness was changed into an external one of faith. The Ebionites
          or Jewish Christians had their favorite Gospels and Acts. The gospel
          of Matthew was highly prized by them, existing as it did in various
          recensions, of which the gospel according to the Hebrews was one.
          Other documents, such as the Revelation of John; and the preaching of
          Peter, a Jewish-Christian history subsequently re-written and employed
          in the Clementine Recognitions and Homilies, were also in esteem. Even
          so late as 175-180
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span
          >, Hegesippus, a Jewish Christian, does not seem to have had a canon
          consisting of the four gospels and Paul's Epistles, but appeals to

          so that his leading principle was, the identity of Jesus's words with
          the Old Testament; agreeably to the tenets of the party he belonged
          to. The source whence he drew the words of Jesus was probably the
          Gospel according to the Hebrews, a document which we know he used, on
          the authority of Eusebius. He does not refer to Paul except by
          implication in a passage given in Photius from Stephen Gobar,<a

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed are your eyes for they see,”</span>

          The Clementine Homilies (161-180

          >) used the four canonical gospels even the fourth (which is somewhat
          singular in a writer who denies the deity of Christ), and assigned it
          to the apostle John. The gospel according to the Egyptians was also
          employed. Paul's epistles were rejected of course, as well as the
          Acts; since the apostle of the Gentiles was pointed at in Simon Magus,
          whom Peter refutes. It is, therefore, obvious that a collection of the
          New Testament writings could make little progress among the Ebionites
          of the second century. Their reverence for the law and the prophets
          hindered another canon. Among the Gentile Christians the formation of
          a canon took place more rapidly, though Judaic influences retarded it
          even there. After Paul's epistles were interchanged between churches,
          a few of them would soon be put together. A collection of this kind is
          implied in 2 Peter iii. 16. The pastoral epistles, which show their
          dependence on the authentic Pauline ones, with those of Peter,
          presuppose a similar collection; which along with the Synoptists,
          existed before the fourth gospel. The Apocalypse and the epistle to
          the Hebrews were obnoxious to the Pauline churches, as Paul's letters
          were to the Jewish-Christian ones. Hence the former were outside the
          Pauline collections.

          the Corinthians, Romans, Hebrews, and perhaps others. Two passages
          have also been adduced as derived from the gospels of Matthew and
          Luke, viz., in chapters xiii. 2 and xlvi. 8; but probably some other
          source supplied them, such as oral tradition. It has also been argued
          that the quotation in the fifteenth chapter,

            lips, but their heart is far from me,”</span

          comes from Mark vii. 6 in which it varies from the Hebrew of Isaiah
          xxix. 13, as well as the Septuagint version. Clement therefore, so it
          is said, quotes the Old Testament through the medium of the gospels
          (Matthew xv. 8, Mark vii. 6). But the argument is inconclusive because
          the words agree closely enough with the Septuagint to render the
          supposition very probable that they are a memorized citation from it.
          As they stand, they coincide exactly neither with Mark nor the
          Septuagint.<a href="#note_149" id="noteref_149" class="pginternal"

          This is the earliest trace of canonical authority being transferred
          from the Old Testament to Christian writings. But the citation is not
          certain. The original may be 4 Esdras, viii. 3; and even if the writer
          took the words from Matthew's gospel, it is possible that he used
          <span class="tei tei-q">“it is written”</span> with reference to their
          prototype in the Old Testament. Of such interchanges, examples occur
          in writers of the second century; and it is the more probable that
          this is one, from the fact that 4 Esdras is elsewhere considered a
          prophet and referred to in the same way as Ezekiel.<a

          Barnabas's citation of a gospel as canonical is wholly improbable,

          first half of the second century. When these post-apostolic
          productions appeared, the New Testament writings did not stand on the
          same level with the Old, and were not yet esteemed

          He had also the older Acts of Pilate. Paul's epistles are never
          mentioned, though he doubtless knew them. Having little sympathy with
          Paulinism he attached his belief much more to the primitive apostles.
          The Apocalypse, 1 Peter, and 1 John he esteemed highly; the epistle to
          the Hebrews and the Acts he treated in the same way as the Pauline
          writings. Justin's canon, as far as divine authority and inspiration
          are concerned, was the Old Testament. He was merely on the threshold
          of a divine canon made up of primitive Christian writings, and
          attributed no exclusive sanctity to those he used because they were
          not to him the only source of doctrine. Even of the Apocalypse he

          In his time none of the gospels had been canonized, not even the

          fountain of Christian knowledge, as it had been for a century. In his
          opinion this tradition was embodied in writing; but the documents in
          which he looked for all that related to Christ were not the gospels

          origin. Its translation from the Greek is assumed, but that is
          uncertain. It begins with the four gospels in the usual order, and
          proceeds to the Acts, thirteen epistles of Paul, the epistles of John,
          that of Jude, and the Apocalypse. The epistle to the Hebrews, 1 and 2

          it is stated that it may be read in the Church. The epistle
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to the Laodiceans”</span> may either be that
          to the Ephesians, which had such superscription in Marcion's canon, or

          What is the result of an examination of the Christian literature
          belonging to the second century? Is it that a canon was then fixed,
          separating some books from others by a line so clear, that those on
          one side of it were alone reckoned inspired, authoritative, of
          apostolic origin or sanction; while those on the other were considered
          uninspired, unauthoritative, without claim to apostolicity,
          unauthentic? Was the separation between them made on any clear
          principle or demarcation? It cannot be said so. The century witnessed
          no such fact, but merely the incipient efforts to bring it about. The
          discriminating process was begun, not completed. It was partly forced
          upon the prominent advocates of a policy which sought to consolidate
          the Jewish and Gentile-Christian parties, after the decline of their
          mutual antagonism, into a united church. They were glad to transfer
          the current belief in the infallible inspiration of the Old Testament,
          to selected Christian writings, as an effective means of defence
          against those whom they considered outside a new organization—the
          Catholic Church.

          Judith, Esdras, Esther, Job, and Tobit. In the New Testament, the four
          gospels, Matthew, John, Mark, Luke, are succeeded by ten epistles of
          Paul, two of Peter, the epistle of James, three of John, and that of
          Jude. The epistle to the Hebrews (characterized as that of Barnabas),
          the Revelation of John, Acts of the Apostles, the Shepherd of Hermas,
          the Acts of Paul, the Revelation of Peter, follow. The last three

          the Emperor Constantine entrusted Eusebius with the commission to make
          out a complete collection of the sacred Christian writings for the use
          of the Catholic Church. How this order was executed we are not told.
          But Credner is probably correct in saying that the code consisted of
          all that is now in the New Testament except the Revelation. The fifty
          copies which were made must have supplied Constantinople and the Greek
          Church for a considerable time with an authoritative canon.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          Eusebius's catalogue agrees in substance with that of Origen's. The
          historian followed ecclesiastical tradition. He inquired diligently
          into the prevailing opinions of the Christian churches and writers,
          with the views held by others before and contemporaneously with
          himself, but could not attain to a decided result. His hesitation
          stood in the way of a clear, firm, view of the question. The tradition
          respecting certain books was still wavering, and he was unable to fix
          it. Authority fettered his independent judgment. That he was
          inconsistent and confused does not need to be shown.

          The exact principles that guided the formation of a canon in the
          earliest centuries cannot be discovered. Strictly speaking there were
          none. Definite grounds for the reception or rejection of books were
          not apprehended. The choice was determined by various circumstances,
          of which apostolic origin was the chief, though this itself was
          insufficiently attested; for if it be asked whether all the New
          Testament writings proceeded from the authors whose names they bear,
          criticism cannot reply in the affirmative. The example and influence
          of churches to which the writings had been first addressed must have
          acted upon the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg081"></a> reception of books. Above
          all, individual teachers here and there saw the necessity of meeting
          heretics with their own weapons, in their own way, with
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">apostolic records</span></em
          >
          instead of oral tradition. The circumstances in which the orthodox
          were placed led to this step, effecting a bond of union whose need
          must have been felt while each church was isolated under its own
          bishop and the collective body could not take measures in common.
          Writings of more recent origin would be received with greater facility
          than such as had been in circulation for many years, especially if
          they professed to come from a prominent apostle. A code of apostolic
          writings, divine and perfect like the Old Testament, had to be
          presented as soon as possible against Gnostic and Manichæan heretics
          whose doctrines were injurious to objective Christianity; while the
          multiplication of apocryphal works threatened to overwhelm genuine
          tradition with a heap of superstition. The Petrine and Pauline
          Christians, now amalgamated to a great extent, agreed in hastening the
          canon-process.

          The infancy of the canon was cradled in an uncritical age, and rocked
          with traditional ease. Conscientious care was not directed from the
          first to the well-authenticated testimony of eye-witnesses. Of the
          three fathers who contributed most to its early growth, Irenæus was
          credulous and blundering; Tertullian passionate and one-sided; and
          Clement of Alexandria, imbued with the treasures of Greek wisdom, was
          mainly occupied with ecclesiastical ethics. Irenæus argues that the
          gospels should be four in number, neither more nor less, because there
          are four universal winds and four quarters of the world. The Word or
          Architect of all things gave the gospel in a fourfold shape. According
          to this father, the apostles were fully informed concerning all
          things, and had a perfect knowledge, after their Lord's ascension.

          The three fathers of whom we are speaking, had neither the ability nor
          the inclination to examine the genesis of documents surrounded with an
          apostolic halo. No analysis of their authenticity and genuineness was
          seriously attempted either by them or by the men of their time. In its
          absence, custom, accident, taste, practical needs directed the
          tendency of tradition. All the rhetoric employed to throw the value of
          their testimony as far back as possible, even up to or at least very
          near the apostle John is of the vaguest sort. Appeals to the
          continuity of tradition and of church doctrine, to the exceptional
          veneration of these fathers for the gospels, to their opinions being
          formed earlier than the composition of the works in which they are
          expressed, possess no force. The ends which the fathers in question
          had in view, their polemic motives, their uncritical, inconsistent
          assertions, their want of sure data, detract from their testimony.
          Their decisions were much more the result of pious feeling biased by
          the theological speculations of the times, than the conclusions of a
          sound judgment. The very arguments they use to establish certain
          conclusions show weakness of perception. What are the manifestations
          of spiritual feeling, compared with the results of logical reasoning?
          Are they more trustworthy than the latter? Certainly not,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg083"></a>
          at least in relation to questions of evidence. It is true that their
          testimony has a value; but it is one proportionate to the degree of
          credibility attaching to witnesses circumstanced as they were, whose
          separation of canonical from uncanonical gospels, or rather their
          canonizing of certain writings apart from others, and their claiming
          of inspiration for the authors of the former, must be judged by the
          reasonableness of the thing itself, in connection with men of their
          type. The second century abounded in pseudonymous literature; and the
          early fathers, as well as the churches, were occupied with other
          things than the sifting of evidence connected with writings
          considerably prior to their own time. The increase of such apocryphal
          productions, gospels, acts, and apocalypses among the heretical
          parties stimulated the orthodox bishops and churches to make an
          authentic collection; but it increased the difficulties of the task.

          Textual criticism has been employed to discredit the true dates of the
          present gospels; and the most exaggerated descriptions have been given
          of the frequent transcription of the text and its great corruption in
          the second century. The process of corruption in the course of
          frequent transcription has been transferred even to the first century.
          It is true that the gospels at the end of that century exhibited a
          text which bears marks of transcription, interpolation, and addition;
          but they were not the complete works as we have them now, being then
          but in progress, except the fourth. The assumption that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“advanced corruption”</span> existed in the
          present text of the synoptists as early as the first century is
          gratuitous; unless the process by which they were gradually built up
          is so called. No attempt to get a long history behind the canonical
          gospels at the close of the first century out of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“advanced corruption”</span> can be
          successful. It is attested by no Christian writer of the century; and
          those in the first half of the second, both heretical and orthodox,
          did themselves treat the text in a manner far short of its implied
          infallibility. The various
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084"></span

          far into the first century. The transcription, enlargement, and
          interpolation of the materials which make up the body of them, must
          not be identified with the corruption of their

          the synoptists did not come forth full-blown, each from the hand of a
          single person. The old Latin version or versions used by Tertullian
          and the interpreter of Irenæus, have been pressed into the same

          In like manner the Curetonian Syriac version of the gospels has been
          put as early as possible into the second century, though it can hardly
          have been prior to the very close of it, or rather to the beginning of
          the third. Here the strong assertions of apologetic writers have been
          freely scattered abroad. But the evidence in favor of the authors
          traditionally assigned to the gospels and some of the epistles, is
          still uncertain. A wide gap intervenes between eye-witnesses of the
          apostles or apostolic men that wrote the sacred books, and the
          earliest fathers who assert such authorship. The traditional bridge
          between them is a precarious one. As the chasm cannot be filled by
          adequate external evidence, we are thrown back on the internal
          character of the works themselves. One thing appears from the early
          corruption of the sacred records spoken of by Irenæus, Origen, and
          others, that they were not regarded with the veneration necessarily
          attaching to infallible documents. Their being freely handled excludes
          the idea of rigid canonization. The men who first canonized them had
          no certain knowledge of their authors. To them, that knowledge had
          been obscured or lost; though a sagacious criticism might have arrived
          at the true state of the question even in their day.

          In the sub-apostolic age Ebionitism passed into Catholicism, Jewish
          into Pauline Christianity, the mythical and marvelous into the
          dogmatic, the traditional into the historic, the legendary into the
          literary. The conflict of parties
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg085"></a> within the sphere of
          Christianity gave rise to productions of various tendencies which
          reflected the circumstances out of which they arose. These were
          accepted or rejected by the churches according to the prevailing
          opinions of the persons composing the churches. Common usage led to
          the authorization of some; others were neglected. The state of the
          second century in its beliefs, credulity, idiosyncracies of prominent
          teachers, antagonistic opinions and mystic speculations, throws a
          light upon the New Testament writings and especially on the formation
          of the canon, which explains their genesis. Two things stand out most
          clearly, the comparatively late idea of a

            ><span style="font-style: italic">canonical</span></em
          >
          New Testament literature; and the absence of critical principles in
          determining it. The former was not entertained till the latter part of
          the second century. The conception of canonicity and inspiration
          attaching to New Testament books did not exist till the time of
          Irenæus.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          When it is asked, to whom do we owe the canon? the usual answer is, to
          the Church. This is true only in a sense. The unity attributed to
          Christians before Irenæus and Tertullian, consisted in their religious
          consciousness. It was subjective. The idea of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">the church</span></em
          >
          was that of inward fellowship—the fellowship of the spirit rather than
          an outward organism. The preservation of the early Christian writings
          was owing, in the first instance, to the congregations to whom they
          were sent, and the neighboring ones with whom such congregations had
          friendly connection. The care of them devolved on the most influential
          teachers,—on those who occupied leading positions in the chief cities,
          or were most interested in apostolic writings as a source of
          instruction. The Christian books were mostly in the hands of the
          bishops. In process of time the canon was the care of assemblies or
          councils. But it had been made before the first general council by a
          few leading fathers towards the end of the second century in different
          countries. The formation of a Catholic Church and of a canon was
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg086"></a> simultaneous. The
          circumstances in which the collection originated were unfavorable to
          the authenticity of its materials, for tradition had been busy over
          them and their authors. Instead of attributing the formation of the
          canon to the Church, it would be more correct to say that the
          important stage in it was due to three teachers, each working
          separately and in his own way, who were intent upon the creation of a
          Christian society which did not appear in the apostolic age,—a visible
          organization united in faith,—where the discordant opinions of
          apostolic and sub-apostolic times should be finally merged. The canon
          was not the work of the Christian Church so much as of the men who
          were striving to form that Church, and could not get beyond the mould
          received by primitive Christian literature. The first mention of a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">Catholic Church</span></em

          >, and may perhaps be ten years later. But though the idea is there,
          its established use is due to Irenæus, Tertullian, and Cyprian. The
          expression has a different and narrow sense in the seven Ignatian
          epistles which we believe to be supposititious and later than Justin.
          Neither the three epistles published in Syriac by Cureton, nor the
          seven Greek ones enumerated by Eusebius are authentic; though Zahn has
          tried to prove the latter such, dating them

          Ignatius's martyrdom at Rome rather than Antioch is still doubtful;
          for the circumstances under which he is said to have been dragged to
          Rome, and his writing letters to the churches by the way, are highly
          improbable. The testimony of Malalas that Ignatius suffered at Antioch
          in December, 115, in the presence of Trajan, may be quite as good as
          that of Chrysostom and the Syriac monthly calendar on which Zahn
          relies so confidently. The
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg087"></a> fact of the priority of the
          last two to Malalas is of little weight as evidence. The main point is

            ><span style="font-style: italic">the locality</span></em
          >
          in which Ignatius suffered; which Malalas, himself a native of Antioch
          and a historian, ought to have known better than Chrysostom, because
          he copied preceding historians.

          as though it were contemporary with the apostles themselves, or at
          least with their immediate disciples; and proceed to argue that
          dissensions arose soon after
          <span class="tei tei-q">“within the church”</span> rendering an appeal
          to the written word necessary. When the authority of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"

            ><span style="font-style: italic">the church</span></em
          >. Such a view tends to mislead. There were dissensions among the
          earliest Christians. The apostles themselves were by no means
          unanimous. Important differences of belief divided the Jewish and
          Gentile Christians from the beginning. The types of Christian truth
          existing from the first gradually coalesced about the middle of the
          second century; when heretics, especially the Gnostics, appeared so
          formidable that a catholic church was developed. Along with this
          process, and as an important element in it, the writings of apostles
          and apostolic men were uncritically taken from tradition and elevated
          to the rank of divine documents. It was not the rise of new
          dissensions <span class="tei tei-q">“within the church”</span> which
          led to the first formation of a Christian canon; rather did the new
          idea of <span class="tei tei-q">“a catholic church”</span> require a
          standard of appeal in apostolic writings, which were now invested with
          an authority that did not belong to them from the beginning.

          Origen was the first who took a somewhat scientific view of the
          relative value belonging to the different parts of the biblical
          collection. His examination of the canon was critical. Before him the
          leading books had been regarded as divine and sacred, the source of
          doctrinal and historic truth. From this stand-point he did not depart.
          With him ecclesiastical tradition was a prevailing principle in the
          recognition
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg088"></a> of books belonging of right
          to the New Testament collection. He was also guided by the inspiration
          of the authors; a criterion arbitrary in its application, as his own
          statements show. In his time, however, the collection was being
          gradually enlarged; his third class.

          of opinion to which certain portions of the New Testament were
          subject, and the unscientific procedure both of fathers and churches
          in the matter, though councils had not met to discuss it, and vague
          tradition had strengthened with time, a certain spiritual
          consciousness manifested itself throughout the East and West in the
          matter of the canon. Tolerable unanimity ensued. The result was a
          remarkable one, and calls for our gratitude, notwithstanding its
          defects. Though the development was pervaded by no critical or
          definite principle, it ended in a canon which has maintained its
          validity for centuries.

          It is sometimes said that the history of the canon should be sought
          from definite catalogues, not from isolated quotations. The latter are
          supposed to be of slight value, the former to be the result of
          deliberate judgment. This remark is more specious than solid. In
          relation to the Old Testament, the catalogues given by the fathers, as
          by Melito and Origen, rest solely on the tradition of the Jews; apart
          from which they have no independent authority. As none except Jerome
          and Origen knew Hebrew, their lists of the Old Testament books are
          simply a reflection of what they learned from others. If they deviate
          in practice from their masters by quoting as Scripture other than the
          canonical books, they show their judgment over-riding an external
          theory. The very men who give a list of the Jewish books evince an
          inclination to the Christian and enlarged canon. So Origen says, in
          his
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">Epistle to Africanus</span></span
          >, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the churches use Tobit.”</span> In
          explaining the prophet Isaiah, Jerome employs Sirach vi. 6, in proof
          of his view, remarking that the apocryphal work is in the Christian
          catalogue.
        </p>
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089"></span
        ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg089"></a>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          In like manner Epiphanius, in a passage against Aetius, after
          referring to the books of Scripture, adds,
          <span class="tei tei-q"
            >“as well as the books of Wisdom,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"
              ><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span
            >, the Wisdom of Solomon and of Jesus, son of Sirach; finally, all
            the other books of Scripture.”</span
          >
          In another place he gives the canon of the Jews historically, and
          excludes the apocryphal Greek books; here he includes some of the
          latter. We also learn from Jerome that Judith was in the number of the
          books reckoned up by the Nicene Council. Thus the fathers who give
          catalogues of the Old Testament show the existence of a Jewish and a
          Christian canon in relation to the Old Testament; the latter wider
          than the former; their private opinion being more favorable to the
          one, though the other was historically transmitted. In relation to the
          New Testament, the synods which drew up lists of the sacred books show
          the view of some leading father like Augustine, along with what custom
          had sanctioned. In this department no member of the synod exercised
          his critical faculty; a number together would decide such questions
          summarily. Bishops proceed in the track of tradition or authority.

          Chapters xvi. and iv. In the former the reference is to Enoch lxxxix.

          A small body of literature originating in the fragment of Papias
          preserved by Eusebius (Hist. Eccles. iii, 39, 1-4) has appeared;
          though it is difficult to obtain satisfactory conclusions. Not only
          have Weiffenbach and Leimbach written treatises on the subject, but
          other scholars have entered into it more or less fully,—Zahn, Steitz,
          Riggenbach, Hilgenfeld, Lipsius, Keim, Martens, Loman, Holtzmann,
          Hausrath, Tietz, and Lightfoot. The fragment is not of great weight in
          settling the authenticity of the four gospels. Indirectly indeed it
          throws some light on the connection of two evangelists with written
          memoirs of the life of Jesus; but it rather suggests than solves
          various matters of importance. It is tolerably clear that the gospels,
          if such they may be called, of which he speaks as written by Matthew
          and Mark, were not identical with the works now existing under the
          names of these evangelists; and that no safe conclusion can be drawn
          from Papias's silence about John's and Luke's as not then in
          existence. Neither the present gospels nor any other had been
          converted into
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">Scripture</span></em
          >; since he regarded oral traditions as more credible than written
          memoirs. Those who hold that the presbyter John was none other than
          the apostle, Eusebius having misunderstood the fragment and made a
          different John from the apostle, as well as the critics who deduce
          from the fragment the fact that John suffered martyrdom in Palestine,
          have not established these conclusions. Papias refers to the material
          he got for explaining the λογία, rather than the source whence they
          were drawn. But whether he learnt directly from the elders, or
          indirectly as the preposition (παρὰ) would seem to indicate, and
          whether the sentence beginning with
          <span class="tei tei-q">“What Andrew,”</span> &amp;c., (τί Ἀνδρέας κ.
          τ. λ.) stands in apposition to the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“words of the elders,”</span> (τούς τῶν
          πρεσβυτέρων λόγους) or not, are things uncertain.
