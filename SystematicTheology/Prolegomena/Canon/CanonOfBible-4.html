        <h2>Chapter IV. Number And Order Of The Separate Books.</h2>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The number of the books was variously estimated. Josephus gives
          twenty-two, which was the usual number among Christian writers in the
          second, third, and fourth centuries, having been derived perhaps from
          the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Origen, Jerome, and others have
          it. It continued longest among the teachers of the Greek Church, and
          is even in Nicephorus's stichometry.<a
            href="#note_83"
            id="noteref_83"
            class="pginternal"
            ><span class="tei tei-noteref"
              ><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super"
                >83</span
              ></span
            ></a
          >
          The enumeration in question has Ruth with Judges, and Lamentations
          with Jeremiah. In Epiphanius<a
            href="#note_84"
            id="noteref_84"
            class="pginternal"
            ><span class="tei tei-noteref"
              ><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super"
                >84</span
              ></span
            ></a
          >
          the number twenty-seven is found, made by taking the alphabet enlarged
          with the five final letters, and dividing Samuel, Kings, and
          Chronicles into two books each. This is probably an ingenious
          combination belonging to the father himself. The Talmud has
          twenty-four,<a href="#note_85" id="noteref_85" class="pginternal"
            ><span class="tei tei-noteref"
              ><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super"
                >85</span
              ></span
            ></a
          >
          a number which did not originate in the Greek alphabet, else the
          Palestinian Jews would not have adopted it. The synagogue did not fix
          it officially. After the Pentateuch and the former prophets, which are
          in the usual order, it gives Jeremiah as the first of the later,
          succeeded by Ezekiel and Isaiah with the twelve minor prophets. The
          Talmud knows no other reason for such an order than that it was made
          according to the contents of the prophetic books, not according to the
          times of the writers. This solution is unsatisfactory. It is more
          probable that chronology had to do with the arrangement.<a
            href="#note_86"
            id="noteref_86"
            class="pginternal"
            ><span class="tei tei-noteref"
              ><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super"
                >86</span
              ></span
            ></a
          >
          After the anonymous collection or second part of Isaiah had been
          joined to the first or authentic prophecies, the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg052"></a> lateness of these oracles
          brought Isaiah into the third place among the greater prophets. The
          Talmudic order of the Hagiographa is Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs,
          Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra,
          Chronicles. Here Ruth precedes the Psalter, coming as near the former
          prophets as possible; for it properly belongs to them, the contents
          associating it with the Judges' time. The Talmudic order is that
          usually adopted in German MSS. What is the true estimate of it? Is it
          a proper Talmudic regulation? Perhaps not, else the Hebrew MSS. of the
          French and Spanish Jews would not so readily have departed from it.
          Bloch supposes that Baba Bathra, which gives the arrangement of the
          books, is one of the apocryphal Boraithas that proceeded from an
          individual teacher and had no binding authority.<a
            href="#note_87"
            id="noteref_87"
            class="pginternal"
            ><span class="tei tei-noteref"
              ><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super"
                >87</span
              ></span
            ></a
          >
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The Masoretic arrangement differs from the Talmudic in putting Isaiah
          before Jeremiah and Ezekiel. The Hagiographa are, Psalms, Proverbs,
          Job, Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra
          (with Nehemiah), Chronicles.<a
            href="#note_88"
            id="noteref_88"
            class="pginternal"

              ></span

          This is usually adopted in Spanish MSS. But MSS. often differ
          arbitrarily, because transcribers did not consider themselves bound to
          any one arrangement.<a
            href="#note_89"
            id="noteref_89"

          According to some, a very old testimony to the commencing and
          concluding books of the third division is given by the New Testament
          (Luke xxiv. 44; Matthew xxiii. 35), agreeably to which the Psalms were
          first and the Chronicles last; but this is inconclusive.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The Alexandrian translators, as we have seen already, placed the books
          differently from the Palestinian Jews. In their version Daniel comes
          after Ezekiel, so that it is put beside the greater prophets. Was this
          done by Jews or Christians? Perhaps by the latter, who put it between
          the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg053"></a>
          greater and lesser prophets, or in other words, out of the third into
          the second division, because of dogmatic grounds, and so effaced a
          trace of the correct chronology. Little importance, however, can be
          attached to the order of the books in the Septuagint; because the work
          was done at different times by different persons. But whatever may
          have been the arrangement of the parts when the whole was complete, we
          know that it was disturbed by Protestants separating the apocryphal
          writings and putting them all together.
