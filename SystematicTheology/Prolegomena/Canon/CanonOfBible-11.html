          Chapter XI. The Canon From Semler To The Present Time, With
          Reflections On Its Readjustment.

          was the most conspicuous scholar after the Reformation who undertook
          to correct the prevailing ideas respecting the canon. Acquainted with
          the works of Toland and Morgan, he adopted some of their views, and
          prosecuted his inquiries on their lines chiefly in relation to the New
          Testament. He had no definite principles to guide him, but judged
          books chiefly by their christian value and use to the Church. Though
          his views are sometimes one-sided and his essays ill-digested, he
          placed the subject in new lights, and rendered a service to truth
          which bore abundant fruit in after years.<a

          He dealt tradition severe blows, and freed theology from the yoke of
          the letter. He was followed by his disciple Corrodi, by G. L. Oeder,
          J. D. Michaelis, Herder, Lessing, and Eichhorn,—most of whom
          recommended their views by a freshness of style which Semler did not
          command. The more recent works of Gesenius, De Wette, Zunz, Ewald,
          Hitzig, Geiger and Herzfeld have contributed to form a juster opinion
          of the true position which the books of the Bible occupy.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          In the New Testament, the writings of F. C. Baur have opened up a new
          method of investigating the canon, which promises important and
          lasting results. Proceeding in the track of Semler, he prosecuted his
          researches into primitive Christianity with great acuteness and
          singular power of combination. Though his separation of Petrine and
          Pauline
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg126"></a> christianity is not new, he
          has applied it in ways which neither Toland nor Morgan was competent
          to manage. These writers perceived the difference between the leading
          principle of the twelve and that of Paul, they had some far-seeing
          glimpses of the origin and differences of the New Testament
          writings,<a href="#note_384" id="noteref_384" class="pginternal"
            ><span class="tei tei-noteref"

          but they propounded them in an unsystematic way along with untenable
          conjectures. It was reserved for the Tübingen professor to elaborate
          the hypothesis of an Ebionite or primitive christianity in
          contra-distinction from a Pauline, applying it to the origin and
          constitution of christian literature; in a word, to use a
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">tendenz-kritik</span></span
          >
          for opening up the genius of the sacred writings as well as the stages
          of early christianity out of which they arose. The head of the
          Tübingen school, it is true, has carried out the antagonism between
          the Petrine and Pauline christians too rigorously, and invaded the
          authenticity of the sacred writings to excess; for it is hazardous to
          make a theory extremely stringent to the comparative neglect of
          modifying circumstances, which, though increasing the difficulty of
          criticism, contribute to the security of its processes. Yet he has
          properly emphasized internal evidence; and many of his conclusions
          about the books will stand. He has thrown much light on the original
          relations of parties immediately after the origin of Christianity, and
          disturbed an organic unity of the New Testament which had been merely
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">assumed</span></em
          >
          by traditionalists. The best Introductions to the New Testament must
          accept them to some extent. The chief characteristic of the school is
          the application of historic criticism to the genesis of the New
          Testament writings, irrespective of tradition—a striving to discover
          the circumstances or tendencies out of which the books originated.
          Baur's
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="de"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">tendenz</span></span
          >-principle judiciously applied cannot but produce good results.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          We have seen that sound critical considerations did not
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg127"></a> regulate the formation of
          the three collections which made up the entire canon of the Old
          Testament. Had it been so, the Pentateuch would not have been
          attributed to Moses. Neither would a number of latter prophecies have
          been accepted as Isaiah's and incorporated with the prophet's
          authentic productions. All the Proverbs, the book of Ecclesiastes, and
          the Song of Songs would not have been assigned to Solomon; Jonah would
          have been separated from the prophets, and Daniel must have had a
          later position in the Hagiographa. We cannot, therefore, credit the
          collectors or editors of the books with great critical sagacity. But
          they did their best in the circumstances, preserving invaluable
          records of the Hebrew people. In like manner, it has appeared, that
          the ecclesiastics to whom we owe the New Testament collection were not
          sharp-sighted in the literature with which they had to do. It is true
          that well-founded doubts were entertained by the early Christians
          about several portions, such as the second Epistle of Peter, the
          Epistle to the Hebrews, &amp;c., but the Revelation was needlessly
          discredited. They accepted without hesitation the pastoral epistles as
          Pauline, but doubted some of the Catholic Epistles, which bear the
          impress of authenticity more strongly, such as James. It is therefore
          incorrect to say that 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, James, Jude, Epistle to
          the Hebrews, and the Apocalypse
          <span class="tei tei-q"
            >“have been received into the canon on evidence less complete”</span
          >
          than that belonging to the others. The very general admission of the
          fourth gospel as the apostle John's, is a curious example of facile
          traditionalism. Biblical criticism, however, scarcely existed in the
          first three centuries. It is for us to set the subject in another
          light, because our means of judging are superior. If the resources of
          the early fathers were inadequate to the proper sifting of a copious
          literature, they should be mildly judged.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The question of the canon is not settled. It is probably the work of
          successive inquirers to set it on a right basis,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg128"></a> and adjust the various
          parts in a manner consistent with historic criticism, sound reason,
          and religion. The absolute and relative worth of books; the degrees in
          which they regulate ethics and conduct; their varying values at the
          times of their first appearance and our own; their places in the
          general history of human progress—all these must be determined before
          the documents of Judaism and Christianity be classified aright. Their
          present arrangement is external. Based on no interior principle, it
          furnishes little help toward a thorough investigation of the whole.
          Those who look upon the question as historical and literary take a
          one-sided view. It has a theological character also. It needs the
          application, not only of historic criticism, but the immediate
          consciousness belonging to every Christian. The two Testaments should
          be separated, and their respective positions assigned to each—the Old
          having been preparatory to the New. Should it be said bluntly, as it
          is in the 7th Article of the Anglican Church, that the Old is not
          contrary to the New Testament? Luther at least expressed his opinion
          of the difference between them pretty clearly;<a
            href="#note_385"
            id="noteref_385"

              ></span
            ></a
          >
          though the theologians of Germany after him evinced a desire to
          minimise the difference.<a
            href="#note_386"

          Should the general opinion of the Protestant Church that the authority
          of the Old Testament is not subordinate to that of the New, be rigidly
          upheld? According to one aspect of the former it may be so, viz., its
          prophetic and theological aspect, that in which it is brought into
          close union with the latter; the essence of the one being foreshadowed
          or implied in the other, as Justin Martyr supposed. And this view has
          never lost
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg129"></a> supporters, who by the help
          of double senses, types, and symbols, with assumed prediction of the
          definite and distant future, transform the old dispensation into an
          outline picture of the new; taking into it a body of divinity which is
          alien from its nature. According to another aspect, viz., the moral
          and historical, the equality can scarcely be allowed. Schleiermacher
          is right in saying that the Old Testament seems to be nothing but a
          superfluous authority for doctrine; an opinion coinciding with that of
          the early Socinians, who held that it has a historical, not a
          dogmatic, value. Only such of our pious emotions as are of a general
          nature are accurately reflected in the Old Testament; and all that is
          most decidedly Jewish is of least value to christians. The alleged
          coincidence of the Old Testament with the New must be modified by the
          doctrine of development. It has been fostered by types and prophecies
          supposed to refer to christian times; by the assumed
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">dictation</span></em
          >
          of all Scripture by the Holy Spirit; by fancied references of the one
          dispensation to the other; by the confounding of a Jewish Messiah
          sketched in various prophets, with Jesus Christ, as if the latter had
          not changed, exalted and purified the Messianic idea to suit his
          sublime purposes of human regeneration. The times and circumstances in
          which the Old Testament Scriptures appeared, the manners, usages,
          civilization, intellectual and moral stage of the Semitic race combine
          to give them a lower position than that of the New Testament books
          which arose out of a more developed perception of the relations
          between God and men. Spiritual apprehension had got beyond Jewish
          particularism, especially in the case of the apostle Paul, who gave
          the new religion a distinct vitality by severing it from its Jewish
          predecessor.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          The agreement of the New Testament books with themselves must be
          modified by the same doctrine of development. Jewish and Pauline
          christianity appear in different works,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg130"></a> necessarily imparting a
          difference of views and expression; or they are blended in various
          degrees, as in the epistles to the Hebrews and the first of Peter.
          Hence, absolute harmony cannot be looked for. If the standpoints of
          the writers were so diverse, how can their productions coincide? The
          alleged coincidence can only be intersected with varieties
          proportioned to the measures in which the authors possessed the Spirit
          of God. These varieties affect the matter as well as the manner of the
          writings. It is therefore unphilosophical to treat the Bible as a
          whole which was dictated by the Spirit and directed to one end. Its
          uniformity is chequered with variety; its harmony with disagreement.
          It is a bundle of books; a selection from a wider literature,
          reflecting many diversities of religious apprehension. After the two
          Testaments have been rightly estimated according to their respective
          merits, the contents of each should be duly apportioned—internal
          evidence being the test of their relative importance, irrespective of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span
          >
          assumptions. Their traditional origin and authority must be
          subordinated to the inherent value they bear, or the conformity of the
          ideas to the will of God. The gradual formation of both canons
          suggests an analysis of the classes into which they came to be put;
          for the same canonical dignity was not attributed by the Jews to the
          books contained in the three divisions; and the controverted writings
          of the New Testament found gradual recognition very slowly. Luther
          made important distinctions between the canonical books;<a
            href="#note_387"
            id="noteref_387"
            class="pginternal"
            ><span class="tei tei-noteref"
              ><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super"
                >387</span
              ></span
            ></a
          >
          and Carlstadt put the Antilegomena of the New Testament on a par with
          the Hagiographa of the Old.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          In the Old Testament the three classes or canons have been generally
          estimated by the Jews according to their respective antiquity; though
          the sacrificial worship enjoined in the Pentateuch never formed an
          essential part of the Jewish religion; the best prophets having set
          small value
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg131"></a>
          upon it. The pure monotheistic doctrine of these last writers, chiefly
          contained in the second canon, lifts that class up to the highest
          rank; yet the Decalogue in the Pentateuch is sufficient to stamp the
          first canon with great worth. It must be confessed, however, that the
          Mosaic law was meagre, in the domain of pure ethics; and that it
          promoted among the people a slavish spirit of positivism by laying
          more stress on acts than dispositions, and insisting on small
          regulations. For this reason, the prophets combated its narrow
          externality. The three canons were regarded with a degree of
          veneration corresponding to the order in which they stand. To
          apportion their respective values to the individual parts of them is a
          difficult task.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          As to the New Testament writings, we think that some of them might
          conveniently occupy the position of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">deutero-canonical</span></em
          >, equivalent to those of the Old Testament having that title. We
          allude to 2 and 3 John, Jude, James, 2 Peter, the Revelation. It is
          true that a few of these were prior in time to some of the
          universally-received gospels or epistles; but time is not an important
          factor in a good classification. Among the Pauline epistles
          themselves, classification might be adopted; for the pastoral letters
          are undoubtedly post-Pauline, and inferior to the authentic ones. In
          classifying the New Testament writings, three things might be
          considered—the reception they met with from the first, their
          authenticity, above all, their internal excellence. The subject is not
          easy, because critics are not universally agreed about the proper rank
          and authenticity of a few documents. The Epistle to the Colossians,
          for example, creates perplexity; that to the Ephesians is less
          embarrassing, its post-Pauline origin being tolerably clear.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          What is wanted is a rational historic criticism to moderate the
          theological hypothesis with which the older Protestants set out, the
          supernatural inspiration of the books, their internal inseparability,
          and their direct reference to the work of salvation. It must be
          allowed that many points are independent
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg132"></a>
          of dogmatics; and that the right decision in things historical may be
          reached apart from any ecclesiastical standpoint.
        </p>
        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          Again, should the distinction between the apocryphal and canonical
          books of the Old Testament be emphasized as it is by many? Should a
          sharp line be put between the two, as though the one class, with the
          period it belonged to, were characterized by the errors and
          anachronisms of its history; the other by simplicity and accuracy; the
          one, by books written under fictitious names; the other, by the power
          to distinguish truth from falsehood or by honesty of purpose? Should
          the one be a sign of the want of truthfulness and discernment; the
          other, of religious simplicity? Can this aggregation of the Apocrypha
          over against the Hagiographa, serve the purpose of a just estimate?
          Hardly so; for some of the latter, such as Esther and Ecclesiastes,
          cannot be put above Wisdom, 1st Maccabees, Judith, Baruch, or
          Ecclesiasticus. The doctrine of immortality, clearly expressed in the
          Book of Wisdom, is not in Ecclesiastes; neither is God once named in
          the Book of Esther as author of the marvelous deliverances which the
          chosen people are said to have experienced. The history narrated in
          1st Maccabees is more credible than that in Esther. It is therefore
          misleading to mark off all the apocryphal works as
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">human</span></em
          >
          and all the canonical ones as
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">divine</span></em
          >. The divine and the human elements in man are too intimately blended
          to admit of such separation. The best which he produces partakes of
          both. The human element still permeates them as long as God speaks
          through man; and He neither dictates nor speaks otherwise. In the
          attributes claimed for the canonical books no rigid line can be drawn.
          It may be that the inspiration of their authors differed in degree;
          that the writer of Ecclesiastes, for example, was more philosophical
          than Jesus, son of Sirach; but different degrees of inspiration belong
          to the canonical writers themselves. Undue exaltation of the Hebrew
          canon does injustice to the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg133"></a> wider Alexandrian one. Yet
          some still speak of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the pure Hebrew canon,”</span> identifying it
          with that of the Church of England. We admit that history had become
          legendary, that it was written in an oratorical style by the
          Alexandrian Jews, and was used for didactic purposes as in Tobit and
          Judith. Gnomic poetry had survived in the book of Sirach; prophecy, in
          Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremiah, though here the language is
          already prosaic. Imitation is too observable in the matter and manner
          of the Apocrypha. They have parallels, however, among the Hagiographa,
          which originated in an age when the genuine breath of prophetic
          inspiration had ceased; when history and prophecy had degenerated; so
          that the transition from Esther and Malachi to Judith and Baruch, as
          also from Proverbs to Wisdom, is not great.

          canon is generally adopted at the present day. It was not, however,
          universally received even by the Jews; for Esther was omitted out of

          Sirach was annexed to it as late as the beginning of the 4th century.

          contrary judgment; nor can all who followed the Alexandrian canon be
          pronounced uncritical, including Origen himself. A stereotyped canon
          of the Old Testament, either among Jews or Christians of the first
          four centuries, which excluded all the apocryphal books and included
          all the canonical ones, cannot be shown. And in regard to
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the critical judgment”</span>
          of Jews and Christians in that period it is arbitrary to suppose that

          The aim of the inquirer should be to find from competent
          witnesses—from contemporaneous or succeeding writers of trustworthy
          character—the authors and ages of the biblical books. When evidence of
          this kind is not available as often happens, the only resource is the
          internal. The external evidence in favor of the canon is all but
          exhausted, and nothing of importance can be added to it now. Its
          strength has been brought out; its weakness has not been equally
          exhibited. The problem resolves itself into an examination of internal
          characteristics, which may be strong enough to modify or
          counterbalance the external. The latter have had an artificial
          preponderance in the past; henceforward they must be regulated by the
          internal. The main conclusion should be drawn from the contents of the
          books themselves. And the example of Jews and Christians, to whom we

          What are degrees or kinds of inspiration assumed by many, but a tacit
          acknowledgment of the fact that books vary in intrinsic value as they
          are more or less impregnated with divine truth or differ in the
          proportion of the eternal and temporal elements which commingle in
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg135"></a> every revealed religion?
          Doubtless the authors from whom the separate books proceeded, if
          discoverable, should be regarded; the inspiration of an Isaiah is
          higher than that of a Malachi, and an apostle is more authoritative
          than an evangelist; but the authors are often unknown. Besides, the
          process of redaction through which many of the writings passed,
          hinders an exact knowledge of authorship. In these circumstances the
          books themselves must determine the position they should occupy in the
          estimation of those who are looking at records of the past to help
          their spiritual life. And if it be asked, What principle should lie at
          the basis of a thorough classification? the answer is, the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">normative element</span></em
          >
          contained in the sacred books. This is the characteristic which should
          regulate classification. The time when a book appeared, its author,
          the surrounding circumstances that influenced him, are of less
          consequence than its bearing upon the spiritual education of mankind.
          The extent of its adequacy to promote this end determines the rank.
          Such books as embody the indestructible essence of religion with the
          fewest accidents of time, place and nature—which present conditions
          not easily disengaged from the imperishable life of the soul, deserve
          the first rank. Whatever Scriptures express ideas consonant with the
          nature of God as a holy, loving, just and good Being—as a benevolent
          Father not willing the destruction of any of his children; the
          Scriptures presenting ideas of Him consistent with pure reason and
          man's highest instincts, besides such as set forth our sense of
          dependence on the infinite; the books, in short, that contain a
          revelation from God with least admixture of the human conditions under
          which it is transmitted—these belong to the highest class. If they
          lead the reader away from opinion to practice, from dogma to life,
          from non-doing to obedience to the law of moral duty, from the notion
          that everything in salvation has been done for him to the keeping of
          the commandments, from particularist conceptions about the divine
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg136"></a> mercy to the widest belief
          of its overshadowing presence—such books of Scripture are in that same
          proportion to be ranked among the best. In regard to the Old
          Testament, conformity to Christ's teaching will determine rank; or,
          which is tantamount, conformity to that pure reason which is God's
          natural revelation in man; a criterion which assigns various ranks to
          such Scriptures as appeared among a Semite race at a certain stage of
          its development. In the New Testament, the words and precepts of Jesus
          have a character of their own, though it is very difficult to select
          them from the gospels. The supposition that the apostles' productions
          possess a higher authority than those of their disciples, is natural.
          But the immediate followers of Christ did not all stand on one
          platform. Differing from one another even in important principles, it
          is possible, if not certain, that some of their disciples' composition
          may be of higher value. The spirit of God may have wrought within the
          apostles generally with greater power and clearness than in other
          teachers; but its operation is conditioned not merely by outward
          factors but by individual idiosyncrasy; so that one who had not seen
          the Lord and was therefore not an apostle proper, may have apprehended
          his mind better than an immediate disciple. Paul stood above the
          primitive apostles in the extent to which he fathomed the pregnant
          sayings of Jesus and developed their latent germs. Thus the normative
          element—that which determines the varying degrees of authority
          belonging to the New Testament—does not lie in apostolic authorship
          but internal worth; in the clearness and power with which the divine
          Spirit enabled men to grasp the truth. By distinguishing the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"
            ><span style="font-style: italic">temporal</span></em

          statement that the primitive Christians are proper judges to determine

          accepting the same writings? Not for a considerable time, until the
          means of ascertaining the real authors of the books and the ability to
          do so were lacking.

          As to the Old Testament, the Palestinian Jews determined the canonical
          books by gradually contracting the list and stopping it at a time when
          their calamities throwing them back on the past for springs of hope,
          had stiffened them within a narrow traditionalism; but their brethren
          in Egypt, touched by Alexandrian culture and Greek philosophy,
          received later productions into their canon, some of which at least
          are of equal value with Palestinian ones. In any case, the degree of
          authority attaching to the Biblical books grew from less to greater,
          till it culminated in a divine character, a sacredness rising even to
          infallibility.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138"></span
          ><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg138"></a> Doubtless the Jews of
          Palestine distinguished the canonical from the apocryphal or
          deutero-canonical books on grounds satisfactory to themselves; but
          their judgment was not infallible. A senate of Rabbis under the old
          dispensation might err, as easily as a synod of priests under the new.
          Though they may have been
          <em class="tei tei-emph"

          so. Their discernment may be commended without being magnified. The
          general feeling of leaning upon the past was a sound one, for the best
          times of Judaism had departed, and with them the most original
          effusions; yet the wave of Platonism that passed over Alexandria could
          not but quicken even the conservative mind of the Jew. Greek thought
          blended with echoes of the past, though in dulled form. Still a line
          had to be drawn in the national literature; and it was well drawn on
          the whole. The feeling existed that the collection must be closed with
          works of a certain period and a certain character; and it was closed
          accordingly, without preventing individuals from putting their private
          opinions over against authority, and dissenting.

          At the present day a new arrangement is necessary; but where is the
          ecclesiastical body bold enough to undertake it? And if it were
          attempted or carried out by non-ecclesiastical parties, would the
          churches approve or adopt the proceeding? We venture to say, that if
          some books be separated from the collection and others put in their
          place—if the classification of some be altered, and their authority
          raised or lowered—good will be done; the Bible will have a fairer
          degree of normal power in doctrine and morals, and continue to promote

          criticism be needlessly negative it cannot remove this time-honored
          legacy from the position it is entitled to, else the spiritual

          The canon was a work of divine providence, because history, in a
          religious view, necessarily implies the fact. It was a work of
          inspiration, because the agency of the Holy Spirit has always been
          with the people of God as a principle influencing their life. It was
          not, however, the result of a

          The canonical authority of Scripture does not depend on any church or
          council. The early church may be cited as a

            ><span style="font-style: italic">witness</span></em
          >
          for it; that is all. Canonical authority lies in Scripture itself, and
          is inherent in the books so far as they contain a declaration of the
          divine will. Hence, there is truth in the statement of old theologians
          that the authority of Scripture is from God alone. It was the early
          church indeed that made the canon, selecting the books which appeared
          to have been written by apostles or apostolic men, and carrying over
          to them authority from alleged authenticity more than internal value.
          But the latter is the real index of authority; and God is the fountain

          confert scripturæ novam aliquam autoritatem quoad nos, sed
