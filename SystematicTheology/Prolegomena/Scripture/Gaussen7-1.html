        <h2>I. Retrospect</h2>
        <p>
          Divine inspiration, we have said, is not a system; it is a fact: and
          that fact, if attested by God, becomes to us a dogma. But it is the
          book that is inspired; it is with the book that, above all things, we
          have to do, and not with the writers. We might almost dispense with
          believing the inspiration of the thoughts, while we could not dispense
          with believing that of the language. If the words of the book are
          God's words, of what consequence to me, after all, are the thoughts of
          the writer? Whatever his mental qualifications, what proceeded from
          his hands would always be the Bible: whereas, let the thoughts be
          given him, and not the words, and it is not a Bible that he gives me,
          it is only something more than a sermon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, we have been at great pains to make our reservations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scripture is entirely the word of man, and Scripture is entirely the
          word of God. O man, we have said, it is here especially that you are
          called to wonder and admire! It has spoken for thee, and like thee; it
          presents itself to thee, wholly clothed in humanity; the Eternal
          Spirit (in this respect at least, and in a certain measure) has made
          himself man, in order to speak to thee, as the Eternal Son made
          himself man, in order to redeem thee. It was with this view that he
          chose, before all ages, men subject to the same affections with
          thyself. He provided for this, and prepared their character, their
          circumstances, their style, their manner, their times, their way. And
          thus it is that the gospel is the tenderness of God, and the sympathy
          of God; as it is, to speak with St Paul, "the wisdom of God and the
          power of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let it not be imagined, then, that the stamp of the individual
          character of the sacred writers in the several books of the Bible,
          authorizes us to regard their inspiration as intermittent or
          incomplete. It matters little for the fact of their divine inspiration
          whether there be the absence or the concurrence of the sacred writer's
          emotions. God may either employ or dispense with them. If he uses
          second causes in all his other works, why should he abstain from doing
          so in divine inspiration? Besides, as we have remarked, this
          individuality, which is made the ground of objection, equally shows
          itself in those parts of Scripture which are most incontestibly
          dictated by God. This system of a gradual and intermittent inspiration
          presents characters at once of complication, rashness, and
          childishness; but what, above all, condemns it, is its being directly
          contrary to the testimony which the Scripture has borne to its own
          nature. After all, think not that, in employing our personality, it
          has done so at random. No: all its several writers were chosen from
          before the foundation of the world for the work to which they were
          destined, and God prepared them for it, as he did St Paul, "from their
          mother's womb." Oh, but the sacred books are admirable in this
          respect; how incomparable do they appear, and how soon do we
          abundantly recognize in them the divine power which caused them to be
          written!
        </p>
        <p>
          Scripture is then from God; it is every where from God, and every
          where it is entirely from God. That is our thesis; and this is what we
          have done to establish it; this we could do only by Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          If God reveals himself, it is for him to tell us, in that same
          revelation, in what measure he has been pleased to do so. Far from us
          be all idle hypotheses! In these we should only meet with our own
          fancies, and fascinate the eye of our faith. What then say the
          Scriptures? The whole question lies there.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, we have said, they declare to us, that all the words of
          the prophets are entirely given and warranted by God. In the second
          place, they attest to us that all the scriptures of the Old Testament,
          are the words of the prophets. Finally, they demonstrate to us that
          the New Testament Scriptures are no less so. All the words of the New
          Testament, then, are equally warranted by God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, too, was the conviction of the apostles of Jesus Christ. See
          what use they made of the Bible. What was it in their eyes? Did they
          not believe in its entire divine inspiration? Is it possible not to
          conclude from their whole conduct that, for them, the Scriptures were
          inspired of God, even to their most minute expressions?
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is for us a proof still more decisive than all the rest. Let
          us consult the example of the Son of God himself. Let us attend to
          what he says of the Scriptures. Let us listen to him, especially when
          he quotes them. Assuredly (we must not be afraid to say it) among the
          most ardent defenders of their verbal inspiration, there is not one to
          be found who has ever expressed himself with more respect for the
          altogether divine authority, and the perpetuity of their most minute
          expressions, than has been done by the man Jesus. And when a modern
          writer happens to quote the Bible in the way that Jesus Christ quoted
          it, in order to deduce some doctrine from it, you will see him
          forthwith ranked among the most enthusiastic partisans of our doctrine
          of plenary inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>Nevertheless we have had objections to consider.</p>
        <p>
          Some opposed to us the necessity for translations, and their
          unavoidable imperfection; others, the numerous various readings
          presented by the ancient manuscripts which had to be employed in
          printing our Scriptures. We replied that those two facts could nowise
          affect the question. It is the primitive text that we have to do with.
          Were the apostles and prophets commissioned to give us a Bible
          entirely inspired and without the admixture of any error?—such is the
          question. But, at the same time, we have been called to participate in
          the Church's triumph at the state in which our sacred manuscripts are
          found, and the astonishing insignificance of the various readings. The
          Lord's providence has watched over this inestimable deposit.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was farther adduced as an objection to the inspiration of the
          words, was the use made by the apostles, in the New Testament, of the
          Septuagint; but we, on the contrary, pointed to the fact that in the
          independent and sovereign manner in which they have made use of it,
          you have a fresh proof (of the presence) of the Spirit who caused them
          to speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, some have gone so far as to object to us, that, after all,
          there are errors in the Scriptures; and these errors they have
          specifically stated to us. This fact we denied. Because they have not
          at once understood some narrative, or some expression, some have
          rashly ventured to censure the Word of God! While willing to present
          some examples of the recklessness and erroneousness of such
          reproaches, we hastened at the same time to take note of this
          objection, for the purpose of showing its authors that they could not
          attack the inspiration of the language without imputing error to the
          thoughts of the Holy Ghost. Reckless indeed they are! At the very time
          that they say of the Bible, as Pilate said of Jesus Christ, "What evil
          hath he done?" they put it upon its defence at the bar of their
          tribunal! To such objectors we would say, "What then would you do to
          those who smite him on the cheek, who spit upon him, and who say to
          him, 'Prophesy who it is that smote thee?' Surely it is not for you to
          place yourselves on such a judgment-seat."
        </p>
        <p>
          The language of Scripture has been blamed for erroneous expressions,
          betraying, on the part of the sacred authors, an ignorance (otherwise,
          it is said, pardonable enough) of the constitution of the heavens, and
          of the phenomena of nature. But here, as elsewhere, the objections, on
          being viewed more closely, pass into subjects of admiration. It is as
          if, in making us polish the diamonds of holy Scripture by a more
          diligent examination, they elicited unexpected splendours, and served
          only to dazzle us with more brilliant reflections of its divinity. At
          the same time that you cannot find in the Bible any of those errors
          which abound in the sacred books of all Pagan nations, as well as in
          all the philosophical systems of antiquity, it in a thousand ways
          discloses in its language the knowledge of "the Ancient of Days;" and
          you will, erelong, ascertain that—whether we look to the expressions
          which it employs, or to those which it avoids employing—that language
          maintained, throughout thirty centuries, a scientific and profound
          harmony with the eternal truth of facts. In that language it seems to
          say: What you knew only but as yesterday. I spoke not of to you, yet I
          knew it from eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words of Paul also were objected to us, in which that apostle
          distinguishes that which the Lord says from that which he himself
          says. We believe we have shown that, on the contrary, he could not
          have given a more convincing proof of his inspiration than is found in
          the boldness of such a distinction, seeing that, with an authority
          altogether divine, he repeals some of the laws of the Old Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still this was not all; we had to reply to other objections,
          presenting themselves rather under the form of systems, and which
          would make bold to exclude a part of God's book from being held to be
          inspired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some have been willing to admit the inspiration of the thoughts of the
          Bible, and to contest that of the language only; but we reminded such,
          first, that there exists so necessary a dependence between the
          thoughts and the words, that it is impossible to conceive a complete
          inspiration of the former without a full inspiration of the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          We charged this fatal system, besides, with being no better than a
          purely human hypothesis, fantastically assumed, without there being
          any thing in Scripture to authorize it. Accordingly we said that it
          led inevitably to suppositions that were most disparaging to the Word
          of God; while, at the same time, to our mind, it removed no
          difficulty, seeing that, after all, it but substitutes for one
          inexplicable operation of God another which is no less so.
        </p>
        <p>
          But further, we added, what purpose does this system serve, since it
          is incomplete, and since, by the confession of those even who maintain
          it, it applies to one portion only of the Scriptures?
        </p>
        <p>
          Others, again, have been ready sometimes to concede to us the plenary
          inspiration of certain books, but with the exclusion from these of the
          historical writings. Besides that every distinction of this kind is
          gratuitous, rash, opposed to the terms of the Scriptures, we were fain
          to show that these books are perhaps, of the whole Bible, those whose
          inspiration is best attested, most necessary, most evident; those
          which Jesus Christ quoted with most respect; those which sound men's
          hearts and tell the secrets of their consciences. They foretell the
          most important events of the future in their most minute details; they
          constantly announce Jesus Christ; they describe the character of God;
          they inculcate doctrines; they give forth laws; they make revelations.
          In a word, they exhibit the splendour of a divine wisdom, both in what
          they say, and in what they are silent about. In order to write them,
          more than men, more than angels, were called for.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have been asked, finally, if we could discover any thing divine in
          certain passages of the Scriptures, too vulgar, it has been said, to
          be inspired. We believe we have shown how much wisdom, on the
          contrary, shines out in these passages, as soon as, instead of passing
          a hasty judgment on them, we would look in them for the teaching of
          the Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fine, we besought the reader to go directly to the Scriptures, for
          the purpose of devoting to the prayerful study of them that time which
          he might hitherto have given to judging them; and we assured him, on
          the testimony of the whole church, and after a threefold experience,
          that the divine inspiration of the minutest parts of the Holy Word
          will erelong reveal itself to him, if he will but study it with
          reverence.
        </p>
        <p>But we must draw to a close.</p>
