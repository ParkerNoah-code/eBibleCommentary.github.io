          If every man has the right, and is bound to read the Scriptures, and
          to judge for himself what they teach, he must have certain rules to
          guide him in the exercise of this privilege and duty. These rules are
          not arbitrary. They are not imposed by human authority. They have no
          binding force which does not flow from their own intrinsic truth and
          propriety. They are few and simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The words of Scripture are to be taken in their plain historical
          sense. That is, they must be taken in the sense attached to them in
          the age and by the people to whom they were addressed. This only
          assumes that the sacred writers were honest, and meant to be
          understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If the Scriptures be what they claim to be, the word of God, they
          are the work of one mind, and that mind divine. From this it follows
          that Scripture cannot contradict Scripture. God cannot teach in one
          place anything which is inconsistent with what He teaches in another.
          Hence Scripture must explain Scripture. If a passage admits of
          different interpretations, that only can be the true one which agrees
          with what the Bible teaches elsewhere on the same subject. If the
          Scriptures teach that the Son is the same in substance and equal in
          power and glory with the Father, then when the Son says, "The Father
          is greater than I," the superiority must be understood in a manner
          consistent with this equality. It must refer either to subordination
          as to the mode of subsistence and operation, or it must be official. A
          king's son may say, "My father is greater than I," although personally
          his father's equal. This rule of interpretation is sometimes called
          the analogy of Scripture, and sometimes the analogy of faith. There is
          no material difference in the meaning of the two expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The Scriptures are to be interpreted under the guidance of the Holy
          Spirit, which guidance is to be humbly and earnestly sought. The
          ground of this rule is twofold: First, the Spirit is promised as a
          guide and teacher. He was to come to lead the people of God into the
          knowledge of the truth. And secondly, the Scriptures teach, that "the
          natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they
          are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are
          spiritually discerned." (1 Cor. 2:14.) The unrenewed mind is naturally
          blind to spiritual truth. His heart is in opposition to the things of
          God. Congeniality of mind is necessary to the proper apprehension of
          divine things. As only those who have a moral nature can discern moral
          truth, so those only who are spiritually minded can truly receive the
          things of the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that all the true people of God in every age and in every
          part of the Church, in the exercise of their private judgment, in
          accordance with the simple rules above stated, agree as to the meaning
          of Scripture in all things necessary either in faith or practice, is a
          decisive proof of the perspicuity of the Bible, and of the safety of
          allowing the people the enjoyment of the divine right of private
          judgment.
