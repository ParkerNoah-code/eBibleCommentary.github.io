        <h2>III. All the Scriptures of the Old Testament are Prophetic</h2>
        <p>
          And, first of all, all the Scriptures are without distinction called
          THE WORD OF GOD. This title is sufficient of itself to demonstrate to
          us, that if Isaiah began his prophecies by inviting the heavens and
          the earth to give ear because the Lord had spoken, the same summons
          ought to come forth for us from all the books of the Bible, for they
          are all called "The Word of God." "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O
          earth; for the Lord hath spoken!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowhere shall we find a single passage that permits us to detach one
          single part of it as less divine than all the rest. When we say that
          this whole book is the Word of God, do we not attest that the very
          phrases of which it is composed have been given by him?
        </p>
        <p>
          But the whole Bible is not only called "The Word of God," (ὁ λόγος τοῦ
          Θεοῦ); it is called, without distinction, THE ORACLES OF GOD (τὰ λόγια
          τοῦ Θεοῦ). Who knows not what oracles were held to be in the ideas of
          men in ancient times? Was there a word that could more absolutely
          express a verbal and complete inspiration? And as if this term, which
          St Paul employs, were not sufficient, we farther hear Stephen, filled
          with the Holy Ghost, call them the LIVING ORACLES (λόγια ζῶντα);
          "Moses," he says, "received the lively oracles, to give them unto
          us."—(Acts 7:38.)
        </p>
        <p>
          All the Scriptures then, without exception, are a continuous word of
          God; they are his miraculous voice; they are his written prophecies
          and his lively oracles. Which of their various parts, then, would you
          dare to cut off? The apostles often distinguish two parts in them,
          when they call them "Moses and the Prophets." Jesus Christ
          distinguished them into three parts when he said to his apostles,
          "That all things must be fulfilled which were written in Moses, and in
          the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me." According to this
          division, then, in which our Lord speaks according to the language of
          that time, the Old Testament would be made up of these three parts,
          —Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms; as the New Testament is composed
          of the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and the Book of the
          Revelation. Which, then, of these three parts of the Old Testament, or
          which of these four parts of the New, would you dare to withdraw from
          the Scripture of the prophets (προφητείας γραφῆς), or from the
          inspired Word (ἐνθέου λόγου—γραφῆς θεοπνεύστου)?
        </p>
        <p>
          Would it be Moses? But what more holy and more divine, in the whole
          Old Testament, than the writings of that man of God? He was in such
          sort a prophet that his holy books are placed above all the rest, and
          are called emphatically THE LAW. He was in such sort a prophet, that
          another prophet, speaking of his books alone, said, "The law of the
          Lord is perfect" (Ps. 19:7); "The words of the Lord are pure words, as
          silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times."—(Ps. 12:6.)
          He was in such sort a prophet of God, that he is compared by himself
          to none but the Son of God. "This is that Moses," it is written, "who
          said to the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God
          raise up unto you of your brethren, LIKE UNTO ME; him shall ye
          hear."—(Acts 7:37.) He was in such sort a prophet, that he was
          accustomed to preface his orders with these words: "Thus saith the
          Lord." He was in such sort a prophet, that God said to him, "Who hath
          made man's mouth? have not I, the Lord? Now therefore go; and I will
          be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say."—(Exod. 4:11.)
          Finally, he was in such sort a prophet, that it is written, "And there
          arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord
          knew face to face."—(Deut. 34:10.)
        </p>
        <p>
          What other part of the Old Testament, then, would you exclude from the
          prophetic Scriptures? Shall it be the second?—that which Jesus Christ
          calls The Prophets, and which comprises all the Old Testament,
          exclusive of Moses and the Psalms, and sometimes exclusive of Moses
          alone? It is well worth noting, that Jesus Christ, and the apostles,
          and the whole people, habitually call by the name of prophets all the
          authors of the Old Testament. They were wont to say, in order to
          designate the whole Scriptures, "Moses and the prophets."—(Luke 24:25,
          27, 44; Matt. 5:17, 7:12, 11:13, 22:40; Luke 16:16, 29, 31, 20:42;
          Acts 1:20, 3:21, 22, 7:35, 37, 8:28, 26:22, 27, 28:23; Rom. 1:2, 3:21,
          10:5, &c. &c.) Jesus Christ called all their books The Prophets:—they
          were prophets. Joshua, then, was a prophet; the authors of the
          Chronicles were prophets, quite as Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel,
          Hosea, and all the rest were, down to Malachi.
        </p>
        <p>
          They wrote then, all of them, the prophetic Scriptures (προφητείαν
          γραφῆς); all, the words of which St Peter has said, "that none of them
          came by a will of man;" all, those ἱερὰ γράμματα, those holy letters,
          which the apostle declares to be "divinely inspired." The Lord said of
          all of them as of Jeremiah, "Lo, I have put my words in thy mouth;"2
          and as of Ezekiel, "Son of man, go, speak unto them MY words: speak
          unto them, and tell them, THUS SAITH THE LORD GOD."
        </p>
        <p>
          And that all the phrases, all the words, were suggested to them by
          God, is demonstrated by a fact stated to us more than once, and in the
          study of their writings frequently brought under our eye, to wit— that
          they were charged to transmit to the Church oracles, the meaning of
          which was to remain veiled to their own minds. Daniel, for example,
          declares more than once, that he was unable to seize the prophetic
          meaning of the words that proceeded from his own lips, or were traced
          with his hand. The types, impressed by God on all the events of
          primitive history, were not to be recognised till many centuries after
          the death of the men who were commissioned to relate to us their
          leading features; and the Holy Ghost informs us that the prophets,
          after having written out their sacred pages, set themselves to study
          them with the most respectful attention, as they would have done with
          the other Scriptures, "searching what, or what manner of time THE
          SPIRIT OF CHRIST which was in them did signify, when it testified
          beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should
          follow." Behold, then, these men of God bending over their own
          writings. There they ponder the words of God and the thoughts of God.
          Can this cause you any surprise, seeing that they have written for the
          elect of the earth, and for the principalities and powers of heaven,
          the doctrines and the glories of the Son of God, and seeing these are
          things "into which the angels desire to look?"6
        </p>
        <p>
          So much for Moses and for the Prophets; but what will you say of the
          Psalms? Shall we consider these less given by the spirit of prophecy
          than all the rest? Are not the authors of the Psalms always called
          prophets? And if they are sometimes, like Moses, distinguished from
          the other prophets, is it not evidently in order that a place of
          greater eminence may be assigned them? "David was a prophet," says St
          Peter.—(Acts 2:30.) Mark what he himself says he is: "The Spirit of
          the Lord SPAKE BY ME," says he, "and HIS WORD WAS UPON MY TONGUE."—(2
          Sam. 23:1, 2.) "What David wrote," and even his words in detail, "he
          wrote SPEAKING BY THE HOLY GHOST," said our Lord.—(Mark 12:36.) The
          apostles also, quoting him (in their prayer), take care to say, "This
          Scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by the
          mouth of David spake."—(Acts 1:16.) "Lord, thou art God, who by the
          mouth of thy servant David hast said."—(Acts 4:25.) What do I say?
          These psalms were to such a degree all dictated by the Holy Ghost,
          that the Jews, and the Lord Jesus Christ himself, call them by the
          name of THE LAW; all their utterances had the force of law; their
          smallest words were from God. "Is it not written in your LAW?" said
          Jesus while quoting them, and in quoting them even for a SINGLE WORD
          (as we shall soon have occasion to show).
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole Old Testament then is, in a scriptural sense of the
          expression, a WRITTEN PROPHECY (προφητεία γραφῆς). It is plenarily
          inspired therefore by God, seeing that, according to the testimony of
          Zachariah, "it is God who spake by the mouth of his holy prophets,
          which have been since the world began;" and because, according to that
          of Peter, "they spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true that thus far our reasonings, and the testimonies on which
          they are founded, directly relate to the books of the Old Testament
          only; and it might possibly be objected to us that as yet we have
          proved nothing for the New.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall begin, before we reply, with asking, If it were likely that
          the Lord could have designed giving successive revelations to his
          people, and that, nevertheless, the latest and the most important of
          these should be inferior to the first? We would ask. If it be rational
          to imagine that the first Testament, which contained only "the shadows
          of things that were to come," could have been dictated by God in all
          its contents; while the second Testament, which sets before us the
          grand object to which all those shadows relate, and which describes to
          us the works, the character, the person, and the sayings even of the
          Son of God, was to be less inspired than the first? We would ask, If
          one can believe that the Epistles and the Gospels, which were destined
          to repeal many of the ordinances of Moses and the Prophets, could be
          less divine than Moses and the Prophets; and that the Old Testament
          could be throughout an utterance of thought on the part of God, while
          it was to be replaced, or at least modified and consummated, by a book
          emanating partly from man and partly from God?
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is no need even of our having recourse to these powerful
          inductions in order to establish the prophetic inspiration of the
          Gospel; nay, its superiority to Moses and the prophets.
