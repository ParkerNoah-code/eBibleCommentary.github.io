        <h2>IV. The Union of the Divine and Human Elements in Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          1. The Scriptures are the production equally of God and of man, and
          are therefore never to be regarded as merely human or merely divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mystery of inspiration consists in neither of these terms
          separately, but in the union of the two. Of this, however, there are
          analogies in the interpenetration of human powers by the divine
          efficiency in regeneration and sanctification, and in the union of the
          divine and human natures in the person of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to “Dalton’s law,” each gas is as a vacuum to every other:
          “Gases are mutually passive, and pass into each other as into vacua.”
          Each interpenetrates the other. But this does not furnish a perfect
          illustration of our subject. The atom of oxygen and the atom of
          nitrogen, in common air, remain side by side but they do not unite. In
          inspiration the human and the divine elements do unite. The Lutheran
          maxim, “Mens humana capax divinæ,” is one of the most important
          principles of a true theology. “The Lutherans think of humanity as a
          thing made by God for himself and to receive himself. The Reformed
          think of the Deity as ever preserving himself from any confusion with
          the creature. They fear pantheism and idolatry” (Bp. of Salisbury,
          quoted in Swayne, Our Lord’s Knowledge, xx).
        </p>
        <p>
          Sabatier, Philos. Religion, 66—“That initial mystery, the relation in
          our consciousness between the individual and the universal element,
          between the finite and the infinite, between God and man,—how can we
          comprehend their coëxistence and their union, and yet how can we doubt
          it? Where is the thoughtful man to-day who has not broken the thin
          crust of his daily life, and caught a glimpse of those profound and
          obscure waters on which floats our consciousness? Who has not felt
          within himself a veiled presence, and a force much greater than his
          own? What worker in a lofty cause has not perceived within his own
          personal activity, and saluted with a feeling of veneration, the
          mysterious activity of a universal and eternal Power? ‘In Deo vivimus,
          movemur, et sumus.’.…This mystery cannot be dissipated, for without it
          religion itself would no longer exist.” Quackenbos, in Harper’s
          Magazine, July, 1900:264, says that “hypnotic suggestion is but
          inspiration.” The analogy of human influence thus communicated may at
          least help us to some understanding of the divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This union of the divine and human agencies in inspiration is not
          to be conceived of as one of external impartation and reception.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, those whom God raised up and providentially
          qualified to do this work, spoke and wrote the words of God, when
          inspired, not as from without, but as from within, and that not
          passively, but in the most conscious possession and the most exalted
          exercise of their own powers of intellect, emotion, and will.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Holy Spirit does not dwell in man as water in a vessel. We may
          rather illustrate the experience of the Scripture writers by the
          experience of the preacher who under the influence of God’s Spirit is
          carried beyond himself, and is conscious of a clearer apprehension of
          truth and of a greater ability to utter it than belong to his unaided
          nature, yet knows himself to be no passive vehicle of a divine
          communication, but to be as never before in possession and exercise of
          his own powers. The inspiration of the Scripture writers, however,
          goes far beyond the illumination granted to the preacher, in that it
          qualifies them to put the truth, without error, into permanent and
          written form. This inspiration, moreover, is more than providential
          preparation. Like miracles, inspiration may use man’s natural powers,
          but man’s natural powers do not explain it. Moses, David, Paul, and
          John were providentially endowed and educated for their work of
          writing Scripture, but this endowment and education were not
          inspiration itself, but only the preparation for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyschlag: “With John, remembrance and exposition had become
          inseparable.” E. G. Robinson; “Novelists do not create
          characters,—they reproduce with modifications material presented to
          their memories. So the apostles reproduced their impressions of
          Christ.” Hutton, Essays, 2:231—“The Psalmists vacillate between the
          first person and the third, when they deliver the purposes of God. As
          they warm with their spiritual inspiration, they lose themselves in
          the person of Him who inspires them, and then they are again recalled
          to themselves.” Stanley, Life and Letters, 1:380—“Revelation is not
          resolved into a mere human process because we are able to distinguish
          the natural agencies through which it was communicated”; 2:102—“You
          seem to me to transfer too much to these ancient prophets and writers
          and chiefs our modern notions of divine origin.…Our notion, or rather,
          the modern Puritanical notion of divine origin, is of a preternatural
          force or voice, putting aside secondary agencies, and separated from
          those agencies by an impassable gulf. The ancient, Oriental, Biblical
          notion was of a supreme Will acting through those agencies, or rather,
          being inseparable from them. Our notions of inspiration and divine
          communications insist on absolute perfection of fact, morals,
          doctrine. The Biblical notion was that inspiration was compatible with
          weakness, infirmity, contradiction.” Ladd, Philosophy of Mind, 182—“In
          inspiration the thoughts, feelings, purposes are organized into
          another One than the self in which they were themselves born. That
          other One is in themselves. They enter into communication with Him.
          Yet this may be supernatural, even though natural psychological means
          are used. Inspiration which is external is not inspiration at all.”
          This last sentence, however, seems to us a needless exaggeration of
          the true principle. Though God originally inspires from within, he may
          also communicate truth from without.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Inspiration, therefore, did not remove, but rather pressed into its
          own service, all the personal peculiarities of the writers, together
          with their defects of culture and literary style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every imperfection not inconsistent with truth in a human composition
          may exist in inspired Scripture. The Bible is God’s word, in the sense
          that it presents to us divine truth in human forms, and is a
          revelation not for a select class but for the common mind. Rightly
          understood, this very humanity of the Bible is a proof of its
          divinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Locke: “When God made the prophet, he did not unmake the man.” Prof.
          Day: “The bush in which God appeared to Moses remained a bush, while
          yet burning with the brightness of God and uttering forth the majesty
          of the mind of God.” The paragraphs of the Koran are called ayat, or
          “sign,” from their supposed supernatural elegance. But elegant
          literary productions do not touch the heart. The Bible is not merely
          the word of God; it is also the word made flesh. The Holy Spirit hides
          himself, that he may show forth Christ (Joh_3:8); he is known only by
          his effects—a pattern for preachers, who are ministers of the Spirit
          (2Co_3:6). See Conant on Genesis, 65.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Moslem declares that every word of the Koran came by the agency of
          Gabriel from the seventh heaven, and that its very pronunciation is
          inspired. Better the doctrine of Martineau, Seat of Authority,
          289—“Though the pattern be divine, the web that bears it must still be
          human.” Jackson, James Martineau, 255—“Paul’s metaphor of the
          ‘treasurein earthen vessels’ (2Co_4:7) you cannot allow to give you
          guidance; you want, not the treasure only, but the casket too, to come
          from above, and be of the crystal of the sky. You want the record to
          be divine, not only in its spirit, but also in its letter.” Charles
          Hodge, Syst. Theol., 1:157—“When God ordains praise out of the mouths
          of babes, they must speak as babes, or the whole power and beauty of
          the tribute will be lost.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Evans, Bib. Scholarship and Inspiration, 16, 25—“The πνεῦμα of a dead
          wind is never changed, as the Rabbis of old thought, into the πνεῦμα
          of a living spirit. The raven that fed Elijah was nothing more than a
          bird. Nor does man, when supernaturally influenced, cease to be a man.
          An inspired man is not God, nor a divinely manipulated automaton”; “In
          Scripture there may be as much imperfection as, in the parts of any
          organism, would be consistent with the perfect adaptation of that
          organism to its destined end. Scripture then, taken together, is a
          statement of moral and religious truth sufficient for men’s salvation,
          or an infallible and sufficient rule of faith and practice.” J. S.
          Wrightnour: “Inspire means to breathe in, as a flute-player breathes
          into his instrument. As different flutes may have their own shapes,
          peculiarities, and what might seem like defects, so here; yet all are
          breathed into by one Spirit. The same Spirit who inspired them
          selected those instruments which were best for his purpose, as the
          Savior selected his apostles. In these writings therefore is given us,
          in the precise way that is best for us, the spiritual instruction and
          food that we need. Food for the body is not always given in the most
          concentrated form, but in the form that is best adapted for digestion.
          So God gives gold, not in coin ready stamped, but in the quartz of the
          mine whence it has to be dug and smelted.” Remains of Arthur H.
          Hallam, in John Brown’s Rab and his Friends, 274—“I see that the Bible
          fits in to every fold of the human heart. I am a man, and I believe it
          is God’s book, because it is man’s book.”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. In inspiration God may use all right and normal methods of literary
          composition.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we recognize in literature the proper function of history, poetry,
          and fiction; of prophecy, parable, and drama; of personification and
          proverb; of allegory and dogmatic instruction; and even of myth and
          legend; we cannot deny the possibility that God may use any one of
          these methods of communicating truth, leaving it to us to determine in
          any single case which of these methods he has adopted.
        </p>
        <p>
          In inspiration, as in regeneration and sanctification, God works “in
          divers manners” (Heb_1:1). The Scriptures, like the books of secular
          literature, must be interpreted in the light of their purpose. Poetry
          must not be treated as prose, and parable must not be made to “go on
          all fours,” when it was meant to walk erect and to tell one simple
          story. Drama is not history, nor is personification to be regarded as
          biography. There is a rhetorical overstatement which is intended only
          as a vivid emphasizing of important truth. Allegory is a popular mode
          of illustration. Even myth and legend may convey great lessons not
          otherwise apprehensible to infantile or untrained minds. A literary
          sense is needed in our judgments of Scripture, and much hostile
          criticism is lacking in this literary sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Denney, Studies in Theology, 218—“There is a stage in which the whole
          contents of the mind, as yet incapable of science or history, may be
          called mythological. And what criticism shows us, in its treatment of
          the early chapters of Genesis, is that God does not disdain to speak
          to the mind, nor through it, even when it is at this lowly stage. Even
          the myth, in which the beginnings of human life, lying beyond human
          research, are represented to itself by the child-mind of the race, may
          be made the medium of revelation.…But that does not make the first
          chapter of Genesis science, nor the third chapter history. And what is
          of authority in these chapters is not the quasi-scientific or
          quasi-historical form, but the message, which through them comes to
          the heart, of God’s creative wisdom and power.” Gore, in Lux Mundi,
          356—“The various sorts of mental or literary activity develop in their
          different lines out of an earlier condition in which they lie fused
          and undifferentiated. This we can vaguely call the mythical stage of
          mental evolution. A myth is not a falsehood; it is a product of mental
          activity, as instructive and rich as any later product, but its
          characteristic is that it is not yet distinguished into history and
          poetry and philosophy.” So Grote calls the Greek myths the whole
          intellectual stock of the age to which they belonged—the common root
          of all the history, poetry, philosophy, theology, which afterwards
          diverged and proceeded from it. So the early part of Genesis may be of
          the nature of myth in which we cannot distinguish the historical germ,
          though we do not deny that it exists. Robert Browning’s Clive and
          Andrea del Sarto are essentially correct representations of historical
          characters, though the details in each poem are imaginary.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The inspiring Spirit has given the Scriptures to the world by a
          process of gradual evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          As in communicating the truths of natural science, God has
          communicated the truths of religion by successive steps, germinally at
          first, more fully as men have been able to comprehend them. The
          education of the race is analogous to the education of the child.
          First came pictures, object-lessons, external rites, predictions; then
          the key to these in Christ, and their didactic exposition in the
          Epistles.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been “divers portions,” as well as “divers manners”
          (Heb_1:1). The early prophecies like that of Gen_3:15—the seed of the
          woman bruising the serpent’s head—were but faint glimmerings of the
          dawn. Men had to be raised up who were capable of receiving and
          transmitting the divine communications. Moses, David, Isaiah mark
          successive advances in recipiency and transparency to the heavenly
          light. Inspiration has employed men of various degrees of ability,
          culture and religious insight. As all the truths of the calculus lie
          germinally in the simplest mathematical axiom, so all the truths of
          salvation may be wrapped up in the statement that God is holiness and
          love. But not every scholar can evolve the calculus from the axiom.
          The teacher may dictate propositions which the pupil does not
          understand: he may demonstrate in such a way that the pupil
          participates in the process; or, best of all, he may incite the pupil
          to work out the demonstration for himself. God seems to have used all
          these methods. But while there are instances of dictation and
          illumination, and inspiration sometimes includes these, the general
          method seems to have been such a divine quickening of man’s powers
          that he discovers and expresses the truth for himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          A. J. Balfour, Foundations of Belief, 339—“Inspiration is that, seen
          from its divine side, which we call discovery when seen from the human
          side.…Every addition to knowledge, whether in the individual or the
          community, whether scientific, ethical or theological, is due to a
          coöperation between the human soul which assimilates and the divine
          power which inspires. Neither acts, or could act, in independent
          isolation. For ‘unassisted reason’ is a fiction, and pure receptivity
          it is impossible to conceive. Even the emptiest vessel must limit the
          quantity and determine the configuration of any liquid with which it
          may be filled.…Inspiration is limited to no age, to no country, to no
          people.” The early Semites had it, and the great Oriental reformers.
          There can be no gathering of grapes from thorns, or of figs from
          thistles. Whatever of true or of good is found in human history has
          come from God. On the Progressiveness of Revelation, see Orr, Problem
          of the O. T., 431–478.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Inspiration did not guarantee inerrancy in things not essential to
          the main purpose of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspiration went no further than to secure a trustworthy transmission
          by the sacred writers of the truth they were commissioned to deliver.
          It was not omniscience. It was a bestowal of various kinds and degrees
          of knowledge and aid, according to need; sometimes suggesting new
          truth, sometimes presiding over the collection of preëxisting material
          and guarding from essential error in the final elaboration. As
          inspiration was not omniscience, so it was not complete
          sanctification. It involved neither personal infallibility, nor entire
          freedom from sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          God can use imperfect means. As the imperfection of the eye does not
          disprove its divine authorship, and as God reveals himself in nature
          and history in spite of their shortcomings, so inspiration can
          accomplish its purpose through both writers and writings in some
          respects imperfect. God is, in the Bible as he was in Hebrew history,
          leading his people onward to Christ, but only by a progressive
          unfolding of the truth. The Scripture writers were not perfect men.
          Paul at Antioch resisted Peter, “because he stood condemned”
          (Gal_2:11). But Peter differed from Paul, not in public utterances,
          nor in written words, but in following his own teachings (cf.
          Act_15:6-11); versus Norman Fox, in Bap. Rev., 1885:469–482. Personal
          defects do not invalidate an ambassador, though they may hinder the
          reception of his message. So with the apostles’ ignorance of the time
          of Christ’s second coming. It was only gradually that they came to
          understand Christian doctrines; they did not teach the truth all at
          once; their final utterances supplemented and completed the earlier;
          and all together furnished only that measure of knowledge which God
          saw needful for the moral and religious teaching of mankind. Many
          things are yet unrevealed, and many things which inspired men uttered,
          they did not, when they uttered them, fully understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pfleiderer, Grundriss, 53, 54—“The word is divine-human in the sense
          that it has for its contents divine truth in human, historical, and
          individually conditioned form. The Holy Scripture contains the word of
          God in a way plain, and entirely sufficient to beget saving faith.”
          Frances Power Cobbe, Life, 87—“Inspiration is not a miraculous and
          therefore incredible thing, but normal and in accordance with the
          natural relations of the infinite and finite spirit, a divine
          inflowing of mental light precisely analogous to that moral influence
          which divines call grace. As every devout and obedient soul may expect
          to share in divine grace, so the devout and obedient souls of all the
          ages have shared, as Parker taught, in divine inspiration. And, as the
          reception of grace even in large measure does not render us
          impeccable, so neither does the reception of inspiration render us
          infallible.” We may concede to Miss Cobbe that inspiration consists
          with imperfection, while yet we grant to the Scripture writers an
          authority higher than our own.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Inspiration did not always, or even generally, involve a direct
          communication to the Scripture writers of the words they wrote.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thought is possible without words, and in the order of nature precedes
          words. The Scripture writers appear to have been so influenced by the
          Holy Spirit that they perceived and felt even the new truths they were
          to publish, as discoveries of their own minds, and were left to the
          action of their own minds in the expression of these truths, with the
          single exception that they were supernaturally held back from the
          selection of wrong words, and when needful were provided with right
          ones. Inspiration is therefore not verbal, while yet we claim that no
          form of words which taken in its connections would teach essential
          error has been admitted into Scripture.

          Before expression there must be something to be expressed. Thought is
          possible without language. The concept may exist without words. See
          experiences of deafmutes, in Princeton Rev., Jan. 1881:104–128. The
          prompter interrupts only when the speaker’s memory fails. The
          writing-master guides the pupil’s hand only when it would otherwise go
          wrong. The father suffers the child to walk alone, except when it is
          in danger of stumbling. If knowledge be rendered certain, it is as
          good as direct revelation. But whenever the mere communication of
          ideas or the direction to proper material would not suffice to secure
          a correct utterance, the sacred writers were guided in the very
          selection of their words. Minute criticism proves more and more
          conclusively the suitableness of the verbal dress to the thoughts
          expressed; all Biblical exegesis is based, indeed, upon the assumption
          that divine wisdom has made the outward form a trustworthy vehicle of
          the inward substance of revelation. See Henderson, Inspiration (2nd
          ed.), 102, 114; Bib. Sac., 1872:428, 640; William James, Psychology,
          1:266 sq.

          Watts, New Apologetic, 40, 111, holds to a verbal inspiration: “The
          bottles are not the wine, but if the bottles perish the wine is sure
          to be spilled”; the inspiring Spirit certainly gave language to Peter
          and others at Pentecost, for the apostles spoke with other tongues;
          holy men of old not only thought, but “spake from God, being moved by
          the Holy Spirit” (2Pe_1:21). So Gordon, Ministry of the Spirit,
          171—“Why the minute study of the words of Scripture, carried on by all
          expositors, their search after the precise shade of verbal
          significance, their attention to the minutest details of language, and
          to all the delicate coloring of mood and tense and accent?” Liberal
          scholars, Dr. Gordon thinks, thus affirm the very doctrine which they
          deny. Rothe, Dogmatics, 238, speaks of “a language of the Holy Ghost.”
          Oetinger: “It is the style of the heavenly court.” But Broadus, an
          almost equally conservative scholar, in his Com. on Mat_3:17, says
          that the difference between “This is my beloved Son,” and
          Luk_3:22—“Thou art my beloved Son,” should make us cautious in
          theorizing about verbal inspiration, and he intimates that in some
          cases that hypothesis is unwarranted. The theory of verbal inspiration
          is refuted by the two facts: 1. that the N. T. quotations from the O.
          T., in 99 cases, differ both from the Hebrew and from the LXX; 2. that
          Jesus’ own words are reported with variations by the different
          evangelists; see Marcus Dods, The Bible, its Origin and Nature,
          chapter on Inspiration.

          Helen Keller told Phillips Brooks that she had always known that there
          was a God, but she had not known his name. Dr. Z. F. Westervelt, of
          the Deaf Mute Institute, had under his charge four children of
          different mothers. All of these children were dumb, though there was
          no defect of hearing and the organs of speech were perfect. But their
          mothers had never loved them and had never talked to them in the
          loving way that provoked imitation. The children heard scolding and
          harshness, but this did not attract. So the older members of the
          church in private and in the meetings for prayer should teach the
          younger to talk. But harsh and contentious talk will not accomplish
          the result,—it must be the talk of Christian love. William D. Whitney,
          in his review of Max Müller’s Science of Language, 26–31, combats the
          view of Müller that thought and language are identical. Major Bliss
          Taylor’s reply to Santa Anna: “General Taylor never surrenders!” was a
          substantially correct, though a diplomatic and euphemistic, version of
          the General’s actual profane words. Each Scripture writer uttered old
          truth in the new forms with which his own experience had clothed it.
          David reached his greatness by leaving off the mere repetition of
          Moses, and by speaking out of his own heart. Paul reached his
          greatness by giving up the mere teaching of what he had been taught,
          and by telling what God’s plan of mercy was to all. Augustine:
          “Scriptura est sensus Scripturæ”—“Scripture is what Scripture means.”
          Among the theological writers who admit the errancy of Scripture
          writers as to some matters unessential to their moral and spiritual
          teaching, are Luther, Calvin, Cocceius, Tholuck, Neander, Lange,
          Stier, Van Oosterzee, John Howe, Richard Baxter, Conybeare, Alford,
          Mead.

          8. Yet, notwithstanding the ever-present human element, the
          all-pervading inspiration of the Scriptures constitutes these various
          writings an organic whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the Bible is in all its parts the work of God, each part is to
          be judged, not by itself alone, but in its connection with every other
          part. The Scriptures are not to be interpreted as so many merely human
          productions by different authors, but as also the work of one divine
          mind. Seemingly trivial things are to be explained from their
          connection with the whole. One history is to be built up from the
          several accounts of the life of Christ. One doctrine must supplement
          another. The Old Testament is part of a progressive system, whose
          culmination and key are to be found in the New. The central subject
          and thought which binds all parts of the Bible together, and in the
          light of which they are to be interpreted, is the person and work of
          Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible says: “There is no God” (Psa_14:1); but then, this is to be
          taken with the context: “The fool hath said in his heart.” Satan’s “it
          is written,” (Mat_4:6) is supplemented by Christ’s “It is written
          again” (Mat_4:7). Trivialities are like the hair and nails of the
          body—they have their place as parts of a complete and organic whole;
          see Ebrard, Dogmatik, 1:40. The verse which mentions Paul’s cloak at
          Troas (2Ti_4:13) is (1) a sign of genuineness—a forger would not
          invent it; (2) an evidence of temporal need endured for the gospel;
          (3) an indication of the limits of inspiration,—even Paul must have
          books and parchments. Col_2:21—“Handle not, nor taste, nor touch”—is
          to be interpreted by the context in verse Col_2:20—“why … do ye
          subject yourselves to ordinances?” and by verse Col_2:22—“after the
          precepts and doctrines of men.” Hodge, Syst. Theol., 1:164—“The
          difference between John’s gospel and the book of Chronicles is like
          that between man’s brain and the hair of his head; nevertheless the
          life of the body is as truly in the hair as in the brain.” Like
          railway coupons, Scripture texts are “Not good if detached.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Crooker, The New Bible and its New Uses, 137–144, utterly denies the
          unity of the Bible. Prof. A. B. Davidson of Edinburgh says that “A
          theology of the O. T. is really an impossibility, because the O. T. is
          not a homogeneous whole.” These denials proceed from an insufficient
          recognition of the principle of evolution in O. T. history and
          doctrine. Doctrines in early Scripture are like rivers at their
          source; they are not yet fully expanded; many affluents are yet to
          come. See Bp. Bull’s Sermon, in Works, xv:183; and Bruce, Apologetics,
          323—“The literature of the early stages of revelation must share the
          defects of the revelation which it records and interprets..…The final
          revelation enables us to see the defects of the earlier.…We should
          find Christ in the O. T. as we find the butterfly in the caterpiller,
          and man the crown of the universe in the fiery cloud.” Crane, Religion
          of To-morrow, 224—Every part is to be modified by every other part. No
          verse is true out of the Book, but the whole Book taken together is
          true. Gore, in Lux Mundi, 350—“To recognize the inspiration of the
          Scriptures is to put ourselves to school in every part of them.”
          Robert Browning, Ring and Book, 175 (Pope, 228)—“Truth nowhere lies,
          yet everywhere, in these; Not absolutely in a portion, yet Evolvable
          from the whole; evolved at last Painfully, held tenaciously by me.” On
          the Organic Unity of the O. T., see Orr, Problem of the O. T., 27–51.

          9. When the unity of the Scripture is fully recognized, the Bible, in
          spite of imperfections in matters non-essential to its religious
          purpose, furnishes a safe and sufficient guide to truth and to
          salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recognition of the Holy Spirit’s agency makes it rational and
          natural to believe in the organic unity of Scripture. When the earlier
          parts are taken in connection with the later, and when each part is
          interpreted by the whole, most of the difficulties connected with
          inspiration disappear. Taken together, with Christ as its culmination
          and explanation, the Bible furnishes the Christian rule of faith and
          practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible answers two questions: What has God done to save me? and
          What must I do to be saved? The propositions of Euclid are not
          invalidated by the fact that he believed the earth to be flat. The
          ethics of Plato would not be disproved by his mistakes with regard to
          the solar system. So religious authority is independent of merely
          secular knowledge.—Sir Joshua Reynolds was a great painter, and a
          great teacher of his art. His lectures on painting laid down
          principles which have been accepted as authority for generations. But
          Joshua Reynolds illustrates his subject from history and science. It
          was a day when both history and science were young. In some
          unimportant matters of this sort, which do not in the least affect his
          conclusions, Sir Joshua Reynolds makes an occasional slip; his
          statements are inaccurate. Does he, therefore, cease to be an
          authority in matters of his art?—The Duke of Wellington said once that
          no human being knew at what time of day the battle of Waterloo began.
          One historian gets his story from one combatant, and he puts the hour
          at eleven in the morning. Another historian gets his information from
          another combatant, and he puts it at noon. Shall we say that this
          discrepancy argues error in the whole account, and that we have no
          longer any certainty that the battle of Waterloo was ever fought at
          all?
        </p>
        <p>
          Such slight imperfections are to be freely admitted, while at the same
          time we insist that the Bible, taken as a whole, is incomparably
          superior to all other books, and is “able to make thee wise unto
          salvation” (2Ti_3:15). Hooker, Eccl. Polity: “Whatsoever is spoken of
          God or things pertaining to God otherwise than truth is, though it
          seem an honor, it is an injury. And as incredible praises given unto
          men do often abate and impair the credit of their deserved
          commendation, so we must likewise take great heed lest, in attributing
          to Scripture more than it can have, the incredibility of that do cause
          even those things which it hath more abundantly to be less reverently
          esteemed.” Baxter, Works, 21:349—“Those men who think that these human
          imperfections of the writers do extend further, and may appear in some
          passages of chronologies or history which are no part of the rule of
          faith and life, do not hereby destroy the Christian cause. For God
          might enable his apostles to an infallible recording and preaching of
          the gospel, even all things necessary to salvation, though he had not
          made them infallible in every by-passage and circumstance, any more
          than they were indefectible in life.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible, says Beet, “contains possible errors in small details or
          allusions, but it gives us with absolute certainty the great facts of
          Christianity, and upon these great facts, and upon these only, our
          faith is based.” Evans, Bib. Scholarship and Inspiration, 15, 18,
          65—“Teach that the shell is part of the kernel and men who find that
          they cannot keep the shell will throw away shell and kernel
          together.…This overstatement of inspiration made Renan, Bradlaugh and
          Ingersoll sceptics.…If in creation God can work out a perfect result
          through imperfection why cannot he do the like in inspiration? If in
          Christ God can appear in human weakness and ignorance, why not in the
          written word?”
        </p>
        <p>
          We therefore take exception to the view of Watts, New Apologetic,
          71—“Let the theory of historical errors and scientific errors be
          adopted, and Christianity must share the fate of Hinduism. If its
          inspired writers err when they tell us of earthly things, none will
          believe when they tell of heavenly things.” Watts adduces instances of
          Spinoza’s giving up the form while claiming to hold the substance, and
          in this way reducing revelation to a phenomenon of naturalistic
          pantheism. We reply that no a priori theory of perfection in divine
          inspiration must blind us to the evidence of actual imperfection in
          Scripture. As in creation and in Christ, so in Scripture, God humbles
          himself to adopt human and imperfect methods of self-revelation. See
          Jonathan Edwards, Diary: “I observe that old men seldom have any
          advantage of new discoveries, because they are beside the way to which
          they have been so long used. Resolved, if ever I live to years, that I
          will be impartial to hear the reasons of all pretended discoveries,
          and receive them if rational, however long soever I have been used to
          another way of thinking.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Bowne, The Immanence of God, 109, 110—“Those who would find the source
          of certainty and the seat of authority in the Scriptures alone, or in
          the church alone, or reason and conscience alone, rather than in the
          complex and indivisible coworking of all these factors, should be
          reminded of the history of religious thought. The stiffest doctrine of
          Scripture inerrancy has not prevented warring interpretations; and
          those who would place the seat of authority in reason and conscience
          are forced to admit that outside illumination may do much for both. In
          some sense the religion of the spirit is a very important fact, but
          when it sets up in opposition to the religion of a book, the light
          that is in it is apt to turn to darkness.”
        </p>
        <p>
          10. While inspiration constitutes Scripture an authority more
          trustworthy than are individual reason or the creeds of the church,
          the only ultimate authority is Christ himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ has not so constructed Scripture as to dispense with his
          personal presence and teaching by his Spirit. The Scripture is the
          imperfect mirror of Christ. It is defective, yet it reflects him and
          leads to him. Authority resides not in it, but in him, and his Spirit
          enables the individual Christian and the collective church
          progressively to distinguish the essential from the non-essential, and
          so to perceive the truth as it is in Jesus. In thus judging Scripture
          and interpreting Scripture, we are not rationalists, but are rather
          believers in him who promised to be with us alway even unto the end of
          the world and to lead us by his Spirit into all the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          James speaks of the law as a mirror (Jam_1:23-25—“like unto a man
          beholding his natural face in a mirror … looketh into the perfect
          law”); the law convicts of sin because it reflects Christ. Paul speaks
          of the gospel as a mirror (2Co_3:18—“we all, beholding as in a mirror
          the glory of the Lord”); the gospel transforms us because it reflects
          Christ. Yet both law and gospel are imperfect; they are like mirrors
          of polished metal, whose surface is often dim, and whose images are
          obscure; (1Co_13:12—“For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face
          to face”); even inspired men know only in part, and prophesy only in
          part. Scripture itself is the conception and utterance of a child, to
          be done away when that which is perfect is come, and we see Christ as
          he is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Authority is the right to impose beliefs or to command obedience. The
          only ultimate authority is God, for he is truth, justice and love. But
          he can impose beliefs and command obedience only as he is known.
          Authority belongs therefore only to God revealed, and because Christ
          is God revealed he can say: “All authority hath been given unto me in
          heaven and on earth” (Mat_28:18). The final authority in religion is
          Jesus Christ. Every one of his revelations of God is authoritative.
          Both nature and human nature are such revelations. He exercises his
          authority through delegated and subordinate authorities, such as
          parents and civil government. These rightfully claim obedience so long
          as they hold to their own respective spheres and recognize their
          relation of dependence upon him. “The powers that be are ordained of
          God” (Rom_13:1), even though they are imperfect manifestations of his
          wisdom and righteousness. The decisions of the Supreme Court are
          authoritative even though the judges are fallible and come short of
          establishing absolute justice. Authority is not infallibility, in the
          government either of the family or of the state.
        </p>
        <p>
          The church of the middle ages was regarded as possessed of absolute
          authority. But the Protestant Reformation showed how vain were these
          pretensions. The church is an authority only as it recognizes and
          expresses the supreme authority of Christ. The Reformers felt the need
          of some external authority in place of the church. They substituted
          the Scripture. The phrase “the word of God,” which designates the
          truth orally uttered or affecting the minds of men, came to signify
          only a book. Supreme authority was ascribed to it. It often usurped
          the place of Christ. While we vindicate the proper authority of
          Scripture, we would show that its authority is not immediate and
          absolute, but mediate and relative, through human and imperfect
          records, and needing a supplementary and divine teaching to interpret
          them. The authority of Scripture is not apart from Christ or above
          Christ, but only in subordination to him and to his Spirit. He who
          inspired Scripture must enable us to interpret Scripture. This is not
          a doctrine of rationalism, for it holds to man’s absolute dependence
          upon the enlightening Spirit of Christ. It is not a doctrine of
          mysticism, for it holds that Christ teaches us only by opening to us
          the meaning of his past revelations. We do not expect any new worlds
          in our astronomy, nor do we expect any new Scriptures in our theology.
          But we do expect that the same Christ who gave the Scriptures will
          give us new insight into their meaning and will enable us to make new
          applications of their teachings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The right and duty of private judgment with regard to Scripture belong
          to no ecclesiastical caste, but are inalienable liberties of the whole
          church of Christ and of each individual member of that church. And yet
          this judgment is, from another point of view, no private judgment. It
          is not the judgment of arbitrariness or caprice. It does not make the
          Christian consciousness supreme, if we mean by this term the
          consciousness of Christians apart from the indwelling Christ. When
          once we come to Christ, he joins us to himself, he seats us with him
          upon his throne, he imparts to us his Spirit, he bids us use our
          reason in his service. In judging Scripture, we make not ourselves but
          Christ supreme, and recognize him as the only ultimate and infallible
          authority in matters of religion. We can believe that the total
          revelation of Christ in Scripture is an authority superior to
          individual reason or to any single affirmation of the church, while
          yet we believe that this very authority of Scripture has its
          limitation, and that Christ himself must teach us what this total
          revelation is. So the judgment which Scripture encourages us to pass
          upon its own limitations only induces a final and more implicit
          reliance upon the living and personal Son of God. He has never
          intended that Scripture should be a substitute for his own presence,
          and it is only his Spirit that is promised to lead us into all the
          truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the authority of Scripture, see A. H. Strong, Christ in Creation,
          113–136—“The source of all authority is not Scripture, but Christ…
          Nowhere are we told that the Scripture of itself is able to convince
          the sinner or to bring him to God. It is a glittering sword, but it is
          ‘the sword of the Spirit’ (Eph_6:17); and unless the Spirit use it, it
          will never pierce the heart. It is a heavy hammer, but only the Spirit
          can wield it so that it breaks in pieces the flinty rock. It is the
          type locked in the form, but the paper will never receive an
          impression until the Spirit shall apply the power. No mere instrument
          shall have the glory that belongs to God. Every soul shall feel its
          entire dependence upon him. Only the Holy Spirit can turn the outer
          word into an inner word. And the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ.
          Christ comes into direct contact with the soul. He himself gives his
          witness to the truth. He bears testimony to Scripture, even more than
          Scripture bears testimony to him.”

          11. The preceding discussion enables us at least to lay down three
          cardinal principles and to answer three common questions with regard
          to inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Principles: (a) The human mind can be inhabited and energized by God
          while yet attaining and retaining its own highest intelligence and
          freedom. (b) The Scriptures being the work of the one God, as well as
          of the men in whom God moved and dwelt, constitute an articulated and
          organic unity. (c) The unity and authority of Scripture as a whole are
          entirely consistent with its gradual evolution and with great
          imperfection in its non-essential parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Questions: (a) Is any part of Scripture uninspired? Answer: Every part
          of Scripture is inspired in its connection and relation with every
          other part. (b) Are there degrees of inspiration? Answer: There are
          degrees of value, but not of inspiration. Each part in its connection
          with the rest is made completely true, and completeness has no
          degrees. (c) How may we know what parts are of most value and what is
          the teaching of the whole? Answer: The same Spirit of Christ who
          inspired the Bible is promised to take of the things of Christ, and,
          by showing them to us, to lead us progressively into all the truth.

          Notice the value of the Old Testament, revealing as it does the
          natural attributes of God, as a basis and background for the
          revelation of mercy in the New Testament. Revelation was in many parts
          (πολυμερῶς—Heb_1:1) as well as in many ways. “Each individual oracle,
          taken by itself, was partial and incomplete” (Robertson Smith, O. T.
          in Jewish Ch., 21). But the person and the words of Christ sum up and
          complete the revelation, so that, taken together and in their
          connection with him, the various parts of Scripture constitute an
          infallible and sufficient rule of faith and practice. See Browne,
          Inspiration of the N. T.; Bernard, Progress of Doctrine in the N. T.;
          Stanley Leathes, Structure of the O. T.; Rainy, Delivery and
          Development of Doctrine. See A. H. Strong, on Method of Inspiration,
          in Philosophy and Religion, 148–155.

          The divine influence upon the minds of post-biblical writers, leading
          to the composition of such allegories as Pilgrim’s Progress, and such
          dramas as Macbeth, is to be denominated illumination rather than
          inspiration, for the reasons that these writings contain error as well
          as truth in matters of religion and morals; that they add nothing
          essential to what the Scriptures give us; and that, even in their
          expression of truth previously made known, they are not worthy of a
          place in the sacred canon. W. H. P. Faunce: “How far is Bunyan’s
          Pilgrim’s Progress true to present Christian experience? It is untrue:
          1. In its despair of this world. The Pilgrim has to leave this world
          in order to be saved. Modern experience longs to do God’s will here,
          and to save others instead of forsaking them. 2. In its agony over sin
          and frightful conflict. Bunyan illustrates modern experience better by
          Christiana and her children who go through the Valley and the Shadow
          of Death in the daytime, and without conflict with Apollyon. 3. In the
          constant uncertainty of the issue of the Pilgrim’s fight. Christian
          enters Doubting Castle and meets Giant Despair, even after he has won
          most of his victories. In modern experience, “at evening time there
          shall be light”—(Zec_14:7). 4. In the constant conviction of an absent
          Christ. Bunyan’s Christ is never met this side of the Celestial City.
          The Cross at which the burden dropped is the symbol of a sacrificial
          act, but it is not the Savior himself. Modern experience has Christ
          living in us and with us alway, and not simply a Christ whom we hope
          to see at the end of the journey.”

          Beyschlag, N. T. Theol., 2:18—“Paul declares his own prophecy and
          inspiration to be essentially imperfect (1Co_13:9-10; 1Co_13:12; cf.
          1Co_12:10; 1Th_5:19-21). This admission justifies a Christian
          criticism even of his views. He can pronounce an anathema on those who
          preach ‘a different gospel’ (Gal_1:8-9), for what belongs to simple
          faith, the facts of salvation, are absolutely certain. But where
          prophetic thought and speech go beyond these facts of salvation, wood
          and straw may be mingled with the gold, silver and precious stones
          built upon the one foundation. So he distinguishes his own modest
          γνώμη from the ἐπιταγὴ κυρίου (1Co_7:25; 1Co_7:40).” Clarke, Christian
          Theology, 44—“The authority of Scripture is not one that binds, but
          one that sets free. Paul is writing of Scripture when he says: ‘Not
          that we have lordship over your faith, but are helpers of your joy:
          for in faith ye stand fast’ (2Co_1:24).”
        </p>
        <p>
          Cremer, in Herzog, Realencyc., 183–203—“The church doctrine is that
          the Scriptures are inspired, but it has never been determined by the
          church how they are inspired.” Butler, Analogy, part II, chap.,
          III—“The only question concerning the truth of Christianity is,
          whether it be a real revelation, not whether it be attended with every
          circumstance which we should have looked for; and concerning the
          authority of Scripture, whether it be what it claims to be, not
          whether it be a book of such sort, and so promulgated, as weak men are
          apt to fancy a book containing a divine revelation should. And
          therefore, neither obscurity, nor seeming inaccuracy of style, nor
          various readings, nor early disputes about the authors of particular
          parts, nor any other things of the like kind, though they had been
          much more considerable than they are, could overthrow the authority of
          the Scripture; unless the prophets, apostles, or our Lord had promised
          that the book containing the divine revelation should be secure from
          these things.” W. Robertson Smith: “If I am asked why I receive the
          Scriptures as the word of God and as the only perfect rule of faith
          and life. I answer with all the Fathers of the Protestant church:
          ‘Because the Bible is the only record of the redeeming love of God;
          because in the Bible alone I find God drawing nigh to men in Jesus
          Christ, and declaring his will for our salvation. And the record I
          know to be true by the witness of his Spirit in my heart, whereby I am
          assured that none other than God himself is able to speak such words
          to my soul.” The gospel of Jesus Christ is the ἅπαξ λεγόμενον of the
          Almighty. See Marcus Dods, The Bible, its Origin and Nature; Bowne,
          The Immanence of God, 66–115.
