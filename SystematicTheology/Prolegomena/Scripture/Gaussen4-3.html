        <h2>III. The Various Readings</h2>
        <p>
          We must give up the translations, then, other opponents will say, and
          admit that they nowise affect the question of the primary inspiration
          of the original text. But in that very text there are numerous
          differences among the ancient manuscripts which our Churches consult,
          and on which our printed editions are based. Confronted with proofs of
          such a fact, what becomes of the doctrine of verbal inspiration, and
          what purpose can it serve?
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, too, the answer is easy. We might say at once of the various
          readings of the manuscripts, what we have said of the translations:
          Why confound two orders of facts that are absolutely distinct: that of
          the first inspiration of the Scriptures, and that of the present
          integrity of the copies that have been made of them? If it was God
          himself that dictated the letter of the sacred oracles, that is a fact
          past recall; and no more can the copies made of them, than the
          translations given to us of them, undo that first act.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a fact is once consummated, nothing that happens subsequently can
          efface it from the history of the past. There are here, then, two
          questions which we must carefully distinguish. Was the whole of
          Scripture divinely inspired?—this is the first question; it is that
          with which we have now to do. Are the copies made of it many centuries
          afterwards by doctors and monks correct? or are they not correct?—that
          is the second question. This last can nowise affect the other. Don't
          proceed, then, to subject the former, by a strange piece of
          inattention, to the latter; they are independent of each other. A book
          is from God, or it is not from God. In the latter case, it were idle
          for me to transcribe it a thousand times exactly—I should not thereby
          render it divine; and in the former case, I should in vain take a
          thousand incorrect copies;—neither folly nor unfaithfulness on my
          part, can undo the fact of its having been given by God. The
          Decalogue, yet once more we repeat it, was entirely written by the
          finger of Jehovah on two tables of stone; but if the manuscripts that
          give it to me at the present day present some various readings, this
          second fact would not prevent the first. The sentences, words, and
          letters of the Ten Commandments, would not the less have been all
          engraven by God. Inspiration of the first text, integrity of the
          subsequent copies—these are two orders of facts absolutely different,
          and separated from each other by thousands of stadia, and thousands of
          years. Beware, then, of confounding what logic, time, and space compel
          you to distinguish.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is by precisely a similar process of reasoning, that we reprove the
          indiscreet lovers of the apocryphal writings. The ancient oracles of
          God, we tell them, were committed to the Jewish people, as the new
          oracles were committed afterwards to the Christian people. If, then,
          the Book of Maccabees was a merely human book in the days of Jesus
          Christ, a thousand decrees of the Christian Church could not have any
          such effect thereafter as that, in 1560, becoming what it had never
          been till then, it should be transubstantiated into a divine book. Did
          the prophets write the Bible with the words which human wisdom
          dictated, or with words given them by God?—such is our question. But
          have they been faithfully copied from age to age, from manuscripts
          into manuscripts?—this is yours, perhaps. It is very important no
          doubt; but it is entirely different from the first. Do not, then,
          confound what God has separated.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true, no doubt, will people say, that the fidelity of one copy
          does not make the original divine, when it is not so; and the
          incorrectness of another copy will not make it human, if it was not
          so. Accordingly, this is not what we maintain. The fact of the
          inspiration of the sacred text in the days of Moses, or the days of St
          John, cannot depend upon the copies which we shall have made of it in
          Europe and Africa, two or three thousand years after them; but though
          the second of these facts does not destroy the first, it at least
          renders it illusory, by depriving it of its whole worth and utility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, then, mark to what the objection is confined. The question is no
          longer about the inspiration of the original text—the whole attack
          here is directed against its present integrity. It was first a
          question of doctrine: "Is it declared in the Bible that the Bible is
          inspired even in its language?" But it is no more now than a question
          of history, or of criticism: "Have the copyists copied faithfully? are
          the manuscripts faithful?" Accordingly, we might say nothing now on a
          position of which we are not here called upon to undertake the
          defence; but the answer is easy; I will say more—God has rendered it
          so triumphant that we will not restrain ourselves from giving it.
          Besides, the faith of simple minds has been so often disquieted on
          this subject by a phantasmagoria of learning, that we consider it
          useful here to expose its hollowness. And, although this objection in
          some sort withdraws us from the field which we had traced out for our
          ourselves, we will follow it, for the purpose of answering it.
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt, had this difficulty been presented to us in the days of
          Anthony Collins and the Free Thinkers, we should not have been left
          without reply, but we should have felt perhaps some embarrassment,
          because full light had not then been thrown upon the facts, and
          because the field of conjectures, as yet unexplored, remained
          undefined. We know the perplexities of the excellent Bengel on this
          question; and we know that these led, first, to his laborious
          researches on the sacred text, and, next, to his pious wonder and
          gratitude at the preservation of that text. Of what use, one might
          have said, is the assurance that the original text was dictated by God
          eighteen hundred years ago, if I have no longer the certainty that the
          manuscripts of our libraries still present it to me in its purity, and
          if it be true (as we are assured) that the various readings of these
          rolls are at least thirty thousand in number?
        </p>
        <p>
          Such is the old objection: it was specious; but now-a-days it is
          known, by all who have studied it, to be a mere illusion. The
          Rationalists themselves have admitted that it can no longer be made,
          and must be given up.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord has watched miraculously over his Word. This the facts of the
          case have demonstrated.
        </p>
        <p>
          In constituting as its depositaries, first, the Churches of the Jewish
          people, and then those of the Christian people, his providence had by
          this means to see to the faithful transmission of the oracles of God
          to us. It has done this; and in order to the attainment of this
          result, it has put different causes in operation, of which we shall
          have again to speak afterwards. Late learned researches have thrown
          the clearest light on this great fact. Herculean labours have been
          bestowed, during the whole of the last century (particularly in its
          last half) and the first part of this, on the task of bringing
          together all the various readings that either the detailed examination
          of the manuscripts of holy Scripture preserved in the different
          libraries of Europe, or the study of the most ancient versions, or the
          searching out of the innumerable quotations made from our sacred books
          in all the writings of the fathers of the Church, could furnish; and
          this immense toil has ended in a result wonderful by its
          insignificance, and (shall I say?) imposing by its nullity.
        </p>
        <p>
          As respects the Old Testament, the indefatigable investigations and
          the four folios of Father Houbigant; the thirty years' labours of John
          Henry Michaelis; above all, the great Critical Bible and the ten
          years' study of the famous Kennicott (who consulted five hundred and
          eighty-one Hebrew manuscripts); and, in fine, Professor Rossi's
          collection of six hundred and eighty manuscripts;—as respects the New
          Testament, the no less gigantic investigations of Mill, Bengel,
          Wetstein, and Griesbach (who consulted three hundred and thirtyfive
          manuscripts for the Gospels alone); the latest researches of Nolan,
          Matthæi, Lawrence, and Hug; above all, those of Scholz (with his six
          hundred and seventy-four manuscripts for the Gospels, his two hundred
          for the Acts, his two hundred and fifty-six for the Epistles of Paul,
          his ninety-three for the Apocalypse, without reckoning his fifty-three
          Lectionaria): all these vast labours have so convincingly established
          the astonishing preservation of that text, copied nevertheless so many
          thousands of times (in Hebrew during thirty-three centuries, and in
          Greek during eighteen hundred years), that the hopes of the enemies of
          religion, in this quarter, have been subverted, and as Michaelis has
          said, "They have ceased henceforth to look for any thing from those
          critical researches which they at first so warmly recommended, because
          they expected discoveries from them that have never been made." The
          learned Rationalist Eichhorn himself also owns that the different
          readings of the Hebrew manuscripts collected by Kennicott hardly offer
          sufficient interest to compensate for the trouble they cost! But these
          very misreckonings, and the absence of those discoveries, have proved
          a precious discovery for the Church of God. She expected as much; but
          she is delighted to owe it to the labour of her very adversaries. "In
          truth," says a learned man of our day, "but for those precious
          negative conclusions that people have come to, the direct result
          obtained from the consumption of so many men's lives in these immense
          researches may seem to amount to nothing; and one may say that in
          order to come to it, time, talent, and learning have all been
          foolishly thrown away."2 But, as we have said, this result is immense
          in virtue of its nothingness, and all-powerful in virtue of its
          insignificance. When one thinks that the Bible has been copied during
          thirty centuries, as no book of man has ever been, or ever will be;
          that it was subjected to all the catastrophes and all the captivities
          of Israel; that it was transported seventy years to Babylon; that it
          has seen itself so often persecuted, or forgotten, or interdicted, or
          burnt, from the days of the Philistines to those of the
          Seleucidæ;—when one thinks that, since the time of Jesus Christ, it
          has had to traverse the first three centuries of the imperial
          persecutions, when persons found in possession of the holy books were
          thrown to the wild beasts; next the 7th, 8th, and 9th centuries, when
          false books, false legends, and false decretals, were everywhere
          multiplied; the 10th century, when so few could read, even among
          princes; the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries, when the use of the
          Scriptures in the vulgar tongue was punished with death, and when the
          books of the ancient fathers were mutilated, when so many ancient
          traditions were garbled and falsified, even to the very acts of the
          emperors, and to those of the councils;—then we can perceive how
          necessary it was that the providence of God should have always put
          forth its mighty power, in order that, on the one hand, the Church of
          the Jews should give us, in its integrity, that Word which records its
          revolts, which predicts its ruin, which describes Jesus Christ; and,
          on the other, that the Christian Churches (the most powerful of which,
          and the Roman sect in particular, interdicted the people from reading
          the sacred books, and substituted in so many ways the traditions of
          the middle ages for the Word of God) should nevertheless transmit to
          us, in all their purity, those Scriptures, which condemn all their
          traditions, their images, their dead languages, their absolutions,
          their celibacy; which say, that Rome would be the seat of a terrible
          apostasy, where "the Man of Sin would be seen sitting as God in the
          temple of God, waging war on the saints, forbidding to marry, and to
          use meats which God had created;" which say of images, "Thou shalt not
          bow down to them"—of unknown tongues, "Thou shalt not use them"—of the
          cup, "Drink ye all of it"—of the Virgin, "Woman, what have I to do
          with thee?"—and of marriage, "It is honourable in all."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, although all the libraries in which ancient copies of the sacred
          books may be found, have been called upon to give their testimony;
          although the elucidations given by the fathers of all ages have been
          studied; although the Arabic, Syriac, Latin, Armenian, and Ethiopian
          versions have been collated; although all the manuscripts of all
          countries and ages, from the third to the sixteenth century, have been
          collected and examined a thousand times over, by countless critics,
          who have eagerly sought out some new text, as the recompense and the
          glory of their wearisome watchings; although learned men, not content
          with the libraries of the West, have visited those of Russia, and
          carried their researches into the monasteries of Mont Athos, Turkish
          Asia, and Egypt, there to look for new instruments of the sacred
          text;—"Nothing has been discovered," says a learned person, already
          quoted, "not even a single reading, that could throw doubt on any one
          of the passages before considered as certain. All the variantes,
          almost without exception, leave untouched the essential ideas of each
          phrase, and bear only on points of secondary importance;" such as the
          insertion or the omission of an article or a conjunction, the position
          of an adjective before or after its substantive, the greater or less
          exactness of a grammatical construction.
        </p>
        <p>
          And would we be less rigorous in our demands with respect to the Old
          Testament?—the famous Indian manuscript, recently deposited in the
          Cambridge library, will furnish an example.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is thirty-three years since the pious and learned Claudius
          Buchanan, while visiting, in the Indian peninsula, the black Jews of
          Malabar (who are supposed to be the remains of the first dispersion
          under Nebuchadnezzar), saw in their possession an immense roll,
          composed of thirty-seven skins, tinged with red, forty-eight feet
          long, twenty-two inches wide, and which, in its originally entire
          state, must have had ninety English feet of development. The Holy
          Scriptures had been traced on it by different hands. There remained
          one hundred and seventeen columns of beautiful writing; and there was
          wanting only Leviticus and part of Deuteronomy. Buchanan succeeded in
          having this ancient and precious monument, which served for the
          worship of the synagogue, committed to his care, and he afterwards
          deposited it in the Cambridge library.
        </p>
        <p>
          The impossibility of supposing that this roll had been taken from a
          copy brought by European Jews, was perceived from certain evident
          marks. Now, Mr Yeates lately submitted it to the most attentive
          examination; and took the trouble to collate it, word by word, letter
          by letter, with our Hebrew edition of Van der Hooght. He has published
          the results of his researches. And what have they been? Why, this:
          that there do not exist, between the text of India and that of the
          West, above forty small differences, not one of which is of sufficient
          importance to lead to even a slight change in the meaning and
          interpretation of our ancient text; and that these are but the
          additions or retrenchments of an י or a ו,—letters the presence or
          absence of which, in Hebrew, cannot alter the import of the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know the peculiar character, among the Jews, of those Massorethes,
          or doctors of tradition, whose whole profession consisted in
          transcribing the Scriptures,—we know to what a pitch these learned men
          carried respect for the letter; and when we read the rules that
          regulated their labours, we can comprehend what use the providence of
          the Lord, who had "committed his oracles to the Jewish people," knew
          to make of their reverential respect, their strictness, and even their
          superstition. In each of the books they counted the number of verses,
          of words, of letters: they could have told you, for example, that the
          letter א appears forty-two thousand three hundred and seventy-seven
          times in the Bible, the letter ב thirty-eight thousand two hundred and
          eighteen times, and so on: they would have scrupled at changing the
          position of a single letter evidently displaced; they would only have
          called your attention to it on the margin, and would have supposed
          some mystery involved in it; they would have told you the middle
          letter in the Pentateuch, and that which is in the middle of each of
          the particular books of which it is composed: they never would permit
          themselves to retouch their manuscript; and if any mistake had escaped
          from them, they would have rejected the papyrus or the parchment which
          it had spoilt, and would have begun anew; for they were equally
          interdicted from ever correcting any of their blunders, and from
          preserving for their sacred volume a parchment or skin that had
          suffered any erasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          This intervention of God's providence in the preservation of the Old
          Testament becomes still more striking in our eyes, if we compare the
          astonishing integrity of the original Hebrew (at the close of so many
          centuries) with the rapid and profound alteration which the Greek
          version of the Septuagint had undergone in the days of Jesus Christ
          (after the lapse of only two hundred years). Notwithstanding that that
          book had acquired throughout the whole East, after the almost
          universal propagation of the Greek language, a semicanonical
          authority, first among the Jews and then among the Christians;
          notwithstanding its being afterwards the only text to which the
          fathers of the East and of the West (with the exception of Origen and
          of Jerome) had recourse for what they knew of the Old Testament, the
          only one that was commented on by the Chrysostoms and the
          Theodorets—the only one whence such men as Athanasius, Basil, and
          Gregory of Nazianzus drew their arguments; notwithstanding that the
          Western no more than the Eastern world had any better source of
          illumination, during so many ages, than that borrowed light (seeing
          that the ancient Italian Vulgate, which was in universal use, had been
          translated from the Greek of the Septuagint, and not from the Hebrew
          of the original); yet hear what the learned tell us of the alteration
          of that important monument—of the additions, changes, and
          interpolations to which it had been subjected, first through the
          doings of the ancient Jews before the days of Jesus Christ, after that
          by the unbelieving Jews, and later still through the heedlessness of
          Christian copyists: "The evil was such (mirum in modum)," says Dr Lee,
          "that in certain books the ancient version could hardly be recognised;
          and when Origen, in the year 231, had devoted twenty-eight years of
          his noble life in searching for different manuscripts of it, with the
          view of doing for that text (in his Tetrapla and his Hexapla) what
          modern critics have done for that of the Old and New Testaments, not
          only could he not find any copy that was correct, but he further made
          matters worse. Through the unskilfulness of the copyists (who
          neglected the transcriptions of his obelisks, asterisks, and other
          marks), the greater number of his marginal corrections found their way
          into the text; so that new errors having spread there, one could no
          longer, in the time of Jerome, distinguish between his annotations and
          the primitive text." We repeat, these facts, placed in contrast with
          the astonishing preservation of the Hebrew text (older than that of
          the LXX. by more than twelve hundred years), proclaim loudly enough
          how necessary it was that the mighty hand of God should intervene in
          the destinies of the sacred book.

          So much for the Old Testament. But let it not be thought that the
          Providence that watched over that sacred book, and which committed it
          to the Jews (Rom. 3:1, 2), has done less for the protection of the
          oracles of the New Testament, committed by it to the new people of
          God. It has not left to the latter less cogent motives to gratitude
          and feelings of security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we would appeal, by way of testimony, to the late experience of
          the authors of a version of the New Testament which has just been
          published in Switzerland, and in the long labours of which we
          ourselves had a part. A single trait may enable all classes of readers
          to understand how very insignificant are the different readings
          presented by the manuscripts. The translators to whom we refer
          followed, without the smallest deviation, what is called the received
          edition, that is to say, the Greek text of Elzevir, 1624, so long
          adopted by all our Churches; but as, in conformity with the original
          plan of the work they had undertaken, they had first of all to
          introduce into their original text the various readings that have been
          most approved by the criticism of the last century, they very often
          found themselves embarrassed, from perceiving the impossibility of
          expressing, even in the most literal French, the new shade of meaning
          introduced by that correction into their Greek. The French language,
          in the most scrupulous version, has not flexibility enough to enable
          it to assume these differences of manner, so as to put them in proper
          relief; just as the casts taken from the face of a king reproduce in
          brass his noble features, yet without being capable of marking every
          vein and wrinkle.
        </p>
        <p>
          We desire, however, to give such of our readers as are strangers to
          sacred criticism, two or three other and still more intelligible means
          of estimating that providence which has for thirty centuries watched
          over our sacred texts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first is as follows: We would bid them compare the two Protestant
          translations by Osterwald and Martin. There are few modern versions
          that come so close to each other. The old version of the Geneva
          pastors having been taken as the basis of both—both having been
          written at nearly the same time and in the same spirit— they differ so
          little, especially in the New Testament, that our Bible societies
          distribute them indifferently, and that one finds it hard to say which
          of the two ought to be preferred. Nevertheless, if you take the
          trouble to note their differences, taking all things into account, as
          has been done on comparing our four hundred manuscripts of the New
          Testament, the one with the other, we affirm beforehand (and rather
          think that in this we under-state the truth), that these two French
          texts are three times, and in many chapters ten times, wider from each
          other than the Greek text of our printed editions is, we will not say
          only from the least esteemed of the Greek manuscripts of our
          libraries, but FROM ALL THEIR MANUSCRIPTS PUT TOGETHER. Hence we will
          venture to say, that were some able and ill-meaning person (such as we
          may suppose the wretched Voltaire or the too celebrated Anthony
          Collins to have been in the last century) to study to select at will,
          out of all the manuscripts of the East and the West, when placed
          before him, the worst readings and the variations most remote from our
          received text, with the perfidious intention of composing at pleasure
          the most faulty text—such a man, we say (even were he to adopt such
          various readings as should have in their favour no more than ONE SOLE
          manuscript out of the four or five hundred of our libraries), could
          not, in spite of all his mischievous inclination, produce a Testament,
          as the result of his labours, that would be less close to that of our
          Churches than Martin is to Osterwald. Further, you might send it
          abroad instead of the true text, with as little inconvenience as you
          would find in giving French Protestants Martin rather than Osterwald,
          or Osterwald rather than Martin; and with far less scruple than you
          would feel in circulating De Sacy's version among the followers of the
          Church of Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt these last books are only translations, whereas all the Greek
          manuscripts profess to be original texts; and it must be admitted
          that, in this respect, our comparison is very imperfect: but it is not
          less fitted to re-assure the friends of the Word of God, by enabling
          them to understand the extreme insignificance of the various readings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, what follows is something more direct and more precise.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to give all our readers some measure at once of the number
          and of the harmlessness of the readings that have been collected
          together in the manuscripts of our libraries, we proceed to present
          two specimens of these. It will consist, first, of a schedule
          containing the first eight verses of the Epistle to the Romans, with
          ALL THE VARIOUS READINGS relating to these IN ALL THE MANUSCRIPTS of
          the East and of the West. This will be followed by a schedule of the
          whole epistle, with ALL THE CORRECTIONS that the celebrated Griesbach,
          the oracle of modern criticism, thought he ought to introduce into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have taken these passages at random, and declare that we have not
          been led to make choice of them in preference to others, by any reason
          bearing upon our argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          We feel gratified at placing these short documents before the eyes of
          persons who are not called by their position to follow out, of
          themselves, the investigations of sacred criticism, and whose minds,
          nevertheless, may have been somewhat discomposed by the language, at
          once mysterious and imposing, which the rationalists of the last
          century have so often employed on the subject. To hear them speak,
          would you not have said that modern science was about to give us a new
          Bible, to bring down Jesus Christ from the throne of God, to restore
          to man, when calumniated by our theology, all his titles to innocence,
          and to set to rights all the dogmas of our old orthodoxy?
        </p>
        <p>
          As a first term of comparison, our columns will present first of all,
          in the eight first verses of the Epistle to the Romans, the
          differences betwixt the one text of Martin (1707) and the one text of
          Osterwald, (Bagster's edition), while the following columns, instead
          of comparing any one sole manuscript with any other sole manuscript
          whatsoever, will present the differences between our received text and
          ALL THE MANUSCRIPTS that one has been able to collect down to
          Griesbach. That learned and indefatigable person, for the Epistle to
          the Romans, scrutinized first of all seven manuscripts written WITH
          UNCIAL LETTERS (or Greek capitals), and it is thought, from thirteen
          to fourteen centuries old, (the Alexandrine, in the British Museum;
          that of the Vatican, and that of Cardinal Passionei at Rome; that of
          Ephrem at Paris; that of St Germain, that of Dresden, and that of
          Cardinal Coislin); and after that, a hundred and ten manuscripts in
          small letters, and thirty others, brought for the most part from Mount
          Athos, and consulted by the learned Matthei, who travelled long for
          that purpose in Russia and the East.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the four Gospels, the same Griesbach had opportunities of
          consulting as many as three hundred and thirty-five manuscripts.
        </p>
        <p>VARIOUS READINGS<br />...</p>
        <p>
          These differences between the two French texts are sufficiently
          insignificant; and were one to tell us that, in all these verses, one
          or other of the two is inspired of God, our faith would receive great
          aid from this. Now it will be seen that the various readings of the
          Greek manuscripts are still more insignificant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now examine, on the same verses, the table containing the
          received text, compared with all the different readings that could be
          presented by the hundred and fifty Greek manuscripts collected and
          consulted for the Epistle to the Romans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we shall not point out either the differences presented by the
          ancient translations, or those that belong only to the punctuation
          (that element being almost null in the most ancient manuscripts).
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall translate the first column (that of the received text)
          according to the old version, which is more literal than Osterwald's;
          and we shall also endeavour to render the Greek readings of the second
          column as exactly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>SECOND TABLE<br />...</p>
        <p>
          Here we have nine or ten different readings, of no importance in
          themselves; and, moreover, they have in their favour only one or two
          manuscripts of the hundred and fifty open to consultation on those
          eight verses, with the exception of the last ("for you all," instead
          of "with respect to you all"), which reckons in its favour twelve
          manuscripts, four of which are in uncial letters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The differences between Osterwald's and Martin's translations are
          three times as numerous; and, generally speaking, these differences
          are far more important in point of meaning. This comparison, were we
          to continue it through the whole New Testament, would bear the same
          character, and become even still more insignificant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, those of our readers who have hitherto been strangers to
          such researches will not be displeased, we believe, at our offering,
          in a third table, a fresh method of estimating the harmlessness of the
          variations, and the nullity of the objection that has been drawn from
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This last table will present the totality of the corrections which,
          according to the learned Griesbach, the father of sacred criticism,
          ought to be introduced into the text of the Epistle to the Romans,
          after the prolonged study of the extant manuscripts to which he had
          devoted himself, and after all that had been done by his predecessors
          in the same field of research.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one who has not entered on these researches, can form a just idea
          of the immensity of those labours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before perusing this third table, however, we would have the reader to
          know—
        </p>
        <p>
          First, That Griesbach is, in general, charged by the learned (such as
          Matthæi, Nolan, Lawrence, Scholz, and others) with an excessive
          eagerness for the admission of new readings into the ancient text.
          This tendency is explained by the habits of the human heart. The
          learned Whitby had, before that, charged Dr Mill, not without some
          foundation, with the same fault, although he had never ventured on so
          many corrections as Griesbach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Observe, further, that in this table we give not only those
          corrections which the learned critic was fully persuaded people ought
          to adopt, but those also which he has said were as yet only doubtful
          in his eyes, and not to be confidently preferred to the generally
          received text.
        </p>
        <p>THIRD TABLE<br />...</p>
        <p>
          Here, then, the thing is evident: such is the real insignificance of
          the various readings about which so much noise was made at first. Such
          has been the astonishing preservation of the Greek manuscripts of the
          New Testament that have been transmitted to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the copying and recopying of the sacred text, whether in Europe,
          in Asia, or in Africa, whether in monasteries, or in colleges, or in
          palaces, or in the houses of the clergy (and this, too, almost without
          interruption, during the long course of fifteen hundred years);—after
          that during the three last centuries, and, above all, in the hundred
          and thirty years that have just elapsed, so many noble characters, so
          many ingenious minds, so many learned lives have been consumed in
          labours hitherto unheard of for their extent, admirable for their
          sagacity, and scrupulous as those of the Massorethes;—after having
          scrutinized all the Greek manuscripts of the New Testament that are
          buried in the private, or monastic, or national libraries, of the East
          and of the West;—after these have been compared, not only with all the
          old translations, Latin, Armenian, Sahidic, Ethiopic, Arabic,
          Sclavonian, Persian, Coptic, Syrian, and Gothic, of the Scriptures,
          but further, with all the ancient fathers of the Church, who have
          quoted them in their innumerable writings, in Greek and in
          Latin;—after so many researches, take this single example, as a
          specimen of what people have been able to find!
        </p>
        <p>
          Judge of the matter by this one epistle which you have before you. It
          is the longest and most important of the epistles of the New
          Testament, "the golden key of the Scriptures" (as it has been called),
          "the ocean of Christian doctrine." It contains four hundred and
          thirty-three verses, and in these four hundred and thirty-three
          verses, ninety-six Greek words that are met with nowhere else in the
          New Testament. And how many (admitting even all the corrections that
          have been adopted, or only preferred by Griesbach), how many have you
          found, in these, of readings that go to change, even slightly, the
          meaning of some phrase? You have seen five such! And, further, what
          are these? We shall repeat them; they are as follows:—
        </p>
        <p>
          The first (chap. 7:6) instead of "That in which … being dead,"
          Griesbach reads, "Being dead to that in which." And note well that
          here in the Greek, the difference depends only on the change of a
          single letter (an o instead of an e); and besides that, the greater
          number of manuscripts were so much in favour of the old text that,
          since Griesbach's time, Mr Tittman, in his edition of 1824, has
          rejected this correction, and Mr Lachman has done so also, in his
          edition of 1831 (Scholz, however, has retained it).
        </p>
        <p>The second is as follows, chapter 11:6:—</p>
        <p>
          Instead of, "And if by grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise
          grace is no more grace; but if it be of works, then is it no more
          grace: otherwise work is no more work," Griesbach takes away the
          latter half of this phrase.
        </p>
        <p>The third is as follows, chapter 12:11:—</p>
        <p>
          Instead of, "Serving the Lord," Griesbach reads, "Serving the
          occasion." Note that the correction depends only on the change of two
          letters in one of the Greek words, and that, moreover, it does not
          appear to be justified by the number of the manuscripts. Further here,
          Whitby told Mill that more than thirty manuscripts, that all the
          ancient translations, that Clement of Alexandria, St Basil, St Jerome,
          all the scholiasts of the Greeks, and all those of the Latins with the
          exception of Ambrose, followed the old text; and the two learned men
          whom we have just named (Lachman and Tittman), the one labouring at
          Berlin, the other a professor at Leipsic, have restored the old text,
          in their respective editions of the New Testament. This has been done
          also by Scholz, in his edition of 1836, which the learned world seems
          to prefer to all that have preceded it.
        </p>
        <p>The fourth is as follows, chapter 6:16:—</p>
        <p>
          Instead of, "Whether of sin unto death or of righteousness," Griesbach
          reads, "Whether of sin or of righteousness;" but he himself puts at
          the place the simple sign of a feeble probability; and Tittman and
          Lachman, in their respective editions, have further rejected this
          correction. Scholz, following their example, has equally rejected it.
          The fifth is as follows, chapter 16:5:—
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of, "The first fruits of Achaia," Griesbach reads, "The first
          fruits of Asia."
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we have taken no notice of the words that are taken away from the
          first paragraph of chapter 8, because we find them again at the 4th
          verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          We see, then, the amount of the whole: such is the admirable integrity
          of the Epistle to the Romans. According to Griesbach five
          insignificant corrections, in the whole epistle—according to more
          modern critics ONLY TWO, and these the most insignificant of the
          five;—and according to Scholz THREE!
        </p>
        <p>
          We repeat, that we have chosen the Epistle to the Romans, as a
          specimen, only because of its length and its importance. We have not
          given ourselves the time to examine whether it presents more or fewer
          various readings than any other part of the New Testament. We have run
          over, for example, in Griesbach, while reviewing these last pages, the
          EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS, written at the same time and on the same
          subject with the Epistle to the Romans; and there we have been unable
          to find more than the three following corrections that can affect the
          sense, or, to speak more correctly, the form of the sense:—
        </p>
        <p>
          Chap. 4:17. "They would exclude us"—say, "They would exclude you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Chap. 4:26. "She is the mother of us all"—say, "She is the mother of
          us."
        </p>
        <p>
          Chap. 5:19. "Adultery, fornication, uncleanness"—say, "Fornication,
          uncleanness."
        </p>
        <p>
          These simple schedules, in our opinion, will speak more loudly to our
          readers than all our general assertions could do. Of this we ourselves
          have felt the happy experience. We had read, no doubt, what others
          before us have been able to say on the insignificance of the different
          readings presented by the manuscripts; and we had often studied the
          various readings of Mill and the severe reproaches of his adversary
          Whitby; we had examined the writings of Wetstein, of Griesbach, of
          Lachman, and of Tittman; but when, on two occasions, while taking part
          in the work of a new translation of the New Testament, we have been
          called upon to correct the French text according to the most esteemed
          various readings, first to introduce these into it, and afterwards to
          remove them out of it again, and to replace there in French the sense
          conveyed by the old reading; then we have had on two occasions, as it
          were, an intuition of that astonishing preservation of the Scriptures,
          and we have felt ourselves penetrated with gratitude towards that
          wonderful providence which has not ceased to watch over the oracles of
          God, in order to preserve their integrity to this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let its true value be then assigned to the objection that has been
          made to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let it be shown us, for example, how three or four various readings
          that we have passed under review in the Epistle to the Romans, and
          which, in the opinion of the most modern critics, are reduced to two
          or to three, could render the fact of its original inspiration
          illusory for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt, in these three or four passages, as well as in those of the
          other sacred books where the true word of the text might be contested,
          no doubt there, and there alone, of the two different readings of the
          manuscripts, one is the inspired word, and not the other; no doubt
          people must in this small number of cases divide or suspend their
          confidence between two expressions; but such is the extent that
          uncertainty reaches; such the point beyond which it must not go.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is reckoned, that of the seven thousand nine hundred and fiftynine
          verses of the New Testament, there hardly exist ten or twelve in which
          the corrections that have been introduced by the new readings of
          Griesbach and Scholz, as the result of their immense researches, have
          any weight at all. Further, in most instances they consist but in the
          difference of a single word, and sometimes even of a single letter. We
          should be doing well, perhaps, to point these out here also, as an
          addition to those to which we have directed the reader's attention in
          the Epistle to the Romans.
        </p>
        <p>
          The twelve or thirteen following have usually been regarded as the
          most important among the various readings collected by Griesbach, and
          more recently by Scholz. The four first even have appeared the most
          serious, only because they strike at the divinity of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st, (Acts 20:28.)—Instead of—"Feed the Church of God, which he hath
          bought with his own blood,"
        </p>
        <p>
          The text of Griesbach bears—"Feed the Church of the Lord, which he
          hath bought with his own blood."
        </p>
        <p>
          Here the difference of the reading preferred by Griesbach consists in
          A SINGLE LETTER. Scholz even preserves the old text.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d, (1 Tim. 3:16.)—Instead of—"And without controversy great is the
          mystery of godliness, God was manifested in the flesh, justified in
          the Spirit," …
        </p>
        <p>
          Some manuscripts bear—"Without controversy, great is the mystery of
          godliness, which was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit."
        </p>
        <p>
          But some other manuscripts adopted by Griesbach bear—"Great is the
          mystery of godliness, he who was manifest in the flesh was justified
          in the Spirit." …
        </p>
        <p>
          Here the difference is still no more than that of a single letter, or
          even only that of two strokes of a letter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scholz has not admitted Griesbach's correction. Almost all the Greek
          manuscripts, says he, bear Θεὸς (God). He assures us he has found it
          in eighty-six manuscripts, examined by himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d, (Jude 4.)—Instead of—"Who deny our only ruler, God and Saviour,
          Jesus Christ,"
        </p>
        <p>
          The text of Griesbach and that of Scholz bears—"Who deny our only
          master and Lord Jesus Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          Here the difference is only in these two letters (ΘΝ, God), omitted in
          the manuscripts which Griesbach has preferred.
        </p>
        <p>
          We approve of the adversaries of the divinity of Jesus Christ
          attaching importance to these three first corrections, in respect of
          criticism (for every thing is of importance in the Scripture), but in
          respect of doctrine, we cannot comprehend how they should do so;
          inasmuch as, by their own admission, there are many other passages
          without various readings, in which our Lord is called by the name of
          God, of true God, of the great God. No manuscript, for example,
          presents variations on the first verse of the Gospel of St John: "In
          the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
          was God." So, too, no Greek manuscript whatsoever presents a variation
          in the reading of that verse of the Epistle to Titus (2:13) —"Looking
          for the glorious appearance of our great God and Saviour Jesus
          Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          4th, (1 John 5:7, 8.)—Instead of—"There are three that bear witness
          [in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three
          are ONE (ἙΝ); and there are three that bear witness] in the earth, the
          Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three agree in that
          ONE" (τὸ ἝΝ),
        </p>
        <p>
          Griesbach's text bears—"There are three that bear witness on the
          earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and the three agree in
          that ONE" (τὸ ἝΝ).
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, without doubt, there is the most serious variation, and, at the
          same time, that which is the most justified by the testimony of the
          manuscripts that have been preserved down to the present day (more
          than a hundred and forty against three), as well as by the univers
          silence of the Greek fathers. We should be travelling out of our
          subject were we to undertake to discuss here the historical
          testimonies and the grammatical considerations that plead, on the
          contrary, for retaining the old reading. We shall confine ourselves to
          these two remarks by Bishop Middleton:—
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Why is the word three, the three, in the masculine in the Greek
          (τρεῖς ὁι μαρτυροῦντες, καὶοἱ τρεῖς), while the words spirit, water,
          and blood, to which it relates, are all neuter (for it would have been
          necessary to say τρία τὰ μαρτυροῦντα)? This irregularity, which is
          fully justified by what is called in grammar the principle of
          attraction, if the passage remains entire, becomes inexplicable when
          you would deprive it of the contested words.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Wherefore, above all, this word, that one (τὸ ἕν, the ONE), if some
          certain ONE have not been spoken of in the preceding words? That
          expression (τὸ ἕν), in that case, would be without example. To this
          Bishop Middleton devotes eighteen pages in his beautiful work on the
          Doctrine of the Greek Article (in 8vo, Cambridge, 1828, pp. 606 to
          624). "I cannot conceive," says he in conclusion, "how this word, that
          ONE (τὸ ἕν) can be reconciled with the taking away of the preceding
          words. I am aware that the greater number of the learned are
          favourable to these retrenchments; but, taking all things into view, I
          am led to suspect that, notwithstanding the immense labour bestowed on
          this celebrated passage, something more yet remains to be done in
          order to clear away the mystery in which it is still involved." The
          learned Bengel, for still further reasons, said that the two verses of
          this passage remain united adamantinâ adhærentiâ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scholz has, like Griesbach, taken away the three heavenly witnesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th, (Apoc. 8:13)—Instead of, "And I beheld and heard an angel
          flying," Griesbach's text and that of Scholz bear, "And I beheld and
          heard an eagle flying."
        </p>
        <p>
          6th, (James 2:18)—Instead of, "Show me thy faith by works,"
          Griesbach's text and that of Scholz bear, "Show me thy faith without
          works."
        </p>
        <p>
          7th, (Acts 16:7)—Instead of, "But the Spirit suffered them not,"
          Griesbach's text and that of Scholz bear, "But the Spirit of Jesus
          suffered them not."
        </p>
        <p>
          8th, (Ephes. 5:21)—Instead of, "Submitting yourselves one to another
          in the fear of God," Griesbach's text and that of Scholz bear,
          "Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          9th, (Apoc. 1:11)—Instead of, "I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the
          last," the text of Griesbach suppresses these words, which it has
          retained, however, at the 8th verse, as well as at chapter 22:13.
          Scholz has made the same correction.
        </p>
        <p>
          10th, (Matth. 19:17)—Instead of, "Why callest thou me good?"
          Griesbach's text bears, "Why do you ask me about the good (or about
          happiness)?"
        </p>
        <p>
          But Scholz does not admit this correction, and retains the old text.
        </p>
        <p>
          11th, (Philip. 4:13)—Instead of, "I can do all things through Christ
          strengthening me," Griesbach's text and that of Scholz bear, "I can do
          all things through him who strengtheneth me."
        </p>
        <p>
          12th, Finally, (Acts 8:37; 9:5, 6; 10:6), Griesbach's text and that of
          Scholz suppress the 37th verse and these words, "It is hard for thee
          to kick against the pricks; and he, trembling and astonished, said,
          Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" and, "He shall tell thee what
          thou oughtest to do."
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt, in these passages (I repeat), among the different readings
          which the manuscripts present, it will not be possible to know
          infallibly which is the one that ought to be regarded as the primitive
          text, or the very word given by God; but, as to the meaning of the
          sentence, our uncertainties will always be circumscribed within a very
          narrow and very clearly defined field. It is true, that choose I must
          between one word and another word—between one letter and another
          letter; but there all my doubts are limited, there they stop: they are
          not allowed to go any farther. Not only, in fact, have I the assurance
          that the rest of the text is entirely from God; but I further know,
          that of the two different readings which the manuscripts present to
          me, one is certainly the inspired word. Thus you see how it stands:
          here my uncertainties can bear only on the alternative of two
          readings, almost always very much alike; while, on the contrary, under
          the system of partial inspiration, the field of our doubts and of our
          perplexities will have no bounds. If the language of the sacred books
          has been so far left to the ever fallible choice of human wisdom —and
          if divine wisdom, which alone is infallible, have not controlled and
          guaranteed it—I am exposed incessantly to the temptation of
          abstracting something from it, modifying something in it, or adding
          something to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, then, have all the efforts of the adversaries of inspiration to
          shake our faith by attacks on this side, only served, as a last
          result, to confirm it. They have obliged the Church to follow them in
          their investigations, and soon thereafter to precede them in these;
          and what has she found in this pursuit? Why this: that the text is
          still purer than the most godly men had ventured to hope; that the
          adversaries of inspiration, and those of the orthodox dogmas, at least
          in Germany, have been compelled to admit it. After the labours of
          Erasmus, of Stephanus, and of Mill, they hoped to find, among all the
          manuscripts of our libraries, readings more favourable to the Socinian
          doctrines than those adopted by the Bezas and the Elzevirs. Many even
          thought that the uncertainties would become such, and the differences
          so serious, that all the positive evangelical doctrines— exclusive, as
          they call them—would be shaken. But it has not been so. The process
          has now been brought to a close—the complainants have lost their
          cause; the trial having been conducted at their demand by modern
          criticism, all the judges, on the benches of the Rationalists, have
          with one voice pronounced it a lost case, and that the objectors must
          go elsewhere to look out for arguments and complaints.
        </p>
        <p>
          When this question, respecting the integrity of the original text,
          presented itself for the first time to the excellent and learned
          Bengel, more than a hundred and twenty years ago, he was dismayed at
          the thought of it; it gave his upright and godly soul profound
          distress. Then did there commence on his part those labours of sacred
          criticism, which gave a new direction to that science among the
          Germans. The English had preceded the Germans in it; but the latter
          soon got before them. At last, after long researches, Bengel, in 1721,
          happy and reassured, wrote to his disciple Reus: "Eat simply the bread
          of the Scriptures as it presents itself to thee; and do not distress
          thyself at finding here and there a small particle of sand which the
          millstone may have left in it. Thou mayst, then, dismiss all those
          doubts which at one time so horribly tormented myself. If the Holy
          Scriptures—which have been so often copied, and which have passed so
          often through the faulty hands of ever fallible men—were absolutely
          without variations, the miracle would be so great, that faith in them
          would no longer be faith. I am astonished, on the contrary, that the
          result of all those transcriptions has not been a much greater number
          of different readings." The comedies of Terence alone have presented
          thirty thousand; and yet these are only six in number, and they have
          been copied a thousand times less often than the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          How shall we not recognize the mighty intervention of God in this
          unanimous accord of all the religious societies of the East and of the
          West! Every where the same Scriptures! What distances separate
          Christians from Jews in their worship! And yet, walk into our schools
          of learning, examine our Hebrew Testaments; then go into their
          synagogues, ask their rabbis to show you their sacred rolls—you will
          there find the same books, without the difference of a letter! What
          distances separate, in their worship, the Reformed Christians from the
          members of the Roman sect! And yet, pursue your search, you will find
          in our respective schools the same Greek Testament, without the
          difference of an iota! We take theirs as they take ours— Erasmus or
          Beza, Ximenes or Mill, Scholz or Griesbach! What distances, further,
          separate the Latin Church from the Greek Church —which also calls
          itself catholic, but orthodox, apostolic daughter of Antioch, and
          condemning the Romans as rebellious and schismatical sons! And yet,
          ask both for their sacred texts, no more will you find here any
          difference; here the various readings will not at all make two schools
          that distinguish them; here the same manuscripts will be consulted—the
          priests and the pope, Munich and Moscow, will make you hear one and
          the same testimony. The necessary result, then, has been, that we
          all—Greeks, Latins, and Protestants—should have among us the same
          sacred book of the New Testament, without the difference of a single
          iota!
        </p>
        <p>
          We have said enough on this great fact. We have felt it right merely
          to glance at it for the purpose of repelling an objection, since it
          took us away from our subject. What we had undertaken was to prove a
          doctrine—to wit, the primary inspiration of Holy Scripture; and some
          have thought they could oppose us by urging, that, even were this
          doctrine true, it would be deprived of all effect by the alterations
          which Holy Scripture must have undergone. We behoved to show that
          these alterations are a vain and harmless phantom. While engaged in
          establishing a doctrine, we have already said, we have been led to
          write a history. We would now, then, return to the doctrine.
          Nevertheless, before returning to it, we must once more conclude, that
          not only was the Scripture inspired on the day when God caused it to
          be written, but that we possess this word inspired eighteen hundred
          years ago; and that we may still, while holding our sacred text in one
          hand, and in the other all the readings collected by the learned in
          seven hundred manuscripts, exclaim, with thankfulness, I hold in my
          hands my Father's testament, the eternal word of my God!
