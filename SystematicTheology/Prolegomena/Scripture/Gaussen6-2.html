        <h2>II. Let Sacred Criticism be an Historian, not a Soothsayer</h2>
        <p>
          There is, in relation to the inspiration of the Scriptures, one other
          not less important precaution, which we must point out in the use that
          is made of science.
        </p>
        <p>
          The task of sacred criticism is to collect facts on the Scriptures: do
          not suffer her to engage you in vain hypotheses; there she will do you
          much mischief. She ought to be an historian; make her not a
          prophetess. When she divines, do not listen to her; turn your back
          upon her; for she will dissipate your time, and more than your time.
          Now, the believer's safeguard here is still the doctrine of
          inspiration such as we have exhibited it; I mean of the inspiration,
          not of the men, but of the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Scripture is divinely inspired: such is the declaration of the
          authentic book of the Scriptures. But as for what passed in the
          understanding and in the conscience of the sacred writers, that is
          hardly ever revealed to us, and it is what we are not required to
          know. Much time and many words have been lost owing to men having
          neglected this grand principle. Scripture is inspired, whether the
          author knew or did not know beforehand what God was making him write.
          In such researches, therefore, as studying in each book of the Bible
          the particularities of its style, of its language, of its reasoning,
          and all the circumstances of its sacred writer, we can see nothing but
          good; they are useful, legitimate, respectful; and it is in these,
          certainly, there is science. Should the student proceed to endeavour,
          by these same characters, to fix its date, and the occasion of its
          being written, still we can perceive nothing but what is instructive
          and becoming in such an investigation. It may be well, for example, to
          know that it was under Nero that Paul wrote to the Jews, enjoining
          them "to be subject to the powers that be." It may be useful to know,
          that Peter had been married more than twenty-three years when Paul
          reminded the Corinthians2 that he (the first of the popes, as he is
          called) still continued, in all his apostolic journeyings, to lead his
          wife about with him, and that the other apostles, and James himself
          (who was reputed the first of the pillars of the church), did the same
          thing. In this, too, there is science. We highly value, for the sake
          of the church of God, all labour which enables it to comprehend better
          a passage, aye, were it but a single word of holy Scripture. But to
          proceed from that to crude hypotheses on the sacred writers, to make
          what they say depend on the haphazard of their presumed circumstances,
          instead of considering their circumstances as prepared and willed by
          God for what they were to teach, to subordinate the nature, the
          abundance, or the conciseness of their teachings to the concurrence,
          more or less fortuitous, of their ignorances, or their
          recollections—this is to degrade inspiration; it is to lay the
          foundations of infidelity; it is to forget that "the men of God spake
          as they were moved by the Holy Ghost (φερόμενοι), not with words which
          man's wisdom teacheth, but with those which the Holy Ghost teacheth."
        </p>
        <p>
          Did the evangelists, it has been asked, read each other? And of what
          consequence is this to me, provided they were "moved by the Spirit;"
          and if, after the example of the Thessalonians, I receive their book,
          not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God? The
          putting of this question, we may remark in passing, may be very
          innocent, but it is no longer so in the manner in which it is treated,
          and in the importance that is attached to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When people inquire whether John had read the gospels of the other
          three; whether Mark and Luke had read the gospel of Matthew before
          writing their own (as Dr Mill and Professor Hug2 would have it, and as
          Dr Lardner and Professor Michaelis4 would not have it); when it is
          asked whether they only caused to be transcribed with discernment the
          most important portions of the oral tradition (as Dr Gieseler would
          have it); when on this huge volumes are written, in attack or defence
          of these systems, as if faith and even science were really interested
          in them, and as if great things behoved to result from them to the
          Christian church; when it is affirmed that the three first evangelists
          had consulted some original document now lost, Greek according to
          some, Hebrew according to others (an idea first conceived by Le Clerc,
          and taken up sixty years after him by Messrs Kopp, Michaelis, Lessing,
          Niemeyer, Eichhorn, and others6); when people plunge still deeper into
          this romantic field; when they reach at last a drama so complicated as
          the Bishop of Landaff's, with his first Hebrew historical document,
          his second Hebrew dogmatical document, his third document, his fourth
          document (a translation of the first), then his documents of the
          second class, formed by the translation of Luke and Mark and Matthew,
          which brings the sources at last to the number of seven, without
          reckoning three more of them peculiar to St Luke and St Mark; or
          further still, with Mr Veysie8 in England, and Dr Gieseler in Germany,
          we would trace up either the three first gospels, or the four gospels,
          to apocryphal narratives in previous circulation in the Christian
          churches; when, with the first of these doctors, people will have it
          that Mark copied them with a more literal exactness than Luke, on
          account, it is said, of his ignorance of Greek, while Matthew, first
          written in Hebrew, must, beyond doubt, have been afterwards translated
          into Greek by some one, who must have modified it out of Mark and
          Luke, and transmitted it to us at last in the state in which we
          possess it; when, not content with sketching these systems in a few
          phrases, as a task of passing curiosity, people have written thereon
          so many and such bulky volumes, as if the interests of the kingdom of
          God were involved in them, oh! we cannot avoid saying that we
          experience, in the view of all this science, a profound sense of
          grief! But after all, is this science? No! these are no longer
          scientific inquirers—they have forsaken facts—they prophetize the
          history of the past; these are the astrologers of theology. It is
          thought, in astronomy, that a book of observations on the smallest
          satellite discovered near Uranus, or on the finding of a second of
          parallax in the case of some star, or on a single spot measured in the
          moon, is a precious acquisition for science, whilst all the writings
          of the Count de Boulainvilliers, and the three hundred volumes on the
          Barbaric sphere, on the influences, the aspects, or the horoscopes of
          the seven planetary bodies, can be for it no better than a piece of
          folly, or a useless encumbrance. Thus we should set a higher value, in
          the pursuits of sacred criticism, on whatever might throw some surer
          light on the smallest passage of the Scriptures; but what end could
          all these crude hypotheses ever serve? In these, people desert the
          luminous paths of science, as well as those of faith; they weary
          themselves in the pursuit of empty nothings! Vain and noisy toil
          expended in misty conjectures formed upon the clouds! Nothing good can
          come down from them! Wretched pursuits, which teach men to doubt where
          God teaches them to believe! "Who is he," saith the Lord, "who
          darkens, by words without knowledge, the counsels of the Most High?"
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, would that we could say that there was nothing there beyond
          idle fancies, and an enormous loss of time! But in these, people do
          much worse than waste their precious hours: they lose their faith
          there; they fascinate their mind's eyes; they draw away young students
          from the great and first Author of the Scriptures. It is clear that
          these idle pursuits can proceed only from a want of faith in the
          inspiration of the Scriptures. Believe, for one moment, that Jesus
          Christ had given to his apostles (the πῶς καὶτί, Matt. 10:19, 20) the
          what and the how that they were to speak; admit that the Holy Ghost
          made them relate the life of Jesus Christ, as he made them relate his
          sitting at the right hand of God, and you instantly perceive that all
          these hypotheses vanish into nothing. Not only do they teach you
          nothing, they cannot teach you any thing; but they put your believing
          thoughts into a wrong track; they gradually undermine the doctrine of
          inspiration; they indirectly weaken God's testimony, its certainty,
          its perfection. They turn the thoughts of your piety from their true
          direction; they mislead those young persons who were looking for the
          living waters from the wells of the Scriptures, and who are drawn away
          to heal themselves amid the sands, far from the springs that gush up
          into eternal life. What, after all, will they find there? Broken
          cisterns, clouds without water, and at most, perhaps fantastic
          streams, gleaming to them for some days in the sun, like a deceitful
          mirage on the deserts of human thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          What would you say of a learned divine who should endeavour to trace
          the discourses and the doctrines of Jesus Christ to the instructions
          of Joseph the carpenter, or to the lessons of the school at Nazareth?
          Idle and pernicious task, you would exclaim. Well, then, the same must
          be said of all those conjectural systems which would, on human
          principles, explain the composition of the Scriptures. Idle and
          pernicious, we say! Admit inspiration, and all this labour vanishes
          like an idle dream. The Scriptures are the word of God; they are given
          by him, and we know that no prophecy ever came by the will of man; but
          holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. The story
          of Paul's nephew giving warning to his uncle in the prison of Antonia,
          is inspired by God, although Luke may have heard it twenty times from
          the mouth of the apostle before receiving it from the Holy Ghost. That
          story is inspired, equally with the account of the invisible angel who
          was commissioned by God to strike the king of the Jews upon his
          throne, in the city of Cesarea. The account given us of Jacob's
          ring-straked and speckled sheep is from God, as well as that of the
          creation of the heavens and the earth. The history of the fall of
          Ananias and Sapphira is as divinely inspired, as is that of the fall
          of Satan and his angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! no doubt the evangelists had one common document after which these
          holy men of God spoke; but as has been so well said by Bishop Gleig,
          that document was neither more nor less than just the preaching and
          the life of our divine Saviour. That was their prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, when you hear it asked, from what documents Matthew could
          have taken his account of the birth of Jesus Christ? Luke, that of his
          early years? Paul, the Saviour's appearance to St James, or the
          Saviour's words on the blessedness of giving? whence Hosea took what
          he says of the tears of Jacob? and Jude, Enoch's prophecy? and
          Michael's contention about the body of Moses?—you may reply, that they
          were derived from the same source from which Moses learned the
          creation of the heaven and the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have shown how sound views on the inspiration of the Scriptures,
          will preserve youthful students from being led into the two grand
          errors of modern criticism, and at the same time enable them to derive
          from that noble science the utmost possible amount of good. The former
          of these errors, we have said, consists in pretending to subject the
          Scriptures to our judgment, after having admitted their authenticity;
          the latter consists in indulging dangerous conjectures on the sacred
          books. But we have still to make an important reflexion on the
          relations of learning to the great question which occupies us.
