          Commentary on The Westminster Confession of Faith<br />Of The Holy
          Scripture
        </h2>
        <p>
          SECTION I. --Although the light of nature; and the works of creation;
          and providence; do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of
          God, as to leave men unexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give
          that knowledge of God and of His will, which is necessary unto
          salvation. Therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry times, and in
          divers manners, to reveal; Himself, and to declare; that His will unto
          His Church; and afterwards, for the better preserving and propagating
          of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the
          Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan
          and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing: which maketh
          the Holy Scripture to be most necessary; those former ways of God's
          revealing His will unto His people being now ceased. Scripture Proof
          Texts

        <p>
          Rom 2:14-15; Rom 1:19-20; Ps 19:1-3; Rom 1:32, with Rom 2:1; 1 Cor

        </p>
        <p>This section affirms the following propositions: -</p>
        <p>
          1. That the light of nature and the works of creation and providence
          are sufficient to make known the fact that there is a God, and
          somewhat of his nature and character, so as to leave the disobedience
          of men without excuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That nevertheless the amount and kind of knowledge thus attainable
          is not sufficient to enable any to secure salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. That consequently it has pleased God, of his sovereign grace, to
          make, in various ways and at different times, a supernatural
          revelation of himself and of his purposes to a chosen portion of the
          human family.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. And that subsequently God has been pleased to commit that
          revelation to writing, and that it is now exclusively embraced in the
          Sacred Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The light of nature and the works of creation and providence are
          sufficient to enable men to ascertain the fact that there is a God,
          and somewhat of his nature and character, end thus render them
          inexcusable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three generically distinct false opinions have been entertained with
          respect to the capacity of men, in their present circumstances, to
          attain to any positive knowledge of the being and character of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) There is the assumption of all those extreme Rationalists who
          deny the existence of any world beyond the natural one discoverable by
          our senses, and especially of that school of Positive Philosophy
          inaugurated by Auguste Comte in France, and represented by John Stuart
          Mill and Herbert Spencer in England, who affirm that all possible
          human knowledge is confined to the facts of our experience and the
          uniform laws which regulate the succession of those facts; that it is
          not possible for the human mind, in its present state, to go beyond
          the simple order of nature to the knowledge of an absolute First
          Cause, or to a designing and disposing Supreme Intelligence, even
          though such an one actually exists; that whether there be a God. or
          not, yet as a matter of fact he is not revealed, and as a matter of
          principle could not, even if revealed, be recognized by man in the
          present state of his faculties.
        </p>
        <p>
          This assumption is disproved - (a.) By the fact that men of all
          nations, ages, and degrees of culture, have discerned the evidences of
          the presence of a God in the works of nature and providence, and in
          the inward workings of their own souls. This has been true, not only
          of individuals, communities, or generations unenlightened by science,
          but pre-eminently of some of the very first teachers of positive
          science in the modern scientific age, such as Sir Isaac Newton, Sir
          David Brewster, Dr. Faraday, etc. (b.) By the fact that the works of
          nature and providence are full of the manifest traces of design, and
          that they can be scientifically explained, and as a matter of fact are
          explained by these very sceptics themselves, only by the recognition
          and accurate tracing out of the evident " intention" which each of
          these works is adapted to subserve in their mutual relations. (c.) The
          same is disproved from the fact that conscience, which is a universal
          and indestructible element of human nature, necessarily implies our
          accountability to a personal moral Governor, and as a matter of fact
          has uniformly led men to a recognition of his existence and of their
          relation to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) An extreme opinion on this subject has been held by some
          Christians, to the effect that no true and certain knowledge of God
          can be derived. by man, in his present condition, from the light of
          nature in the entire absence of a supernatural revelation; that we are
          altogether dependent upon such a revelation for any certain knowledge
          that God exists, as well as for all knowledge of his nature and his
          purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This opinion is disproved -- (a.) By the direct testimony of
          Scripture. Rom 1:20-24; Rom 2:14-15. (b.) By the fact that many
          conclusive arguments for the existence of a great First Cause, who is
          at the same time an intelligent personal Spirit and righteous moral
          Governor, have been drawn by a strict induction from the facts of
          nature alone, as they lie open to the natural understanding. The fact
          that this argument remains unanswerable shows that the process by
          which the conclusions are drawn from purely natural sources is
          legitimate. (c.) All nations, however destitute of a supernatural
          revelation they may have been, have yet possessed some knowledge of a
          God. And in the case of the most enlightened of the heathen, natural
          religion has given birth to a considerable natural theology. We must,
          however, distinguish between that knowledge of the divine character
          which may be obtained by men from the worlds of nature arid providence
          in the exercise of their natural powers alone, without any suggestions
          or assistance derived from a supernatural revelation -- as is
          illustrated in the theological writings of some most eminent of the
          heathen who lived before Christ -- and that knowledge which men in
          this age, under the clear light of a supernatural revelation, are
          competent to deduce from a study of nature. The natural theology of
          the modern Rationalists demonstrably owes all its special excellences
          to that Christian revelation it is intended to supersede.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) The third erroneous opinion which has been entertained on this
          subject is that of Deists and theistic Rationalists -- viz., that the
          light of nature, when legitimately used, is perfectly sufficient of
          itself to lead men to all necessary knowledge of God's being, nature,
          and purposes. Some German Rationalists, while admitting that a
          supernatural revelation has been given in the Christian Scriptures,
          yet insist that its only office is to illustrate and enforce the
          truths already given through the light of nature, which are sufficient
          in themselves, and need re-enforcement only because they are
          ordinarily not properly attended to by men. But, in opposition to
          this, the Confession teaches --
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That the amount of knowledge attainable by the light of nature is
          not sufficient to enable any to secure salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is proved to be true -- (1.) From Scripture. 1 Cor 1:21; 1 Cor
          2:13-14. (2.) From the fact that man's moral relations to God have
          been disturbed by sin; and while the natural light of reason may teach
          an unfallen being spontaneously how he should approach and serve God,
          and while it may teach a fallen being what the nature of God may
          demand as to the punishment of sin, it can teach nothing by way of
          anticipation as to what God may be sovereignly disposed to do in the
          way of remission, substitution, sanctification, restoration, etc. (3.)
          'From the facts presented in the past history of all nations destitute
          of the light of revelation, both before and since Christ. The truths
          they have held have been incomplete and. mixed with fundamental error;
          their faith has been uncertain; their religious rites have been
          degrading, and their lives immoral. The only apparent exception to
          this fact is found in the case of some Rationalist' in Christian
          lands; and their exceptional superiority to others of their creed is
          due to the secondary influences of that system of supernatural
          religion which they deny, but the power of which they cannot exclude.
        </p>
        <p>Hence, the Confession teaches in this section --</p>
        <p>
          3. That consequently it has pleased God, of his sovereign grace, to
          make, in various ways and at different times, a super natural
          revelation of himself and of his purposes to a chosen portion of the
          human family. And that --
        </p>
        <p>
          4. God has been pleased subsequently to commit that revelation to
          writing, and it is now exclusively embraced in the Sacred Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since, as above shown, the light of nature is insufficient to enable
          men to attain such a knowledge of God and his will as is necessary for
          salvation, it follows -- (1.) That a supernatural revelation is
          absolutely necessary for man; and, (2.) From what natural religion
          alone teaches us of the character of God, it follows that the giving
          of such a revelation is in the highest degree antecedently probable on
          his part. Man is essentially a moral agent, and needs a clearly
          revealed rule of duty; and a religious being, craving communion with
          God. In his natural state these are both unsatisfied. But God is the
          author of human nature. His intelligence leads us to believe that he
          will complete all his works and crown a religious nature with the gift
          of a religion practically adequate to its wants. The benevolence of
          God leads us to anticipate that he will not leave his creatures in
          bewilderment and ruin for the want of light as to their condition and
          duties. And his righteousness occasions the presumption that he will
          at some time speak in definite and authoritative tones to the
          conscience of his subjects. (3.) As a matter of fact, God has given
          such a revelation. Indeed he has in no period of human history left
          himself without a witness. His communications to mankind through the
          first three thousand years were made in very " diverse manners"-- by
          theophanies and audible voices, dreams, visions, the Urim and Thummim,
          and prophetic inspiration; and the results of these communications
          were diffused and perpetuated by means of tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that such a revelation has been made, and. that we ' have it
          in the Christian Scriptures, is fully substantiated by that mass of
          proof styled the " Evidences of Christianity." The main departments of
          this evidence are the following: --
        </p>
        <p>
          (a.) The Old and New Testaments, whether the Word of God or not, bear
          all the marks of genuine and authentic historical records.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b.) The miracles recorded in these Scriptures are established as
          facts by abundant testimony; and when admitted as facts they
          demonstrate the religion they accompany to be from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c.) The same is true in all respects with regard to the many explicit
          prophecies already fulfilled which are contained in the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d.) The unparalleled perfection of the moral system they teach, and
          the supernatural intelligence they discover in adaptation to all human
          characters and conditions in all ages.
        </p>
        <p>(e.) The absolutely perfect excellence of its Founder.</p>
        <p>
          (f.) The spiritual power of Christianity, as shown in the religious
          experience of individuals, and also in the wider influence it exerts
          over communities and nations in successive generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the questions concerning the Holy Scriptures as containing the
          whole of this revelation now made by God to men, see below.
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION II. Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God
          written, are now contained all the books of the Old and New Testament,
          which are these:
        </p>
        <p>Of the Old Testament:</p>
        <p>
          Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges,
          Ruth, I Samuel, II Samuel, I Kings, II Kings, I Chronicles, II
          Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs,
          Ecclesiastes, The Song of Songs, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations,
          Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum,
          Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi.
        </p>
        <p>Of the New Testament:</p>
        <p>
          The Gospels according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, The Acts of the
          Apostles, Paul's Epistles to the Romans, Corinthians I, Corinthians
          II, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians I ,
          Thessalonians II , To Timothy I , To Timothy II, To Titus, To
          Philemon, The Epistle to the Hebrews, The Epistle of James, The first
          and second Epistles of Peter, The first, second, and third Epistles of
          John, The Epistle of Jude, The Revelation of John.
        </p>
        <p>
          All which are given by inspiration of God to be the rule of faith and
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION III. The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine
          inspiration, are no part of the canon of the Scripture, and therefore
          are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise
          approved, or made use of, than other human writings.
        </p>
        <p>Scripture Proof Texts</p>
        <p>
          Lk 16:29, Lk 16:31; Eph 2:20; Rev 22:18-19; 2 Tim 3:16; Lk 24:27, Lk
          24:44; Rom 3:2; 2 Pet 1:21.
        </p>
        <p>These sections affirm the following propositions: --</p>
        <p>
          1. That the complete canon of Scripture embraces in the two great
          divisions of the Old and the New Testaments all the particular books
          here named.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That the books commonly called Apocrypha form no part of that
          canon, and are to be regarded as of no more authority than any other
          human writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. That all the canonical books were divinely inspired, and are thus
          given to us as an authoritative rule of faith and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The complete canon of Scripture embraces in the two great divisions
          of the Old and New Testaments all the particular books here named.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Old Testament is the collection of inspired writings given by God
          to his Church during the Old Dispensation of the Covenant of Grace;
          and the New Testament is the collection of those inspired writings
          which he gave during the New or Christian Dispensation of that
          Covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          We determine what books have a place in this canon or divine rule by
          an examination of the evidences which show that each of them,
          severally, was written by the inspired. prophet or apostle whose name
          it bears; or, as in the case of the Gospels of Mark and Luke, written
          under the superintendence and published by the authority of an
          apostle. This evidence in the case of the Sacred Scriptures is of the
          same kind of historical and critical proof as is relied upon by all
          literary men to establish the genuineness and authenticity of any
          other ancient writings, such as the Odes of Horace or the works of
          Herodotus. In general this evidence is (a) Internal, such as language,
          style, and the character of the matter they contain; (b) External,
          such as the testimony of contemporaneous writers, the universal
          consent of contemporary readers, and corroborating history drawn from
          independent credible sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          The genuineness of the books constituting the Old Testament canon as
          now received by all Protestants is established as follows: --
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Christ and his apostles endorse as genuine and authentic the
          canon of Jewish Scriptures as it existed in their time. (a) Christ
          often quotes as the Word of God the separate books and the several
          divisions embraced in the Jewish Scriptures -- viz., the Law, the
          Prophets, and. the Holy Writings or Psalms. Mk 14:49; Lk 24:44; Jn
          5:39. (b) The apostles also quote them as the Word of God; 2 Tim
          3:15-16; Acts 1:16. (c) Christ often rebuked the Jews for disobeying,
          but never for forging or corrupting their Scriptures, Mat 22:29.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) The Jewish canon thus endorsed by Christ and his apostles is the
          same as that we now have. (a) The New Testament writers quote as
          Scripture almost every one of the books we recognize, and no others.
          (b) The Septuagint, or Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures,
          made in Egypt B.C. 285, which was itself frequently quoted by Christ
          and his apostles, embraced every book contained in our copies. (c)
          Josephus, born A.D. 37, enumerates as Hebrew Scriptures the same books
          by their classes. (d) The testimony of the early Christian writers
          uniformly agrees with that of the ancient Jews as to every book. (e)
          Ever since the time of Christ both Jews and Christians, while rival
          and hostile parties, have separately kept the same canon, and agree
          perfectly as to the genuineness and authenticity of every book.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evidence which establishes the canonical authority of the several
          books of the New Testament may be generally stated as follows: (a) The
          early Christian writers in all parts of the world agree in quoting as
          of apostolical authority the books we receive, while they quote all
          other contemporaneous writings only for illustration. (b) The early
          Church Fathers furnish a number of catalogues of the books received by
          them as apostolical, all of which agree perfectly as to most of the
          books, and differ only in a slight degree with reference to some last
          written or least generally circulated. (c) The earliest translations
          of the Scriptures prove that, at the time they were made, the books
          they contain were recognized as Scripture. The Peshito, or early
          Syriac translation, agrees almost entirely with ours; and the Vulgate,
          prepared by Jerome A.D. 385, was based on the Italic or early Latin
          version, and agrees entirely with ours. (d) The internal evidence
          corroborates the external testimony in the case of all the books. This
          consists of the language and idiom in which they are written; the
          harmony in all essentials in the midst of great variety in form and
          circumstantials; the elevated spirituality and doctrinal consistency
          of all the books; and their practical power over the consciences and
          hearts of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But the books called Apocrypha form no part of the sacred canon,
          and are to be regarded as of no more authority than any other human
          writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word Apocrypha (anything hidden) has been applied to certain
          ancient writings whose authorship is not manifest, and for which
          unfounded claims have been set up for a place in the canon. Some of
          these have been associated with the Old and. some with the New
          Testament. In this section of the Confession, however, the name is
          applied. principally to those spurious scriptures for which a place is
          claimed in the Old Testament canon by the Roman Church. These are
          Tobit, Wisdom, Judith, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, and the two books of
          Maccabees. They also prefix to the book of Daniel the History of
          Susannah, and insert in the third chapter the Song of the Three
          Children; and add to the end of the book the History of Bel and the
          Dragon.
        </p>
        <p>
          That these books have no right to a place in the canon is proved by
          the following facts: (1.) They never formed a part of the Hebrew
          Scriptures. They have always been rejected by the Jews, to whose
          guardianship the Old Testament Scriptures were committed. (2.) None of
          them were ever quoted by Christ or the apostles. (3.) They were never
          embraced in the list of the canonical books by the early Fathers; and
          even in the Roman Church their authority was not accepted by the most
          learned and candid men until after it was made an article of faith by
          the Council of Trent, late in the sixteenth century. (4.) The internal
          evidence presented by their contents disproves their claims. None of
          them make any claim to inspiration, while the best of them disclaim
          it. Some of them consist of childish fables, and inculcate bad morals.
        </p>
        <p>And this section teaches --</p>
        <p>
          3. That all the canonical Scriptures were divinely inspired, and are
          thus given us as an authoritative rule of faith and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The books of Scripture were written by the instrumentality of men, and
          the national and personal peculiarities of their authors have been
          evidently as freely expressed in their writing, and their natural
          faculties, intellectual and moral, as freely exercised in their
          production, as those of the authors of any other writings.
          Nevertheless these books are, one and all, in thought and verbal
          expression, in substance and form, wholly the Word of God, conveying
          with absolute accuracy and divine authority all that God meant them to
          convey, without any human additions or admixtures. This was
          accomplished by a supernatural influence of the Spirit of God acting
          upon the spirits of the sacred writers, called "inspiration;" which
          accompanied them uniformly in what they wrote; and which, without
          violating the free operation of their faculties, yet directed them in
          all they wrote, and secured the infallible expression of it in words.
          The nature of this divine influence we, of course, can no more
          understand than we can in the case of any other miracle. But the
          effects are plain and certain -- viz., that all written under it is
          the very Word of God, of infallible truth, and of divine authority;
          and this infallibility and authority attach as well to the verbal
          expression in which the revelation is conveyed as to the matter of the
          revelation itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that the Scriptures are thus inspired is proved because they
          assert it of themselves; and because they must either be credited as
          true in this respect, or rejected as false in all respects; 'and
          because God authenticated the claims of their writers by accompanying
          their teaching with "signs and wonders and divers miracles." Heb 2:4.
          Wherever God sends his "sign," there he commands belief; but it is
          impossible that he could unconditionally command belief except to
          truth infallibly conveyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) The Old Testament writers claimed to be inspired. Deut 31:19-22;
          Deut 34:10; Num 16:28-29; 2 Sam 23:2. As a characteristic fact, they
          speak in the name of God, prefacing their messages with a "Thus saith
          the LORD. "The mouth of the LORD hath spoken it." Deut 18:21-22; 1
          Kings21:19; Jer 9:12, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) The New Testament writers introduce their quotations from the Old
          Testament with such formulas as, "The Holy Ghost saith," Heb 3:7; "The
          Holy Ghost this signifying," Heb 9:8; "Saith God," Acts 2:17; 1 Cor
          9:9-10; "The Lord by the mouth of his servant David saith," Acts 4:25;
          "The Lord limiteth in David a certain day, saying," Heb 4:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) The inspiration of the Old Testament is expressly affirmed in the
          New Testament. Lk 1:70; Heb 1:1; 2 Tim 3:16; 1 Pet 1:10-12; 2 Pet
          1:21.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) Christ and his apostles constantly quote the Old Testament as
          infallible, as that which must be fulfilled. Mat 5:18; Jn 10:35; Lk
          24:44; Mat 2:15-23, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) Inspiration was promised to the apostles. Mat 10:19; Mat
          28:19-20; Lk 12:12; Jn 13:20; Jn 14:26; Jn 15:26-27; Jn 16:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6.) They claimed to have the Spirit, in fulfillment of the promise of
          Christ, Acts 2:33; Acts 15:28; 1 Thes 1:5; -- to speak as the prophets
          of God, 1 Cor 4:1; 1 Thes 4:8; -- to speak with plenary authority, 1
          Cor 2:13; 2 Cor 13:2-4; Gal 1:8-9. They put their writings on a level
          with the Old Testament Scriptures. 2 Pet 3:16; 1 Thes 5:27.
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION IV. The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to
          be believed, and obeyed, depends not upon the testimony of any man, or
          Church; but wholly upon God (who is truth itself) the author thereof:
          and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.[9]
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION V. We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church
          to an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scripture.[10] And the
          heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty
          of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole
          (which is, to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of
          the only way of man's salvation, the many other incomparable
          excellencies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby
          it does abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God: yet
          notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible
          truth and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the
          Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.[11]

          [9] 2 Pet 1:19, 2 Pet 1:21; 2 Tim 3:16; 1Jn 5:9; 1 Thes 2:13. [10] 1
          Tim 3:15; [11] 1 Jn 2:20, 1 Jn 2:27; Jn 16:13-14; 1 Cor 2:10-12; Isa
          59:21.
        </p>
        <p>This section teaches the following propositions: --</p>
        <p>
          1. That the authority of the inspired Scriptures does not rest upon
          the testimony of the Church, but directly upon God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This proposition is designed to deny the Romish heresy that the
          inspired Church is the ultimate source of all divine know ledge, and
          that the written Scripture and ecclesiastical tradition alike depend
          upon the authoritative seal of the Church for their credibility. They
          thus make the Scriptures a product of the Spirit through the Church;
          while, in fact, the Church is a product of the Spirit through the
          instrumentality of the Word. It is true that the testimony of the
          early Church to the apostolic authorship of the several books is of
          fundamental importance, just as a subject may bear witness to the
          identity of an heir to the crown; but the authority of the Scriptures
          is no more derived from the Church than that of the king from the
          subject who proves the fact that he is the legal heir.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That the internal evidences of a divine origin contained in and
          inseparable from the Scriptures themselves are conclusive.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a part of the evidences of Christianity considered under sect.
          i. The internal marks of a divine origin in the Bible are such as --
          (1.) The phenomena it presents of a supernatural intelligence: in
          unity of design developed through its entire structure, although it is
          composed of sixty-six separate books, by forty different authors,
          writing at intervals through sixteen centuries; in its perfect freedom
          from all the errors incident to the ages of its production, with
          regard to facts or opinions of whatever kind; in. the marvellous
          knowledge it exhibits of human nature under all possible relations and
          conditions; in the original and luminous solution it affords of many
          of the darkest problems of human history and destiny. (2.) The
          unparalleled perfection of its moral system: in the exalted view it
          gives of God, his law, and moral government; in its exalted yet
          practical and beneficent system of morality, set forth and effectively
          enforced; in its wondrous power over the human conscience; and in the
          unrivalled extent and persistence of its influence over communities of
          men.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Yet that the highest and most influential faith in the truth and
          authority of the Scriptures is the direct work of the Holy Spirit on
          our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scriptures to the unregenerate man are like light to the blind.
          They may be felt as the rays of the sun are felt by the blind, but
          they cannot be fully seen. The Holy Spirit opens the blinded eyes and
          gives due sensibility to the diseased heart; and thus assurance comes
          with the evidence of spiritual experience. When first regenerated, he
          begins to set the Scriptures to the test of experience; and the more
          he advances, the more he proves them true, and the more he discovers
          of their limitless breadth and fulness, and their evidently designed
          adaptation to all human wants under all possible conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION VI. The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary
          for His own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either
          expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence
          may be deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be
          added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of
          men.[12] Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination of the
          Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such
          things as are revealed in the Word:[13] and that there are some
          circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the
          Church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered
          by the light of nature, and Christian prudence, according to the
          general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.[14]
          Scripture
        </p>
        <p>Proof Texts</p>
        <p>
          [12] 2 Tim 3:15-17; Gal 1:8-9; 2 Thes 2:2 [13], Jn 6:45; 1 Cor 2:9-12;
          [14] 1 Cor 11:13-14; 1 Cor 14:26, 1 Cor 14:40.
        </p>
        <p>This section teaches the following propositions: --</p>
        <p>
          1. The inspired Scriptures of the Old. And New Testaments are a
          complete rule of faith and practice: they embrace the whole of
          whatever supernatural revelation God now makes to men, and are
          abundantly sufficient for all the practical necessities 'of men or
          communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is proved -- (1.) From the design of Scripture. It professes to
          lead us to God. Whatever is necessary to that end it must teach us. If
          any supplementary knowledge is necessary, it must refer to it.
          Incompleteness in such an undertaking would be falsehood. But (2.)
          while Christ and his apostles constantly refer to Scripture as an
          authoritative rule, neither they nor the Scriptures themselves ever
          refer to any other source of divine revelation whatsoever. They
          therefore assume all the awful prerogatives of completeness. Jn 20:31;
          2 Tim 3:15-17. And (3.), as a matter of fact, the Scriptures do teach
          a perfect system of doctrine, and all the principles which are
          necessary for the practical regulation of the lives of individuals,
          communities, and churches. The more diligent men have been in the
          study of the Bible, and the more assiduous they have been in carrying
          out its instructions into practice, the less has it been possible for
          them to believe that it is incomplete in any element of a perfect rule
          of all that which man is to believe concerning God, and of all that
          duty which God requires of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Nothing during the present dispensation is to be added to this
          complete rule of faith, either by new revelations of the Spirit or by
          traditions of men.
        </p>
        <p>No new revelations of the Spirit are to be expected now --</p>
        <p>
          (1.) Because he has already given us a complete and all-sufficient
          rule. (2.) because, while the Old. Testament foretells the new
          dispensation, the New Testament does not refer to any further
          revelation to be expected before the second advent of Christ: they
          always refer to the "coming" or "appearance" of Christ as the very
          next supernatural event to be anticipated. (3.) As a matter of fact,
          no pretended revelations of the Spirit since the days of the apostles
          have borne the marks or been accompanied with the "signs" of a
          supernatural revelation: on the contrary, all that have been made
          public -- as those of Swedenborg and the Mormons -- are inconsistent
          with Scripture truth, directly oppose the authority of Scripture, and
          teach bad morals; while private revelations have been professed only
          by vain enthusiasts, and are incapable of verification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditions of men cannot be allowed to supplement Scripture as a rule
          of faith, because -- (1.) The Scriptures, while undertaking to lead
          men to a saving knowledge of God, never once ascribe authority to any
          such a supplementary rule. (2.) Christ rebukes the practical
          observance of it in the Pharisees. Mat 15:3-6; Mk 7:7-8. (3.)
          Tradition cannot supplement Scripture, because, while the latter is
          definite, complete, and perspicuous, the former is essentially
          indeterminate, obscure, and fragmentary. (4.) The only system of
          ecclesiastical tradition which pretends to rival the Scriptures as a
          rule of faith is that of the Roman Church; and her traditions are,
          many of them, demonstrably of modern origin. None can be traced to the
          apostolic age, much less to an apostolic origin: they are inconsistent
          with the clear teaching of Scripture, and with the opinions of many of
          the highest authorities in that Church itself in past ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Nevertheless, a personal spiritual illumination by the power of the
          Holy Ghost is necessary, in every case, for the practical and saving
          knowledge of the truth embraced in the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          This necessity does not result from any want of either completeness or
          clearness in the revelation, but from the fact that man in a state of
          nature is carnal, and unable to discern the things of the Spirit of
          God. Spiritual illumination differs from inspiration, therefore, (1.)
          In that it conveys no new truths to the understanding, but simply
          opens the mind and heart of the subject to the spiritual discernment
          and appreciation of the truth already objectively presented in the
          Scriptures; and (2.) In that it is an element in regeneration common
          to all the children of God, and not peculiar to prophets or apostles;
          and hence, (3.) In that it is private and personal in its use, and not
          public.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. That, while the Scriptures are a complete rule of faith and
          practice, and while nothing is to be regarded as an article of faith
          to be believed, or a religious duty obligatory upon the conscience,
          which is not explicitly or implicitly taught in Scripture,
          nevertheless they do not descend in practical matters into details,
          but, laying down general principles, leave men to apply them in the
          exercise of their natural judgment, in the light of experience, and in
          adaptation to changing circumstances, as they are guided by the
          sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          This liberty, of course, is allowed only within the limits of the
          strict interpretation of the principles taught in the Word, and in the
          legitimate application of those principles, and applies to the
          regulation of the practical life of the individual and of the Church,
          in detailed adjustments to changing circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION VII. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in
          themselves, nor alike clear unto all:[15] yet those things which are
          necessary to be known, believed, and observed for salvation are so
          clearly propounded, and opened in some place of Scripture or other,
          that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the
          ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of
          them.[16]
        </p>
        <p>Scripture Proof Texts</p>
        <p>[15] 2 Pet 3:16; [16] Ps 119:105, Ps 119:130.</p>
        <p>This section affirms --</p>
        <p>
          1. That the Scriptures are in such a sense perspicuous that all that
          is necessary for man to know, in order to his salvation or for his
          practical guidance in duty, may be learned therefrom; and --
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That they are designed for the personal use, and are adapted to the
          instruction, of the unlearned as well as the learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protestants admit that many of the truths revealed in the Scriptures
          in their own nature transcend human understanding, and that many
          prophecies remain intentionally obscure until explained by their
          fulfillment in the developments of history. Nevertheless, Protestants
          affirm, and Romnnists deny -- (1.) That every essential article of
          faith and rule of practice may be clearly learned from Scripture; and
          (2.) That private and unlearned Christians may be safely allowed to
          interpret Scripture for themselves. On the other hand, it is true
          that, with the advance of historical and critical knowledge, and by
          means of controversies, the Church as a community has made progress in
          the accurate interpretation of Scripture and in the full comprehension
          of the entire system of truth revealed therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the Protestant doctrine on this subject is true, is proved --
        </p>
        <p>
          (a.) From the fact that all Christians promiscuously are commanded to
          search the Scriptures. 2 Tim 3:15-17; Acts 17:11; Jn 5:39.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b.) From the fact that the Scriptures are addressed either to all men
          or to the whole body of believers. Deut 6:4-9; Lk 1:3; Rom 1:7; 1 Cor
          1:2; 2 Cor 1:1; and the salutations of all the Epistles except those
          to Timothy and Titus.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c.) The Scriptures are affirmed to be perspicuous. Ps 119:105, Ps
          119:130; 2 Cor 3:14; 2 Pet 1:18-19; 2 Tim 3:15-17.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d.) The Scriptures address men as a divine law to be obeyed and as a
          guide to salvation. If for all practical purposes they are not
          perspicuous they must mislead, and so falsify their pretensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e.) Experience has uniformly proved the truth of the Protestant
          doctrine. Those Churches which have most faithfully disseminated the
          Scriptures in the vernacular among the mass of the people have
          conformed most entirely to the plain and certain sense of their
          teaching in faith and practice; while those Churches which have locked
          them up in the hands of a priesthood have to the greatest degree
          departed from them both in letter and spirit.

          SECTION VIII. The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native
          language of the people of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek
          (which, at the time of the writing of it, was most generally known to
          the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and, by His singular
          care and providence, kept pure in all ages, are therefore
          authentical;[17] so as, in all controversies of religion, the Church
          is finally to appeal unto them.[18] But, because these original
          tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto,
          and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God,
          to read and search them,[19] therefore they are to be translated in to
          the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come,[20] that,
          the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in
          an acceptable manner;[21] and, through patience and comfort of the
          Scriptures, may have hope.[22]
        </p>
        <p>Scripture Proof Texts</p>
        <p>
          [17] Mat 5:18; [18] Isa 8:20; Acts 15:15; [19] Jn 5:39, Jn 5:46; [20]
          1 Cor 14:6, 1 Cor 14:9, 1 Cor 14:11-12, 1 Cor 14:24, 1 Cor 14:27-28;
          [21] Col 3:16; [22] Rom 15:4.
        </p>
        <p>This section teaches,--</p>
        <p>
          1. That the Old Testament having been originally written in Hebrew,
          and the New Testament in Greek -- which were the common languages of
          the large body of the Church in their respective periods -- the
          Scriptures in those languages are the absolute rule of faith and
          ultimate appeal in all controversies.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That the original sacred text has come down to us in a state of
          essential purity.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. That the Scriptures should be translated into the vernacular
          languages of all people, and copies put into the hands of all capable
          of reading them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The true text of the ancient Scriptures is ascertained by means of a
          careful collation and comparison of the following: --
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Ancient manuscripts. The oldest existing Hebrew manuscripts date
          from the ninth or tenth century. The oldest Greek manuscripts date
          from the fourth to the sixth century. Many hundreds of these have been
          collated by eminent scholars in forming the text of modern Hebrew and
          Greek Testaments. The differences are found to be unimportant, and the
          essential integrity of our text is established.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Quotations from the apostolic Scriptures found in the writings of
          the early Christians. These are so numerous that the whole New
          Testament might be gathered from the worlds of writers dating before
          the seventh century, and they prove the exact state of the text at the
          time in which they were made.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Early translations into other languages. The principal of these are
          the Samaritan Pentateuch, which the Samaritans inherited from the ten
          tribes; the Greek Septuagint, B.C. 285; the Peshito or ancient Syriac
          version, A.D, 100; the Latin Vulgate of Jerome, A.D. 385; the Coptic
          of the fifth century, and others of less critical value.
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION IX. The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the
          Scripture itself: and therefore, when there is a question about the
          true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one),
          it must be searched and known by other places that speak more
          clearly.[23]
        </p>
        <p>
          SECTION X. The supreme judge by which all controversies of religion
          are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient
          writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined,
          and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy
          Spirit speaking in the Scripture.[24]
        </p>
        <p>Scripture Proof Texts</p>
        <p>
          [22] 2 Pet 1:20-21; Acts 15:15-16. [24] Mat 22:29, Mat 22:31; Eph 2:20
          with Acts 28:25.
        </p>
        <p>These sections teach,--</p>
        <p>
          1. That the infallible and only true "rule" for the interpretation of
          Scripture is Scripture itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. That the Scriptures are the supreme "judge" in all controversies
          concerning religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authority of the Scriptures as the ultimate rule of faith rests
          alone in the fact that they are the Word of God. Since all these
          writings are one revelation, and the only revelation of his will
          concerning religion given by God to men, it follows: --
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) That they are complete as a revelation in themselves, and are not
          to be supplemented or explained by light drawn from any other source.
          (2.) That the different sections of this revelation mutually
          supplement and explain one another. The Holy Spirit who inspired the
          Scriptures is the only adequate expounder of his own words, and he is
          promised to all the children of God as a Spirit of light and truth. In
          dependence upon his guidance, Christians are of course to study the
          Scriptures, using all the helps of true learning to ascertain their
          meaning; but this meaning is to be sought in the light of the
          Scriptures themselves taken as a whole, and not in the light either of
          tradition or of philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A rule is a standard of judgment; a judge is the expounder and
          applier of that rule to the decision of particular cases."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Romish doctrine is, that the Papal Church is the infallible
          teacher of men in religion; that, consequently, the Church
          authoritatively determines, (1.) What is Scripture; (2.) What is
          tradition; (3.) What is the true sense of Scripture and of tradition;
          and (4.) What is the true application of that rule to every particular
          question of faith or practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Protestant doctrine is,-- (1.) That the Scriptures are the only
          rule of faith and practice; (2.) (a) Negatively, that there is no body
          of men qualified or authorized to interpret the Scriptures or to apply
          their teachings to the decision of particular questions in a sense
          binding upon their fellow - Christians; (3) Positively, that the
          Scriptures are the only authoritative voice in the Church; which is to
          be interpreted and applied by every individual for himself, with the
          assistance, though not by the authority, of his fellow-Christians.
          Creeds and confessions, as to form, bind those only who voluntarily
          profess them; and as to matter, they bind only so far as they affirm
          truly what the Bible teaches, and because the Bible does so teach.
        </p>
        <p>
          This must be true -- (1.) Because the Scriptures, which profess to
          teach us the way of salvation, refer us to no standard or judge in
          matters of religion beyond or above themselves; and because no body of
          men since the apostles has ever existed, with the qualifications or
          with the authority to act in the office of judge for their fellows.
          (2.) Because, as we have seen, the Scriptures are themselves complete
          and perspicuous. (3.) Because all Christians are commanded to search
          the Scriptures, and to judge both doctrines and professed teachers
          themselves. Jn 5:39; 1 Jn 2:20, 1 Jn 2:27; 1 Jn 4:1-2; Acts 17:11; Gal
          1:8; 1 Thes 5:21. (4.) Because all Christians are promised the Holy
          Spirit to guide them in the understanding and practical use of the
          truth. Rom 8:9; 1 Jn 2:20, 1 Jn 2:27.
