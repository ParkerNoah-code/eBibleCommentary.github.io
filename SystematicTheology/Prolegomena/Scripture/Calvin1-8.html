          Chapter VIII. Rational Proofs To Establish The Belief Of The Scripture
        </h2>
        <p>This chapter consists of four parts.</p>
        <p>
          The first contains certain general proofs which may be easily gathered
          out of the writings both of the Old and New Testament, viz., the
          arrangement of the sacred volume, its dignity, truth, simplicity,
          efficacy, and majesty, see.1, 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second part contains special proofs taken from the Old Testament,
          viz., the antiquity of the books of Moses, their authority, his
          miracles and prophecies, see. 3-7; also, the predictions of the other
          prophets and their wondrous harmony, see.8. There is subjoined a
          refutation of two objections to the books of Moses and the Prophets,
          see. 9, 10.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third part exhibits proofs gathered out of the New Testament, e.
          g., the harmony of the Evangelists in their account of heavenly
          mysteries, the majesty of the writings of John, Peter, and Paul, the
          remarkable calling of the Apostles and conversion of Paul, see. 11.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last part exhibits the proofs drawn from ecclesiastical history,
          the perpetual consent of the Church in receiving and preserving divine
          truth, the invincible force of the truth in defending itself, the
          agreement of the godly,(though otherwise differing so much from one
          another,) the pious profession of the same doctrine by many
          illustrious men; in fine, the more than human constancy of the
          martyrs, see. 12, 13. This is followed by a conclusion of the
          particular topic discussed.

        <h2>
          (The unique majesty and impressiveness, and the high antiquity, of
          Scripture, 1-4)
        </h2>
        <h2>1. Scripture is superior to all human wisdom</h2>
        <p>
          In vain were the authority of Scripture fortified by argument, or
          supported by the consent of the Church, or confirmed by any other
          helps, if unaccompanied by an assurance higher and stronger than human
          judgement can give. Till this better foundation has been laid, the
          authority of Scripture remains in suspense. On the other hand, when
          recognising its exemption from the common rule, we receive it
          reverently, and according to its dignity, those proofs which were not
          so strong as to produce and rivet a full conviction in our minds,
          become most appropriate helps. For it is wonderful how much we are
          confirmed in our belief, when we more attentively consider how
          admirably the system of divine wisdom contained in it is arranged -
          how perfectly free the doctrine is from every thing that savours of
          earth - how beautifully it harmonises in all its parts - and how rich
          it is in all the other qualities which give an air of majesty to
          composition. Our hearts are still more firmly assured when we reflect
          that our admiration is elicited more by the dignity of the matter than
          by the graces of style. For it was not without an admirable
          arrangement of Providence, that the sublime mysteries of the kingdom
          of heaven have for the greater part been delivered with a contemptible
          meanness of words. Had they been adorned with a more splendid
          eloquence, the wicked might have cavilled, and alleged that this
          constituted all their force. But now, when an unpolished simplicity,
          almost bordering on rudeness, makes a deeper impression than the
          loftiest flights of oratory, what does it indicate if not that the
          Holy Scriptures are too mighty in the power of truth to need the
          rhetorician's art? Hence there was good ground for the Apostle's
          declaration, that the faith of the Corinthians was founded not on "the
          wisdom of men," but on "the power of God," (1 Cor. 2: 5,) this speech
          and preaching among them having been "not with enticing words of man's
          wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power," (1 Cor. 2:
          5.) For the truth is vindicated in opposition to every doubt, when,
          unsupported by foreign aid, it has its sole sufficiency in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          How peculiarly this property belongs to Scripture appears from this,
          that no human writings, however skilfully composed, are at all capable
          of affecting us in a similar way. Read Demosthenes or Cicero, read
          Plato, Aristotle, or any other of that class: you will, I admit, feel
          wonderfully allured, pleased, moved, enchanted; but turn from them to
          the reading of the Sacred Volume, and whether you will or not, it will
          so affect you, so pierce your heart, so work its way into your very
          marrow, that, in comparison of the impression so produced, that of
          orators and philosophers will almost disappear; making it manifest
          that in the Sacred Volume there is a truth divine, a something which
          makes it immeasurably superior to all the gifts and graces attainable
          by man.
        </p>

        <h2>2.Not style but content is decisive</h2>
        <p>
          I confess, however, that in elegance and beauty, nay, splendour, the
          style of some of the prophets is not surpassed by the eloquence of
          heathen writers. By examples of this description, the Holy Spirit was
          pleased to show that it was not from want of eloquence he in other
          instances used a rude and homely style. But whether you read David,
          Isaiah, and others of the same class, whose discourse flows sweet and
          pleasant; or Amos the herdsman, Jeremiah, and Zechariah, whose rougher
          idiom savours of rusticity; that majesty of the Spirit to which I
          adverted appears conspicuous in all. I am not unaware, that as Satan
          often apes God, that he may by a fallacious resemblance the better
          insinuate himself into the minds of the simple, so he craftily
          disseminated the impious errors with which he deceived miserable men
          in an uncouth and semi-barbarous style, and frequently employed
          obsolete forms of expression in order to cloak his impostures. None
          possessed of any moderate share of sense need be told how vain and
          vile such affectation is. But in regard to the Holy Scriptures,
          however petulant men may attempt to carp at them, they are replete
          with sentiments which it is clear that man never could have conceived.
          Let each of the prophets be examined, and not one will be found who
          does not rise far higher than human reach. Those who feel their works
          insipid must be absolutely devoid of taste.
        </p>

        <h2>3. The great antiquity of Scripture</h2>
        <p>
          As this subject has been treated at large by others, it will be
          sufficient here merely to touch on its leading points. In addition to
          the qualities already mentioned, great weight is due to the antiquity
          of Scripture, (Euseb. Prepar. Evang. lib. 2 c. 1.) Whatever fables
          Greek writers may retail concerning the Egyptian Theology, no monument
          of any religion exists which is not long posterior to the age of
          Moses. But Moses does not introduce a new Deity. He only sets forth
          that doctrine concerning the eternal God which the Israelites had
          received by tradition from their fathers, by whom it had been
          transmitted, as it were, from hand to hand, during a long series of
          ages. For what else does he do than lead them back to the covenant
          which had been made with Abraham? Had he referred to matters of which
          they had never heard, he never could have succeeded; but their
          deliverance from the bondage in which they were held must have been a
          fact of familiar and universal notoriety, the very mention of which
          must have immediately aroused the attention of all. It is, moreover,
          probable, that they were intimately acquainted with the whole period
          of four hundred years (Gen.15:13; Ex.12:40; Gal.3:17). Now, if Moses
          (who is so much earlier than all other writers) traces the tradition
          of his doctrine from so remote a period, it is obvious how far the
          Holy Scriptures must in point of antiquity surpass all other writings.
        </p>

        <h2>4. The truthfulness of Scripture shown by Moses' example</h2>
        <p>
          Some perhaps may choose to credit the Egyptians in carrying back their
          antiquity to a period of six thousand years before the world was
          created. But their garrulity, which even some profane authors have
          held up to derision, it cannot be necessary for me to refute.
          Josephus, however, in his work against Appion, produces important
          passages from very ancient writers, implying that the doctrine
          delivered in the law was celebrated among all nations from the
          remotest ages, though it was neither read nor accurately known.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, in order that the malignant might have no ground for
          suspicion, and the ungodly no handle for cavil, God has provided, in
          the most effectual manner, against both dangers. When Moses relates
          the words which Jacob, under Divine inspiration, uttered concerning
          his posterity almost three hundred years before, how does he ennoble
          his own tribe? He stigmatises it with eternal infamy in the person of
          Levi. "Simon and Levi," says he, "are brethren; instruments of cruelty
          are in their habitations. O my soul, come not thou into their secret;
          unto their assembly mine honour be not thou united,"(Gen. 49: 5, 6.)
          This stigma he certainly might have passed in silence, not only that
          he might spare his own ancestor, but also save both himself and his
          whole family from a portion of the disgrace. How can any suspicion
          attach to him, who, by voluntarily proclaiming that the first founder
          of his family was declared detestable by a Divine oracle, neither
          consults for his own private interest, nor declines to incur obloquy
          among his tribe, who must have been offended by his statement of the
          fact? Again, when he relates the wicked murmuring of his brother
          Aaron, and his sister Miriam, (Numb. 12: 1,) shall we say that he
          spoke his own natural feelings, or that he obeyed the command of the
          Holy Spirit? Moreover, when invested with supreme authority, why does
          he not bestow the office of High Priest on his sons, instead of
          consigning them to the lowest place? I only touch on a few points out
          of many; but the Law itself contains throughout numerous proofs, which
          fully vindicate the credibility of Moses, and place it beyond dispute,
          that he was in truth a messenger sent forth from God.
        </p>

        <h2>
          (Refutation of objections regarding miracles and prophecy, 5-10)
        </h2>
        <h2>5. Miracles strengthen the authority of God's messengers</h2>
        <p>
          The many striking miracles which Moses relates are so many sanctions
          of the law delivered, and the doctrine propounded, by him. His being
          carried up into the mount in a cloud; his remaining there forty days
          separated from human society; his countenance glistening during the
          promulgation of the law, as with meridian effulgence; the lightnings
          which flashed on every side; the voices and thunderings which echoed
          in the air; the clang of the trumpet blown by no human mouth; his
          entrance into the tabernacle, while a cloud hid him from the view of
          the people; the miraculous vindication of his authority, by the
          fearful destruction of Korah, Nathan, and Abiram, and all their
          impious faction; the stream instantly gushing forth from the rock when
          struck with his rod; the manna which rained from heaven at his prayer;
          - did not God by all these proclaim aloud that he was an undoubted
          prophet? If any one object that I am taking debatable points for
          granted, the cavil is easily answered. Moses published all these
          things in the assembly of the people. How, then, could he possibly
          impose on the very eye-witnesses of what was done? Is it conceivable
          that he would have come forward, and, while accusing the people of
          unbelief, obstinacy, ingratitude, and other crimes, have boasted that
          his doctrine had been confirmed in their own presence by miracles
          which they never saw?
        </p>

        <h2>6. Moses' miracles are incontestable</h2>
        <p>
          For it is also worthy of remark, that the miracles which he relates
          are combined with disagreeable circumstances, which must have provoked
          opposition from the whole body of the people, if there had been the
          smallest ground for it. Hence it is obvious that they were induced to
          assent, merely because they had been previously convinced by their own
          experience. But because the fact was too clear to leave it free for
          heathen writers to deny that Moses did perform miracles, the father of
          lies suggested a calumny, and ascribed them to magic, (Exod. 9: 11.)
          But with what probability is a charge of magic brought against him,
          who held it in such abhorrence, that he ordered every one who should
          consult soothsayers and magicians to be stoned? (Lev. 30: 6.)
          Assuredly, no impostor deals in tricks, without studying to raise his
          reputation by amazing the common people. But what does Moses do? By
          crying out, that he and Aaron his brother are nothing, (Exod. 16: 7,)
          that they merely execute what God has commanded, he clears himself
          from every approach to suspicion. Again, if the facts are considered
          in themselves, what kind of incantation could cause manna to rain from
          heaven every day, and in sufficient quantity to maintain a people,
          while any one, who gathered more than the appointed measure, saw his
          incredibility that God then suffered his servant to be subjected to so
          many serious trials, that the ungodly cannot now gain anything by
          their glamour. When (as often happened) the people proudly and
          petulantly rose up against him, when individuals conspired, and
          attempted to overthrow him, how could any impostures have enabled him
          to elude their rage? The event plainly shows that by these means his
          doctrine was attested to all succeeding ages.
        </p>

        <h2>
          7. Prophecies that are fulfilled contrary to all human expectation
        </h2>
        <p>
          Moreover, it is impossible to deny that he was guided by a prophetic
          spirit in assigning the first place to the tribe of Judah in the
          person of Jacob, especially if we take into view the fact itself, as
          explained by the event. Suppose that Moses was the inventor of the
          prophecy, still, after he committed it to writing, four hundred years
          pass away, during which no mention is made of a sceptre in the tribe
          of Judah. After Saul is anointed, the kingly office seems fixed in the
          tribe of Benjamin, (1 Sam. 11: 15; 16:13.) When David is anointed by
          Samuel, what apparent ground is there for the transference? Who could
          have looked for a king out of the plebeian family of a herdsman? And
          out of seven brothers, who could have thought that the honour was
          destined for the youngest? And then by what means did he afterwards
          come within reach of the throne? Who dare say that his anointing was
          regulated by human art, or skill, or prudence, and was not rather the
          fulfilment of a divine prophecy? In like manner, do not the
          predictions, though obscure, of the admission of the Gentiles into the
          divine covenant, seeing they were not fulfilled till almost two
          thousand years after, make it palpable that Moses spoke under divine
          inspiration? I omit other predictions which so plainly betoken divine
          revelation, that all men of sound mind must see they were spoken by
          God. In short, his Song itself (Deut. 32) is a bright mirror in which
          God is manifestly seen.
        </p>

        <h2>8. God has confirmed the prophetic words</h2>
        <p>
          In the case of the other prophets the evidence is even clearer. I will
          only select a few examples, for it were too tedious to enumerate the
          whole. Isaiah, in his own day, when the kingdom of Judah was at peace,
          and had even some ground to confide in the protection of the
          Chaldeans, spoke of the destruction of the city and the captivity of
          the people, (Isaiah 39:6-7.) Supposing it not to be sufficient
          evidence of divine inspiration to foretell, many years before, events
          which, at the time, seemed fabulous, but which ultimately turned out
          to be true, whence shall it be said that the prophecies which he
          uttered concerning their return proceeded, if it was not from God? He
          names Cyrus (Isaiah 45:1), by whom the Chaldeans were to be subdued
          and the people restored to freedom. After the prophet thus spoke, more
          than a hundred years elapsed before Cyrus was born, that being nearly
          the period which elapsed between the death of the one and the birth of
          the other. It was impossible at that time to guess that some Cyrus
          would arise to make war on the Babylonians, and after subduing their
          powerful monarchy, put an end to the captivity of the children of
          Israel. Does not this simple, unadorned narrative plainly demonstrate
          that what Isaiah spoke was not the conjecture of man, but the
          undoubted oracle of God? Again, when Jeremiah, a considerable time
          before the people were led away, assigned seventy years as the period
          of captivity, and fixed their liberation and return (Jer.25:11-12),
          must not his tongue have been guided by the Spirit of God? What
          effrontery were it to deny that, by these evidences, the authority of
          the prophets is established, the very thing being fulfilled to which
          they appeal in support of their credibility! "Behold, the former
          things are come to pass, and new things do I declare; before they
          spring forth I tell you of them," (Isaiah 42:9.) I say nothing of the
          agreement between Jeremiah and Ezekiel, who, living so far apart, and
          yet prophesying at the same time, harmonise as completely in all they
          say as if they had mutually dictated the words to one another. What
          shall I say of Daniel? Did not he deliver prophecies embracing a
          future period of almost six hundred years, as if he had been writing
          of past events generally known? (Dan. 9, &c.) If the pious will duly
          meditate on these things, they will be sufficiently instructed to
          silence the cavils of the ungodly. The demonstration is too clear to
          be gains aid.

        <h2>9. The transmission of the law is to be trusted</h2>
        <p>
          I am aware of what is muttered in corners by certain miscreants, when
          they would display their acuteness in assailing divine truth. They
          ask, how do we know that Moses and the prophets wrote the books which
          now bear their names? Nay, they even dare to question whether there
          ever was a Moses. Were any one to question whether there ever was a
          Plato, or an Aristotle, or a Cicero, would not the rod or the whip be
          deemed the fit chastisement of such folly? The law of Moses has been
          wonderfully preserved, more by divine providence than by human care;
          and though, owing to the negligence of the priests, it lay for a short
          time buried, - from the time when it was found by good King Josiah, (2
          Kings 22: 8; 2Chron. 34: 15,) - it has continued in the hands of men,
          and been transmitted in unbroken succession from generation to
          generation. Nor, indeed, when Josiah brought it forth, was it as a
          book unknown or new, but one which had always been matter of
          notoriety, and was then in full remembrance. The original writing had
          been deposited in the temple, and a copy taken from it had been
          deposited in the royal archives, (Deut. 17: 18, 19;) the only thing
          which had occurred was, that the priests had ceased to publish the law
          itself in due form, and the people also had neglected the wonted
          reading of it. I may add, that scarcely an age passed during which its
          authority was not confirmed and renewed. Were the books of Moses
          unknown to those who had the Psalms of David in their hands? To sum up
          the whole in one word, it is certain beyond dispute, that these
          writings passed down, if I may so express it, from hand to hand, being
          transmitted in an unbroken series from the fathers, who either with
          their own ears heard them spoken, or learned them from those who had,
          while the remembrance of them was fresh.
        </p>

        <h2>10. God has marvelously preserved the Law and the Prophets</h2>
        <p>
          An objection taken from the history of the Maccabees (1 Maccab. 1: 57,
          58) to impugn the credibility of Scripture, is, on the contrary,
          fitted the best possible to confirm it. First, however, let us clear
          away the gloss which is put upon it: having done so, we shall turn the
          engine which they erect against us upon themselves. As Antiochus
          ordered all the books of Scripture to be burnt, it is asked, where did
          the copies we now have come from? I, in my turn, ask, in what workshop
          could they have been so quickly fabricated? It is certain that they
          were in existence the moment the persecution ceased, and that they
          were acknowledged without dispute by all the pious who had been
          educated in their doctrine, and were familiarly acquainted with them.
          Nay, while all the wicked so wantonly insulted the Jews as if they had
          leagued together for the purpose, not one ever dared to charge them
          with having introduced spurious books. Whatever, in their opinion, the
          Jewish religion might be, they acknowledged that Moses was the founder
          of it. What,then, do those babblers, but betray their snarling
          petulance in falsely alleging the spuriousness of books whose sacred
          antiquity is proved by the consent of all history? But not to spend
          labour in vain in refuting these vile calumnies, let us rather attend
          to the care which the Lord took to preserve his Word, when against all
          hope he rescued it from the truculence of a most cruel tyrant as from
          the midst of the flames - inspiring pious priests and others with such
          constancy that they hesitated not, though it should have been
          purchased at the expense of their lives, to transmit this treasure to
          posterity, and defeating the keenest search of prefects and their
          satellites. Who does not recognise it as a signal and miraculous work
          of God, that those sacred monuments which the ungodly persuaded
          themselves had utterly perished, immediately returned to resume their
          former rights, and, indeed, in greater honour? For the Greek
          translation appeared to disseminate them over the whole world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor does it seem so wonderful that God rescued the tables of his
          covenant from the sanguinary edicts of Antiochus, as that they
          remained safe and entire amid the manifold disasters by which the
          Jewish nation was occasionally crushed, devastated, and almost
          exterminated. The Hebrew language was in no estimation, and almost
          unknown; and assuredly, had not God provided for religion, it must
          have utterly perished. For it is obvious from the prophetical writings
          of that age, how much the Jews, after their return from the captivity,
          had lost the genuine use of their native tongue. It is of importance
          to attend to this, because the comparison more clearly establishes the
          antiquity of the Law and the Prophets. And whom did God employ to
          preserve the doctrine of salvation contained in the Law and the
          Prophets, that Christ might manifest it in its own time? The Jews, the
          bitterest enemies of Christ; and hence Augustine justly calls them the
          librarians of the Christian Church, because they supplied us with
          books of which they themselves had not the use.

        <h2>
          (Simplicity and heavenly character and authority of the New Testament,
          11)
        </h2>
        <h2>11. Special proofs from the New Testament.</h2>
        <p>
          When we proceed to the New Testament, how solid are the pillars by
          which its truth is supported! Three evangelists give a narrative in a
          mean and humble style. The proud often eye this simplicity with
          disdain, because they attend not to the principal heads of doctrine;
          for from these they might easily infer that these evangelists treat of
          heavenly mysteries beyond the capacity of man. Those who have the
          least particle of candour must be ashamed of their fastidiousness when
          they read the first chapter of Luke. Even our Saviour's discourses, of
          which a summary is given by these three evangelists, ought to prevent
          every one from treating their writings with contempt. John, again,
          fulminating in majesty, strikes down more powerfully than any
          thunderbolt the petulance of those who refuse to submit to the
          obedience of faith. Let all those acute censors, whose highest
          pleasure it is to banish a reverential regard of Scripture from their
          own and other men's hearts, come forward; let them read the Gospel of
          John, and, willing or unwilling, they will find a thousand sentences
          which will at least arouse them from their sloth; nay, which will burn
          into their consciences as with a hot iron, and check their derision.
          The same thing may be said of Peter and Paul, whose writings, though
          the greater part read them blindfold, exhibit a heavenly majesty,
          which in a manner binds and rivets every reader. But one circumstance,
          sufficient of itself to exalt their doctrine above the world, is, that
          Matthew, who was formerly fixed down to his money-table, Peter and
          John, who were employed with their little boats, being all rude and
          illiterate, had never learned in any human school that which they
          delivered to others. Paul, moreover, who had not only been an avowed
          but a cruel and bloody foe, being changed into a new man, shows, by
          the sudden and unhoped-for change, that a heavenly power had compelled
          him to preach the doctrine which once he destroyed. Let those dogs
          deny that the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles, or, if not, let
          them refuse credit to the history, still the very circumstances
          proclaim that the Holy Spirit must have been the teacher of those who,
          formerly contemptible among the people, all of a sudden began to
          discourse so magnificently of heavenly mysteries.
        </p>

        <h2>(Consent of the church, and fidelity of the martyrs, 12-13)</h2>
        <h2>12. Unvarying testimony of the church to the Scripture</h2>
        <p>
          Add, moreover, that, for the best of reasons, the consent of the
          Church is not without its weight. For it is not to be accounted of no
          consequence, that, from the first publication of Scripture, so many
          ages have uniformly concurred in yielding obedience to it, and that,
          not withstanding of the many extraordinary attempts which Satan and
          the whole world have made to oppress and overthrow it, or completely
          efface it from the memory of men, it has flourished like the palm tree
          and continued invincible. Though in old times there was scarcely a
          sophist or orator of any note who did not exert his powers against it,
          their efforts proved unavailing. The powers of the earth armed
          themselves for its destruction, but all their attempts vanished into
          smoke. When thus powerfully assailed on every side, how could it have
          resisted if it had trusted only to human aid? Nay, its divine origin
          is more completely established by the fact, that when all human wishes
          were against it, it advanced by its own energy. Add that it was not a
          single city or a single nation that concurred in receiving and
          embracing it. Its authority was recognised as far and as wide as the
          world extends - various nations who had nothing else in common
          entering for this purpose into a holy league. Moreover, while we ought
          to attach the greatest weight to the agreement of minds so
          diversified, and in all other things so much at variance with each
          other - an agreement which a Divine Providence alone could have
          produced - it adds no small weight to the whole when we attend to the
          piety of those who thus agree; not of all of them indeed, but of those
          in whom as lights God was pleased that his Church should shine.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Martyrs died firmly for Scripture doctrine</h2>
        <p>
          Again, with what confidence does it become us to subscribe to a
          doctrine attested and confirmed by the blood of so many saints? They,
          when once they had embraced it, hesitated not boldly and intrepidly,
          and even with great alacrity, to meet death in its defence. Being
          transmitted to us with such an earnest, who of us shall not receive it
          with firm and unshaken conviction? It is therefore no small proof of
          the authority of Scripture, that it was sealed with the blood of so
          many witnesses, especially when it is considered that in bearing
          testimony to the faith, they met death not with fanatical enthusiasm,
          (as erring spirits are sometimes wont to do,) but with a firm and
          constant, yet sober godly zeal. There are other reasons, neither few
          nor feeble, by which the dignity and majesty of the Scriptures may be
          not only proved to the pious, but also completely vindicated against
          the cavils of slanderers. These, however, cannot of themselves produce
          a firm faith in Scripture until our heavenly Father manifest his
          presence in it, and thereby secure implicit reverence for it. Then
          only, therefore, does Scripture suffice to give a saving knowledge of
          God when its certainty is founded on the inward persuasion of the Holy
          Spirit. Still the human testimonies which go to confirm it will not be
          without effect, if they are used in subordination to that chief and
          highest proof, as secondary helps to our weakness. But it is foolish
          to attempt to prove to infidels that the Scripture is the Word of God.
          This it cannot be known to be, except by faith. Justly,therefore, does
          Augustine remind us, that every man who would have any understanding
          in such high matters must previously possess piety and mental peace.
